# 1.背景介绍


Virtual Reality (VR) has been one of the hottest topics in recent years due to its potential applications in various fields such as gaming, entertainment, education and research. The rapid development of VR technology brings us closer to creating a whole new experience for human beings. However, it also creates some challenges for developers who want to develop more immersive virtual environments that are actually capable of real-world interactions with users or other objects. 

Inspired by this scenario, we have developed a novel approach called AI Mass which combines deep learning models and computer graphics techniques to create high-fidelity virtual reality scenes that can interact physically with the real world while immersed in the virtual environment. By integrating different components including visual understanding, object recognition, motion capture, rendering, interaction design and haptics, the mass model can generate a high degree of realism and richness. Moreover, we use a flexible hardware platform based on NVIDIA Jetson Nano embedded GPU to achieve high performance and low latency processing, enabling faster virtual scene updates. Finally, we provide an end-to-end solution through cloud computing infrastructure to enable widespread usage and integration across multiple platforms and devices. In conclusion, our goal is to develop a scalable and efficient framework that enables VR application developers to create immersive virtual environments with highly accurate and interactive physical interactions.

# 2.核心概念与联系
We define the key concepts and principles of our AI Mass framework as follows:

1. Virtual World: A virtual world refers to an artificial environment created using computer graphics techniques. It consists of virtual objects, surfaces, and characters that mimic aspects of the real world, but they can exist separately from each other and move independently within the space. 

2. Physical Object: Anything that can be touched by humans can be considered as a physical object. This includes furniture, appliances, vehicles, etc., both static and moving. These objects can affect the user's movement, positioning, and viewpoint, leading to a sense of presence and interactivity.

3. Computer Graphics Techniques: We use a range of computer graphics techniques to render the virtual worlds. These include procedural generation, shape modeling, lighting, shadows, texture mapping, and animation. Procedural generation involves generating complex shapes and textures at runtime based on input parameters like size, complexity, color, material properties, etc. Shape modeling involves building a database of pre-defined shapes that can be used as building blocks for constructing larger structures. Lighting helps simulating the natural lighting conditions in the virtual world, shadows add depth cues to enhance spatial awareness, and texture mapping adds realistic materials to the virtual objects. Animation helps to create movement, rotations and dynamism effects in the virtual objects and environments.

4. Deep Learning Model: A deep learning model is a machine learning algorithm that learns by example from labeled data and provides insights into patterns and trends in data sets. There are several types of deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). CNN is particularly suited for image classification tasks and RNN is well-suited for sequence analysis and prediction tasks. LSTM models are popular for handling sequential data like language modeling, speech recognition, time-series forecasting, etc. For our project, we will focus on implementing and optimizing our own custom deep learning models.

5. Interaction Design: Human-computer interactions (HCI) refer to the ways people interact with computers and software products. Our aim is to create an interface between the virtual environment and the user, so that he/she feels comfortable exploring and interacting with the virtual objects. We employ a variety of methods including voice commands, gesture control, hand tracking, eye gaze tracking, touchscreen inputs, and virtual buttons. Each method allows users to interact with the virtual objects in their way of choice.

6. Haptics: Haptics refers to vibration motors that can produce tactile sensations when activated. They play a crucial role in making virtual experiences feel real, engaging, and immersive. To simulate these effects, we use actuators and sensors that are part of the VR headset. The outputs of these actuators can then drive sound synthesis algorithms in the audio engine of the virtual environment, providing realistic haptic feedback to the user.

Our framework relies on combining multiple techniques to create a fully functional virtual reality system. Visual understanding, object recognition, motion capture, rendering, interaction design, and haptics are all critical components of the system, and together make up the AI Mass architecture. Using these components, we create a hybrid multi-agent system that represents the user's actions as physical interactions and passes them down to the virtual environment to update its state accordingly.

The overall structure of our framework is shown below:
