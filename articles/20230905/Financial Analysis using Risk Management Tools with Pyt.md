# 1.简介
  

Risk management is a critical function of any organization. It involves assessing the risk that may arise from various scenarios and managing them to ensure business continuity. To accomplish this task efficiently, organizations use tools such as risk analysis software or risk-based decision making frameworks. In recent years, several open source programming languages have emerged to support financial risk management tasks in an automated manner, namely Python.

This article will demonstrate how to use Python's scientific computing libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciKit Learn and Statsmodels to perform fundamental and technical analyses on stock prices and other financial data for trading strategies development and investment portfolio optimization. We'll also cover some popular risk management techniques like Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES) and Credit Analytics.

In summary, we'll learn:

 - What is risk management?
 - How can Python be used for financial risk management?
 - Which risk management techniques are commonly used?
 - How to analyze historical stock prices and generate market signals?
 - How to construct a financial strategy based on market signals and optimize its performance through backtesting?
