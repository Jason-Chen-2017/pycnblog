Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), also known as Elman networks or Hopfield networks, are a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for processing sequential data such as time series and natural language. The name "recurrent" comes from the way in which these models process sequences: they have loops or cycles that allow information to persist between iterations. In this article, we will introduce you to RNNs and how they can be used effectively for sequence analysis tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, speech recognition, and image captioning. We will cover the basic concepts behind RNNs, such as the structure of memory cells, hidden states, forward and backward propagation, and backpropagation through time. Finally, we will demonstrate some applications of RNNs using Python code examples. 

Before starting our journey with RNNs, let's first understand what exactly do we mean by "sequence". A sequence is simply an ordered collection of elements or items, where each element has its own position within the overall order. For instance, consider the following sentence: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”. This sentence consists of 9 words in total, and each word is assigned a unique number (starting at one) based on its relative position within the sentence. Therefore, this sentence is considered to be a sequence of 9 integers.

Now let's see how RNNs work step-by-step. Let's assume we have a very simple example scenario where there is only one input feature (e.g., temperature) and one output variable (e.g., whether it’s going to rain or not). Our task here would be to build a model that takes in the current temperature and predicts if it’ll be raining tomorrow or not. Here is how RNNs could potentially solve this problem:

1. Firstly, we start by initializing the weights and biases of the model randomly. These parameters will determine how sensitive the model is to changes in the inputs and outputs during training. 

2. Next, we pass the initial input through the model to get the predicted output. Based on the predicted output, we make a decision to either continue running the model or stop depending on our confidence level. 

3. Now, we take into account all the previous inputs and their corresponding outputs along with the new input to generate a new output prediction. This step involves passing the input through multiple layers of neurons in the network, where each layer learns to identify patterns in both past and present inputs and incorporate them into future predictions.

4. Once we reach the end of the sequence, we update the weights and biases of the model based on the difference between the actual output and the predicted output to improve its accuracy over time.

In summary, RNNs consist of layers of neurons that learn to recognize patterns in sequences by maintaining a persistent internal state called a hidden state. Each iteration of the model processes the next element in the sequence, while keeping track of the previous ones. By doing so, RNNs are capable of handling long sequences without vanishing gradients or exploding values due to the multiplication of large matrices throughout the network. Additionally, RNNs enable efficient computation because they avoid repeating computations unnecessarily and rely on dynamic programming techniques instead. Overall, RNNs offer many advantages for sequence analysis tasks like sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and machine translation.

## 2.1 Sequence
A sequence is simply an ordered collection of elements or items, where each element has its own position within the overall order. For instance, consider the following sentence: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”. This sentence consists of 9 words in total, and each word is assigned a unique number (starting at one) based on its relative position within the sentence. Therefore, this sentence is considered to be a sequence of 9 integers.

## 2.2 Input Features and Output Variables
Input features represent the independent variables that we use to predict the output variable. They include things like weather conditions, stock prices, and other factors that affect the outcome of the experiment.

Output variables represent the dependent variable that we want to predict given certain input features. They usually represent a categorical or continuous variable that depends on the input features.

For example, suppose we're building a model for predicting car accidents based on various attributes such as age, gender, income, location, etc. One possible input feature could be age, another might be gender, and so on. Another possible output variable could be a binary value representing whether an accident occurred or not.

We typically split up our dataset into two parts - training set and test set. The training set is used to train our model, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of our model after it is trained. During training, the model updates itself to minimize the error rate between the predicted output and the true output using gradient descent optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam.
