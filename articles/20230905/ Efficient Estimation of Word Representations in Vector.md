Word embeddings are a popular way to represent text as vectors in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition. Traditionally, word embeddings have been learned from large datasets using neural networks. However, this approach has limited scalability and requires extensive computational resources for training large models on high-resource languages like English or Chinese. In this paper, we propose two efficient estimation methods that can be used to learn word embeddings more efficiently: (a) Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), which is an effective method for learning word representations in shallow NLP architectures; and (b) Skip-Gram, which represents each word as the sum of its neighboring words in a deeper NLP architecture. We demonstrate these approaches on several benchmark tasks, including analogy detection, clustering, and semantic similarity, achieving state-of-the-art results compared with other embedding learning techniques.

In addition, our experiments show that by combining CBOW and Skip-Gram together, we can achieve significant improvements over individual methods while still requiring significantly fewer resources than traditional deep models.

We hope that this work will inspire further research into efficient and accurate vector representation learning for natural language processing applications, especially those dealing with resource-scarce languages like Chinese.
2.背景介绍
Word Embeddings(WEs) are one of the most popular ways to represent texts in Natural Language Processing (NLP). They were originally proposed to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms applied to language modeling, but they also play important roles in many applications such as information retrieval, question answering, document classification and topic modeling. The goal of WE is to transform each token (word, phrase or character) in a corpus into a dense vector space where similar tokens are closer together in vector space. This means that related words should be represented by close points in the vector space, whereas unrelated words should be far away. Thus, given a sentence, the task of identifying the most appropriate matching word can be simplified to finding the nearest neighbor in the vector space. The final step is usually performed using cosine distance between the target word's vector and all other candidate words' vectors. 

However, creating such dense vector spaces from large amounts of unstructured data, especially in low-resource languages such as Chinese, is challenging because traditional machine learning techniques often require tremendous amount of labeled data, expensive hardware and computationally intensive preprocessing steps. To address this problem, various optimization techniques have been developed to train very small WE models on limited resources. These include continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and skip-gram model variants, negative sampling, subsampling, and noise contrastive estimation. Despite their effectiveness, they still require significant amount of time and memory for training, making them impractical for handling large corpora in real-world scenarios.

To solve the problem of limited training resources, we propose two new efficient estimation methods based on CBOW and Skip-Gram models respectively. Both of these methods combine techniques from both directional context models and shallow neural network models. Using these combined models, we are able to quickly estimate word embeddings from large unlabelled corpora without relying on any complex pretraining stage or external resources. Moreover, we show how these models can be trained jointly with deep neural networks by iteratively updating weights during training process. Finally, we evaluate our methods on multiple NLP tasks and compare them against existing state-of-the-art baselines and domain-specific models. Our experimental results show that by combining CBOW and Skip-Gram together, we can obtain better accuracy and efficiency than single models while keeping the same level of performance.

This work provides insights into the limitations of current methods for learning WE and presents novel solutions that provide fast and accurate estimates of word embeddings. By combining techniques from both directional context models and shallow neural network models, we can obtain competitive results at much lower cost than traditional deep models while still obtaining good quality embeddings. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of optimizing training resources when it comes to building robust and reliable systems for natural language processing tasks.
