Frequent itemset mining is a technique for discovering frequent sets of items or patterns in large databases that may contain noisy or incomplete transactions. It has various applications such as market basket analysis, fraud detection, recommendation systems etc. In this paper we will discuss several popular techniques for generating frequent itemsets from transaction data and analyze their theoretical properties. Finally, we will empirically evaluate these techniques by applying them to real-world datasets.

## Basic Concepts and Terminology
### Transaction Database
A transaction database consists of records that describe activities performed over a period of time by different entities or individuals. Each record contains one or more attributes that describe the activity being recorded. These attributes can be categorical or numerical values. A typical transaction database could have fields like customer ID, product name, date, amount spent, etc., where each record represents an individual purchase made by the customer. An example record in the transaction database might look something like this:

|Customer ID|Product Name|Date|Amount Spent|
|---|---|---|---|
|C1|Pencil|2020-09-01|7|

In general, transaction databases are very complex due to the variety of possible activities that can occur within an organization. Furthermore, there often exists uncertainty about how well any given entity or individual actually performs during a particular transaction. This makes it challenging to identify meaningful information from transactional data. 

### Support Count
The support count of an itemset X is defined as the number of transactions that include at least one instance of all items in the itemset. For example, if an itemset X = {Bread} appears in only one transaction but {Milk, Bread} appears in five distinct transactions, then its support count is three. Similarly, if an itemset X does not appear in any transaction, then its support count is zero.

### Frequent Itemset (FI)
A set of items with high frequency in a dataset is called a frequent itemset. Items whose frequencies exceed some minimum threshold are considered to be frequent. One way to determine the minimum frequency threshold is through calculating the relative support value, which indicates the percentage of transactions in which the itemset appears. Alternatively, one can use other statistical methods such as the chi-squared test or the Gini impurity index to calculate the threshold.

Suppose you want to find all the frequent itemsets in a transactional database with a minimum support of 3%. Here are two approaches you can take:

1. **Candidate generation**: Generate candidate itemsets that may potentially be frequent using algorithms such as Apriori, Eclat, FP-growth, or PrefixSpan. Candidate itemsets must satisfy the mininum support requirement before they are added to a list of frequent itemsets. 

2. **Sequential search**: Use sequential searches to generate the frequent itemsets. Start with a single item and iterate through increasing order of size until all potential frequent itemsets are found. Check whether each generated itemset satisfies the minimum support condition and add it to a list of frequent itemsets if necessary. Repeat this process until no additional frequent itemsets can be found.

Both approaches produce similar results, but the efficiency of candidate generation depends on the algorithm used. Sequential search is much faster than candidate generation when dealing with larger datasets because it avoids examining many unpromising candidates early on in the process. However, both approaches require careful consideration of the minimum support parameter to avoid false positives.

## Statistical Properties of Frequent Itemsets
There are several statistical properties that characterize frequent itemsets:

* **Support:** Support refers to the proportion of transactions in which the itemset appears. We typically define a minimum support threshold to filter out infrequent itemsets. If the support count of an itemset falls below the threshold, it becomes less likely to be truly frequent.

* **Confidence:** Confidence measures the likelihood that a random subset of the transactions containing the itemset also contains another randomly chosen item that belongs to the same frequent set. Mathematically, confidence is calculated as follows:

    $$confidence(X\subset Y)=\frac{\text{support}(XY)\cdot \text{size}(Y)}{\sum_{z\supseteq Y} \text{support}(XZ)}$$
    
    Where $\text{support}(XY)$ is the support count of $X$ and $\text{size}(Y)$ is the number of elements in $Y$.
    
* **Lift:** Lift measures the increase in expected revenue or profit that can be obtained by including an item belonging to a frequent set compared to adding an unrelated item to the same set. Mathematically, lift is calculated as follows:

   $$lift(X\subset Y)=\frac{\text{support}(XY)}{\text{support}(X)}\cdot \frac{\text{support}(X)-1}{(\text{support}(X)+1)-\text{support}(XY)}$$
   
   Note that lift cannot be computed for singleton frequent itemsets.
   
These properties provide insight into why certain itemsets are more probable than others. For example, consider the following scenario:

> Imagine a retail store that sells laptops. Your task is to develop targeted marketing campaigns to encourage customers to buy new laptops. You hypothesize that laptop models that tend to go together are more likely to result in higher sales. To test this hypothesis, you collect transaction data on purchases of laptop models from a sample of users.

Assuming you have collected enough data, you would now need to find frequent itemsets that commonly co-occur. This can help you select appropriate laptop models based on their frequency in your customer base. However, if there were too few occurrences of combinations of laptop models, this approach would lead to suboptimal targeting. Therefore, it's essential to carefully examine the performance of your selected itemsets against relevant metrics such as revenue per purchase or customer satisfaction score.
