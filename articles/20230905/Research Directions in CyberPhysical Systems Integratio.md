# 1.简介
  

In cyber-physical systems (CPS), intelligent machines and robotic agents are embedded with various sensors to capture the environmental information such as visual, audio, and physical signals. These devices work together for complex tasks in safety critical applications including industrial automation, healthcare, agriculture, transportation, etc. However, due to interconnected nature of these systems, there is increasing complexity that requires integrating different technologies and techniques, from soft real-time computing to efficient resource allocation strategies. 

The objective of this research direction is to develop advanced algorithms, frameworks, tools, and methods that can effectively integrate heterogeneous CPS components with different operational and communication requirements. In particular, we aim to provide robust solutions in achieving better performance, scalability, reliability, fault tolerance, and efficiency while minimizing costs and maximizing benefits. To achieve this goal, we need an effective approach towards developing new algorithms, software architectures, models, and optimization techniques, which can be integrated into existing platforms or used independently. This article will discuss about several research directions, including:

1) Heterogeneous architecture design approaches: We consider designing hardware/software architectures specifically tailored for handling dynamic changes in sensor data rate, communication bandwidth, computational resources, etc., and incorporate necessary optimizations at each layer to ensure system level performance. 

2) Resource allocation techniques: We study how to distribute computation, memory, and communication resources among heterogeneous components in order to maximize their overall performance. Key challenges include identifying bottlenecks and determining appropriate scheduling policies across multiple domains.

3) Adaptive control techniques: We explore adaptive control mechanisms that can optimize individual component’s performance based on its own state and input feedback received by other components. The key challenge here is to select suitable controller models and formulate adaptivity criteria that can anticipate and act on changes in the external world.

4) Fault detection and diagnosis: We focus on developing accurate and reliable fault detection and diagnosis techniques for detecting and mitigating errors, failures, and uncertainties occurring within heterogeneous CPS components. Techniques such as model predictive control (MPC), machine learning, probabilistic inference, signal processing, and hybrid techniques combining various statistical analysis and computer vision algorithms will be explored.

5) Optimization models: We investigate how to build mathematical models that describe the behavior of heterogeneous CPS components over time, making use of both qualitative and quantitative knowledge. Models may help identify optimal configurations, parameters, and operating conditions for maximizing overall system performance. Additionally, we also explore novel ways to learn more about underlying dynamics of the system and improve our ability to make predictions and take actions.

To summarize, this research direction aims to develop advanced algorithms, software architectures, models, and optimization techniques that can effectively integrate heterogeneous CPS components under varying conditions, providing robust solutions in terms of performance, scalability, reliability, fault tolerance, and efficiency. We believe that this endeavor will lead to significant advances in building practical and cost-effective solutions for addressing emerging problems in CPS integration. 

# 2.相关术语、概念及定义
Before going further, it is important to define some related terminologies and concepts. Here they are:

1. Component: A fundamental unit of CPS system consisting of one or more physical or virtual elements that communicates with other components via channels. Each component performs a specific task, provides service(s), receives inputs, processes them, produces outputs, and sends messages or commands to other components. Examples of components are sensor nodes, actuators, processors, controllers, displays, speakers, etc. 

2. Communication channel: A pathway through which two or more components communicate with each other. There are three types of communication channels - data channels, command channels, and message channels. Data channels carry numerical or digital values, whereas command channels carry instructions for controlling components, while message channels carry textual or symbolic messages. 

3. Domain: An area within the CPS system where certain functions or activities are performed. For example, sensor nodes could belong to the "perception" domain, actuators belong to the "actuation" domain, etc. Different domains require different operating principles and constraints, making them challenging to handle independently. 

4. Resource allocation policy: A method for allocating available resources among components so that every component has a fair share without compromising on any of its functionalities. The decision-making process involves defining resource utilization thresholds, prioritizing tasks according to their importance and availability, selecting a set of schedulable tasks, assigning resources optimally based on the chosen tasks, monitoring the allocation status periodically, and adjusting if needed. 

5. Control strategy: A procedure for manipulating the output of a component based on inputs received from other components. There are many control strategies that involve using mathematical equations to map states and inputs to outputs. Common examples of control strategies include proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control, model predictive control (MPC), reinforcement learning (RL), and fuzzy control. 

6. Fault detection and diagnosis: A technique for identifying and analyzing errors, failures, and uncertainties within components. It involves performing automated tests, collecting data, and evaluating trends to detect abnormal behaviors. Some common fault detection and diagnosis techniques include isolation testing, randomized response testing, neural networks, anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and clustering. 

7. Model: A representation of the physical system that captures essential features and relationships between components and variables. Models aid in understanding the behavior of the system and predict future outcomes. Several popular modeling paradigms exist, ranging from deterministic to stochastic to hybrid. 

Some additional definitions:

1. Real-time computing: Computing under strict timing constraints to meet deadlines or perform mission critical tasks in real-time.

2. Scalability: The capability of a system to cope up with increased load or workload without degrading its performance.

3. Robustness: Ability of a system to recover from failure or adverse events and continue functioning efficiently after recovery.

4. Efficiency: A measure of system's ability to accomplish given tasks without wasting energy or resources unnecessarily.

5. Cost effectiveness: A metric indicating the relative value of a system compared to alternatives in terms of economics, human resources, and maintenance.
