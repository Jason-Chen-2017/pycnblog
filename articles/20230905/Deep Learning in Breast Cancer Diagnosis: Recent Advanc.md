Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide. It accounts for one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women in developed countries, responsible for approximately 9% of new cancer cases each year in Europe alone [1]. As breast cancer progresses, it spreads throughout the body, invades surrounding tissues, and leads to many diseases such as ovarian cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer, and breast fibroids. Therefore, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer are crucial steps towards successful clinical management of this disease. Despite its importance, there has been a paucity of studies on using deep learning techniques to diagnose or classify patients with breast cancer. In recent years, advanced machine learning models have shown significant improvements in the ability of identifying malignant tumors from histopathology images [2-4], improving grading performance of solid tumors [5] and detecting atypical cells in digital pathology images [6]. To date, few attempts have been made to leverage these advances and apply them to classification of breast cancer. Thus, we need to fill this gap by developing an accurate and robust breast cancer classifier that uses both spatial and textual features. Herein, we will provide an overview of the current state of research and development on breast cancer classification using deep learning techniques. We also discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field.

## 2.1 分类器的类型
Breast cancer can be classified into two types based on the size of the mass (small or large) and histological patterns observed in the specimens used for testing: small cell and large cell carcinomas [7]. The following table summarizes some commonly used classifiers for breast cancer diagnosis:

| Classifier Type | Description  | Reference   |
|---|---|---|
| Texture analysis  | Analysis of textures associated with various regions of the breast using algorithms like texture analysis, texture synthesis [8]. This approach relies heavily on domain expertise and may not be feasible for real-time applications.| [8]|
| Histochemical markers  | Use of different histochemical markers like Estrogen receptor positive breast (ER+) and estrogen receptor negative breast (ER-) stained lymphocytes to identify abnormal cells in biopsies [9]. However, the accuracy of this method depends heavily on the quality and consistency of the microscope settings, which vary between labs.| [9]|
| Radiomics feature extraction  | Extraction of radiomic features from medical imaging data including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound for quantitative analysis of breast tissue characteristics, including morphology, hematoxylin and eosin staining patterns, size and shape [10]. These features have been shown to predict survival better than other traditional methods for breast cancer diagnosis.| [10]|
| Deep learning-based approaches  | Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are popular deep learning models for image recognition tasks. They extract highly discriminative features from raw pixel values of the input images and learn complex non-linear relationships within and across domains. Several works have proposed novel CNN architectures for breast cancer classification using medical imaging data [11-13], radiology reports [14], genomic information [15-17], etc. | [11-17]|

## 2.2 使用机器学习的特征选择
In recent years, several works have proposed automatic feature selection strategies for breast cancer classification using deep learning. These methods involve selecting relevant features automatically from the original dataset and removing irrelevant ones before feeding them to the classification algorithm. There are several ways to perform feature selection in breast cancer classification:

1. Filter-based selection - Select only those features that correlate well with the target variable. This approach often results in very sparse feature vectors due to the high dimensionality of breast cancer datasets.

2. Wrapper-based selection - Use sequential feature selection algorithms like recursive feature elimination (RFE) or random forest feature importances to select important features iteratively.

3. Embedded-based selection - Use feature selection algorithms embedded in the deep learning architecture itself, either through regularization mechanisms or attention mechanism modules.

## 2.3 深度学习技术在诊断分类中的应用
There are three main areas where deep learning techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness in breast cancer classification:

1. Spatially invariant representation learning - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved impressive performance in image classification tasks for object recognition. While they do not directly model the underlying geometry of biological tissues, they use convolutional filters to capture contextual dependencies between pixels and hence effectively formulate a spatial invariant representation of the input data. For example, they have successfully utilized handcrafted visual features like edges and corners to achieve competitive accuracies in large scale image classification tasks like ImageNet [18]. Similarly, CNNs could potentially serve as a powerful tool in breast cancer classification since they could exploit spatially variant features such as local tumor distributions, calcifications, duct density, and internal structures. 

2. Multi-modal fusion - Many works have demonstrated the potential of multi-modal integration in breast cancer classification. For instance, Lung Nodule Segmentation Challenge (LNSCC) 2018 has used multi-view CT scans alongside MRI scans to improve overall performance compared to single view modalities. Similarly, multimodal fusing techniques could help to integrate both spatial and textural information extracted from medical imaging and pathological reports to identify more precise cancerous regions.

3. Context-aware modeling - LSTM networks have shown promise in capturing temporal dependencies and representing long range dependencies while processing medical images. These networks have also been applied in breast cancer classification by incorporating sequential patient information into the model training process and using residual connections to preserve informative representations learned from previous timesteps. Additionally, attention mechanisms have been explored to focus on specific parts of the image during inference phase for improved localization capability.

Overall, the existing literature shows that deep learning techniques can significantly improve the accuracy of breast cancer classification with the right feature engineering and network design choices. With advancements in hardware technology and computational power, these tools can eventually enable real-world clinical practice. However, there remain numerous challenges yet to overcome before applying these technologies for clinical implementation. We hope this article provides a good starting point for further research efforts in this area.
