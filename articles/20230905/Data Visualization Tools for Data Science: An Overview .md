# 1.简介
  

Data visualization tools are important for data scientists as they provide a way to communicate and present complex data in an easy-to-understand manner. There are many types of data visualization tools available today including static plots (such as line charts, scatterplots, bar graphs), interactive web applications (dashboards) and animated graphics. In this article we will be comparing five different data visualization tools for data science: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, ggplot, and Bokeh. We will briefly introduce each tool, discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrate some use cases for which each tool can be useful. Additionally, we will summarize some common pitfalls when using these tools and give suggestions on how to avoid them while working with large datasets. Finally, we will conclude by discussing how data visualization tools fit into the overall process of building a data science project and selecting the best tool(s) based on specific requirements and needs.

# 2.Data Visualization Tool Categories
## Static Plots
Static plots include basic visualizations such as line charts, histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, etc., that do not require interaction or interactivity with the user. They can be easily generated using programming languages like Python, R, MATLAB, etc. These plots typically have clear labels and axes, but lack dynamic interactivity. 


## Interactive Web Applications
Interactive web applications allow users to explore data through various views and interactions. They enable exploration of large datasets by filtering, grouping, aggregating, and highlighting data points. Examples of interactive web applications include Tableau, Shiny apps, D3.js, and Plotly's dashboards. The core principle behind interactive web application design is to separate presentation from analysis and manipulation so that users can focus on what they want to see without getting bogged down in details.  


## Animated Graphics
Animated graphics combine both motion and animation elements to create engaging and informative visuals that capture attention. Popular examples of animated graphics include GIF animations created using Photoshop or Illustrator software, and JavaScript libraries like d3.js and three.js. Animated graphics offer more complex visual representations and help make complex concepts easier to understand. However, creating and animating high quality animated graphics requires specialized skills and knowledge.


## Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) also known as interactive shells aim to simplify the use of complex software tools by providing graphical buttons, dropdown menus, sliders, etc. GUIs enable users to quickly navigate and interact with complex software systems without having to learn how to code. Some popular examples of GUIs include Matlab's desktop interface, SAS' Studio interface, and IBM Watson Workbench. While GUIs provide great flexibility and ease of use, it may limit the ability to customize individual components and build fully customized solutions. Additionally, GUIs are often difficult to integrate into larger projects because they may conflict with other parts of the system.

## Reports
Reports provide summaries, statistical analyses, and insights about the dataset that can be used to drive decision making. Report generation tools such as JMP or Power BI generate rich HTML reports that contain embedded visualizations, formulas, tables, and textual explanations. However, report generation can be time-consuming and expensive depending on the size of the dataset.

Overall, there are multiple categories of data visualization tools for data science, ranging from simple static plots to sophisticated interactive web applications with a focus on advanced features such as graph manipulation and customizability. Each category has its own advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the right tool for your particular problem can significantly impact the results you obtain.
