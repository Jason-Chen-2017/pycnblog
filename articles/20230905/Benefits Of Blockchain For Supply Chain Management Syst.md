Supply chain management (SCM) systems are critical to ensuring the efficiency and quality of supply chains, as they coordinate actions between suppliers, distributors, retailers, manufacturers, and end-users. However, SCM is often faced with a range of complex issues such as transportation problems, unreliable suppliers or demand changes, and high costs due to fluctuating inventory levels. To address these challenges, blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution in recent years that can help automate many aspects of SCM systems by providing immutability, tamperproofness, trustworthiness, transparency, scalability, and privacy guarantees for all data involved. This article provides an overview on the benefits of using blockchains for SCM systems including:

1. Immutability - Each transaction on the ledger is traceable back to its source, making it impossible to modify without the consent of both parties involved.
2. Transparency - All transactions on the ledger are visible to everyone, giving consumers the ability to monitor and audit operations at any point in time.
3. Trustworthiness - Transactions are verified by multiple nodes on the network ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the data.
4. Scalability - The system can handle large volumes of data while maintaining constant performance regardless of the size of the organization.
5. Privacy Guarantees - Data on the blockchain is encrypted and stored securely, preventing anyone from accessing sensitive information unless authorized to do so.
In addition, this article highlights key features of various popular blockchain technologies that could be used in SCM systems and how they contribute towards achieving the above-mentioned benefits. Specifically, we will focus on Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. 

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
Before diving into the details of blockchain application in SCM systems, let’s first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to blockchain technology. 

1. Cryptographic Hash Function
A cryptographic hash function takes input data of arbitrary length and produces fixed-size output called a digest or message digest. It is a one-way mathematical function that cannot be reversed meaning that once you generate the hash value, there is no way to derive the original input data from it. The main purpose of cryptographic hashing functions is to produce unique digital fingerprints of data that can be compared to identify duplicates or detect errors quickly. In the case of blockchain applications, the most commonly used algorithm is SHA-256 which uses 256 bits to represent the hash value. A sample implementation of SHA-256 in Python would look like this:

```python
import hashlib

data = "Hello World"

hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data.encode())
hex_dig = hash_object.hexdigest()

print("Input Data:", data)
print("Hash Value:", hex_dig)
```

2. Blockchain Network
Blockchain networks consist of several distributed nodes that communicate through P2P protocols such as TCP/IP or HTTP. They use decentralized consensus algorithms to ensure that each node agrees on the order of transactions and maintain their individual copies of the ledger. There are different types of blockchains such as permissionless, private, consortium, etc., depending on the access control mechanism required. 

3. Consensus Mechanism
The consensus mechanism refers to the process where multiple nodes agree on the same set of transactions and update their respective ledgers in a consistent manner. There are different types of consensus mechanisms such as PoW (Proof of Work), PoS (Proof of Stake), PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance), DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake), etc., based on various requirements such as security, throughput, latency, scalability, and fairness. 

# 3. Hyperledger Fabric Overview
Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain framework created by Linux Foundation consisting of two components – a smart contract platform and a permissioned blockchain network. The fabric framework is designed to support enterprise-level collaboration among organizations with distinct business roles, policies, and procedures. It provides a modular architecture that enables pluggable implementations of different modules such as consensus, membership services, and identity management. Additionally, fabric supports multiple programming languages and frameworks such as GoLang, Nodejs, Java, etc. Moreover, it offers advanced features such as asset management, private data, and confidential computations that can be leveraged to build more robust and secure solutions.

Let's discuss the key features of hyperledger fabric specifically related to SCM systems. 

## Smart Contract Platform
Fabric provides a powerful and flexible smart contract platform that allows developers to create contracts that can be enforced across the entire network. These contracts include transaction-oriented contracts, asset management contracts, and lifecycle contracts. Developers can use these contracts to define custom rules and logic around who can perform certain actions on the network, what assets they own, when a particular transaction type should occur, and other relevant regulatory and compliance requirements. 

Smart contracts also provide a level of abstraction over the underlying blockchain infrastructure, allowing developers to write code once and run it everywhere on the network. This simplifies development by removing the need for experts to understand how to deploy and manage the underlying infrastructure.  

## Membership Services
Membership services provide a secure means for organizations to establish trusted relationships with each other within the network. Participants must authenticate themselves to join the network before participating in the execution of transactions, and identities are validated using public key infrastructure (PKI). This ensures that only legitimate participants can interact with the network and enforce the contractual agreements on behalf of others. 

Fabric includes built-in membership services that allow organizations to easily register new users and define their roles and permissions. Organizations can further customize the membership service capabilities by adding additional attributes such as certifications, licenses, and endorsements to enable fine-grained access control.

## Asset Management
Asset management is another key feature provided by hyperledger fabric that makes it well suited for SCM scenarios. Assets typically refer to anything tangible that needs to be tracked digitally throughout their life cycle, whether physical objects like products or intellectual property rights or financial instruments like securities or loans. 

Assets can be represented digitally using records in the blockchain that contain metadata about them, including ownership, custodianship, and transfer history. This provides a complete accounting of every asset ever owned and transferred on the network. With asset tracking, organizations can track and query historical events related to specific assets to gain insights into past behavior, trends, and predict future outcomes.

## Private Data
Private data refers to data that is not shared with other organizations on the network but requires special handling to maintain confidentiality. This may involve encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, and policies that restrict access to authorized individuals or entities. 

Hyperledger fabric provides a built-in capability for storing and sharing private data within a permissioned network. Applications can designate a subset of peers to hold sensitive data, and those peers can apply additional access control policies to protect the data against unauthorized access.

Confidential computation is yet another important feature offered by hyperledger fabric that can be leveraged to build more complex smart contracts that require processing of sensitive data. Confidential computing is a technique that utilizes specialized hardware devices to obscure the results of computations, thus fulfilling the requirement for privacy while still enabling meaningful analysis. Hyperledger fabric provides a framework for developing and deploying confidential computations that leverage existing cloud platforms, allowing organizations to share sensitive data securely while processing it locally.

# 4. Etherum Overview
Ethereum is a public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform originally developed by Dr. <NAME> in 2013 and released under the MIT license in October 2015. It is known for its low-cost and high-throughput characteristics, making it ideal for cryptocurrency transactions, decentralized finance, gaming, IoT, and other real-world applications requiring fast, cheap, and secure transactions. Although it was launched in 2015, its popularity has been steadily increasing since then, particularly in the context of decentralized finance and NFT markets. 

Etherum provides a wide range of tools and features that make it suitable for implementing decentralized applications for various use cases, including smart contracts, NFT marketplaces, DAOs, and other decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Let's now discuss the key features of ethereum specifically related to SCM systems. 

1. Smart Contracts
Ethereum relies heavily on smart contracts for executing automated processes. Smart contracts are programs written in a high-level language that govern the interactions between different accounts on the network, making them similar to traditional financial contracts. Developers can write smart contracts in Solidity, a relatively simple language, and deploy them to the blockchain to execute arbitrary automated transactions according to predefined conditions. Unlike centralized banking institutions, smart contracts can be programmed to automatically execute trades whenever a pre-defined condition is met, reducing risk and improving efficiency.

2. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Decentralized Finance refers to financial applications that involve managing autonomously managed digital assets rather than relying on central intermediaries. Examples of DeFi applications include lending protocols like Aave and Yield Protocol, borrowing protocols like Compound and Mooniswap, and liquidity providers like MakerDAO and Unit.finance.

With a growing interest in DeFi, businesses and individuals have begun exploring alternative ways to invest and trade digital assets outside of banks, leading to significant growth in the space. Companies like ABN Amro Bank have already invested billions of dollars in DeFi projects, ranging from NFT trading and yield farming to synthetic asset trading and hedging. 

3. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital items that are unique and non-interchangeable. In contrast to traditional financial instruments such as stocks and bonds, NFTs can be valued differently because they are not necessarily backed by legal fiat money like cash. As such, NFTs have become a popular choice for creative works, collectibles, games, artwork, and entertainment industry. Since NFTs offer the potential for unlimited economic value creation, companies like OpenSea and Rarible have already explored the possibility of minting and selling millions of digital items directly on the blockchain. 

By combining NFTs with DeFi, people and organizations have come up with interesting use cases that go beyond traditional finance. Some examples include NFT auctions, fractionalizing ownership shares in DeFi projects, and generating yields via NFT rewards markets. These ideas demonstrate the possibilities of decentralized finance and NFTs and raise exciting research questions for future exploration.
