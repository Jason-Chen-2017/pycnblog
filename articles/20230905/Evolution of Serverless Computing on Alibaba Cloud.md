Serverless computing refers to the cloud computing model that enables developers to focus more on application development rather than managing servers and infrastructure resources, which is a significant advantage for businesses today who are facing rapidly evolving business demands. 

Alibaba Cloud has been leading in serverless computing for several years and recently entered the market with a lot of advantages over its rivals such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). However, there are still many challenges ahead regarding scalability, cost efficiency, security, and other aspects that must be addressed before it becomes an industry standard solution. Therefore, this article aims at exploring the evolution of serverless computing in Alibaba Cloud and identifying the critical issues that need to be solved to ensure its long-term success.

## 2.1 Serverless computing model
Serverless computing refers to a cloud computing model where the cloud provider automatically manages the execution environment for applications, eliminating the need for users or developers to manage their own systems. It uses event-driven programming models like functions as a service (FaaS) or microservices architecture to enable small modules of code to run without worrying about underlying system dependencies. The key feature of serverless computing is the ability to scale up and down based on needs and usage patterns, paying only for what they use when the function runs.

The basic units of serverless computing are functions, which are individual pieces of code that can execute on-demand from the cloud provider's platform. Functions can also interact with each other using triggers and events, allowing them to be chained together into workflows and applications. Additionally, functions can access various services provided by the cloud provider such as object storage, databases, and messaging middleware, making them highly flexible and extensible. Overall, serverless computing offers a low-cost and elastic approach to building cloud-native applications.

## 2.2 ECS instance
Elastic Compute Service (ECS) is one of the core components of Alibaba Cloud's Elastic Compute Service (EC2) suite, providing virtual machines (VMs) running in the cloud. VMs have unique hardware specifications and software configurations that define the maximum amount of RAM, CPU cores, disk space, bandwidth, etc., that they can provide. By default, new EC2 instances are created using ECS optimized images, which pre-configure different types of operating systems and runtime environments specifically designed for high performance computing workloads. Users can customize these instances according to their specific requirements through launch templates and custom AMIs.

In terms of scaling, ECS provides two options: vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling involves changing the specification of the existing VM while keeping the same number of vCPUs, memory, and disks, effectively increasing/decreasing the available compute power but not adding/removing any additional resources such as network interfaces or disks. Horizontal scaling allows users to add or remove additional instances to increase or decrease the capacity of the VM cluster, resulting in greater flexibility and fault tolerance compared to vertical scaling. This flexibility comes at a higher cost as VMs incur extra costs due to increased processing, memory, and I/O operations. 

## 2.3 Function Compute
Function Compute is another essential component of Alibaba Cloud's serverless computing platform, enabling users to easily deploy and invoke serverless functions across regions globally. A function is simply a piece of executable code that performs a specific task, such as performing data processing, machine learning inference, or file transcoding. Unlike traditional web apps, which typically involve complex backend architectures comprising multiple tiers of servers and networking, functions tend to be much simpler and stateless. They usually take input parameters and return output results in a few seconds, regardless of the size or complexity of the data being processed. 

Functions are deployed and executed within a Function Compute namespace, which consists of functions, triggers, and Aliyun resources such as Log Service logs, OSS buckets, RDS databases, and Table Store tables. When a user deploys a function, they specify the type of trigger(s) that will initiate the function invocation, such as HTTP requests or object uploads to a specified bucket. Each time a trigger fires, Function Compute invokes the corresponding function and passes the associated event data as inputs.

Therefore, Function Compute acts as the glue between serverless functions and all other Alibaba Cloud services such as OSS, log analytics, and RDS. These services enable developers to build robust, scalable, and secure applications quickly and easily, especially considering the vast array of built-in capabilities offered by Alibaba Cloud's numerous products.

## 2.4 EventBridge
EventBridge is yet another important component of Alibaba Cloud's serverless computing platform, providing a centralized hub for sending, routing, and transforming events coming from various sources throughout the enterprise. With EventBridge, users can create rules that match incoming events and route them to specified targets, including Lambda functions, SQS queues, or Step Functions workflows. Events can be filtered, transformed, augmented, aggregated, and enriched before being delivered to target endpoints. In addition to filtering and routing, EventBridge supports various integrations with popular tools such as Kafka and RabbitMQ, enabling users to connect external systems to their serverless functions seamlessly.

## 2.5 Fargate
When deploying containerized workloads in Function Compute, users have the option of using either an ECS instance or a task definition. An ECS instance allows users to specify the operating system, instance type, VPC configuration, and other properties of the desired virtual machine hosting the container. However, creating and maintaining an entire VM cluster requires significant operational overhead and maintenance costs, making it challenging to run multiple containers simultaneously or even replicate them across multiple availability zones. To address these limitations, Alibaba Cloud introduced Fargate, a serverless container management service that provides lightweight, server-free containers that can scale up and down based on resource utilization and billing metrics. 

Instead of provisioning dedicated hosts or clusters of VMs, Fargate dynamically allocates the necessary resources needed to run tasks based on the workload and budget constraints imposed by the users. Fargate eliminates the need for administrators to provision and maintain container clusters, reducing overall operational costs. Furthermore, Fargate supports both Docker and containerd runtimes, ensuring compatibility with most containerized workloads used in the cloud.

## 2.6 Container Registry
To efficiently distribute and version-control containers, Alibaba Cloud offers the Container Registry service, which serves as a private repository for storing and distributing container images across multiple regions. Developers can push their built image layers to the registry for distribution and sharing, and then pull them into their own account for deployment. The registry provides role-based access control to help limit access to authorized users and organizations.

As we know, serverless computing relies heavily on auto-scaling mechanisms to ensure the highest levels of elasticity, but it also brings along some drawbacks. One of the main problems faced by developers is the lack of visibility and monitoring of their serverless functions, making troubleshooting and debugging difficult. Also, once a function has been invoked, there may be no way to stop it except deleting it, making it difficult to prevent unintended consequences and waste resources if abuse occurs. To address these concerns, Alibaba Cloud offers several solutions including Function Compute's logging and monitoring features, the Log Service product, and the Tracing Analysis service. Let’s explore how these technologies work in detail.
