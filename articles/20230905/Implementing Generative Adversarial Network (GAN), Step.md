Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a type of generative model that can generate new data instances in the same distribution as the training dataset with good quality and diversity. In this article, we will implement GAN step by step using Python programming language. We will also discuss its advantages and disadvantages compared to other types of generative models like Variational Autoencoder or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Finally, we will compare GANs with other types of generative models on several benchmarks and illustrate their usage scenarios in real-world applications. This article assumes readers have basic knowledge about deep learning algorithms such as neural networks, probability distributions, optimization techniques, and linear algebra concepts. It may also benefit from some experience implementing machine learning models using popular libraries like Keras or TensorFlow. 

In summary, we will:

1. Introduce the concept of GAN and explain how it works.
2. Define key terms and concepts related to GAN.
3. Learn about different approaches for generating images with GANs and select one suitable approach based on our requirements.
4. Discuss the math behind GAN architecture and implement each component separately.
5. Train and evaluate GAN models on different datasets and compare performance metrics.
6. Evaluate GANs with respect to strengths and weaknesses in comparison with other types of generative models.
7. Demonstrate practical examples where GANs are used for image generation and provide suggestions for further research.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Introduction
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning architectures that are designed to learn complex data distributions and synthesize new instances of them at test time. The two main components of GANs are a generator function and a discriminator function. The generator generates synthetic samples while the discriminator learns to classify between generated and real data points. During training, the generator tries to fool the discriminator into misclassifying the fake samples as real ones while the discriminator must correctly identify both the true and fake samples during the training process. By minimizing the competition between these two functions, the generator learns to produce outputs that appear natural to human beings and capture relevant features of the input space. GANs were first introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014 and achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks including image synthesis, text-to-image translation, and generating faces and animals.

In this article, we will explore the basics of GANs and cover following topics:

1. Definition of GAN.
2. Types of GANs.
3. Structure of GAN.
4. Loss Functions Used in GANs.
5. Applications of GANs.

### Definition of GAN
A generative adversarial network is an artificial neural network composed of two sub-networks: a generator and a discriminator. These sub-networks play a two-player game with each other, i.e., the generator aims to create plausible output samples while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between actual and generated samples. At each iteration of training, the objective of the discriminator is to maximize the likelihood of assigning the correct label to both real and generated samples, while the objective of the generator is to minimize the cross entropy loss assigned by the discriminator to fake samples. As a result, the generator learns to fool the discriminator, resulting in improved sample quality.

The goal of the discriminator is to estimate the probability of being a real example or a fake example. The generator takes random noise vector inputs and produces output samples that look like they came from the underlying data distribution. To accomplish this task, the generator uses a deconvolutional neural network that converts low dimensional latent codes back into high resolution images that resemble the original data distribution.

To train the GAN model, the discriminator and generator need to be trained simultaneously through alternating updates. First, the discriminator is updated using only the true examples provided by the dataset. Then, the generator is updated using the gradients obtained from the discriminator’s error on fake examples produced by the current version of the generator.

### Types of GANs
There are three broad categories of GANs based on the structure of their generator and discriminator functions. They are Vanilla GAN, Wasserstein GAN, and Cycle Consistency GAN. Let us briefly describe them:

1. Vanilla GAN: The vanilla GAN consists of simple generator and discriminator functions without any modifications. Both functions use ReLU activation units except for the last layer which has a sigmoid activation unit. The generator uses normal distribution random vectors as input while the discriminator receives both real and fake samples concatenated together along with corresponding labels. The losses used are binary crossentropy and mean squared error respectively.

2. Wasserstein GAN: In the Wasserstein GAN, both the generator and discriminator seek to minimize the Earth Mover’s Distance between their respective distributions over all possible pairs of samples. Thus, instead of using traditional measures like gradient penalty and Lipschitz constraint to enforce smoothness, the WGAN uses the Wasserstein distance instead. The Wasserstein distance encourages the discriminator to match the optimal critic value given samples drawn from their respective distributions and the generator seeks to minimize this distance so that it can better control the variance of the generated samples. A drawback of WGAN is that the generator becomes unstable when dealing with mode collapse. 

3. Cycle Consistency GAN: In Cycle Consistency GAN, there exists an additional constraint that ensures that the fake images generated by the generator should be able to reconstruct the input images within a certain range. This is done by introducing an identity mapping loss term that forces the generator to map the input images back to themselves while training. Additionally, another loss function called Contextual Loss is added to encourage the generator to focus on important features present in the input domain. Cyclic consistency makes the generator more diverse because it considers multiple views of the same object or scene and not just isolated examples.

### Structure of GAN
We now understand the definition of GAN and its different variants. Now let's move on to understanding the overall structure of GAN. There are mainly four modules involved in GAN. Below diagram shows the general layout of GAN.


1. **Discriminator**: The discriminator module takes an image as input and predicts whether it is real or fake. The purpose of the discriminator is to distinguish between actual and generated images. It contains several convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and LeakyReLU activations. The final output is a single number that indicates the probability of the input image being real or fake.

2. **Generator**: The generator module takes a random noise vector as input and transforms it into a fake image that looks similar to the original distribution. The generator module is responsible for generating fake images that have the desired properties specified by the user. It contains several upsampling layers followed by transposed convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and ReLU activations.

3. **Latent Space**: The latent space represents the middle man between the input and output spaces of the GAN. The latents are sampled from a standard normal distribution and then transformed through multiple intermediate layers before being fed into the generator module.

4. **Adversarial Loss Function**: Once the generator and discriminator modules are trained independently, the next step is to combine them to form a unified system. The adversarial loss function determines the degree of similarity between the generated and real images, which is measured by the discriminator’s prediction probabilities. One common choice for this loss function is the Binary Cross Entropy loss.
