# 1.简介
  

Different frameworks and tools vary based on industry and level of maturity. Some examples include: 





These frameworks are valuable resources for individuals working in various fields from researchers to policy-makers, technology companies to journalists, due to their ability to address issues related to data governance, compliance, and accessibility while promoting innovation and economic growth. 


# 2.Background Introduction
Data governance is the process of overseeing how data is created, managed, used, and shared throughout its lifecycle. Over time, industries have evolved increasingly complex data structures, making it challenging to implement effective data governance processes. Increasing levels of complexity and depth require specialized skills and technologies that need to be learned and applied effectively. Additionally, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, as each organization has unique needs and constraints. Therefore, it is essential for anyone involved in data governance to understand the current state-of-the-art and choose the right tool for their specific needs. 

# 3.Basic Concepts & Terminology
Before we begin discussing technical details about these frameworks and tools, let us first clarify some basic concepts and terminology.
## Definitions
**Data asset:** An individual piece of data stored within a system or collection, often containing personal or sensitive information. For example, a bank statement may be considered a data asset when located within a financial transaction system.

**Personal data:** Information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"). Personal data includes things like name, date of birth, address, email, phone number, and photograph. Personal data could refer to any type of data that is linked directly or indirectly to a particular individual.

**Sensitive data:** Sensitive data refers to information that poses a high risk of unintended disclosure if it were revealed to someone who should not have access to it. Common examples of sensitive data include credit card numbers, social security numbers, passport details, healthcare records, and biometric data.

**Privacy:** Privacy refers to the concept of preventing unauthorized access to personal or sensitive information. Techniques like encryption and access controls help reduce the potential for unauthorized disclosures.

**Regulation:** Regulation is a legal framework that sets requirements or guidelines for certain aspects of business or government operations, such as data handling procedures or data protection laws. Examples of regulations include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

**Rights Management:** Rights management refers to the assignment of permissions to individuals for accessing and sharing data according to established rules. Access control lists (ACLs) are a common technique used to manage data access.

**Compliance:** Compliance means adherence to relevant regulatory and ethical laws, codes of conduct, and company policies. Organizations must regularly assess their own internal and external compliance activities to identify areas where improvements can be made.

**Trustworthiness:** Trustworthiness involves assessing the reliability, legitimacy, and appropriateness of data provided by third parties. According to the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), "trustworthy" data is defined as accurate, complete, reliable, current, and consistent with authorized purpose and use."

**Authorization:** Authorization is the permission given by an entity to another entity to access and utilize a data asset. It typically occurs after a positive assessment of the risks associated with accessing or sharing the data.

**Audit trail:** Audit trails document all actions taken on behalf of an organization, recording what users did and when, providing visibility into past activities and identifying patterns of abuse or misuse.

**Pseudonymization:** Pseudonymization involves generating random identifiers instead of real ones to mask the relationships between individuals' private information and make it difficult for those involved to trace back to a singular individual. This makes pseudonyms useful for de-identifying data while still allowing meaningful analysis.

**Security:** Security is the protection of data from unauthorized access, modification, deletion, loss, or damage. Various techniques such as encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and logging capabilities help secure data assets.

**Business Continuity Planning:** Business continuity planning is the process of identifying and mitigating potential threats to critical functions during a period of transition or disruption, which can result in service interruptions or significant cost increases. It involves defining backup and recovery strategies, monitoring performance, and evaluating contingency plans.

**Legal Concerns:** Legal concerns relate to any aspect of a company's data environment that could potentially affect the fairness, transparency, or integrity of the data or the processing of customer data. These include privacy lawsuits, data breaches, litigation involving customer data, and anticompetitive behavior.
