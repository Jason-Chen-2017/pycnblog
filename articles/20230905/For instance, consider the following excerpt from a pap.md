# 1.简介
  

Google Brain Team has been publishing academic papers for many years and is considered one of the leading AI researchers in the world. One such paper is "Attention is all you need", which introduced the transformer model. The main idea behind this paper was to propose an attention-based model that can learn efficiently from massive amounts of data without explicitly modeling position or temporal dependencies between input elements. In recent years, with advances in hardware technology and large scale datasets, transformers have become increasingly popular in natural language processing tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. 

In this article, we will explain how the transformer model works at a high level using intuitive examples and provide code samples in Python for implementing the model. We also look into some key techniques used in building these models, including positional encoding and multi-head attention mechanisms. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges in building better transformers and articulate a roadmap for their development.

2.基本概念和术语说明
Before delving into the technical details, let us first understand some basic concepts and terms used in building neural networks. 

2.1 Neural Networks
A neural network (NN) is a set of interconnected nodes (or units), where each unit receives inputs from other units in the layer and applies its weights to those inputs to produce outputs. A simple example of a NN architecture is shown below:


Each node represents an activation function applied on weighted sum of its input signals. Each edge indicates a connection between two layers, which allows information flow across layers during training. 

There are different types of NN architectures based on whether they use feedforward neural networks or recurrent neural networks. Feedforward NNs work best when the inputs do not depend on previous inputs and rely solely on current inputs to make predictions. Recurrent NNs, on the other hand, allow information to persist through time, allowing them to capture complex patterns in sequences. Examples of RNNs include LSTM and GRU.

2.2 Activation Functions
An activation function acts as a non-linear transformation performed on the output of a neuron. There are various types of activation functions available in practice, but common ones include sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU. Common choices include ReLU for hidden layers and softmax for classification problems. 

2.3 Loss Function
The loss function measures the error between the predicted output and the actual target value. It helps to optimize the parameters of the neural network to minimize the errors and improve the accuracy of the model. There are several commonly used loss functions in deep learning, such as cross entropy and mean squared error.

2.4 Backpropagation Algorithm
Backpropagation algorithm is the central optimization technique used to update the weights of a neural network during training. During backpropagation, each weight learns its contribution to reducing the loss function. The gradient descent method updates the weights according to the negative of the gradient of the loss function w.r.t. to the weights. This process repeats until convergence or a specified number of iterations is reached.


3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
Now that we know what neural networks, activations functions, loss functions, and backpropagation algorithms are, let us dive deeper into the inner working of the transformer model.

3.1 Positional Encoding
Positional encoding is a type of embedding that provides a representation of the absolute or relative positions of tokens within a sequence. In the Transformer model, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings before being fed into the encoder layers. The goal of adding positional encodings is to give the model more information about the order and structure of the input sentence. Without it, the model would be unable to effectively leverage the sequential nature of sentences.

As mentioned earlier, positional encoding is simply another type of embedding that maps individual words or phrases to vectors of fixed size. Instead of having unique values for every word, we assign a vector of the same dimensionality to each position in the sequence. This makes sense since the position of any given token does not change throughout the entire sequence. 

Here is the formula for calculating the positional encoding:

PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/(10000^(2i/dmodel)))
PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/(10000^(2i/dmodel)))

where pos is the position of the token in the sequence, i is the index of the feature (i=1...dmodel/2), dmodel is the dimensionality of the feature vector. 

We can implement the above formula using numpy as follows:


```python
import math
import numpy as np

class PositionalEncoding(object):
    def __init__(self, max_seq_len, dim):
        self.dim = dim
        pe = []
        for pos in range(max_seq_len):
            for i in range(0, self.dim, 2):
                val = math.sin(pos / (10000 ** ((2 * i)/self.dim))) 
                if i == self.dim - 2:
                    val = val * 0.5 # scaling factor for even dimensions
                pe.append(val)

                val = math.cos(pos / (10000 ** ((2 * (i + 1))/self.dim)))
                if i == self.dim - 2:
                    val = val * 0.5 # scaling factor for even dimensions
                pe.append(val)

        pe = np.array(pe).reshape(-1, self.dim)
        self.pe = pe

    def get_positional_encoding(self, seq_len):
        return self.pe[:seq_len]
```

This implementation calculates the positional encoding for up to `max_seq_len` tokens long sequences. If the length of the sequence is less than `max_seq_len`, zeros are padded to the end of the positional encoding tensor. 

3.2 Multi-Head Attention Mechanism
Multi-head attention mechanism is a new way of performing attention over multiple heads instead of just one. Unlike traditional attention mechanism, which considers only the query element and keys in computing the attention scores, the multi-head attention mechanism involves splitting the queries, keys, and values into multiple sub-vectors, known as head vectors. These sub-vectors are then concatenated together and fed into separate linear projections to generate attention distributions for each head. By doing so, the attention mechanism can exploit different aspects of the input sequence, resulting in improved performance.

To perform multi-head attention, we first split the input tensors into h sub-vectors of equal dimensionality D. Then we calculate Qh, Kh, Vh matrices for each head j, where q_ij, k_ij, v_ij represent the ith element of query, key, and value respectively.

The attention score matrix Sj is calculated as follows:

Sij = q_ij^T W_q k_ij 
Qj = concat([Q_1,..., Q_h])
Kj = concat([K_1,..., K_h])
Vh = concat([V_1,..., V_h])
Wh_q = matmul(W_q^T, [D,..., D])
Sh_qj = matmul(Qh^T, Wh_q)
S_qj = matmul(Qj, Sh_qj)

Next, we apply softmax function to convert the attention score matrix into normalized distribution.

S_qj = softmax(S_qj)

Finally, we multiply the normalized attention scores with the corresponding values vector to obtain the final context vector c_j:

c_j = matmul(S_qj, Vh)

We concatenate the c_j vectors to form the complete context vector C:

C = concat([c_1,..., c_h])

We repeat the above steps for each head j to obtain the final output o:

o = Oj x W_o + bias

where Oj denotes the output of the jth head.

After obtaining the output o, we add dropout regularization to reduce overfitting and prevent memorizing irrelevant features.

Overall, the overall computation complexity of multi-head attention is proportional to n x dk, where n is the maximum sequence length, dk is the dimensionality of the input vectors, and h is the number of heads. As a result, multi-head attention scales well to larger input sizes while retaining the ability to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
