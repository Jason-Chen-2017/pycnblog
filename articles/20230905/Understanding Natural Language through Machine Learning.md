# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the field of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence that helps computers understand human language and manipulate it in various ways such as translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering etc. The goal of NLP is to enable machines to read, understand, generate and interact with natural human languages using computer programming techniques. 

The traditional approach towards NLP has been rule-based systems where complex rules are used for determining a sentence's grammatical structure, word senses, coreferences, negation, temporal references, semantic relationships, logical inference, etc. However, this process can be time consuming, error prone and results in unnatural text. In recent years, deep learning models have shown promise as they learn from large datasets without explicit supervision and achieve state-of-the-art performance in many tasks like speech recognition, image caption generation, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. One such model called the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network uses an input sequence of words and outputs a probability distribution over possible next words. These networks can work on variable length sequences, making them well suited for processing text data.


In this article we will discuss about some key concepts and algorithms involved in building neural networks for natural language understanding. We will also demonstrate how these algorithms can be used to build models for text classification, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. Finally, we will provide insights into how these models can be further fine-tuned or transferred to other domains by leveraging domain-specific data and transfer learning techniques. 


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before delving into the details of building neural networks for natural language understanding, let us briefly review some basic concepts and terminology related to language and its representation.
## 2.1 Language
Language is a system of communication between people whose meanings are constructed via symbols, phrases, clauses and sentences. This symbolic information includes sound, gestures, facial expressions, and vocabulary. Humans use their native tongue and communicate in different cultures around the world. Thus, language varies from individual to individual and across generations. Language differs from culture in several ways including dialectical variation, lexicon size, idiomatic usage, and variations in nuances of meaning due to social context. 

## 2.2 Representation
In order to represent language digitally, we need a way to encode each symbol in terms of one or more digits. There are two main methods: symbol coding and one-hot encoding.

Symbol Coding involves assigning unique integers or characters to each symbol and representing the message as a sequence of codes corresponding to those integers/characters. For example, if "apple" is represented as [1,2,3], then "banana" would be represented as [2,3,4]. Symbol coding provides efficient storage space but makes it challenging to analyze or interpret the messages since no clear semantics or relationship among the symbols is preserved.

One-Hot Encoding assigns either a value of zero or one to each symbol depending on whether it occurs in the message or not. For example, if "apple" is represented as [0,1,0], then "banana" would be represented as [0,1,0]. Each dimension corresponds to a unique symbol and all values except one are set to zero, resulting in a binary vector. One-hot encoding is simple and easy to implement but does not preserve any information regarding the order or proximity of symbols within the message. It may result in sparse representations which do not capture important aspects of the language.

## 2.3 Corpus and Vocabulary
A corpus consists of a collection of documents typically written by humans. A document can be considered as a unit of text. A corpus is often divided into training, development, and testing sets. 

Vocabulary refers to the collection of distinct words used in the corpora. It contains both frequent and infrequent words. Often times, the vocabulary size is restricted to reduce the number of dimensions required to represent the messages. Word embeddings, a type of distributed representation technique, can help capture the semantic relationships among the words even when limited to a fixed vocabulary size. They map each word to a dense vector space where similar words are mapped closer together.

## 2.4 Tokenization and Stopwords
Tokenization refers to dividing the text into smaller units called tokens, such as words or sub-phrases. Common stopwords like 'the', 'and', 'a' are removed during tokenization to improve efficiency. Tokens are fed into the embedding layer to convert each token to a dense vector representation. Common pre-processing steps include converting uppercase letters to lowercase letters, removing special characters, stemming and lemmatization. Stemming reduces words to their base form while lemmatization retains the original form but removes inflectional endings like '-ing'. 

# 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
## 3.1 Bag-of-Words Model
Bag-of-words models assume that words occur independently in a document and represent the occurrence count of each word in the document. For example, given a document "I am happy", bag-of-words model would create a dictionary containing "happy" as a separate item along with the count of 1 indicating the frequency of the word in the document. These dictionaries are usually stored in sparse format to save memory and speed up computation. Once the vocabulary is learned, new documents can be represented as vectors by counting the occurrences of each word in the dictionary.

However, this model ignores the order or position of the words in the document, making it ineffective for capturing the syntactic and semantic relationships present in the text. To address this issue, we can use n-grams instead of single words. An n-gram is a sequence of n consecutive words. For example, in the sentence "I love New York", bigrams would be ["I love", "love New", "New York"]. Using bigrams instead of singletons allows the algorithm to capture the sequential nature of the text.

Finally, this model does not take into account the contextual relationships among the words in the document. Context-aware models incorporate external knowledge sources such as named entities or parts of speech tags to capture the interplay between words.   

## 3.2 Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly useful for analyzing visual imagery because they are designed to detect patterns and features at multiple spatial scales. CNNs consist of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers apply filters to the input images, performing feature detection and extraction. The pooling layers downsample the output of the previous layer to reduce the dimensionality and increase the discriminative power of the model. The final fully connected layers combine the extracted features to produce the final predictions. The architecture of the CNNs vary widely, ranging from shallow to deeper convolutional layers and larger filter sizes. 

We can use CNNs for text classification tasks by treating each document as an image. We can preprocess the text data by converting it into a suitable format such as image data and applying appropriate padding to ensure consistency in the shape and size of the input tensor. During training, we can split the dataset into training and validation splits and train the CNN on the training data. We can evaluate the performance of the model on the validation data to monitor the convergence and avoid overfitting. At test time, we feed the raw text data to the trained CNN to obtain predicted class labels.  

Another application of CNNs for text analysis is sentiment analysis, where we classify the polarity of the text (positive or negative). We can treat each sentence as an image and apply a CNN classifier to predict the sentiment score. Text classifiers can also utilize attention mechanisms to focus on specific words in the sentence based on their relevance to the task. Additionally, we can use GloVe word embeddings to capture the semantic relationships among the words and incorporate them in our models.
