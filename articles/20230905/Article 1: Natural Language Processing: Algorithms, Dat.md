## 2.1 NLP简介

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to understand and manipulate human languages in natural ways. The goal of this technology is to enable computers to process, analyze, and generate text as well as speech, making it one of the most powerful tools for AI today. Examples of applications include chatbots, speech recognition systems, information retrieval, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. 

The field has seen an explosion of research over the past several years, with many new techniques being developed such as deep learning and neural networks, attention mechanisms, and convolutional neural networks. It also faces unique challenges like dealing with noisy data and the importance of contextual understanding. Despite these advances, there are still significant gaps in the quality and accuracy of current NLP models. Therefore, successful advancements require not only algorithmic breakthroughs but also improved evaluation metrics, datasets, and model architectures.

In this article, we will discuss algorithms, datasets, and evaluation methods used in the NLP domain. We will start by introducing some fundamental concepts in NLP including linguistic structures, parsing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, word embeddings, and named entity recognition. Then, we will move on to examine various NLP tasks and evaluate their performance using standard metrics such as perplexity, precision/recall, F1 score, BLEU score, and ROUGE score. Finally, we will explore common approaches to improving NLP models, including training probabilistic language models, using transfer learning techniques, fine-tuning pre-trained models, and multi-task learning. To conclude our discussion, we will briefly touch upon other relevant technologies such as sequence modeling, knowledge graphs, and question answering. This work provides a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in exploring the area of NLP and building more accurate and reliable NLP models. 

Let’s get started!


## 2.2 Linguistic Structures

In NLP, text can be analyzed based on its underlying linguistic structure. Some important features of linguistic structures include:

1. Word Formation: A sentence typically consists of words, which have different forms due to conjugations or derivational morphology. For example, the verb "to walk" can take different forms depending on whether it is being used in isolation or as part of a longer phrase. 

2. Syntax: Sentences have internal relationships between components, such as subject, object, adverbial modifiers, etc., which determine how they are arranged and combined to form coherent sentences. Each component is linked to others through syntactic links, which define the order and dependencies among them. 

3. Semantics: Sentences express ideas, attitudes, and beliefs about things and events, and may involve complex reasoning processes. These thoughts can be categorized into various semantic fields, such as philosophy, literature, history, science, medicine, politics, sports, entertainment, etc., each of which requires specific linguistic expressions and vocabulary. 

To summarize, linguistic structures provide rich insights into the meaning and structure of texts, and can help us make sense of the world around us. With proper preprocessing and feature extraction, linguistic structures can be effectively used to build NLP models.

## 2.3 Parsing

Parsing refers to the task of identifying the constituent parts of a sentence, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, conjunctions, etc., and linking them together into meaningful phrases and clauses. Parsing allows NLP models to better understand the relationships and interactions between different units within a sentence. In NLP, parsing is usually performed using chart parsers or shift reduce parsers. Chart parsers use a set of rules and constraints to construct a parse tree from a given input string. Shift-reduce parsers alternatively scan the string left-to-right and right-to-left respectively, allowing for top-down and bottom-up scanning strategies. Both types of parser suffer from ambiguity issues, where multiple possible parses exist for a given sentence. However, improvements in parsing technology are continually underway to address this challenge. 

To summarize, parsing involves extracting the structural elements of sentences while maintaining discourse and style information, enabling NLP models to better interpret the content and relationships of sentences. Improvements in parsing technology are essential for effective NLP models.

## 2.4 Tokenization

Tokenization refers to the process of splitting a sentence into individual tokens or units, such as words, punctuation marks, numbers, or abbreviations. Tokens are the basic building blocks of natural language processing, representing the smallest meaningful unit in a document. Tokenization helps improve the efficiency of NLP models because they can operate at a higher level of abstraction and focus on individual units rather than entire documents. Typically, tokenization splits a sentence into words using whitespace characters as delimiters. Another approach is to split a sentence into characters or subwords according to character n-grams or word n-grams, which represent sequences of characters or words that appear frequently together. 

To summarize, tokenization converts raw text into a stream of tokens, providing a high-level representation of a sentence that can be processed by NLP models. Improved tokenization techniques can further enhance NLP models' performance.

## 2.5 Part-Of-Speech Tagging

Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) assigns a category to each word in a sentence according to its grammatical function. POS tags play an essential role in determining the meanings and relationships between words and phrases, leading to improved accuracy of NLP models. Classical POS taggers assign categories based on dictionaries of lexicons, while recent deep learning-based models achieve impressive results by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled corpus data and transfer learning techniques. Common POS tags include noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, determiner, coordinating conjunction, etc., although variations and synonyms can cause confusion when using traditional lexicons. 

To summarize, part-of-speech tagging categorizes words based on their grammatical roles, leading to enhanced understanding of the content and relationships of sentences. Traditional and deep learning-based approaches offer significant progress towards achieving robust and accurate NLP models.

## 2.6 Dependency Parsing

Dependency parsing refers to the process of constructing a directed graph connecting the head nodes of phrases to dependent nodes, indicating the relationship between pairs of words in a sentence. Depending on the type of relation captured, dependency parsing can extract valuable information such as coreference chains, temporal orders, and causal factors. Similar to part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing plays an essential role in improving the accuracy and interpretability of NLP models. Standard dependency grammars rely heavily on handcrafted features extracted from dependency trees, such as arc labels, directionality, and distance between dependents. Deep learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks or transformers to automatically learn the appropriate features for dependency parsing directly from raw text inputs without requiring any manual annotation.

To summarize, dependency parsing constructs a directed graph connecting the head nodes of phrases to dependent nodes, providing insights into the relationships and interactions between words within a sentence. Traditional and deep learning-based approaches both play critical roles in improving NLP models' ability to understand and manipulate natural language.
