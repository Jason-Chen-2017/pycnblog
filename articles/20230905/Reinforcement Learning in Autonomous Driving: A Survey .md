Autonomous driving refers to the technology of driving a vehicle without human intervention or direct control over it. With advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, autonomous vehicles are being developed at an unprecedented rate. In this article, we will survey several methods for reinforcement learning (RL) applied in autonomous driving applications such as lane-keeping, speed regulation, traffic signal control, and driver assistance systems. The goal is to provide insights into the state-of-the-art RL research on these topics with regards to their theoretical foundations, algorithms, implementation details, and practical applications. To achieve this task, we will present a comprehensive overview covering 7 main sections that we believe are crucial to understand different aspects of RL applications in autonomous driving. Each section will be presented by providing a brief background on its topic, highlighting key concepts involved in RL algorithms, discussing how they work and implementing them using real world examples. We also aim to conclude each section with some future directions and challenges that may arise in the field of RL in autonomous driving. Finally, we will include some common issues and questions faced while applying RL in autonomous driving along with solutions and guidance towards resolving those issues. Overall, our goal is to provide a detailed yet accessible review paper that summarizes all relevant papers published till date related to RL in autonomous driving, making it easier for readers to quickly grasp and get started with understanding this area of research. This should serve as a starting point for further investigation and exploration of RL in autonomous driving.

Reinforcement Learning (RL), also known as “agent-based” learning, is one of the most promising fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It allows machines to learn from experience instead of being explicitly programmed. The core idea behind RL is that an agent learns through trial and error by interacting with its environment. 

The first significant breakthroughs in AI were made possible due to RL’s ability to learn complex tasks from simple instructions. Robotics, specifically, pioneered the use of RL for realistic simulations of robotic behavior. Other notable areas where RL has been used in the past decade are computer games, virtual assistants, and biological systems. In the autonomous driving domain, there have been several applications of RL such as advanced path planning, driver monitoring, safety management, decision making during traffic jams, etc.

However, although RL has shown promise in several domains, it remains challenging to apply it successfully in large-scale, continuous control settings like autonomous driving. For instance, controlling a car's throttle while avoiding collisions can seem daunting if trained only based on static visual inputs. Similarly, training an agent to follow a specific route may require massive amounts of data and time, which are usually difficult to collect. Additionally, the complexity of various environments makes it even more difficult to design appropriate algorithms and parameterizations.

Overall, there exists much less empirical evidence about the efficacy and effectiveness of RL in autonomous driving compared to other AI applications. As such, this article aims to fill this gap and provide insight into the current state of the art of RL applied in autonomous driving.

## 概览
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) applied in autonomous driving. We start by reviewing relevant literature by categorizing works into seven main sections: 

1. Lane keeping 
2. Speed regulation 
3. Traffic signal control 
4. Driver assistance systems
5. Behavioral cloning
6. Imitation learning
7. Hybrid approaches

Each section presents a comprehensive analysis of existing methods and reviews open research problems and future directions. Specifically, we focus on four main topics:

1. Lane Keeping: Despite widespread success in self-driving cars, accidents still occur frequently due to variations in road geometry and light conditions. Therefore, automated lane keeping plays a critical role in improving system reliability and reducing incidents. In this section, we discuss the fundamental principles underlying optimal lane keeping strategies, highlight different types of models used for predicting the desired trajectory, and evaluate the performance of different algorithms on challenging test cases. We also introduce new methods for managing uncertainties, including using learned action priors and model-free Q-learning.

2. Speed Regulation: Congested roads cause delays, frustration, and fatalities among drivers. In order to improve overall driving comfort, automatic speed regulation systems are required to adaptively manage vehicle dynamics. One approach is to train a neural network to take into account vehicle dynamics, history of the previous actions, and reward functions provided by the driver. Another approach is to employ adaptive cruise control, which dynamically adjusts vehicle acceleration based on observed vehicle dynamics, headway time, and travel distance. In this section, we provide a thorough overview of both approaches, comparing their respective benefits and drawbacks. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different factors on the performance of automatic speed regulation systems, including headwind effects, road layout, and weather conditions.

3. Traffic Signal Control: According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statistics, around 90% of traffic fatalities occur in urban areas. Automated traffic signal control is essential to ensure safe operations across the country. In this section, we examine two different approaches to automate traffic signal timing control: learning-based and model-based. Model-based methods typically rely on established traffic flow patterns and occupancy profiles, whereas learning-based methods learn from historical data and anticipate changes in traffic conditions. While learning-based methods have shown promise in simulators, they may not perform well in actual road conditions due to uncertainty and noisy sensors. In contrast, model-based methods offer the advantage of having fewer parameters than learning-based methods but may lack robustness against adverse weather conditions and variations in road quality. Moreover, they require accurate estimates of the local dynamics and map connectivity, which can be impractical for real-world scenarios. In this section, we summarize the major challenges associated with automation of traffic signal control and suggest potential avenues for future research.

4. Driver Assistance Systems: Traditionally, car accidents have been caused by distracted drivers. However, modern driver assistance systems (DAS) can help reduce reliance on human input and enable safer driving behaviors. There are three main components of DAS: Intelligent Vehicles (IV), Computer Vision (CV), and Actuators. IV helps recognize obstacles ahead and steer the car appropriately. CV uses sophisticated perception technologies to detect abnormal events and alerts the driver beforehand. Actuators then manipulate steering wheels, brakes, and accelerators to provide additional feedback to guide the car. This section provides a comprehensive overview of DAS architectures, evaluation metrics, and future opportunities for development.
