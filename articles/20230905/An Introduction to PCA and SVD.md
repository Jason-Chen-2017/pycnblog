Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction in machine learning. Similarly, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), also known as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), is another powerful technique that can be used for the same purpose. 

In this blog article we will introduce both PCA and SVD techniques, explain their basic concepts and algorithms, demonstrate how they work on various datasets and showcase some interesting applications of these techniques in industry. 

We hope that by reading this article you will have gained an understanding of both methods, understood their limitations and how they are being applied in real-world scenarios.

## Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of reducing the number of variables or dimensions in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. This can help in simplifying the data representation, visualization, analysis and interpretation of complex problems. There are two common types of dimensionality reduction:

1. Feature Selection - Selecting relevant features from a larger set of available features based on certain criteria such as relevance, redundancy, and variance.

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - A technique that transforms a large dataset consisting of many variables into a smaller dimensional space where each new axis represents one of the most important variables in the original space. The axes are ordered based on their importance, so the first principal component explains the largest amount of variability in the data, followed by the second principal component, and so on.

Similarly, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) are other commonly used techniques for feature selection and dimensionality reduction. However, unlike PCA which assumes that the data follows a normal distribution, SVD and LSA operate directly on the data matrix without any assumption about its structure. 


## Linear Algebra Background
Linear algebra plays a crucial role in almost all aspects of modern science and technology including linear regression, neural networks, computer vision, etc. It provides us with a way of manipulating vectors and matrices to solve problems like solving systems of equations, calculating determinants, finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues, performing operations like addition, multiplication, and transposition, among others. Understanding the basics of linear algebra will make it easier to understand the underlying principles behind PCA and SVD techniques.

### Vectors
A vector is simply an array of numbers, denoted as $\vec{x}$ or $[x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n]$, where n is the length of the vector. In the context of PCA and SVD, we usually represent vectors as column vectors, meaning that they take up only one row of a matrix. 

### Matrices
A matrix is an array of vectors arranged in rows and columns, denoted as $A$ or $[[a_{i1} a_{i2} \cdots a_{in}] \ [b_{j1} b_{j2} \cdots b_{jn}] \cdots [z_{m1} z_{m2} \cdots z_{mn}]]$. We often use capital letters to denote matrices instead of boldface type to distinguish them from vectors.

### Operations
The following are some of the fundamental operations that we perform with vectors and matrices:

#### Addition
Addition of two vectors or matrices results in the element-wise sum of corresponding elements:
$$\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
\vdots \\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}
x_1+y_1 \\
x_2+y_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n+y_n
\end{bmatrix}$$

#### Scalar Multiplication
Scalar multiplication involves multiplying every element of a vector or matrix by a scalar value:
$$c \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}
cx_1 \\
cx_2 \\
\vdots \\
cx_n
\end{bmatrix}$$

#### Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication involves taking the dot product between corresponding elements of two matrices if the number of columns in the left matrix equals the number of rows in the right matrix. If the inner dimensions don’t match, then we need to transpose one of the matrices before performing the operation:
$$C = AB \qquad C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^na_{ik}b_{kj}$$

### Eigendecomposition
Eigendecomposition is a powerful tool in linear algebra that allows us to break down a square matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Let $M$ be a positive definite symmetric matrix, i.e., $MM^\intercal = M^\intercal M$. Then, there exists a diagonal matrix $S$ and a unitary matrix $V$ such that $M = V S V^\intercal$. Moreover, since $M$ is symmetric, $S$ is a diagonal matrix containing the square roots of the eigenvalues of $M$. The eigenvectors of $M$ are the columns of $V$, and the corresponding eigenvalues are given by the diagonals of $S$. Thus, we can express any vector $u$ in terms of its eigenvectors using Rodrigues' formula:

$$u^T M u = (\underbrace{V^Tu}_{eigenvector} \underbrace{\Lambda}_{\text{eigenvalue}})^T(\underbrace{V^Tu}_{eigenvector}\underbrace{\Lambda}_{\text{eigenvalue}})$$

where $\Lambda=\text{diag}(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n)$ contains the eigenvalues of $M$.

This equation demonstrates the connection between eigendecomposition and the problem of finding the dominant directions in high-dimensional spaces. Since we know that the direction of maximum variation corresponds to the dominant eigenvalue, we can find the corresponding eigenvector(s). By repeating this process for multiple eigenpairs, we can extract a basis for the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues.
