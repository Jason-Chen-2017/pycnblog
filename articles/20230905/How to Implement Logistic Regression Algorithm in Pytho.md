# 1.简介
  

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability of an input belonging to one class or another based on a set of coefficients and weights learned from training data. This model can be useful when we want to predict the outcome of a categorical variable like whether someone will default or not based on various factors such as age, income level, marital status etc. In this article, I am going to show you how to implement logistic regression algorithm using python library scikit learn with detailed explanation of each step. 

# 2.Prerequisites:
Before understanding logistic regression, let's understand some basic terms and concepts related to it. Here are few points that should be understood before implementing logistic regression algorithms.

1. Binary Classification Problem: It refers to the problem where we have two classes, say 'Yes' and 'No', which needs to be predicted based on certain features of the given dataset. 

2. Coefficients and Weights: The coefficients represent the relationship between independent variables (input) and dependent variable (output). These coefficients need to be adjusted by learning algorithm during training process so that they fit the best to the given dataset. Finally, these coefficients determine the decision boundary of our logistic function.

3. Probability Estimation Function(sigmoid): A sigmoid function maps any value into range [0,1]. It helps us estimate the probability of an event happening. If the output value of sigmoid is close to 1 then the estimated probability is closer to 1 and vice versa. The sigmoid function takes z = b0 + b1 * x1 +... + bn * xn as its input, where bi are the coefficients learned by the model, xi are the independent variables and n is number of inputs.

Now, we got all necessary terminologies and concepts about logistic regression. Let’s dive deep into implementation part!
# 3.Implementation steps:Let's discuss the following steps involved in implementing logistic regression algorithm.

1. Import libraries
The first step is to import required libraries. Scikit learn provides many functions for machine learning models including logistic regression. So, we will use sklearn library to implement logistic regression.

import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression


2. Load iris Dataset
We will use built-in iris dataset from scikit learn library. It contains information about three different species of iris flowers. 

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

3. Split Data into Train and Test Sets
Next, we will split the loaded dataset into test and train sets. We will use train set for training the model and test set for testing the accuracy of the trained model. 

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

4. Initialize and Fit Model
After splitting the dataset, we will initialize the logistic regression object and call the `fit()` method to train the model on the training data.

lr = LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

5. Predict Results on Test Set
Once the model has been trained, we can make predictions on the test set using the `predict()` method.

predicted_values = lr.predict(X_test)

6. Evaluate Accuracy
Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our logistic regression model using several evaluation metrics provided by scikit learn library. One of them is accuracy score which gives us the percentage of correctly classified samples out of total samples in the test set.

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
print("Accuracy:",accuracy_score(y_test, predicted_values))

That's it! We have successfully implemented logistic regression algorithm using python scikit learn library.
