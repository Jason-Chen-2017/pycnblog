# 1.简介
  

Hierarchical clustering (HC) is a widely used technique in data mining to group similar objects into clusters based on their similarity or distance measures between them. There are several methods for implementing HC including single-linkage, complete-linkage, average linkage, centroid method etc., but the most commonly used algorithm is K-means clustering which has advantages over other methods such as efficiency and scalability. In this article, we will use the `hclust()` function in R to perform HC and create our own hierarchy of clusters. We also look at how to visualize the resulting dendrogram to gain insight into the structure of our dataset.

# 2.核心概念和术语
## 2.1 Hierarchical Clustering(HC)
In simple terms, HC involves arranging objects into groups based on their relationships to each other. Objects are divided into different groups until they cannot be separated anymore, i.e., there is no object that belongs exclusively to one group while the rest belong to another group. This process can continue recursively to form multiple levels of nested groups known as a hierarchy. The purpose of HC is to identify patterns or groups of objects with similar characteristics that may have been hidden due to random chance or noise. 

There are various methods available for implementing HC like Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Centroid Method etc. All these methods assign an individual cluster center for all objects in the dataset, hence creating distinct clusters within the same level of grouping. However, some methods may not necessarily result in the best hierarchy because of certain assumptions made by those methods during the clustering process. Thus, it is essential to choose an appropriate method that balances the trade-off between finding informative clusters and reducing redundancy in the final output.

## 2.2 Distance Matrix vs. Similarity Matrix
Distance matrix is used to represent the dissimilarity between objects, whereas the similarity matrix is defined as 1/distance_matrix. In both cases, the diagonal elements of the matrices should always be zero. Apart from the mathematical difference, both types of matrices have their uses depending on the specific problem being solved. While calculating distances between objects is useful when working with high dimensional datasets, the choice of using either type of matrix depends on the properties of the underlying data. If the relationship between objects is non-linear or non-monotonic then the distance matrix may provide more accurate results. On the other hand, if the relationship between objects is monotonic or linear then similarity matrix provides better insights into the structure of the data.

## 2.3 Dendrogram
A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that shows the arrangement of objects into clusters. Each node represents a cluster formed after merging two or more smaller clusters together. At each level of the tree, the height of the nodes corresponds to the number of clusters present in that particular branch. Hence, the greater the height, the larger the gap between the clusters. It allows us to understand the shape of the overall clustering hierarchy. As an example, consider the following dendrogram:

```
      * 
      | 
      0 
     / \ 
    /   \ 
   /     \ 
  /       \ 
 *         * 
       1    | 
         |   2 
         |   | 
         3   * 
             | 
             4
```
Here, each asterisk (*) denotes a separate cluster. Starting from the top of the dendrogram, the first set of bars indicates that three clusters were merged to produce the second level of clusters. From here, four additional clusters merge with the third level, leading to five total clusters in the bottom level. Note that the length of each bar represents the size of the corresponding cluster. The darker shade of blue indicates that the node represents the largest cluster among its children. 

Dendrograms help interpret complex clusters by showing where changes in membership occur, whether important outliers exist, and what influences contribute to the formation of these clusters. They also give us a sense of the degree of separation between the clusters and their relative sizes.

# 3.算法原理及流程说明

## 3.1 Basic Idea
The basic idea behind HC algorithms is to start with every object in its own cluster, then repeatedly combine pairs of clusters that minimally increase the intra-cluster sum of squared errors (SSE), until there is only one large cluster containing all objects. To measure the similarity between two sets of objects, we need to define a distance metric or criterion. Depending on the chosen metric, the distance between any pair of points would vary. For instance, if we want to calculate Euclidean distance between two vectors X = [x1, x2,..., xn] and Y = [y1, y2,..., ym], we can simply take the square root of the sum of the squares of differences between corresponding coordinates:

d(X,Y) = sqrt((x1 - y1)^2 +... + (xn - yn)^2)

We can extend this formula to handle higher dimensions as well. Alternatively, we can use a kernel function to transform the original features into a similarity space, which makes computing distances easier. Once we obtain the distance or similarity matrix, we can apply one of the many HC algorithms to obtain the desired partitioning of the data. These algorithms differ mainly in the way they combine adjacent clusters to reduce the SSE. Some popular methods include single-linkage, complete-linkage, average-linkage, Ward's linkage, and median-linkage.

Single-linkage hierarchical clustering compares the shortest distance between any two objects in two clusters and combines them if the combined distance is less than the minimum distance separating the two clusters. The maximum value of the resulting clustering is called the maximum distance between clusters. Complete-linkage performs the opposite operation, combining two clusters with the longest distance between their objects. Average-linkage assigns each new cluster the arithmetic mean of the distances between all pairs of objects in the clusters. Finally, median-linkage partitions the objects around the median of the distances between their nearest neighbours. Ward’s linkage constructs a tree of clusters, where each node represents a cluster formed after merging two or more smaller clusters together. The height of each node corresponds to the variance explained by that cluster. By assigning weights to the edges connecting the nodes, we minimize the variance introduced by the splitting of clusters.

Once we have obtained the hierarchy of clusters, we can use it to classify new observations or highlight interesting patterns in the data. Common visualization techniques include heatmaps, ellipses, and dendrograms. Heatmaps show the distribution of values across the clusters, while ellipses depict the boundaries of the clusters. A dendrogram shows the ordering of the clusters, indicating the affinity between the objects in different clusters and revealing possible subgroups or clusters embedded within others. Overall, HC algorithms enable us to uncover hidden structures and patterns in complex data sets, making them valuable tools for exploratory analysis and data mining tasks.

## 3.2 Algorithm Implementation
To implement the above ideas, we will use the `hclust()` function in R. Specifically, let’s assume that we have a vector of measurements associated with each observation, and we want to find a good partitioning of the data using HC. Here is how we can do it step by step:

1. Calculate the distance or similarity matrix using any suitable distance or similarity metric.
2. Compute the initial linkage matrix using the `hclust()` function, specifying the desired method for clustering. Options include "single", "complete", "average" and "ward". Additional options include "mcquitty" for clustering categorical variables, "median" for handling missing values, and "centroid" for k-means style initialization.
3. Visualize the dendrogram using the `plot()` function and its relevant parameters. Examples of parameter settings include `type="lines"`, `hang=-1`, and `main="My Title"`. 
4. Interpret the dendrogram to extract information about the optimal number of clusters, identifying the presence of significant gaps in the clustering pattern. Use the cutree() function to compute cluster assignments based on a specified threshold, typically determined empirically using cross validation.
