The following is the introduction of the survey article:

Natural language processing (NLP) has revolutionized many aspects of human life through its ability to communicate with machines effectively and efficiently. This technology has enabled us to build powerful tools such as chatbots, search engines, recommender systems, and more. However, building high quality NLP systems requires advanced algorithms, large amounts of training data, efficient hardware, and constant improvement in modeling accuracy. Machine learning approaches, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), have emerged as one of the most effective technologies for handling complex natural language problems. These techniques use sophisticated mathematical models to automatically learn features from unstructured data and extract valuable information that can be leveraged to solve real-world problems. One major challenge faced by these models is how to handle rare words or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, i.e., those that do not appear frequently enough in the training set but occur often in test data. To address this problem, several strategies have been proposed including filtering, subword tokenization, and domain adaptation. Despite significant progress achieved in recent years, there still exists a need for better understanding of how these models work under the hood, especially when it comes to selecting the right model architecture, hyperparameters tuning, and regularization techniques. As a result, a comprehensive review of current state-of-the-art techniques for addressing the challenges of natural language processing is essential to ensure the success of future NLP applications.

# 3.模型概述
## 3.1 模型架构及代表方法
Deep learning has made tremendous progress in NLP area due to its capacity to learn contextual relationships between words and capture global semantics. There are three main types of deep learning architectures used in NLP:

1. Sequence Modeling: It involves applying sequential operations to input sequences, such as LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, RNN, CNN etc. They process each element of sequence independently without any knowledge of previous elements. For example, in speech recognition, audio samples are processed sequentially frame by frame without knowing anything about the existence of other frames before or after it.

2. Embedding: Word embeddings represent words as dense vectors of real numbers in a continuous space. They map each distinct word to a unique vector in a space where similar words are located close together. Some popular embedding models include GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText, and ELMo. Word embeddings are trained on large corpora of texts, which allow them to capture semantic meaning of words across contexts. Another advantage of using word embeddings is that they reduce the dimensionality of the inputs and hence make them more manageable for DNNs. 

3. Attention Mechanisms: Attention mechanisms are designed to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during decoding. At each step, the attention mechanism calculates a weight for each input element based on its relevance to the output being generated so far. The weighted sum of all the input elements is then fed into a linear transformation followed by non-linearity to produce the final output. For example, in image captioning task, the attention mechanism helps identify and focus on important objects in the scene, thus producing accurate captions. 
## 3.2 关键算法
### 3.2.1 词法分析
In order to perform natural language processing tasks, a tokenizer must first convert raw text into tokens. Tokenization refers to dividing the text into smaller units called tokens, such as individual words, punctuation marks, and special characters. Different languages require slightly different tokenization procedures due to differences in writing styles and grammar rules. Commonly used tokenizers include whitespace splitting, punctuations removal, stemming/lemmatization, n-gram tokenization, and character-based tokenization. Examples of common tokenizers are NLTK and SpaCy libraries in Python.

### 3.2.2 句法分析
Once the tokens are obtained, next step is to parse the sentences to understand their syntactic structure. Syntactic parsing analyzes the relationship between words in a sentence to determine their constituents and dependencies among them. Popular syntactic parsers include recursive descent parser, shift-reduce parser, probabilistic chart parser, and neural networks. Each type of parser provides different levels of precision and recall, depending on the level of ambiguity present in the input data. Parsers are typically evaluated against known treebanks to measure their accuracy and robustness.

### 3.2.3 意图识别
After obtaining structured representations of the input text, next task is to recognize the underlying intent behind the message. Intent recognition consists of identifying the user's goal or purpose in the input data. It involves classifying the messages into predefined categories, such as greeting, order status, transaction request, and query. Intents can help businesses to customize responses, automate processes, and offer personalized services to customers.

### 3.2.4 对话系统
Dialog systems enable humans to converse with computer programs or devices through spoken or written conversations. Dialog systems involve a combination of natural language understanding, dialogue management, and dialog act generation. Key components of dialog systems include natural language understanding modules that extract meaningful information from the user's utterances, dialogue management modules that coordinate the conversation flow, and dialog act generator modules that generate appropriate responses to the user. A typical dialogue system might consist of a front-end interface component that collects user input, a dialogue manager that manages the conversation flow, and back-end support infrastructure that interacts with external systems and databases.

### 3.2.5 文本分类
Classification is another key aspect of NLP tasks. Text classification involves categorizing text documents into predefined classes. Applications of text classification include spam detection, document tagging, sentiment analysis, topic identification, and customer service routing. Traditionally, text classification algorithms were based on the Bag-of-Words model, which considers every occurrence of a word as equally important. Recent advancements in NLP field aim to improve the performance of these classifiers using deep learning techniques.

### 3.2.6 机器翻译
Machine translation (MT) refers to the automatic conversion of text from one language to another. MT is an important feature of modern day communication systems and plays a crucial role in enabling people to communicate with each other easily irrespective of cultural background. Many companies rely heavily on MT to deliver products and services internationally, which makes it essential for NLP practitioners. Although MT is considered easy, it still requires expertise in both source and target languages and careful selection of language models and evaluation metrics.

### 3.2.7 文本摘要
Automatic text summarization is another challenging NLP task. It involves condensing long passages of text into short segments that capture the core ideas of the original passage. Technologies like ROUGE score and BERT have significantly improved the performance of text summarization over the last few years. Approaches like graph-based ranking, TF-IDF-based ranking, and deep learning-based seq2seq models have been employed to achieve promising results.

### 3.2.8 问答系统
Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental part of conversational AI that enables users to ask questions and receive answers in natural language format. Most QA systems involve developing a corpus of questions and corresponding answers, then training a neural network model to predict the correct answer given a new question. Three types of models exist - generative, retriever-reader, and distractor-critic. Generative models try to generate a complete answer directly from scratch, retriever-reader models leverage existing knowledge bases to find related facts and retrieve them, and distractor-critic models combine multiple sources of evidence to select the most plausible answer. Today, transformer-based models are preferred due to their ease of parallelization and scalability.

## 3.3 现有研究进展
There are two types of deep learning methods used in NLP today:
1. Pre-trained models: These models are pre-trained on large corpora of texts and then fine-tuned on the specific NLP task at hand. Pre-trained models can capture rich linguistic and contextual information that is not available in the limited dataset used for finetuning. Examples of pre-trained models are GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLNet, DistilBert, ALBERT, ELECTRA, and XLM-RoBERTa. Transfer learning allows for faster development of high-quality NLP models, reduces costs and saves time.
2. Fine-tuning models: These models are trained exclusively on the specific NLP task at hand and then generalize well to a variety of downstream tasks. Examples of fine-tuning models are BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBert, Electra, XLM-RoBERTa, and ULMFit. 

Transfer learning has shown great promise in improving the performance of NLP models since it transfers prior knowledge learned from massive datasets to the specific NLP task at hand. While pre-trained models are ideal for quickly solving a wide range of NLP tasks, fine-tuning models can offer better performance if they are properly fine-tuned on the specific task at hand. Using multi-task learning and increasing the amount of labeled data has helped improve the performance of NLP models even further.

Another significant advancement in NLP is the rise of transformers. Transformers are novel architectural techniques that use self-attention mechanisms to encode the contextual information of the input sequence. They are capable of capturing longer-range dependencies than traditional recurrent neural networks and have led to breakthroughs in numerous NLP tasks such as natural language inference, named entity recognition, machine translation, and question answering. Transformer models usually consist of an encoder module and a decoder module, which take care of the encoding and decoding of the input sequence respectively.

There are several open issues in NLP field that remain to be addressed. One of the biggest challenges facing NLP research is the lack of clear benchmarks and evaluation criteria. Research papers tend to use custom evaluation sets that may not reflect actual usage scenarios or practical concerns. This leads to biased evaluations, leading to incorrect conclusions. Meanwhile, measuring performance in terms of accuracy alone does not always provide a good sense of what is actually happening in NLP systems. Additionally, there are no established guidelines for choosing the optimal algorithm configuration or optimizing the computational resources required for training NLP models. The need for such guidance becomes more pressing as the demand for deploying high-quality NLP solutions continues to grow rapidly.
