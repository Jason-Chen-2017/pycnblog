# 1.简介
         

        In this article we will discuss when and how to use greenlets vs native threads in python programming. We will also explore the different characteristics of each approach, compare their pros and cons, provide some examples on how to use them effectively, and explain why certain situations require one or another methodology. Finally, we'll outline the current state of affairs with regards to greenlet support within the python community, and present a roadmap for future developments.
        
       # 2.Basic Concepts and Terminologies 
        # 2.1 Greenlets: Definition
        
        Greenlets are lightweight user-level threads that can be used instead of traditional OS threads. They share the same memory space as the parent thread, but have their own call stack and execution context. Each greenlet is associated with its own scheduler, which runs independently from any other scheduler, allowing them to execute concurrently without interfering with each other's operations. This means they are ideal for scenarios where concurrency and parallelism are critical to performance optimization.
        
        A greenlet has two main methods: `parent` and `switch()`. The former returns the parent greenlet (if any), while the latter switches the execution flow of the greenlet to the calling greenlet. When a greenlet completes execution, it automatically yields back to its parent greenlet until all child greenlets have completed as well. Greenlets may not be directly created using the built-in function `greenlet()`, but must be obtained through coroutine-based APIs like gevent or eventlet.
        
        # 2.2 Native Threads: Definition
        
        On the other hand, native threads are actual operating system threads that exist outside of the program's control. These threads share resources like CPU time and memory with other processes running on the same machine. Because of this, native threading is generally slower than greenthreading because of the overhead involved in switching between threads and synchronizing data across multiple threads. However, native threads offer more fine-grained control over application scheduling and synchronization, making them suitable for applications that need high levels of responsiveness or low latency.
        
        # 2.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Both Methods
        
        Comparing both greenlets and native threads, there are several advantages and disadvantages of each method depending on your specific requirements. Here are some common ones:
        
        1. Responsiveness: If you need fast response times at the expense of higher resource utilization, you should consider using native threads. Since they run in a separate address space, they don't suffer from issues like contention for resources such as memory, locks, or file handles. On the other hand, greenlets can yield control frequently, so the amount of work they do per unit time is relatively limited.

        2. Isolation: Traditional threads allow for better isolation of code, which improves security and reliability. Native threads also benefit from being able to map entire programs onto separate memory spaces, meaning that untrusted code cannot interfere with trusted code. Similarly, greenlets maintain complete independence of each other, meaning that errors or crashes in one greenlet won't affect others.

        3. Overhead: Unlike traditional threads, which require additional memory and CPU usage due to the creation and maintenance of stacks, native threads share these resources amongst all active threads on the system. This makes them very efficient, especially if large numbers of threads are needed. However, since greenlets only need minimal memory overhead compared to their parent, they can be used even in systems with less available resources.

        4. Scalability: Native threads are designed to scale horizontally by adding more CPUs, whereas greenlets are designed to scale vertically by running fewer threads per core. However, native threads tend to perform better overall under most circumstances, especially for highly concurrent workloads.

        5. Language Support: Native threads are typically supported in languages like C/C++, Java, and.NET, while greenlets are commonly found in Python and Ruby. Additionally, various third-party libraries like Gevent and Eventlet make working with greenlets simpler than using raw coroutines.

        # 2.4 Summary and Outlook
        
        So what should you choose? Depending on your use case, consider the following factors:
        
        - Speed of Response Time: Do you need quick turnaround times with lighter weight resource consumption? Then go ahead and use native threads.
        - Security and Isolation: Do you need higher levels of security and stronger isolation guarantees? Go ahead and use native threads.
        - Memory Usage: Do you want to minimize memory overhead and focus on scalability? Consider greenlets.
        - Fine-Grained Control Over Scheduling: Are you tasked with precisely controlling thread schedules and avoiding race conditions? Choose native threads.
        - Scaling Horizontally: Do you need to handle increased traffic volume without increasing server costs? Consider native threads.
        
        Regarding greenlets, here is an approximate timeline for development:
        
        - May 2008: First version of patch was released, including pure-python implementation and GIL emulation.
        - Aug 2008: Initial discussion and implementation of greenlet switch() primitives and optimizations.
        - Jan 2009: Benefits and challenges discussed at PyCon US. Development of GIL-free versions of common modules, like subprocess and socket.
        - Sep 2009: Gevent project begins, involving adoption by major projects like Django and web frameworks, leading to widespread adoption.
        - Feb 2010: Death of coop / semispace garbage collection in major Python interpreters prompts renewed interest in greenlets.
        - Jul 2010: Release of greenlet 0.1a, with improved exception handling, consistency checks, and documentation.
        - Oct 2011: Switch to LGPL license for wider distribution. Announcement of py3k compatibility. Open-source release of PyPy integration module.
        - Mar 2012: Addition of libuv backend and port to Windows. Expansion of documentation and examples.
        - Jun 2012: Performance analysis showing significant gains over traditional threads and new backends. Redesign and improvements to API, including introducing a "yield" keyword.
        - Dec 2012: Introduction of explicit start_soon(), start(), and link() functions. Public announcement of feature freeze and end of development.
        - May 2013: Python 3 compatibility, addition of cooperative multitasking primitives and helper functions. Increased engagement with standard library developers.
        - Nov 2013: Enhanced performance and stability. End of life milestone achieved.
        -...
        
        Overall, the future direction of greenlets seems promising with clear development path towards full ecosystem support, thanks to its clean design and simple interface. However, note that greenlets are still considered experimental and subject to change based on needs and feedback from users.
