# 1.简介
         

         The fundamentals of database systems are essential for all computer scientists and software engineers who need to work with data stored in databases. This book is a comprehensive guide to the fundamental principles and concepts of relational and non-relational databases. It covers topics such as normalization, indexing, query optimization, transaction management, backup and recovery mechanisms, security considerations, and advanced techniques such as spatial and temporal databases, graph databases, and NoSQL databases. By mastering these core principles and technologies, you will be able to design, develop, and maintain reliable and scalable databases that can handle complex data requirements effectively.
         While this book provides an excellent foundation for working with databases, it does not cover every aspect of them. To get a deeper understanding of each technology, you should also read additional resources such as textbooks, documentation, or online tutorials on individual topics. In addition to learning about specific algorithms used in databases, this book presents approaches to analyzing performance and determining bottlenecks.
         
         # 2.数据库概念和术语
         
         ## 数据模型
         A database consists of tables, which store related records called tuples. Each tuple contains one or more fields, which contain information about the corresponding entity being described by the table. There are several different data models depending on how the relationships between entities and their attributes are represented:

         ### Entity-Relationship Model (ERM)
         An ERM represents entities and their relationships using ER diagrams. Entities are typically represented as circles, and their attributes are represented as ellipses surrounding those circles. Relationships are shown with lines connecting pairs of entities. Examples include UML class diagrams or physical schema diagrams.

          
          **Example:** Suppose we have a hypothetical school system with three main components - students, courses, and teachers. The student entity has two attributes - name and age, while the course entity has four attributes - title, number, description, and credits. The relationship between the three entities is that a student enrolls in multiple courses, and a teacher teaches multiple courses. An ERM diagram could look something like this:
          

          
        ### Object-Oriented Data Model (OODM)
        An OODBMS uses objects to represent entities and their interactions. Objects can have properties, methods, and behaviors. They are similar to classes and instances in object-oriented programming languages.

        For example, suppose we want to model a car rental service where customers can make reservations for cars and pick up their vehicles from a fleet of available vehicles. We might define a Car Rental object with properties like customer ID, vehicle type, pickup location, drop off location, start date, end date, etc., and operations like reserve_car(), cancel_reservation(), and return_vehicle(). 


        
        ### Relational Data Model (RDM)
        A relational database stores data in tables, organized into columns and rows, much like spreadsheets or flat files. Each row in a table corresponds to a record, and each column contains a field containing a piece of information about that record. Tables can be joined together based on common keys, allowing users to access related information easily. The most popular relational database systems include SQL Server, Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MariaDB.


        ### Document Data Model (DDM)
        A document database stores JSON-like documents instead of tabular structures. Each document can contain nested subdocuments, arrays of values, and other types of data. Queries can search through documents based on keywords or patterns within fields. Popular document databases include MongoDB, Couchbase, ElasticSearch, and Amazon DynamoDB.

        ### Columnar Data Model (CDM)
        A columnar database stores data in vertical slices rather than horizontal rows. It's optimized for analytical queries that involve aggregating large amounts of data across many dimensions. Examples include Apache Cassandra and HBase.

        ### Key-Value Store
        A key-value store is a simple data storage mechanism where data is mapped to unique keys. Unlike traditional relational databases, key-value stores offer high throughput and low latency for frequent reads and writes. Common examples include Redis, Memcached, and Azure Cosmos DB.

        ## 事务管理
        
        Transactions are sets of actions performed as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure atomicity, consistency, and isolation guarantees among database activities. When transactions are committed successfully, they provide durability since changes are permanently saved to disk. However, if there is a failure during the commit process, the transaction may need to be rolled back to undo the changes. Transaction management includes various features such as serialization, concurrency control, and logging to ensure consistent and correct behavior under concurrent environments.
        
         Transactions can be categorized into the following categories:
         * ACID Properties
            1. Atomicity : A transaction is either fully completed or aborted, but cannot be partially completed. All related updates to data are applied atomically or none at all.
             
            2. Consistency : The database always remains in a valid state before and after a transaction. Any constraint or rule defined must be followed consistently throughout the database. 
             
            3. Isolation : Concurrent execution of transactions should not interfere with each other. Different transactions see only their own modifications and modifications made by other transactions do not affect their view.
             
            4. Durability : Once a transaction is committed, its effects persist even in case of system crashes or hardware failures.
            
            
  
       
       ## 查询优化
        
        Query optimization refers to the process of selecting the optimal way to execute a given query against a database. The goal of query optimization is to minimize the total cost of processing the request, including the time required to retrieve the requested data and the amount of memory necessary to perform the operation. Query optimizer algorithms use statistics gathered about the distribution of the data to determine the best plan for executing the query. Some commonly used algorithms for query optimization include:

        1. Single Table Scan Optimization

        2. Index Selection and Maintenance

        3. Join Order Selection

        4. Nested Loop Join Algorithm

        5. Query Planning
        
         ## 索引
        
        Indexes are special lookup tables that speed up searching and sorting operations on certain columns in a table. Indexes improve data retrieval times by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned in order to find a particular set of results. When creating indexes, the database management system maintains a copy of the index in a separate structure, making searches faster compared to a sequential scan of the entire table. Indexes allow quick retrieval of data regardless of the size of the table and help avoid scanning unnecessary data when dealing with very large datasets. Common types of indexes include primary keys, secondary keys, composite keys, and unique constraints.
