         ## What is Spring Boot?
         
         Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal configuration, allowing you to get running productively in a short time.

         Spring Boot has lots of features including:

         1. It is designed for building web applications, RESTful services, and microservices.
         2. The starter projects make getting up and running fast and easy. You don’t need to configure anything yourself.
         3. It comes with dependency management, allowing you to easily upgrade versions of your dependencies.
         4. It provides production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
         5. It supports many embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.
         6. It has built-in testing support including JUnit, Mockito, and Hamcrest assertions.
         7. It has supported Java versions from Java 8 and later all the way to Java 11 and even newer versions.

         In summary, Spring Boot simplifies the development process by providing a convention over configuration approach to reduce boilerplate code. Furthermore, it offers built-in security, testing, monitoring, and integration tools that are important in enterprise-level applications.

         ## Objectives of this Tutorial
         
         This tutorial will show you how to build a simple Spring Boot application with user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to authenticate users and authorize them to access certain endpoints. 

         At the end of this article, we hope that you have gained some understanding on how to implement user authentication and authorization using JWTs in Spring Boot. Let's dive into the implementation details!

        # 2.基本概念术语说明

        ## 2.1 JWT (JSON Web Token)
        JSON Web Tokens (JWT), previously known as OAuth tokens, are used primarily to secure API calls between two parties. These tokens contain information about the authenticated user such as their username and role(s) within an organization. They are self-contained which means they include everything necessary to verify the token's authenticity without any additional requests being made to a server. 

        A typical JWT consists of three parts separated by dots (.): header, payload, and signature. The header contains metadata about the type of token, signing algorithm, and key identifier. The payload holds the claims — data statements that assert some fact about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data such as expiration date and roles assigned to the user. Finally, the signature digitally signs the entire message using a secret key to ensure its integrity and non-tampering.
        
        JWT tokens can be signed using symmetric encryption algorithms (such as HMAC SHA-256) or asymmetric encryption algorithms (such as RSA) using public/private keys pairs. When verified, the signature is validated to confirm the token was issued by a trusted authority and not tampered with during transport.

        ## 2.2 Cookies vs. JWT 
        While cookies were originally intended to store small amounts of data such as session identifiers, they now serve several other purposes as well. Some common uses of cookies include website sessions, shopping cart tracking, browser preferences, and device fingerprinting. However, these benefits are lost when compared to JWTs because JWTs can store more complex data structures than cookies, and since JWTs are self-contained, there is no need for additional requests to validate them once they are generated. Therefore, JWTs offer several advantages over traditional cookie-based authentication systems:

            * Simplicity: JWTs require less code and configuration than cookies do.
            * Statelessness: Since JWTs do not rely on maintaining client state, it prevents cross-site scripting attacks and other similar vulnerabilities.
            * Security: Using JWTs ensures that the system remains secure against various types of attacks such as replay attacks, injection attacks, and malicious claims.
            * Flexibility: JWTs can be customized to fit specific needs, such as single sign-on (SSO) or refresh tokens.
            
         ## 2.3 Spring Security
        Spring Security is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing security in Spring-based applications. It allows developers to easily add powerful authentication and authorization functionality to their applications while still remaining modular and customizable. 

        Spring Security includes numerous components such as authentication providers, password encoders, and interceptors that provide flexibility in adding different layers of protection to different areas of an application. The framework also comes with a number of built-in filters that allow developers to protect specific resources or paths within an application.

        ### How does Spring Security work?

        When a request reaches a secured resource, the following steps occur:

        1. The filter chain starts at the beginning and proceeds downwards through each configured filter until either the resource is allowed to pass or the filter chain terminates due to an error. 
        2. Each filter examines the incoming request to determine if it should be handled by itself or passed on to the next filter in the chain. For example, the X-Requested-With header filter determines whether the current request is coming from a XMLHttpRequest object, which indicates that it may be unsafe to include sensitive data in the request body. If the requested path matches a protected URL pattern, the filter chain stops and control passes to the appropriate authentication provider. 
        3. Once the principal is identified, the security context is created and populated with relevant information, such as the user's authorities and credentials. 
        4. Based on the security configuration, the appropriate authorizer takes action to decide if the user is authorized to access the resource. If the user is authorized, the filter chain continues and the resource is served to the user. Otherwise, a HTTP status code indicating unauthorized access is returned to the user agent and the filter chain terminates prematurely. 


          ## 2.4 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
          RBAC refers to a method of restricting access to computer programs and networked devices based on the individual's role rather than individual permissions. Roles are defined by the organizational structure and assign specific privileges to members of each group. RBAC policies typically use groups and membership rules to define who has access to what resources based on their roles.

          There are several ways to implement role-based access control depending on the complexity of the system. Common approaches include using identity management platforms like Active Directory or Apache Ranger, or manually defining access controls within the application code.

          In general, manual RBAC requires creating separate permissions for every possible action that could be performed by any user on the system, and then assigning those permissions to roles based on the user's job function or department. Administrators would then grant users access to these roles according to their responsibilities within the company.

          ##  3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解

           In this section, I will explain how to implement user authentication and authorization using JWTs in Spring Boot. 
           First, let me give a brief introduction to the algorithm behind JWT authentication and authorization. Then, we'll explore how to implement JWT authentication in Spring Boot using the `spring-security-oauth2` library. Lastly, we'll see how to integrate JWT authentication with role-based access control in our Spring Boot application.
         
           ## Algorithm Overview
           Here's a high-level overview of the JWT authentication and authorization algorithm:
 
           1. The client sends a login request to the server along with their email address and password.
           2. The server verifies the email and password against its database and generates a unique JWT access token for the user.
           3. The server returns the JWT access token to the client.
           4. The client stores the JWT access token in local storage or in an HTTPOnly Cookie.
           5. On subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT access token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request.
           6. The server validates the JWT access token and grants access to the corresponding user account if it is valid.
           7. After accessing a restricted endpoint, the server extracts the user's role(s) from the JWT access token and applies role-based access control (RBAC) policies to grant or deny access to the endpoint.
          
          To understand the above algorithm better, let's go deeper into the technical details.

          ### Step 1: Login Request
          The first step is to send a login request containing the user's email address and password to the server. Here's a sample POST request to `/login`:

          ```
          POST /login HTTP/1.1
          Host: localhost:8080
          Content-Type: application/json
          {
              "email": "<EMAIL>",
              "password": "mysecret"
          }
          ```

          ### Step 2: Server Verifies Email and Password
          Next, the server receives the login request and verifies the provided email and password against its own database. Assuming the verification succeeds, the server generates a new JWT access token and encrypts it using a secret key. The encrypted JWT access token is returned back to the client. Here's a sample response from the server:

          ```
          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          Content-Type: application/json
          {
              "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
          }
          ```

          Note that the JWT access token is an encoded string that consists of three segments separated by periods. The first segment is the header, the second segment is the payload, and the third segment is the signature. All segments except the last one are base64url-encoded strings, whereas the last one is a cryptographic hash of the previous two segments plus a secret key.

          ### Step 3: Client Stores JWT Access Token Locally
          The client stores the received JWT access token locally for future use. Here's an example of storing the access token in a JavaScript variable called `accessToken`:

          ```javascript
          const accessToken = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c';
          ```

          ### Step 4: Subsequent Requests to Restricted Endpoints
          When the client sends subsequent requests to restricted endpoints, it must include the JWT access token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request. Here's an example of sending the access token in the Authorization header:

          ```
          GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
          Host: localhost:8080
          Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
          ```

          ### Step 5: Server Validates JWT Access Token
          Before granting access to a restricted endpoint, the server validates the JWT access token. Here's how the validation works:


          > **Note**: Depending on the chosen implementation, the actual validation logic might differ slightly. 


          #### Verification of Signature
          The server decrypts the JWT access token using the same secret key that was used to generate it. If decryption fails, the server rejects the request. If decryption succeeds, the server retrieves the header, payload, and signature segments from the decrypted token.

          #### Expiration Time Check
          The server checks if the expiration timestamp in the JWT access token has expired. If the token has expired, the server rejects the request.

          #### Audience Claim Check
          The server verifies that the JWT access token was intended for the correct audience (i.e., the server's URI).

          #### Not Before Time Check
          The server checks if the token is currently valid before the specified start time. If the token is invalid because it has already been used before the start time, the server rejects the request.

          ### Step 6: Grants Access to Endpoint
          Once the JWT access token is successfully validated, the server grants access to the corresponding user account. The server extracts the user's role(s) from the JWT access token and applies RBAC policies to grant or deny access to the endpoint.

          ### Summary
          That concludes the JWT authentication and authorization algorithm. In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of JWTs, Spring Security, and role-based access control. We discussed how to implement JWT authentication in Spring Boot using the spring-security-oauth2 library and integrated JWT authentication with role-based access control.
