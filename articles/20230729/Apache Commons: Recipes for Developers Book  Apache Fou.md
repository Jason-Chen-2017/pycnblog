         第三章	Introduction to the Java Programming Language and Tools
         ▪ Java Programming Language Background and Features
         ▪ Basic Syntax of Java Code
         ▪ Compiling and Running Java Programs
         ▪ Debugging Java Programs
         ▪ Introducing GUI Development in Java
         ● Introducing Data Structures and Algorithms
        The following chapters discuss important concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, interfaces and exception handling while also highlighting how they help make programs more modular and maintainable. In addition, it covers basic design patterns that can be used effectively to solve common problems such as singletons, factories, iterators, and command pattern.
        Chapter 2: Java Collections Framework
        This chapter focuses on implementing various collections classes such as lists, sets, maps and trees along with their features and methods. It explores different ways to access elements from these collections using indices or keys. Also, it discusses advanced topics such as serialization, listeners, comparators, enumerations, and concurrent modification exceptions.
        Chapter 3: Java I/O
        This chapter presents an overview of input-output operations in Java including streams, readers, writers, buffered readers and writers, file channels, data conversion, and charset encodings. It also covers working with URLs and URIs and reading properties files. Finally, it shows examples of how to use NIO.2 to improve performance when dealing with large amounts of data.
        Chapter 4: Java Concurrency
        This chapter introduces concurrency programming in Java through a hands-on approach by demonstrating several synchronization techniques such as synchronized blocks, locks, monitors, wait-notify mechanism, and semaphores. It also demonstrates the usage of threads and thread pools, executor frameworks, and futures to perform parallel processing tasks efficiently.
        Chapter 5: JDBC and SQL Database Access
        This chapter provides an introduction to database access using JDBC APIs and explains how to work with databases such as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc., using SQL statements and queries. It also demonstrates how to manage transactions, set up connection pooling, and handle errors gracefully.
        Chapter 6: Java Web Services
        This chapter demonstrates how to develop web services in Java using JAX-WS API. It covers defining web service endpoints, creating WSDL documents, configuring transport protocols and security mechanisms, writing message handlers and interceptors, publishing and consuming SOAP messages, and debugging issues related to web services development.
        Chapter 7: Java Messaging Service
        This chapter provides an introduction to developing messaging applications in Java using JMS API. It starts with an explanation of what is meant by messaging application and its components like message producer, message consumer, message broker, queue, topic, subscription, session, transaction, etc. Then, it demonstrates how to create JMS producers and consumers, send and receive messages, and implement message listeners.
        Chapter 8: Java Remoting
        This chapter covers Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) framework and the technologies associated with RMI such as stubs, skeletons, export and unexport objects, naming service, activation system, etc. It then discusses the advantages and limitations of RMI compared to other distributed computing frameworks such as CORBA, EJB and Spring remote invocation frameworks. Lastly, it demonstrates how to use standard Java serialization instead of XML for RMI communication if needed.
        Chapter 9: Java Logging
        This chapter explores logging frameworks available for Java, starting with Log4J, SLF4J, and custom logging implementations. It also discusses the importance of log levels, appenders, filters, rolling policy, and layout patterns. Finally, it gives examples of configuring each framework to meet specific requirements.
        Chapter 10: Java Configuration
        This chapter demonstrates the basics of Java configuration via annotations and programmatic approaches such as setting properties directly or loading them from external resources. It covers default configurations provided by Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Hibernate. It also demonstrates how to integrate Java configuration into Spring MVC controllers and repositories.
        Chapter 11: Java Internationalization and Localization
        This chapter covers internationalization and localization in Java including locale management, resource bundles, formatting dates and numbers, currency formatting, and character encoding conversions. Additionally, it discusses localizing text, managing translations, generating language dictionaries, and adding multi-language support to existing applications.
        Chapter 12: Java Security
        This chapter covers essential concepts related to security in Java such as authentication, authorization, encryption, hashing, key generation, SSL/TLS, digital signatures, and auditing. It also covers best practices for secure coding, configuring firewalls, and hardening systems against attacks.
        Chapter 13: Testing and Performance Tuning
        This chapter provides an overview of testing in Java and teaches you how to write unit tests, integration tests, load tests, functional tests, and acceptance tests. It also covers profiling tools such as Java Mission Control and JProfiler, memory analysis tools such as VisualVM and MAT, and code optimization techniques such as JIT compilation and garbage collection tuning.

        In summary, this book provides developers with all the necessary knowledge and skills required to build scalable enterprise grade Java applications using Apache Commons libraries.
