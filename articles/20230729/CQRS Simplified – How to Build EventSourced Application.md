 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is an architectural pattern that has become popular in recent years for building applications where separating reads and writes of data into separate models improves scalability and responsiveness. The separation also facilitates better testing as queries can be tested independently from commands which modify data. It’s not a new concept but rather evolved into more complex patterns such as ES/CQRS or SAGA.
          
          However, despite being well understood by developers, this pattern still remains underused due to its complexity and challenges in applying it correctly. In this article, we will explore how to build event-sourced applications using CQRS and how its principles and best practices have evolved over the past decade, enabling us to apply them effectively and efficiently to our projects. We will also discuss some lessons learned while implementing CQRS and provide practical examples to illustrate how these ideas can help you save time, reduce errors, increase quality, and make your application more maintainable.
          
          This article assumes readers are familiar with basic concepts of software development, including design patterns, programming languages, databases, and distributed systems. We won't go too deep into those topics as they would require a different article altogether. Instead, we'll focus on explaining key CQRS concepts and their benefits through real-world examples.
          
          Let's dive right in!
         # 2. Concepts & Terminology
          Before diving into the core idea behind CQRS, let’s first review some key terms and concepts that relate to it:

          Command - An instruction sent from one system to another that modifies the state of the domain model(s). Examples include creating a user account, updating a customer record, or processing a payment transaction.

          Query - A request for information sent from one system to another without modifying any state. Examples include fetching all orders placed by a specific customer or checking the balance of a bank account.

          Events - Records that represent something that happened in the system. They contain relevant information about what occurred at a particular point in time. These events are stored separately from the domain model and used to reconstruct the current state of the domain model(s).

          Event Store - A database or message queue where events related to changes to the domain model are stored. It acts like an append-only log of all the changes that have been made to the domain model.

          Aggregate Root - The root entity of the domain model that contains references to other entities. Each aggregate should correspond to a single table in the relational database so that events can be easily inserted, updated, and queried across multiple aggregates.

          Read Model - A representation of the current state of the domain model(s) generated based on the events stored in the event store. These read models can then be used for querying and reporting purposes. For example, if we want to display the total number of active users, we might query a read model that keeps track of the count of active users per day.

          Materialized View - A cached representation of the current state of the domain model(s), similar to a materialized view in a relational database. Unlike views, however, these representations update automatically whenever the corresponding domain model changes. For example, we could create a daily summary of user activity that gets updated every night based on the latest events in the event store.

          Snapshotting - Technique used to capture the current state of the domain model(s) at regular intervals. When snapshotting is enabled, only the events that occurred since the last snapshot need to be replayed to rebuild the current state. Otherwise, the entire event stream needs to be processed to get the most up-to-date state of the domain model(s). Snapshotting can significantly improve performance and reduce storage requirements when dealing with large datasets.

          Coupling between components - Refers to the degree of interdependence between various components in an application, typically represented as coupling factor. In CQRS, coupling refers to the degree to which the write side of the application interacts with both the read side and vice versa.

          Single writer principle - Principle of eventual consistency, stipulating that each component of a distributed system must eventually provide a consistent view of the same data regardless of the latency or order of messages. In CQRS, the write side must ensure that updates are reflected in the read side within a certain amount of time to avoid inconsistencies.

          Projections - Processes that consume events from the event store and transform them into a format suitable for consumption by clients. These projections may involve filtering, grouping, summarizing, or otherwise manipulating the data before delivery. In CQRS, projections enable efficient access to aggregated and pre-computed data across multiple aggregates.
          
         # 3. Core Idea Behind CQRS
          As mentioned earlier, CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It is an architectural pattern that aims to address two important concerns in modern web application architectures – scalability and responsiveness. 

          Scalability refers to the ability of the system to handle increasing demand, often measured in terms of the volume of incoming requests and responses. To scale horizontally, several instances of the application can run simultaneously, and additional resources can be added easily. To scale vertically, simply adding more powerful hardware or optimizing existing resources can achieve higher throughput and decrease response times. 

          However, scalability alone does not guarantee high availability, meaning that the system should continue functioning even if individual components fail or experiences temporary downtime. Therefore, the second concern addressed by CQRS is responsiveness, which means making sure that operations execute quickly enough to meet the needs of the users. 

          With increased demand comes increased complexity. Applications built around traditional CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) operations typically suffer from poor performance due to locking conflicts and excessive round trips between layers of the architecture. Within the context of CQRS, we move away from CRUD-based architectures by separating read and write operations into distinct models.

          Separating reads and writes into different models enables better scalability because reads do not block writes, allowing many concurrent readers to work against a single copy of the data. Additionally, queries can be executed asynchronously outside of the critical path of business transactions, further improving responsiveness.

          CQRS enforces the single writer principle by ensuring that there is only one source of truth for each piece of data, and modifications always take place via command messages. Commands are stored in a central event store alongside associated events, which are then used to update the appropriate aggregate roots. By keeping aggregates small and highly cohesive, scalability is improved overall.

          While CRUD can be effective at providing quick solutions for simple use cases, CQRS provides a robust framework for handling complex, enterprise-level domains with sophisticated requirements. Its key concepts, terminology, and principles together form the basis of successful CQRS implementations.

         # 4. Implementation Details 
          Implementing CQRS requires careful planning and attention to detail. Below are some of the steps involved in building a CQRS-based application:

          1. Choose a Domain-Driven Design approach for modeling the domain. Use bounded contexts to partition the problem space and define aggregates that encapsulate related data. Each aggregate corresponds to a single table in the relational database.
           
          2. Define commands that represent actions performed on the domain objects, typically represented as messages exchanged between components. Ensure that commands are immutable, i.e., once submitted, cannot be modified later.
           
          3. Publish commands to a message broker or message queue, where they can be received and handled by different services asynchronously. Set aside a limited set of commands that need immediate execution, usually referred to as “critical” commands.
           
          4. Write handlers for the critical commands, taking care to ensure atomicity and consistency of updates. Once the command has been successfully executed, publish a corresponding event to the event store.
           
          5. Create separate read and write databases, backed by different SQL servers or NoSQL databases, depending on the type of data. Both databases should be kept in sync using eventual consistency mechanisms.
           
          6. Implement a messaging gateway that routes messages to the appropriate handler based on their type (i.e., critical vs non-critical). All updates to the database should be done through the messaging layer to enforce consistency and prevent accidental modification of data by unauthorized actors.
           
          7. Implement asynchronous consumers that subscribe to the event store topic and process the events sequentially. Replay all the events from the beginning of time or from the last known position to catch up with any pending updates. Periodically checkpoint the progress so that crashes can resume from the correct position.
           
          8. Consume projected data from the read database, either synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the desired level of consistency. Projectors can use the state of the aggregates to generate reports or dashboards, or retrieve pre-aggregated values. Apply projections as needed, updating them periodically or upon receiving a signal from another service.
           
          9. Test thoroughly to ensure that the application functions correctly and responds quickly to user input, especially during peak hours. Monitor resource usage, identify bottlenecks, and optimize as needed.
           
          10. Continuously monitor the health of the application, identifying potential issues and adapting the solution accordingly. Regularly review logs, metrics, and traces to detect abnormal behavior and troubleshoot problems.

         # 5. Lessons Learned Over the Past Decade
          One thing that was never taught explicitly in school is that mistakes happen. Just because things seem easy doesn’t mean we shouldn’t learn from experience. Here are some lessons learned while implementing CQRS:

          1. Understand the business requirements and constraints carefully. Don’t just adopt the CQRS paradigm blindly unless it makes sense for your domain and scenario. It’s essential to understand whether moving part of your system towards CQRS will actually improve performance and reliability.
            
          2. Stay organized. Make sure your code is structured in logical modules and follow good naming conventions. You don’t want to spend days trying to figure out why your implementation isn’t working properly, and worse yet, waste hours debugging a mistake that turned out to be unrelated.
            
          3. Keep the event store clean. Avoid accumulating unnecessary events and use techniques such as batching and compaction to limit disk usage. Deleting old events helps keep the event store lightweight and reduces memory footprint.
            
          4. Know your toolbox. Different tools exist for managing CQRS-based applications, ranging from event stores and brokers to databases and projectors. Learn to navigate the landscape and choose the right tool for the job.
            
          5. Optimize for simplicity. Don’t prematurely optimize until you know exactly what your bottleneck is. Start with straightforward approaches and gradually add complexity as needed.
            
            But remember, everything is complicated. Even if you manage to implement CQRS correctly and consistently, chances are that there will still be unexpected edge cases or bugs that you didn’t foresee. So it’s important to continuously test, monitor, and refine your solution as necessary to minimize downtime and errors.
