# 1.简介
         
 In computer science, a data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data in memory or on disk. The most common data structures are arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, and hash tables. Each data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of data being stored and the operations that need to be performed on it. This article will give an introduction to each data structure and explain how they work. 
          A good understanding of data structures can help you choose the right one for your application, which makes programming easier and more efficient. Choosing the wrong data structure can cause significant performance issues, slow down code execution, and even crash your program. Therefore, knowing how each data structure works well enough to make good choices can save time and effort in software development.

        ## Array(数组)
            An array is a sequence of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by using subscripts (indices). Arrays have two primary properties:
            - Fixed size: Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed except through resizing.
            - Contiguous memory: All elements in an array are stored in a single block of contiguous memory, so accessing any element takes constant time regardless of where it is located within the array.

            For example, consider the following array:
            ```python
                int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
            ```
            Here `arr` is an integer array with five elements, `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.

        ## LinkedList(链表)
            A linked list is a linear collection of nodes whose elements contain pointers to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size, but rather grow dynamically as new elements are added. A pointer referencing the head of the list points to the first node, while other nodes refer to the previous node's location. Adding a new element at the beginning of the list requires updating all subsequent nodes' references, resulting in slower insertion than adding to the end of the array. However, traversal from the beginning to the end of a linked list takes O(n) time complexity, whereas traversing backwards from the end to the beginning takes only O(1) time.
            
            For example, here is a simple implementation of a singly-linked list in Java:
            ```java
                class Node<T> {
                    T data;
                    Node<T> next;

                    public Node(T data) {
                        this.data = data;
                        this.next = null;
                    }
                }

                class LinkedList<T> {
                    private Node<T> head;

                    // Add a new element at the beginning of the list
                    public void addFirst(T elem) {
                        Node<T> newNode = new Node<>(elem);

                        if (head == null) {
                            head = newNode;
                        } else {
                            newNode.next = head;
                            head = newNode;
                        }
                    }

                    // Print all elements in the list
                    public void printList() {
                        Node<T> current = head;

                        System.out.print("LinkedList: ");

                        while (current!= null) {
                            System.out.print(current.data + " ");
                            current = current.next;
                        }

                        System.out.println();
                    }
                }
                
                LinkedList<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();
                linkedList.addFirst(1);
                linkedList.addFirst(2);
                linkedList.addFirst(3);

                linkedList.printList();  // Output: LinkedList: 3 2 1
            ```
            
        ## Stack(栈)
            A stack is an abstract data type that stores a collection of elements in last-in, first-out order. It supports three basic operations: push, pop, and peek. Elements can be pushed onto the top of the stack, removed from the top of the stack, viewed without removing it, and checked whether it is empty or full. The last element pushed into the stack becomes the first one to be removed, making it a LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structure.

            For example, here is a simple implementation of a stack in Python:
            ```python
                class Stack:
                    def __init__(self):
                        self.stack = []
                    
                    def push(self, item):
                        self.stack.append(item)
                        
                    def pop(self):
                        return self.stack.pop()
                    
                    def peek(self):
                        return self.stack[-1]
                    
                    def isEmpty(self):
                        return len(self.stack) == 0
                
                    def size(self):
                        return len(self.stack)
            
                s = Stack()
                s.push(1)
                s.push(2)
                s.push(3)
                
                assert s.peek() == 3   # check the top element of the stack
                assert s.size() == 3    # check the number of elements in the stack
                assert not s.isEmpty()
                
                s.pop()                   # remove the top element of the stack
                
                assert s.peek() == 2
                assert s.size() == 2
                assert not s.isEmpty()
                
            ```
        
        ## Queue(队列)
            A queue is an abstract data type that maintains the order in which elements were added to it, allowing access to the front and back of the queue. New elements are inserted at the rear end (end), while removal takes place at the front end (beginning). Queues support four fundamental operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isFull/isEmpty. Enqueuing adds an element to the rear end of the queue, dequeuing removes an element from the front end, peaking lets us look at the next element without removing it, and checking whether the queue is full or empty allows us to prevent overflow or underflow errors respectively. Like stacks, queues typically use either dynamic arrays or circular buffers to store elements.

            For example, here is a simple implementation of a queue in C++:
            ```c++
                template <typename T>
                class Queue {
                  private:
                    std::deque<T> q_;

                  public:
                    bool isEmpty() const {
                        return q_.empty();
                    }

                    bool isFull() const {
                        return false;  // unlimited size
                    }

                    void enqueue(const T& x) {
                        q_.push_back(x);
                    }

                    T dequeue() {
                        auto result = q_.front();
                        q_.pop_front();
                        return result;
                    }

                    const T& peek() const {
                        return q_.front();
                    }
                };
            ```
            
        ## HashTable(哈希表)
            A hash table is a data structure that uses key-value pairs to store values associated with unique keys. Keys are mapped to indexes using a mathematical function called a hashing algorithm, which converts keys to indices in an array. When searching for a value based on a key, we compute the index for the corresponding bucket using the hashing function, then search for the value in that bucket until we find the matching key. Insertion and deletion take O(1) average case time complexity, making them very fast compared to traditional tree-based implementations. However, collisions occur when multiple keys map to the same index, leading to poor performance. To avoid collisions, we can increase the size of the array or use separate chaining techniques to handle buckets with many items.

            For example, here is a simple implementation of a hash table in Python:
            ```python
                class HashTable:
                    def __init__(self, capacity=10):
                        self.capacity = capacity
                        self.table = [None] * capacity

                    def _hash(self, key):
                        """Simple hash function"""
                        return sum([ord(char) for char in str(key)]) % self.capacity

                    def put(self, key, value):
                        hashed_key = self._hash(key)
                        self.table[hashed_key] = value

                    def get(self, key):
                        hashed_key = self._hash(key)
                        return self.table[hashed_key]

                ht = HashTable()
                ht.put('apple', 10)
                ht.put('banana', 5)
                ht.put('orange', 7)
                print(ht.get('banana'))  # output: 5
            ```
                
        ## Binary Search Tree(二叉搜索树)
            A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has a left child that contains a smaller value, and a right child that contains a larger value. We maintain the property that the root of the BST holds the minimum possible value, and every node satisfies the constraint that both its left subtree and right subtree also hold the appropriate range. In addition to these constraints, there may be additional constraints specific to certain types of problems, such as ensuring that no duplicate elements exist in the tree. Because of these constraints, performing various operations on a BST like finding maximum and minimum values, inserting a new element, and deleting an element can all take O(log n) worst-case time complexity. Since balancing and rebalancing the tree after every operation can also lead to significant overhead, some BSTs also employ algorithms such as AVL trees or red-black trees to ensure balance during insertions and deletions.
