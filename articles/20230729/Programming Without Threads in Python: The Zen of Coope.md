         ## What is Co-operative Multitasking?
         
         In co-operative multitasking, tasks are assigned to multiple threads or processes so that each thread/process works independently and cooperatively with other threads/processes without sharing resources. Co-operative multitasking enables programming models such as message passing, where messages can be sent from one task to another using shared memory, allowing parallelism and concurrency. In addition, some threading APIs like POSIX threads, Java’s threading library, and.NET's Task Parallel Library support cooperative multitasking by default. 

         One major benefit of co-operative multitasking over traditional preemptive multitasking is that it simplifies the design of concurrent systems because there is no need for synchronization primitives or locks. Instead, threads communicate through shared data structures or message passing mechanisms to share state information. Furthermore, a thread only executes when it explicitly switches into its waiting state (e.g., using blocking calls like I/O). This makes it easier to reason about concurrent programs since programmers do not have to worry about race conditions or deadlocks due to uncoordinated access to shared resources. Additionally, co-operative multitasking enables high levels of flexibility, which means developers can write more complex applications with less code and fewer interruptions caused by synchronization issues.

         However, co-operative multitasking also has some drawbacks. It requires careful thought when designing concurrent software, especially those dealing with large amounts of shared mutable state. For example, ensuring proper ordering of operations within different threads is critical to prevent race conditions or inconsistent results. Furthermore, implementing cooperative multitasking correctly can be difficult since there are many edge cases to consider. Finally, debugging multi-threaded programs can be challenging because errors and deadlocks can occur at runtime and cause unexpected behaviors that may be hard to reproduce and diagnose.

         Therefore, while co-operative multitasking offers significant benefits compared to traditional multitasking, it should not be considered a panacea and must still be used carefully in practice. To make this process simpler, we can follow a few simple rules called “The Zen of Cooperative Multitasking”. These rules help ensure that our concurrent programs are correct and easy to debug.

         
        # 2.Basic Concepts & Terms

        ## Process vs Thread

        A process is an instance of a running program that occupies a whole area of memory on the computer. Processes typically include a single thread of execution but they can also contain additional threads if needed. Each process has its own set of instructions and private data, making them isolated from other processes. On the other hand, a thread is a lightweight entity that shares the same address space as the process and represents a stream of instructions executed by the processor. Threads are designed to be independent, allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously in the same process.

        In contrast, co-operative multitasking involves assigning multiple tasks to multiple threads or processes so that their interactions with the rest of the system are controlled by the scheduler rather than being automatically managed by the operating system. Tasks cannot share memory or modify global variables directly; instead, they communicate indirectly via shared objects or shared memory regions. This approach avoids conflicts and allows greater degrees of control over the execution order of tasks.

        ## Events

        An event is a signal raised by an operation completion or error condition, indicating that something has happened. Examples of events include file read/write operations completing, timeouts, keyboard input received, etc. Events provide a way for threads to synchronize their activities and coordinate their interaction with other threads or external entities.

        ## Synchronization

        Synchronization refers to the coordination of multiple threads or processes to avoid race conditions and ensure consistency of data between threads. When two or more threads or processes interact with shared data, they must use synchronization techniques to ensure that the actions taken by these threads are ordered consistently. Common synchronization methods include semaphores, mutexes, barriers, monitors, and signals. Semaphores allow threads to temporarily block until a certain resource becomes available, whereas mutexes ensure exclusive access to shared resources. Barriers enable threads to wait for all threads to reach a specific point before continuing, and monitors implement mutual exclusion and coordination among related threads. Signals provide a way for one thread to notify other threads that an event has occurred.

        ## Deadlock

        Deadlock occurs when two or more threads or processes are blocked forever, unable to proceed because each holds a resource needed by the other(s) to continue. To avoid deadlock, all threads must regularly check whether any other thread needs the current set of held resources, release them if possible, and request new ones if necessary. If a thread repeatedly fails to obtain a resource it needs within a given time limit, then it should give up and terminate gracefully.

        ## Context Switching

        Context switching refers to the process of saving the context of the currently executing thread, changing the active thread, and loading the context of the next thread to resume execution. Context switching saves CPU cycles and ensures fairness, since each thread is guaranteed to get enough time slices to complete its work. However, too frequent context switching can lead to poor performance and increased overhead, leading to negative consequences such as starvation or livelocks.
        
        ## Producer Consumer Problem

        The producer consumer problem describes a classic concurrent programming issue involving shared resources, namely buffers, usually implemented as a queue. A producer adds elements to the buffer and waits for the consumer to remove elements from the buffer. Similarly, a consumer removes elements from the buffer and waits for the producer to add elements to the buffer. The goal is to maximize overall throughput by optimally allocating the amount of resources used to fill and empty the buffer.
