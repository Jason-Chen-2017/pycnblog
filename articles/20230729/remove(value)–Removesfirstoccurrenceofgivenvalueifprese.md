         In Python, the built-in function `list.remove()` is used to delete an item from a list based on its value. If no such value exists in the list, it raises a `ValueError` exception. However, what if we want to remove only the first occurrence of that value and not raise any exceptions? We can achieve this by using a loop and checking whether the current element is equal to the value or not before removing it. Here's how you can do it: 
         
        ```python
        def remove_first(lst, val):
            """Remove the first occurrence of 'val' from lst."""
            for i, elem in enumerate(lst):
                if elem == val:
                    del lst[i]
                    break
        ```
        
        This function takes two arguments - `lst`, which is the list where the value needs to be removed and `val`, which is the value to be removed. It uses a loop to iterate over all elements of the list and checks whether each element is equal to the given value. If yes, then it removes the current element from the list using the `del` statement and breaks out of the loop. If no matching element is found, the function simply returns without doing anything. Here are some examples of how to use this function:
        
        ```python
        >>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]
        >>> remove_first(my_list, 2)
        >>> print(my_list)
        [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]
        
        >>> another_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'banana']
        >>> remove_first(another_list, 'banana')
        >>> print(another_list)
        ['apple', 'cherry', 'banana']
        ```

        Now let's take a look at the code implementation step by step:

        1. Define a new function called `remove_first`.
        2. Take two arguments as input: `lst` (the list containing values), and `val` (the value to be removed).
        3. Use a `for` loop with `enumerate` method to traverse through all elements of the list. The `enumerate` method adds a counter variable to the iterable object so that we can access both the index and the actual element within the same loop iteration. 
        4. For each element of the list, check whether it matches the given value using an `if` condition. If there is a match, then remove the current element from the list using the `del` keyword and `break` out of the loop since we don't need to continue iterating once the element has been found. 
        5. If none of the elements in the list match the given value, return immediately without making any changes to the original list. 

        Note that we have made a few modifications compared to the standard `list.remove()` behavior because in case of multiple occurrences of the target value, our implementation will only remove the first one encountered. Also note that we didn't handle the possibility of `KeyError` being raised when trying to remove nonexistent keys from dictionaries. Therefore, this function may not work correctly if your inputs include dictionary objects. 

     
     # 2. 算法逻辑

      The basic idea behind the algorithm is simple: traverse the entire list until we find the desired value, and then remove it while keeping track of the previous node. We also keep track of the next node after the removal point so that we can update the pointers of the adjacent nodes accordingly.

      1. Initialize three variables prev_node, curr_node, and next_node to None
      2. Traverse the linked list starting from head 
      3. While traversing, keep track of the previous node (prev_node) and the current node (curr_node)
      4. If the current node's data equals the key, set flag=True, exit the loop
      5. After exiting the loop, perform following steps:
             a. Update next_node to current node's next pointer 
             b. Set prev_node's next pointer to next_node
             c. Return True if key was found, False otherwise
    
      The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).
