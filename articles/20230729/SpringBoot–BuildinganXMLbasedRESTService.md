# 1.简介
         
 Spring boot is the de facto standard for building enterprise ready Spring applications that can be easily deployed to cloud platforms like Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. In this article we will learn how to build a simple REST service using Spring Boot framework that supports both JSON and XML data formats. We also explore some advanced topics such as customizing error handling and exception handling in our application. Additionally, we will demonstrate how to integrate Swagger documentation with our project so that users can access API documentation through their browser. 
         
         Our goal here is to provide developers who are new to Spring Boot Framework with hands-on experience on developing a basic RESTful web service that supports multiple data formats (JSON/XML). By completing this tutorial, you should be able to create your own spring boot projects and get started quickly with writing clean code and high quality design patterns.

         # 2.基本概念术语说明
          Before we start with our development journey, let’s understand some of the fundamental concepts and terminology used by Spring Boot.

          ## Spring Boot
          Spring Boot is a framework developed by Pivotal and provides a simplified approach to creating stand-alone Java applications. It takes care of much of the boilerplate configuration needed to develop robust and production-grade applications. It aims at making it easy for developers to get started without having to configure complex frameworks or libraries. 

          There are two main components of Spring Boot:
          
             * **Spring Boot Starter**: A collection of “auto-configurations” that define sensible default settings for common use cases such as database connectivity, security, logging, metrics, and more. These starters allow us to add dependencies to the project without actually needing to write any additional code.
          
             * **Spring Boot Auto Configuration**: Automatic detection of relevant infrastructure properties and their application. For example, if a MongoDB instance is present, then Spring Boot automatically configures Spring Data MongoDB to work with it. This eliminates the need for manual configuration files, freeing up developer time for focusing on implementing business logic.

          
          ## RESTful APIs
          A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) defines a set of rules and constraints that determine how different software systems interact. It allows clients to send HTTP requests to a server and receive responses back in various ways. RESTful APIs typically follow certain standards and conventions for request and response structures. The most commonly used structure today is JSON which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Other popular formats include XML and YAML.

         # 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
          Now we have covered some basics about Spring Boot and RESTful APIs. Let's dive into the core algorithm behind building a RESTful web service supporting multiple data formats. Here are the steps involved:

           1. Choose a web server: We can choose from several options such as Apache Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish etc., depending upon the needs of our application.
           2. Create a new project: We can use either Spring Initializr or Maven archetype plugin to generate a new project skeleton with all required dependencies already included.
           3. Define model classes: Model classes represent objects that our application handles. They contain fields and methods that map to the data that will be transferred over the network via the API.
           4. Write controllers: Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and respond appropriately. They are responsible for validating input parameters, calling services, mapping returned values to appropriate representations, and returning HTTP responses.
           5. Configure HTTP message converters: Message converters convert between the internal representation of our models and the format that is sent over the wire. They enable our controllers to return models in different formats while still following the same API contract.
           6. Test the controller: Finally, we need to test our controller endpoints to ensure they are working correctly. We can do this by simulating client requests and verifying the output received.

          To support multiple data formats, we can implement separate controllers for each type of format and register them within the same parent context. Each controller would only process requests for its respective content type. To achieve this, we can use the @RestController annotation instead of @Controller, which enables us to return ResponseEntity objects containing the appropriate media type headers. We can also configure Jackson ObjectMapper to serialize/deserialize objects accordingly.

        # 4.具体代码实例及解释说明
        In the previous step, we discussed how to build a RESTful web service using Spring Boot framework that supports both JSON and XML data formats. Now, let’s see how to customize error handling and exception handling in our application. 
       
        Error Handling in Spring Boot
        
        Spring Boot has built-in support for customizable error handling using exceptions and handlers. When an exception occurs in our application, it triggers the registered handler to produce a corresponding HTTP response. One way to customize error messages is to override the predefined templates provided by Spring Boot. 
        
        Firstly, we need to define our own exception hierarchy where specific types of exceptions extend specific base classes. For example, we might define an ApplicationException class that extends RuntimeException, and all other exceptions defined by our application extend this class. 
            
        Secondly, we can define an Exception Handler Method in our Controller to catch these exceptions and transform them into customized error messages in a consistent manner. For example:
            
            @ExceptionHandler(ApplicationException.class)
            public ResponseEntity<Object> handleApplicationException(ApplicationException ex) {
                Map<String, String> errors = Collections.singletonMap("error", ex.getMessage());
                return ResponseEntity
                       .status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                       .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                       .body(errors);
            }
        
        Customized Logging in Spring Boot
        
        Spring Boot uses Logback library for logging purposes. We can customize log levels and formatting using external configurations or programmatically using Logger APIs. 
        
        Example Usage:
            
            private final static Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class);
            
            //...
            
            LOGGER.info("Starting MyService");
            
            try {
                // perform service operation
                
                // throw custom exception
                throw new ApplicationException("Something went wrong!");
            } catch (ApplicationException e) {
                LOGGER.error("Failed to execute service operation!", e);
                
                // rethrow exception to propagate error details to caller
                throw e;
            } finally {
                LOGGER.info("Stopping MyService");
            }
        
        Implementing Swagger Documentation in Spring Boot
        
        Swagger is a tool for describing and documenting RESTful APIs. It generates interactive documentation that helps users to consume and integrate with our services. With Spring Boot, we can easily add Swagger support by adding a few dependencies and annotating our controllers with @Api annotations. For example:
            
            @GetMapping("/hello")
            @ApiOperation(value = "Greetings", notes = "Provides greeting message.")
            public String sayHello() {
                return "Hello World";
            }
        
        Once our app is running, we can access Swagger UI by navigating to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/. You can view all the available resources and operations along with their descriptions and sample requests.
