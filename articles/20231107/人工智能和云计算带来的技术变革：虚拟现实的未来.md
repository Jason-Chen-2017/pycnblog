# 1.背景介绍


虚拟现实（VR）、增强现实（AR）和可穿戴设备（wearable devices），这些都是近年来热门的话题。过去几年间，由于消费者对虚拟现实的需求激增，越来越多的人开始关注VR产业链的变革。

VR、AR和wearable devices三者之间的关系是什么？它们各自的应用场景有哪些？相互之间有哪些联系和区别？如何应对当下VR/AR产业的变革？

虚拟现实（VR）：Virtual Reality (VR) 虚拟现实或简称VR，指通过计算机生成一个虚拟的、真实世界的环境，让用户在这个虚拟世界中自由行动、旅行、探索、娱乐、学习、创作等，具有高度沉浸感的虚拟世界。VR通常呈现的是全息影像。主要产品有HTC Vive、Oculus Rift和Microsoft Hololens等。

增强现实（AR）：Augmented Reality (AR) 增强现实，也称为“透视显示”，是一种将虚拟物体添加到现实世界中的技术。通过图像识别、机器学习、信号处理等技术，实现智能地融合虚拟物体与现实世界，并提供真实感的增强现实体验。主要产品有Facebook ARKit、Google VR、Apple ARKit等。

可穿戴设备（Wearable Devices）：Wearable Devices 可穿戴设备也被称为智能手环或智能手表。它可以帮助人们在不离开手机或电脑的情况下进行日常运动跟踪管理。主要产品有 Fitbit、Garmin、Jawbone Up、Mi Band等。

这些技术都源于人工智能（AI）和云计算的革命性进步，它们结合了计算机图形学、计算机视觉、机器学习、生物医学等科技领域的最新研究成果。它们各有侧重，用于不同的应用场景，但是共同的驱动力是建立更富有沉浸感、真实感的虚拟及增强现实体验。

如何应对当下VR/AR产业的变革？这是一个重要的问题。从产业角度来看，VR/AR平台市场已经成为主流，其规模正在急速扩张，但仍然存在供需双方的矛盾。如果要持续推进产业的进步和发展，就必须要平衡平台和服务的布局，适时调整策略，促进创新，协调布局，避免产业陷阱。另外，还需要注重研发和投资，提升产品水平，降低成本，通过结构性补贴等方式，在保障效益的同时，减少企业与消费者的纠纷。在这种情况下，新的产业结构可能会出现，VR、AR领域会成为一个重要的领军者。那么，这究竟是好是坏？未来的发展方向又是怎样的呢？
# 2.核心概念与联系
## 2.1 基础知识
虚拟现实
- Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that allows users to create an immersive virtual environment that feels like one's physical environment by using computer graphics and simulations. It typically uses high-definition (HDR) or binocular vision to capture and display realistic visuals in stereoscopic mode for the user. The term "virtual" refers to the fact that objects appear as if they are real but can be interacted with through digital means only. Users have complete freedom of movement within this virtual environment including teleportation and navigation. There are currently several VR platforms available, ranging from the HTC Vive Pro system, Oculus Rift S, Microsoft Mixed Reality headsets, and Google Daydream. They offer various applications such as entertainment, gaming, education, training, simulation, rehabilitation, healthcare, and socializing.
- AR: Augmented reality (AR) involves overlaying virtual objects on top of real world scenes using smartphone camera feed and sensors. The real-world surroundings become part of the virtual environment, giving it a holographic appearance and allowing users to interact with them through their own senses. Currently, there are two main types of augmented reality technologies - Markerless Augmented Reality (MAR) and Marker-based Augmented Reality (MAR). Both work by capturing images from the real world and processing these images using image recognition algorithms. However, MAR relies on specialized hardware called markers which are tracked by dedicated hardware components and used to determine position, orientation, and scale of virtual objects placed over the scene. On the other hand, markerless approaches use traditional video-tracking techniques instead of markers to identify and track virtual objects in the real world. There are several companies developing AR solutions, including Facebook's Meta Studio, Apple's ARKit framework, and Google's ARCore platform. In general, AR brings enhanced realism to ordinary everyday tasks by simulating an entirely new world inside the palm of your hands.
- Wearable devices: A wearable device is any electronic device designed to fit around the body or worn on the skin to provide personalized functionality. One example of such devices is the Apple Watch, which measures heart rate, sleep quality, activity level, blood oxygen levels, and provides notifications, reminders, alarms, fitness tracker, exercise routines, and health insights. These devices utilize biometric sensors, motion detection systems, and data communication protocols to provide accurate information and guidance to consumers. Various wearable devices based on AI and cloud computing technologies such as Fitbit, Garmin, Jawbone Up, Mi Band, etc., aim at providing convenient access to mobile phone capabilities while also promoting healthy lifestyle habits and preventing diseases. Some examples include Smartwatches, Bracelets, Gym Equipment, Digital Fitness Trackers, etc. With the rise of IoT connectivity, smart wearables will help individuals stay connected and engaged with their daily lives, making virtual reality more accessible than ever before.
