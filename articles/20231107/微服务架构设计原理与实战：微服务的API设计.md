# 1.背景介绍


Microservices architectural design and practical application of API design for microservices architecture has become a hot topic in recent years. Many engineers have learned the importance of developing APIs between different services, but still few understand the best practices to develop RESTful or gRPC APIs with ease. This article aims to provide knowledge on how to develop effective RESTful or gRPC APIs for microservices architecture by covering the following topics:

1. RESTful vs gRPC 
2. Best practices for API design 
3. Design principles for building APIs 
4. Examples of OpenAPI specification
5. Implementation using Spring Boot
# 2.核心概念与联系
## 2.1 RESTful 和 gRPC
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used when creating web services. It allows clients to interact with resources through HTTP requests. There are several ways to implement REST, including Representational state transfer over HTTP, Representational state transfer over HTTPS, Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Similarly, gRPC is another protocol built on top of HTTP/2 that provides high-performance, bidirectional communication between client and server applications. Both protocols offer advantages such as simplicity, scalability, and interoperability. However, there are also differences between them, mainly due to their respective focus areas and use cases. The main difference between REST and gRPC is the way they handle request and response messages, which we will discuss later. Additionally, both protocols can be used within microservices architectures, while some may find gRPC more suitable for certain scenarios. Nonetheless, RESTful is still dominant in enterprise development and educational institutions due to its simpler syntax and easier learning curve. Therefore, it makes sense to start with understanding what each protocol offers before moving towards specific implementation details.
## 2.2 RESTful 风格及最佳实践
### 2.2.1 URI
The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) specifies a resource location by specifying its scheme, host, port number, path, query parameters, fragment identifier, etc. A good practice to follow when designing RESTful APIs is to keep URIs simple and consistent. For example, instead of having separate endpoints for fetching all users, one for getting user information based on ID, and another endpoint for updating user information, you should have just two GET endpoints for /users and PUT endpoint for /users/{id}. This reduces complexity and improves consistency across your API. Another recommendation is to avoid plurals in resource names as this adds unnecessary complexity. Instead, you could use singular nouns like /user or /customer.
### 2.2.2 HATEOAS
Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS) is a constraint in RESTful systems that allows clients to discover related resources without prior knowledge of the service's interface. In other words, if an API returns a response containing hyperlinks, clients don't need to hardcode URLs in order to navigate through the system. Instead, these links can be discovered dynamically by sending additional requests to the API. To make your APIs fully HATEOAS compliant, ensure that every response includes hyperlinks for navigating throughout the API.
### 2.2.3 状态码
HTTP status codes indicate the outcome of various operations performed on the API. You should always return appropriate status codes for different situations. Here are some common ones you might encounter:

1. 200 OK - Request was successful
2. 201 Created - New resource created successfully
3. 204 No Content - Empty response, usually after deleting a resource
4. 400 Bad Request - Invalid request format
5. 401 Unauthorized - Authentication required
6. 403 Forbidden - Permission denied
7. 404 Not Found - Resource not found
8. 409 Conflict - Request conflicts with current state of the resource
9. 500 Internal Server Error - Unexpected error occurred
You can read about the meaning of each code in detail on the Internet.
### 2.2.4 查询参数
Query parameters allow clients to filter results according to specific criteria. They are commonly used to paginate results, sort data, and search for particular resources. You should carefully consider what kind of queries clients might want to perform and include support for those queries where possible. Avoid adding too many filters at once, as it can slow down performance. Consider using pagination to reduce load on the server and improve responsiveness. Keep the size of responses small so that they don't overload the network. Finally, remember to validate input values to prevent injection attacks and enforce security policies.
### 2.2.5 请求方法
HTTP defines various methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. When designing a RESTful API, you should choose the most appropriate method for each operation depending on the desired effect. Common HTTP methods include POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE. Here are some general rules of thumb for choosing the right method:

1. Use POST for creating new resources since it does not require a previous existence of the resource.
2. Use GET for retrieving individual or multiple resources, especially when only a subset of properties is needed.
3. Use PUT for replacing existing resources. It requires the full representation of the resource being updated.
4. Use PATCH for modifying partial representations of existing resources.
5. Use DELETE for removing resources from the database permanently.
By following these rules, you can create efficient and intuitive APIs that support complex functionality with ease.
## 2.3 gRPC 的优势
gRPC stands for Google Remote Procedure Call, which is a remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It uses protocol buffers, a language-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data, to define interfaces and messages. Unlike traditional RPC frameworks like SOAP or REST, gRPC is designed primarily for efficient connections between microservices and supports bi-directional streaming. Furthermore, it is supported by modern programming languages and platforms like Java, Go, Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, and C++. By leveraging features such as protobuffers, gRPC eliminates the need for manual serialization and deserialization of data, reducing errors and improving overall efficiency. Overall, gRPC offers significant benefits compared to traditional RPC frameworks like REST or SOAP, especially for microservice architectures with large numbers of services communicating with each other.
## 2.4 服务发现
One of the key challenges faced in implementing microservices architectures is ensuring that services can locate and communicate with each other during runtime. Service discovery plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. It involves finding and monitoring available instances of a given service, and routing incoming requests to those instances. There are several ways to achieve service discovery, ranging from configuring static IP addresses to dynamic DNS lookups. Choosing the right approach depends on factors such as latency requirements, scalability, and availability guarantees. In addition to service discovery, you should also consider authentication, authorization, logging, and tracing to monitor and troubleshoot the system.
