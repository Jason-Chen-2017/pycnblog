Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to their ability to capture local patterns within sequences of words or sentences and learn abstract features that can be used later on for classification purposes. Although CNNs have become the state-of-the-art model architecture for NLP tasks, they still lag behind Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This article explores why this is the case and discusses some key differences between these two models, including sequence length, word order information, semantic meaning, and representation learning capabilities. 

In this article, we will explore several reasons why CNNs work better than RNNs as an NLP model architecture:

1. Sequence Length Matters
2. Word Order Information Doesn't MATTER 
3. Semantic Meaning MATTERS!
4. Representation Learning CAPABILITY!!

Let's dive into each one of them in detail.<|im_sep|>
 


# 2.Sequence Length Matters
In a typical recurrent neural network (RNN), all elements from time step t-1 are passed through the network at once along with element x_t at time step t. As a result, the entire input sequence has to be processed sequentially before it reaches its final output. However, if the number of tokens in our input sequence is very long, then passing the entire sequence through the network at once may not be feasible. Therefore, it becomes important to segment our sequence into smaller subsequences so that different parts of it can be processed independently by the network. In other words, using convolutional layers instead of traditional fully connected layers helps us avoid issues related to long sequences because they allow us to process individual segments of the sequence separately. 


 

 



# 3.Word Order Information doesn’t matter 
Recurrent neural networks handle sequential data such as text by keeping track of hidden states at each time step. The order in which the words occur does not affect the output generated by the network. For example, consider the following sentence: "I love you" and assume that there is no relation between 'love' and 'you'. If 'you' occurs after 'love', the order in which they appear does not impact the final sentiment conveyed in the sentence. Similarly, if a word is repeated multiple times in a sentence, its position relative to the rest of the sentence also does not matter. So why do RNNs struggle when dealing with longer sequences where word ordering matters more than in shorter ones? One reason could be that RNNs rely too much on their past hidden states to make predictions about future inputs, but CNNs use spatial information to identify patterns in both past and future sequences without relying on prior knowledge. It makes sense since taking into account the order of words can lead to ambiguities and incorrect interpretations. Let's take an illustrative example to explain what I mean. Consider the following analogy: Imagine you want to predict whether today is a weekday or weekend based only on today's weather forecast. Is it possible to tell the difference between Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday solely based on the date alone? The answer is NO, even though many people recognize the pattern between these days and the way they change throughout the year. This is because every day represents a unique combination of sunrise, sunset, moon phase, temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc., making it impossible to separate them without additional contextual information like historical weather records or culture. On the other hand, if we use a CNN-based approach, we can apply filters or feature maps over the image to extract relevant features that represent the general shape and colors of the sky, giving rise to patterns that can help us classify the weather as either weekday or weekend.<|im_sep|>
