机器翻译（MT）作为现代nlp中的一个重要子领域，主要任务是将一种语言的语句翻译成另一种语言的语句。而MT系统中的很多问题都可以归结于低资源场景下的学习问题。对于低资源场景下MT模型训练的问题，一种主流的方法是利用相关领域的高质量数据进行知识迁移学习（transfer learning），即借助高质量的数据训练源语言到目标语言的单词表示、句子编码等模块，然后在缺少足够训练数据的条件下对低资源语言的MT系统进行适配。通过这种方法，可以提升低资源场景下MT性能，降低训练成本，加快模型应用效率。

在本文中，作者研究了基于跨语言适配(CLa)的方法，主要关注低资源语言(Low Resource Languages, LRL)中低资源数据的集成学习方法能否有效提升LRL MT性能。本文首先阐述了CLa方法的相关理论，包括LRL-specific transfer learning、pre-training方法及其后处理阶段、LRL data augmentation方法及其影响因素、不同MT框架之间的差异等。接着，作者通过实验验证了CLa方法在几个LRL MT任务上的有效性。最后，作者从多方面总结了CLa方法在LRL MT性能提升上的优点和局限性，并给出了可行的未来方向。

## 2.2 Low Resource Languages
Low resource languages (LRL) refers to the limited availability of training examples for natural language processing tasks like Machine Translation or Text Summarization in specific languages such as African Languages, South Asian Languages, etc., which hinders their application by traditional machine translation approaches based on monolingual corpora. In order to overcome this issue, we can use CLa approach that involves transfer learning from high quality source languages trained on related domains with available resources. This helps us improve the accuracy of models across various LRLs and also reduces the computational cost required to train them. Another aspect of LRL is their diversity in terms of dialectal variations and cultural practices making it challenging to build reliable systems that work well on all of these varieties.

## 3.1 方法概览
Transfer Learning is a popular technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where pre-trained word embeddings are fine-tuned on target domain data to perform better on certain tasks. Similarly, we can extend this methodology to include knowledge transfer between low-resource languages using transfer learning algorithms called Cross-Lingual Adaptation (CLa). We do this by pre-training the model on related domains (high quality monolingual data), aligning the vocabularies of the two languages, adapting the language-dependent components of the model such as embedding layers, hidden states, etc., and then fine-tuning the model on low-resource data. This way, we learn a good representation of both languages without relying solely on the presence of parallel sentences. The below figure provides an overview of how CLa works.


In CLa, we first pretrain our model on high quality monolingual data in the related domain. Then, we extract representations of words in both languages by aligning their vocabulary. Next, we adapt the language dependent components of the model separately and concatenate them to form a single output layer. Finally, we fine-tune the adapted model on low-resource data to obtain the best results. Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. Pre-Training Phase: Here, we first train our model on large amounts of parallel text obtained from different sources. We freeze the weights of the embedding layers during this process and only train the language independent parts of the model. For example, we can use GPT-2 architecture for this purpose.

2. Vocabulary Alignment: Once the model is trained, we align its vocabularies using tokenizers or other tools. This ensures that each word has a unique index in the input and output layers of the model. After alignment, there may be some out-of-vocabulary words present in one or both languages. These can either be masked out or replaced by special tokens depending on the choice of tokenizer. 

3. Model Adaptation: In this phase, we modify the language dependent part of the model to account for the differences in both languages. This involves changing the number of units in the embedding layer, adjusting attention mechanisms, and any other hyperparameters that depend on the structure of the model itself. To ensure fair comparison between multiple models, we should try to make the modifications uniform and reproducible among all models.  

4. Fine-Tuning Phase: Finally, we fine-tune the adapted model on low-resource data to see if we get improved results than just using monolingual models. During finetuning, we update the weights of the network but keep the weights of the embedding layer frozen. It is important to note that finetuning may require careful parameter selection to avoid overfitting or underfitting.  

5. Post-Processing: Some methods incorporate post-processing steps after the model is fine-tuned. These typically involve techniques such as backtranslation, pseudo-labeling, or denoising autoencoders.  

Some key ideas behind CLa:

1. Knowledge Transfer from Related Domains: Our main goal is to learn a good representation of both languages without relying solely on the presence of parallel sentences. Therefore, we pre-train the model on related domains with available resources, rather than attempting to create new high quality datasets ourselves.

2. Shared Input Output Layers: Since we have aligned the vocabularies of both languages, we can now share the input and output layers of the model. This enables us to treat each language independently when generating translations. 

3. Adaptable Language Components: Although most state-of-the-art models are built to handle many types of inputs and outputs, we need to tailor them to the characteristics of individual languages. By adapting the language dependent components of the model separately, we can achieve more efficient use of resources while ensuring that they are working effectively together.

4. Finetuning for Improved Performance: Ultimately, we want to evaluate our final model on low-resource data and compare it against other monolingual baseline models to determine if it performs better or worse. Thus, we must fine-tune the adapted model on low-resource data to obtain meaningful comparisons. If it performs poorly, we may need to revisit the choices made during the adaptation stage or consider alternate adaptations.   

Overall, CLa promises significant improvements in low-resource MT performance because it learns a shared representation of words across different languages without requiring parallel data and thus allows for effective transfer of information across languages. Moreover, its flexible and adaptive nature makes it suitable for handling diverse linguistic variations and cultures and is especially useful for building accurate multilingual models.

## 3.2 Aligning Vocabularies
Before proceeding with CLa, we first need to align the vocabularies of the two languages so that we can pass input sequences that contain words not seen before into the model. There are several ways to do this including character n-grams, subword representations, and sentence encodings. However, we will focus on methods that align the entire vocabulary at once since it offers the highest flexibility and requires the least amount of computation. Additionally, we can use the aligned vocabulary as the basis for further refinement of the language dependent components of the model. Below are some of the common vocabulary alignment strategies:

1. Character n-gram alignment: One simple strategy is to take all possible character combinations in the source and target languages and assign each combination a unique id in the corresponding language's vocabulary. Alternatively, we could also use a fixed-size character encoder to produce dense vectors representing each character sequence, and then feed those into the transformer.

2. Subword segmentation and encoding: Another option is to use subword segmentation schemes such as byte pair encoding (BPE) to segment words into smaller units. Each unit corresponds to a unique vector in the vocabulary. WordPiece is another widely used algorithm that achieves similar benefits while also reducing the risk of rare words being assigned the same vector.

3. Sentence Encodings: An alternative to directly aligning the entire vocabulary is to encode the full context of each sentence as a vector using a transformer-based encoder. This approach captures syntactic and semantic information about the meaning of each word within the sentence, enabling us to capture local relationships between words even when they don't appear in parallel pairs. Note that this approach may still require careful alignment due to varying degrees of lexical overlap between languages.

Once the vocabularies are aligned, we can apply the above-mentioned transformations to the language dependent components of the model. This involves changing the size of the input and output layers, changing the type of attention mechanism used, modifying the positional encoding, adding regularization techniques, or simply experimenting with different architectures.

## 3.3 Embedding Layer Adjustments
One critical component of the language dependent components of the model is the embedding layer. Because we are sharing the input and output layers, we need to make sure that they have the same dimensionality. However, different languages might have vastly different word usage statistics, resulting in different numbers of dimensions needed to represent each word. Therefore, we cannot simply adjust the dimensionality of the embedding layer alone. Instead, we need to come up with a scheme that balances the tradeoff between compression and generalization power. Common techniques include scaling the embedding matrix, replacing top-k frequent words with random vectors, and using multiple embedding matrices with different dimensions for different parts of the model. Of course, tuning these parameters can be quite time consuming, and finding the right balance requires a lot of empirical trial and error.

## 3.4 Attention Mechanisms
Attention mechanisms play a crucial role in capturing long-range dependencies in the input and output sequences. While standard transformers utilize multi-head attention, some variants use relative position encoding or convolutional filters to capture non-local interactions. CLa relies heavily on attention mechanisms to allow for transfer of information across languages. Specifically, we rely on dot-product attention and linear projections to allow each head to attend to different parts of the input sequence and generate appropriate output. However, the range of attention mechanisms supported by modern transformers can vary, necessitating careful consideration of the particular design choices made.

## 3.5 Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques help prevent the model from overfitting to the training data and promote its ability to generalize to unseen data. Several common regularization techniques include dropout, weight decay, label smoothing, and batch normalization. Dropout randomly drops out some fraction of neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation of neurons, which can cause instability in the model. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages small weights, leading to sparsity and easier convergence. Label smoothing replaces true labels with a softened version of the original ones, giving the model a slight preference for predicting the expected distribution instead of always choosing the mode. Batch normalization normalizes the inputs of each batch to zero mean and unit variance, allowing faster convergence and stabilizing the model. All of these techniques can greatly affect the robustness and stability of the model, especially when dealing with low-resource scenarios.

## 3.6 Alternative Training Approaches
There are many alternative approaches to training models on low-resource settings, ranging from active learning to self-supervised learning. However, all of these methods assume that we have access to sufficient labeled data in addition to the raw text. Without this, we would need to use pretext tasks or weak supervision to supplement the training data.
