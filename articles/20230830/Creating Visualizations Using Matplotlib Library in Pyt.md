# 1.简介
  

Matplotlib is a popular python library used for creating various kinds of visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts and histograms. It can be considered one of the most powerful libraries available for data visualization and it has been around since the beginning of time. In this article, we will learn how to use matplotlib library in python to create different types of visualizations like Line Plots, Bar Charts, Histograms, Scatter Plots, etc.

Matplotlib provides several ways to customize your graphs. You can change font sizes, colors, legends, tick mark lengths and labels, add titles, adjust margins, hide or show grid lines, control plot size and aspect ratio, and many more customizable parameters. 

In this article, we are going to cover all these aspects including basic concepts of graphics, algorithms, and code examples. We hope that you find this article helpful in learning and using Matplotlib library effectively in your work. Also, feel free to suggest any changes or corrections if required. 
# 2.基本概念和术语介绍
Before diving into the technical details of creating visualizations with Matplotlib library, let's first understand some important terms and terminologies related to plotting. 

## 2.1. Graphics
A graphic consists of graphical elements that make up an image, chart, diagram or other representation of data. Graphic elements include shapes, lines, symbols, text, color, images, and animation effects.

For example, the following are common graphics:

1. Bar graph: A vertical or horizontal bar graph shows comparisons between categories or variables, usually represented by heights or widths of bars, respectively. 

2. Line chart: A line chart displays information about a trend over time through connecting individual data points together with straight lines. 

3. Histogram: A histogram represents a distribution of numerical data by displaying counts of observations divided into bins or intervals. 

4. Pie chart: A pie chart presents data as slices of a circle, where each slice represents a proportionate percentage of the whole. 

5. Scatter plot: A scatter plot shows patterns among two-dimensional data sets by showing the relationship between variables as dots placed on a scatterplot matrix.

## 2.2. Axes and Figure objects
The main components of Matplotlib library are the axes and figure objects. An axis object corresponds to one dimension of the chart (x-axis or y-axis), while a figure object contains multiple subplots arranged in a grid layout. The figure object also includes metadata such as title, xlabel, ylabel, and legend.

## 2.3. Data and Plotting Functions
Matplotlib library provides functions for plotting different types of graphics based on their type, i.e., bar(), hist(), plot() for line plots, scatter() for scatter plots, etc. These functions accept input data as arguments and draw corresponding graphics on the current active figure and/or axes. 

Some commonly used plotting function arguments include:

1. `x` and `y`: For line and scatter plots, these arguments represent the abscissa and ordinate values of the data points.

2. `bins`, `range`, and `density`: For histograms, these arguments specify the number of bins, range of bin values, and whether to display probability density instead of counts.

3. `color` and `marker`: For both line and scatter plots, these arguments set the colors and markers of the data points.

We will now proceed to explain the core algorithms and operations involved in creating visualizations using Matplotlib library. 

# 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
Now that we have gone through the basics of Matplotlib library, we can move further towards understanding its core algorithms and operations involved in creating different types of visualizations. Let's start with creating simple line plots. 

## 3.1. Basic Line Plots
To create a basic line plot, you need to pass the x and y coordinates of your data points as arrays and then call the plot() method from the pyplot module. Here's an example code snippet demonstrating this approach:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
x = np.arange(10)
y = x ** 2

# Create a new figure and axes object
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add the data points to the plot
ax.plot(x, y)

# Set the title and label of the x and y axes
ax.set_title("Sample Line Plot")
ax.set_xlabel("X Values")
ax.set_ylabel("Y Values")

plt.show()
```

This code generates a simple square root curve and adds it to a blank canvas. Note that the `np.arange()` function creates an array of evenly spaced numbers starting from zero up to n-1, which we assign to the variable `x`. Then we compute the square of `x` using the exponent operator `**` and assign it to the variable `y`. Finally, we create a new figure (`fig`) and axes object (`ax`) using the `subplots()` function provided by the `matplotlib.pyplot` module. Next, we add our data points to the plot using the `plot()` method of the axes object and finally set the title, x-axis label, and y-axis label using the respective methods of the axes object. We then render the plot using the `show()` function and get a basic line plot.  

Here's what the resulting plot looks like:


You can play around with changing the values of the `x` and `y` arrays to generate different curves. 

## 3.2. Customizing Line Plots
Customization refers to changing certain properties of a plotted graph to suit specific needs. Matplotlib allows us to modify almost every property of the plot, ranging from font sizes, colors, linestyles, marker styles, alpha levels, and much more. To customize the appearance of the line plot, we can use the following steps:

1. Modify the title, xlabel, and ylabel of the plot using the `set_title()`, `set_xlabel()`, and `set_ylabel()` methods.
2. Change the color and style of the plot using the `c` and `ls` keyword arguments of the `plot()` method.
3. Adjust the width and length of the plot lines using the `linewidth` and `markersize` keywords of the `plot()` method.
4. Turn off the frame, ticks, and gridlines using the `frameon`, `ticks`, and `grid` keyword arguments of the `axis()` method.
5. Hide the x and y ticklabels using the `tick_params()` method with `which='both'` argument and `bottom=False` and `left=False` keyword arguments.

Let's see an example code snippet that demonstrates these modifications:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
x = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 256)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a new figure and axes object
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add the data points to the plot
line, = ax.plot(x, y, c='#FF0000', ls='--', linewidth=2, markersize=7)

# Set the title and label of the x and y axes
ax.set_title("Sine Wave", fontsize=20)
ax.set_xlabel('Angle [rad]', fontsize=16)
ax.set_ylabel('Amplitude', fontsize=16)

# Remove unnecessary frames, ticks, and gridlines
ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
ax.get_xaxis().tick_bottom()
ax.get_yaxis().tick_left()
ax.tick_params(axis='both', which='major', labelsize=14)
ax.tick_params(axis='both', which='minor', labelsize=14)
ax.grid(linestyle="--", color="#FFFFFF", alpha=.3)

# Hide the x and y ticklabels
ax.tick_params(axis='both', which='both', bottom=False, left=False)

plt.show()
```

In this example, we generate a sine wave using the `np.linspace()` function and apply some customization techniques to turn the background white, remove unnecessary elements, and give the plot a clean look. Specifically, we changed the color of the line to red, made the linestyle dashed, increased the width of the line to 2pt, and adjusted the size of the markers to 7pt. We removed the top and right borders of the plot using the `spines[]` attribute and moved the minor ticks inside the plot area using the `tick_params()` method. We hid the x and y ticklabels by setting the `bottom` and `left` arguments to False. We also customized the fonts of the labels using the `fontsize` parameter of the `set_*()` methods.
