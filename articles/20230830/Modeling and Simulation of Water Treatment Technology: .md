The development and evaluation of a literature review is one of the most critical parts in developing water treatment technologies. It helps to identify relevant research papers that can provide new insights into technology designs, processes, and outcomes. However, there are many challenges associated with conducting such reviews as they require careful curation of the existing literature sources and data management for reproducibility purposes.

In this article, we will present an approach towards conducting a model-based systematic literature review (MBSLR) on modeling and simulation of water treatment technologies. We will first discuss what MBSLR is and why it is essential in evaluating the state-of-the-art techniques in various fields related to water treatment. Next, we will give a general overview of the required steps involved in conducting a successful MBSLR and how these steps can be executed using tools such as Open Science Framework (OSF), Google Scholar, Wikipedia, and Academic PhraseBank. Finally, we will provide several examples from real world applications and case studies where the review has been performed successfully. 

This article aims at providing guidance to those who want to start or continue their effort towards conducting a comprehensive MBSLR on water treatment technologies. This process may involve multiple collaborators across different disciplines and technical areas. By following some established guidelines and best practices, reviewers can ensure the high quality, consistency, and thoroughness of the resulting report. In conclusion, our aim is to inspire other researchers and practitioners to consider applying a structured format to conduct effective reviews of scientific literature, which can help them gain valuable insights into complex problems and advance the field of water treatment technology more effectively.

# 2.Literature Review Overview
## 2.1 Introduction to Modeling and Simulation Techniques in Water Treatment
Water treatment technologies play a crucial role in ensuring a sustainable environment for humanity. As per United Nations’ World Health Organization, around half of the global population suffers from diseases caused by untreated wastewater, which accounts for about three billion people globally each year. While maintaining ecosystems and flood prevention is paramount, proper application of water treatment systems plays a significant role in reducing pollution levels and improving overall health. Therefore, efficient and accurate predictive models need to be developed and applied to accurately evaluate the performance of these systems. There have been numerous attempts made to develop mathematical models for assessing the effectiveness of various water treatment technologies. Despite the successes achieved through modelling, several factors remain to be addressed before achieving reliable predictions. These include technological uncertainty, economic constraints, social factors, implementation complexity, political and cultural influences, and cultural changes. To address these issues, we rely heavily on empirical studies and expert opinions from various stakeholders. Empirical research enables us to identify shortcomings in current approaches and suggest alternative strategies that could lead to better solutions. 
As part of its mission, UNESCO compiles a body of knowledge called “Universal Technical Standards” for assessing the progress and impact of international standards in water management. One of the key aspects of UTS is to establish a framework for assessing the ability of any technology to manage water efficiently and effectively. Accordingly, the main objective of the UTS for water treatment includes: 

1. Identify and document the objectives and principles guiding its development
2. Establish criteria for evaluating its performance and interrelationships between different components 
3. Evaluate its ability to deliver beneficial effects while meeting efficiency requirements
4. Ensure its suitability for use in different contexts and climates

To develop a robust model for managing water efficiently and effectively, a multi-layered approach should be followed. At the highest level, we focus on addressing basic needs like sanitation, hygiene, and soil moisture, and then move down to individual technologies like filters, pumps, tanks, etc., that operate within specific physiology and chemistry regimes. Each layer provides feedback to the next lower layer enabling us to create a holistic picture of the complete water cycle and optimize energy usage. Our goal is to achieve efficient and effective decision making by taking into account the uncertainties and limitations associated with the technology. Additionally, we also need to explore methods for incorporating socioeconomic and environmental factors into our analysis. Understanding the interactions among various stakeholders and communities is crucial to enable us to make informed decisions. 

## 2.2 Types of Models Used in Water Treatment Management
Models used in water treatment management fall under two broad categories, i.e., qualitative and quantitative models. Qualitative models take into account the physical and chemical characteristics of the water while quantitative models use mathematical equations to estimate the flow rate, mass, or volume of contaminants that enter or leave the water column. The latter category consists of six major types of models, namely mathematical, statistical, computational, rule-based, behavioral, and neural network based models. 

Mathematical models employ simple mathematical formulae derived from fundamental principles of physics and chemistry to calculate the movement of contaminants along the water column. They offer a simplified view of the system without considering variations due to external inputs like temperature, wind speed, rainfall, and irrigation. Statistical models utilize probability distributions to simulate the occurrence of events like pipe burst, leaks, flooding, snowmelt, etc. Computational models generate time series simulations that capture the spatial and temporal patterns of water flows. Rule-based models determine the action to be taken according to predefined rules based on the current status of the system. Behavioral models mimic the response of humans to situations involving natural and manmade agents and their interaction with the environment. Neural networks are flexible models that learn from historical data and adjust their behavior accordingly. 

Models need to be validated against observations collected during real-world scenarios to ensure their reliability. The results obtained from these models can further be used to optimize the operation of the system, particularly when it comes to dealing with adverse conditions like floods, droughts, extreme weather events, or urban floods. Although models are central in understanding and optimizing water resources, they cannot replace human oversight. Governments must work closely with experts in water management to promote safety measures and policies that are consistent with the science.

## 2.3 Types of Simulation Tools Used in Water Treatment Management
There are various types of software tools available for simulating the operation of water treatment systems including computer-aided engineering (CAE) software, hybrid mathematical/computer models, and agent-based simulation tools. CAE software packages like Hydraulics Analytical (HA) and Flow Simulation (FS) provide a wide range of features that can simulate fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and transport phenomena in real-time. Hybrid mathematical/computer models combine both theoretical and experimental data to generate simulations that can perform complex calculations quickly but may lack accuracy compared to full-scale numerical simulations. Agent-based simulation is another type of tool that combines physical laws with artificial intelligence algorithms to simulate the behavior of interacting individuals or groups. These tools allow for precise control of simulated environments and are useful in analyzing complex behaviors and emergent properties of large-scale systems. 

Choosing the right simulation tool for a particular project depends on the size and scope of the problem. For small projects, interactive graphical user interfaces like HAView or FSView may be sufficient. More advanced users might opt for programming languages like Matlab or Python that offer a wider range of features. Large-scale projects requiring fine-grained controls and detailed outputs typically require dedicated simulation tools that support parallel processing and distributed computing capabilities. Cloud-based platforms like HydroCloud and SimCenter provide easy access to powerful computational power and distributed computing resources.

## 2.4 Characteristics of Sustainable Modeling and Simulation Methods in Water Treatment
The success of water treatment technologies relies on the rigorous planning, monitoring, and evaluation of all components that go into creating a treatment system. But relying only on purely reactive measures alone is not enough. Rather, it requires integration of sustainable practices that integrate ecologically sound management of water, ecosystem services provision, and human well-being. Some of these integrated principles include transparency, accountability, participatory governance, public engagement, and community-oriented institutions. Without transparent documentation and measurable outcomes, sustainable management will not be possible. Quality assurance mechanisms such as peer review, data sharing, and continuous improvement are essential to verify the effectiveness of a given technique and prevent potential biases. Continuously monitoring the health and performance of treatment systems ensures that improvements are being made in real-time, which ultimately leads to improved outcomes for patients, communities, and the planet. 

Sustaining a positive attitude toward modeling and simulation in water treatment requires enthusiasm, commitment, and collaboration with diverse stakeholders including policy makers, developers, engineers, scientists, technicians, and others. Initiatives like the US EPA’s Center for Integrative Studies (CIS) provide an excellent platform to scale up efforts and bring together various stakeholders. They host meetings regularly to discuss latest advances in water treatment technologies, provide training courses, and hold competitions to encourage innovation. All this requires investment from both academia and industry alike to realize the vision set forth by the International Technology Standards Organization (ITSO).

Ultimately, building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills in water treatment management requires us to move beyond traditional models and algorithms and adopt a systematic approach towards developing truly innovative and scalable solutions. With the rise of cloud-based tools and infrastructure, integrating sustainability into water management becomes increasingly important as it promotes the promotion of responsible consumption.
