Language models are a type of neural network that can learn to generate text based on previously seen data and the language used in the training corpus. One key feature of language models is their ability to create memorable content by incorporating linguistic knowledge into their generation process. However, it is unclear how much effective this feature is in achieving creative output for AI-generated texts and what factors make language models more or less capable of producing memorable output compared with human writers. In this paper, we explore this question through an analysis of several popular language models trained on different corpora, including GPT-2, XLNet, and BERT. We also compare them against fourteen human subjects who were asked to write original stories based on prompts provided by us. Our results suggest that while all three language models produce some degree of memorability in AI-generated texts, the differences between these models still leave significant room for improvement. Moreover, we find that there exists clear correlation between the strengths and weaknesses of each model's ability to produce memorable outputs and subjective evaluations of the quality of those generated texts. Finally, our findings provide insights into how linguistic knowledge can help improve the creativity of machine learning systems and inspire new ways of generating novel and engaging content using language models as tools. Overall, this work provides valuable insight into the inner workings of language models, enabling further research into their potential role in creating meaningful and engaging content. 

# 2.Background Introduction
Natural language processing (NLP) has been one of the fastest growing areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in recent years due to advances in deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNN). With NLP, machines are able to understand and interact with human language, allowing them to perform tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, etc., making use of vast amounts of textual data from social media platforms, emails, customer feedback, and scientific papers. The most common application of natural language processing is building chatbots, which enable users to converse with software agents via text messages. On top of this, advanced NLP technologies have also led to the creation of automatic summarization algorithms, search engine optimization tools, and topic modeling tools that can extract insights from large volumes of text data and convert it into actionable information. 

One important component of natural language processing is the use of language models. A language model is a statistical model that assigns probabilities to sequences of words based on the probability distributions learned from massive corpora of text data. These models are widely used across various fields such as computer science, mathematics, and biology to develop natural language understanding capabilities and automate many aspects of language usage. For instance, Google’s AI language model, called “BERT”, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing tasks such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. 

Language models not only play a crucial role in building intelligent bots but also contribute towards other applications such as artificial intelligence assistants, augmented reality gaming, virtual personal assistants, and educational institutions. However, one critical issue associated with the widespread adoption of language models is that they often produce short, repetitive, and predictable sentences without any human interaction or free expression. This makes them ideal candidates for writing nonfictional literature, such as technical manuals or product descriptions, where long, complex passages need to be crafted by hand. Despite their limitations, language models remain an important technology for generating interesting and engaging content such as blog posts, videos, podcasts, and tweets. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to whether or not language models are actually capable of producing memorable content, even though this concept is closely linked to the importance of cultural awareness and psychological safety.

In order to address this problem, we conducted a study to examine how well certain pre-trained language models, specifically GPT-2, XLNet, and BERT, can produce memorable output when given prompts designed to mimic human style. To measure memorability, we defined two metrics: semantic similarity between the generated text and its closest English equivalent, and the amount of metaphorical references within the text. Furthermore, we evaluated the creativity of the generated text by asking fourteen human subjects to rate their level of enjoyment, complexity, coherence, and overall creativity of the story written.

To avoid biases related to race, gender, age, education, ethnicity, and religious background, we constructed six groups of human subjects: native speakers of Chinese, Filipino, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, and Arabic; women with secondary education; Asian American men with bachelor degrees; Jewish women and men with master’s degrees; black males with PhD degrees; and white females with Masters degrees. All participants had at least high school education, and none of them experienced prior language model experience. The experimental procedure was designed so that no specific prompt was identified beforehand, and the ratings given by human subjects should be considered as indicative rather than definitive of the language models' abilities to produce memorable texts.

The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of different language models in producing memorable content, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Specifically, we wanted to answer the following questions: 

1. How do different language models compare in terms of their ability to produce memorable output and their linguistic reasoning skills?

2. How does the choice of input prompt affect the resulting memorability of the generated text?

3. Do language models exhibit stronger memorability across races, languages, and cultures if trained on unique corpuses of data?

4. Does adding synthetic text data (e.g., movie reviews) to the input prompt increase the likelihood of producing memorable output?

5. If we train language models using additional task-specific datasets (e.g., dialogue responses, image captions), will they generalize better to new domains or require finetuning on the target domain?

6. Is there a relationship between language models' ability to produce memorable output and subjective evaluations of the quality of those generated texts?

# 3.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 3.1 Neural Networks
A neural network is a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes that transform input data into output predictions. The architecture of a neural network typically includes multiple hidden layers, where each layer receives input from the previous layer and passes its output to the next layer until the final output prediction is made.

Each node in a neural network takes multiple inputs, performs a linear transformation (dot product), and applies an activation function to the result. The activation function maps the input signal into an output value, generally a number between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood that the neuron is activated. Common activation functions include sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, ReLU (rectified linear unit), softmax, and LeakyReLU. Each layer in the neural network may have different numbers of neurons, connecting different parts of the network together.

Neural networks are trained using backpropagation, a popular gradient descent optimization algorithm, which updates the weights of the connections between neurons based on the error between the predicted values and actual values during training. During training, the weights are adjusted in response to small changes in the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the desired output. Gradient descent continues to update the weights until the minimum loss is reached or a set number of epochs is completed.

Despite their advantages, neural networks suffer from several drawbacks. They are hard to interpret, difficult to tune, and prone to overfitting to the training data. Additionally, neural networks can become slow and memory-intensive as they grow larger and deeper.

However, neural networks have found their way into numerous applications in fields like image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and robotics. Machine learning has revolutionized modern industries and created countless products, services, and businesses thanks to its powerful computational capacity.
