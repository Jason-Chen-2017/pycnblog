Neuro-symbolic integration (NS) is an approach to integrating neural networks and symbolic representations of language understanding in the same model architecture. This new type of model has attracted significant interest because it allows for fast, efficient, and accurate computational reasoning over structured input such as textual data. However, existing NS models have been mostly restricted to learning simple operations on individual words or sentences without considering their coherence or context within a larger sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network that uses both neurons and symbols as inputs simultaneously, which enables more complex reasoning over linguistic contexts. To achieve this, we use an attention mechanism that assigns different weights to each word based on its relevance to other words in the sentence. We also incorporate symbolic features into the model by encoding them using a convolutional neural network. By doing so, our model can take advantage of both visual information from image and audio data, while still being able to process natural language text. The proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on various language comprehension tasks including SQuAD, GQA, CNN/Daily Mail summarization and question answering. Our code implementation and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Neuro-symbolic-Integration-Networks.
In summary, we present a novel approach to integrating neural networks and symbolic representations of language understanding in a single end-to-end model, called Neuro-Symbolic Integration Networks (NSI), which addresses the limitations of current NS approaches and produces high quality results for various language understanding tasks. We believe NSI will become a useful tool for developing future intelligent machines with enhanced abilities in processing structured language input, especially in areas like speech recognition and natural language generation.

## 2.1 Symbol-based Input
In NSI, we use symbol-based input instead of traditional word-based input, where each element in the input sequence is represented as a symbolic representation rather than a string of characters or phonemes. These symbolic representations may be learned through a deep neural network or extracted directly from raw text data. Commonly used symbols include part-of-speech tags, dependency trees, named entities, sentiment labels, etc., but they can also be generated using advanced techniques such as clustering, topic modeling, and transformers. 

For example, given the input sequence "John likes ice cream", a possible set of symbolized representations could be: 
[[POS_NN], [POS_VBZ], [SYMBOL_likes], [POS_JJ], [SYMBOl_ice_cream]]
where POS indicates Part Of Speech, JJ indicates Adjective, VBZ indicates Verb and ZZ indicates Other (uncommon words). In general, each symbol represents some property or feature of the corresponding word, enabling the model to extract rich semantic information about the text.  

To enable the model to consider not only individual words but also their relationships and context within a larger sentence, we add an attention layer between the embedding layers of the neural network and the symbolic input. The attention layer computes a weighted average of the embeddings based on the similarity between the embedded word sequences and the symbolic inputs. This attention mechanism is designed to focus on relevant parts of the input that are consistent with the underlying symbolic representation of the sentence.

## 2.2 Integrated Attention Mechanism
We combine both neural network outputs and symbolic input by concatenating the two streams along the depth dimension before applying a fully connected layer. The output of the integrated attention mechanism then combines these combined hidden states from the neural network and symbolic inputs using a weighted sum to produce final predictions. Specifically, the weight assigned to each word depends on the cosine similarity between the embedded vector and the symbolic representation computed by the attention layer. Intuitively, words that have similar meanings should receive higher scores due to the fact that humans naturally tend to assign greater importance to related concepts when making decisions. 

The resulting attention map informs the model of how much each word contributes towards the overall meaning of the entire sentence. For instance, if one word is highly correlated with another word in the sentence, it might carry more weight in computing the final prediction, reflecting the impression of the reader that those two words belong together. The strength of the correlation between any pair of words is determined by the length and position of the words relative to each other in the sentence. A smaller distance indicates stronger correlation, whereas a longer distance suggests lesser correlation. Based on this attention map, the model can selectively attend to specific subsets of the input, identifying salient patterns or chunks of text that contribute most significantly to predicting the correct answer. This improved attention mechanism improves the accuracy of the model's predictions by focusing on important aspects of the input sequence that are crucial for determining the final decision.
