## Introduction: How Artificial Intelligence is changing the retail industry and establishing new markets? 

Retail Industry is one of the most valuable industries in the world that provides access to a large number of goods for consumers all over the globe. It has been an important part of economic growth and development across various sectors such as electronics, fashion, beauty products etc., but it also brings challenges like data overload, security breaches, fraudulent activities, and lack of customer engagement. To address these problems, many companies have started using artificial intelligence techniques to provide personalized experiences to customers. The recent advancement in machine learning technologies has enabled companies to develop highly accurate models that can predict behavior patterns and preferences of their customers based on their previous purchase history. This technology is transforming the way we interact with brands, shops, and services by providing real-time recommendations, personalization, and customized product offerings. This article will explore how artificial intelligence is changing the retail industry through establishing new markets and discuss key issues that need further research. 

In this article, we are going to focus on three main aspects related to the introduction of new market opportunities via artificial intelligence technologies. These include E-commerce platforms, Personalization, and Augmented Reality (AR). Let’s dive into each aspect individually. 

2.E-commerce Platforms: 

A e-commerce platform refers to a software or hardware system that enables buyers and sellers to transact online easily and securely. Many brands choose to partner up with established e-commerce platforms to increase their visibility and reach. While traditional retail stores still play an essential role in marketing, they have become increasingly redundant with the advent of digital channels like social media and mobile apps. 

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, e-commerce platforms can start offering targeted offers, promotions, and discounts directly within the customer experience itself. For example, if a user is looking for a particular type of clothing, the e-commerce platform could suggest related products or showcase relevant designs. Within minutes, users get results rather than waiting days or weeks. Similar features can also be used for recommending products based on past purchases, interest groups, and other factors such as demographics, location, device type, etc. Brands can use big data analytics tools to monitor their performance and make necessary adjustments. 

Another benefit of having your business partnership with a leading e-commerce platform is that you don't have to build everything from scratch yourself. You can leverage prebuilt modules like shopping cart integrations, checkout processes, payment gateways, and shipping providers which saves time and money. Additionally, established e-commerce platforms often already have a great reputation in the market, so your brand can stand out amongst the crowd.

3.Personalization:

Personalization involves giving different experiences to different customers based on their individual needs, preferences, behaviors, and actions. Traditionally, businesses had a limited amount of resources available to them when it comes to developing personalized offers. However, today's technologies enable businesses to create dynamic, personalized offers within a matter of hours, even for small businesses. 

One popular approach to personalizing is using recommendation systems. Recommendation systems work by analyzing historical data about what people prefer and suggesting items that match those tastes. Traditional methods involve targeting specific categories or types of customers with promotional offers, but machine learning algorithms like collaborative filtering and content-based recommenders can generate more personalized suggestions based on a customer's browsing history, search queries, demographic information, and more. 

Recent advances in deep learning technologies have led to increased accuracy in recommendation systems. This technology allows machines to understand complex relationships between various attributes and identify patterns and correlations behind customer behavior. Companies can now tailor their recommendations to each individual customer based on their unique preferences, interests, and lifestyle choices. Additionally, Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube have implemented personalization features that take advantage of machine learning algorithms to deliver high-quality recommendations to their users.

The value of personalization goes beyond just providing personalized offers to individuals. Businesses can leverage personalization to improve sales and profits, reduce churn rates, increase loyalty, and enhance customer satisfaction. By embedding personalization throughout the customer lifecycle, businesses can better anticipate their needs, adapt to new trends, and attract new customers.

4.Augmented Reality (AR):

Augmented Reality (AR) refers to virtual reality where the physical environment around the viewer becomes mixed with computer generated images and videos. AR technology was originally created to enhance the visual perception of objects in real life. Today, it is being used for a wide range of applications including healthcare, gaming, transportation, entertainment, education, and scientific research.  

The main difference between augmented reality and virtual reality is that virtual reality places the user inside a simulated environment while augmented reality overlays the reality with computer generated images and videos. Users can see both physical and virtual elements side by side and manipulate them interactively using input devices such as controllers or touchscreens. Examples of augmented reality applications include medical imaging, flight simulators, military simulations, tourism guides, movie theaters, and kiosks.

While there is no definitive answer as to whether augmented reality will change or continue to dominate the retail industry, several factors are becoming more obvious. Firstly, the rise of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies makes it easier for businesses to gather and analyze massive amounts of data, allowing them to develop new ways of interacting with customers. Secondly, VR headsets like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive allow developers to test AR applications without requiring specialized equipment. Thirdly, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are enabling businesses to gain insights into customers' everyday interactions with virtual objects, which are not possible with purely visual imagery alone. Overall, the future of the retail industry seems brighter and agile thanks to the emergence of AR and hybrid solutions powered by machine learning and big data.
