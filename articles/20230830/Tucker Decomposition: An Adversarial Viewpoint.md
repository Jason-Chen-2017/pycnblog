Tucker decomposition is an unsupervised learning method that can be used to decompose tensors into a few core subspaces or modes. It has been shown to be very effective in many applications such as image compression, recommender systems and natural language processing. In this article, we will discuss the basics of tensor decompositions and its adverse effects on different types of data, including images, texts, time-series and social media analysis. We will also present two examples of using Tucker decomposition for multidimensional image denoising and recommendation system filtering, respectively. Finally, we will provide insights and future directions for researchers in this area. 

In order to understand why Tucker decomposition is important and how it works, we need to have a basic understanding of what a tensor is and its various dimensions. Additionally, we should know about some of the key assumptions and properties of Tucker decomposition that must be satisfied before applying it to any specific problem. 

Let's get started!
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 What is Tensor?
A tensor refers to an array with more than one dimension. A vector, matrix, cube, or higher-order tensor are all tensors. For example, consider a grayscale image, which is a three-dimensional tensor where each pixel represents intensity values between black (0) and white (255). Another common type of tensor is a sequence of words (text), which is typically represented by a four-dimensional tensor, where the first dimension corresponds to the number of words, second dimension corresponds to the length of each word, third dimension corresponds to the size of vocabulary, and fourth dimension corresponds to the embedding vectors representing each unique word.

## 2.2 How Do I Define a Tensor Decomposition?
Tensor decomposition methods aim at reducing the complexity of high-dimensional tensors by identifying their intrinsic structure into simpler parts called factors. The resulting decompositions capture latent features and relationships within the original tensor. There are several ways to define tensor decompositions based on different criteria like low rank, sparseness, shared subspace, etc. Here, we will focus on Tucker decomposition, which provides a universal framework for factorization of tensors along multiple axes simultaneously.  

The general formulation of Tucker decomposition is given below:

$$X_{i_1i_2...i_n} = \prod_{k=1}^{r}\left[\prod_{j=1}^{\tilde{m}_k}U_{kj}\right]V_{kl}$$

where $X$ is the input tensor of shape $(d_1\times d_2\times...\times d_n)$, $\{i_1, i_2,..., i_n\}$ are the mode indices, and $r$ is the number of modes. Each $U_{kj}$ and $V_{kl}$ is a tensor of shape $(d_j\times \tilde{m}_k)$ and $(\tilde{m}_k\times d_\ell)$, respectively, where $\tilde{m}_k$ is the new dimensionality along mode k after factorizing X along axis j.

The above equation defines a Tucker decomposition of the tensor X along $r$ modes, where the factors $U_{kj}, V_{kl}$ are assumed to satisfy certain constraints and conditions. Depending on the application, these assumptions may vary and additional restrictions/assumptions may be needed depending upon the distribution of tensor entries. 

However, there are no guarantees that the decomposition always exists or that it gives optimal solutions. Therefore, the choice of appropriate Tucker parameters and choices of initial values during optimization plays a crucial role in the performance of tensor decomposition algorithms.

Another popular way to visualize Tucker decomposition is through matrices. Let us assume that we want to decompose a tensor X of shape $(I \times J \times K \times L )$. To do so, we would start by creating three matrices U1, U2, and U3 of shapes $(K \times M^1)$, $(L \times M^2)$, and $(J \times M^3)$ respectively, where $M^1$, $M^2$, and $M^3$ represent the reduced sizes of dimensions 1, 2, and 3 after factorization. Then we multiply them together to create the final matrix Z of shape $(K \times L \times M^1 \times M^2 \times M^3)$. This operation can be repeated over all possible combinations of factor matrices to obtain all possible ranks $r$. However, computing the full tensor requires a large amount of memory. Thus, the computationally efficient approach is to compute only those decompositions corresponding to smaller ranks that satisfy certain error bounds and perform approximate reconstruction via other methods.

## 2.3 Types of Tucker Decompositions
There are several types of Tucker decompositions that can be performed based on different sets of assumptions and regularizations applied to the factor matrices. Here are brief descriptions of most commonly used types:

1. **Unfolding**: One assumption of Tucker decomposition is that the input tensor is already unfolded across all the modes while preserving the underlying multi-linearity property. These decompositions directly map each entry of the tensor to the elementary components of the decomposition equations.

2. **Orthogonal**: Assumption here is that the factor matrices are orthonormal, meaning they are unitary in case of square matrices. Tucker decomposition becomes more efficient when the factor matrices are obtained from SVD or QR decompositions of the input tensor, since they guarantee orthogonality and efficiency of multiplication operations involved in decomposing the tensor. 

3. **Low Rank**: Another assumption is that the factor matrices are low rank. This helps to avoid redundancy in the learned representation, hence leading to faster convergence of optimization algorithms, especially if the objective function includes a measure of dissimilarity between consecutive elements of the original tensor.

4. **No Correlation**: Third assumption is that the correlation among the individual entries of the tensor is not significant. If the covariance matrix of the input tensor is close to identity, then this condition can be relaxed and the decompositions still preserve the overall structure of the tensor accurately.

5. **Regularization**: Regularization techniques include adding noise to the factor matrices or restricting their norms to ensure stability of the algorithm and improving the numerical stability of the solution.

Overall, Tucker decomposition offers an unifying framework for factorization of tensors along multiple axes simultaneously and enables the extraction of useful information without having to specify prior knowledge about the tensor’s geometry or contents. However, choosing suitable regularization parameter is essential to achieve accurate results. Moreover, the limitations of applying Tucker decomposition are mainly related to computational resources required for solving the optimization problems associated with finding the best factor matrices.
