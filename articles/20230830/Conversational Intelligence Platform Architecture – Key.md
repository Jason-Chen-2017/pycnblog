With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has become one of the main fields where AI can provide benefits to businesses, organizations, and society. One such application is conversational AI, which involves a chatbot or virtual assistant that can answer questions by understanding the context of user’s input text using NLP techniques like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and intent classification. However, building an effective and efficient conversation platform for this type of applications is not easy as it requires multiple components working together to formulate answers correctly. In fact, many companies are investing heavily in developing conversational AI platforms but still lack sufficient expertise and resources to make them work seamlessly. 

In this article, we will look at some key components and functions of a conversational AI platform architecture. These include data collection, preprocessing, dialog management, natural language understanding, and dialogue modeling. We will also explore how these components interact with each other to create conversations that are more natural, accurate, and engaging for users. Additionally, we will discuss issues related to scalability, accuracy, privacy, and ethical concerns while designing a conversational AI platform. Finally, we will present some use cases illustrating the value added by building a conversational AI platform.


## Introduction
Conversational AI refers to automated communication systems that understand human speech and respond naturally in real-time without being explicitly programmed to do so. The term was coined in 2015 by IBM researchers who developed Siri, Cortana, Alexa, and Google Assistant. These products have revolutionized the way humans interact with machines and robotics. With the advent of cloud computing, enterprise mobility, and mobile devices, conversational AI has gained traction in various sectors including e-commerce, healthcare, financial services, and education. Despite their potential impact on our lives, however, building an effective and reliable conversation platform remains a challenging task for both professionals and startups alike. 

A good conversation AI platform should be able to handle various types of conversations, incorporate relevant content from different sources, and generate responses quickly and accurately. It must also have robust security measures, adaptive learning algorithms, and scalable infrastructure to accommodate ever-increasing volumes of data. To achieve this level of performance, a conversational AI platform needs to address several critical issues: 

1. Scalability - A single system may not always be able to keep up with the demand for handling increasing amounts of traffic. Therefore, a conversational AI platform must be designed to scale horizontally or vertically depending on the size and complexity of its deployment.

2. Accuracy - Unlike typical search engines that rely on keyword matching and machine learning models, a conversational AI platform needs to be highly specialized in recognizing specific patterns and concepts within user queries. This requires advanced natural language understanding (NLU) technologies and careful attention to detail when training the model.

3. Privacy - User privacy plays a crucial role in ensuring that sensitive information does not leave the device unintentionally. Hence, a conversational AI platform needs to take steps to ensure that no personal information is shared without consent.

4. Ethical Concerns - Conversational AI has immense potential to transform human-computer interactions into a new paradigm where machines speak directly with people rather than through traditional channels like email and social media. However, regulations and ethical considerations need to be taken into account when deploying these systems, especially those that involve autonomous decision-making capabilities. For example, if a company uses a conversational AI platform to assist employees in making important business decisions, there could be risks associated with its usage that go beyond its control.

5. Flexibility - While conversational AI platforms are typically designed with a predefined set of functionality, they often require customization and adaptation over time based on changing customer requirements, user behavior, and market dynamics. As a result, a conversational AI platform should be flexible enough to evolve over time to meet the needs of diverse customers.

To build a conversational AI platform, it is essential to identify key components and functionalities required to support natural language understanding, dialogue management, and response generation. These components must work together effectively to enable the platform to recognize and interpret user queries, construct appropriate responses, and manage the flow of a conversation. Each component of the platform should also be customizable to allow for tailoring to different user scenarios and preferences.
