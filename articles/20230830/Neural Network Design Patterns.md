# 3.Abstract
Design patterns have been widely applied to solve problems in software engineering for decades. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained increasing attention due to their ability to handle complex inputs with high accuracy. However, training these models requires extensive computational resources and expertise, making it difficult to find efficient solutions for all possible scenarios. In contrast, many different design patterns have emerged in DNN training to address specific challenges. To understand the existing design patterns and their applicability to DNN training, we surveyed several sources of information and identified six core patterns that cover five fundamental concepts in DNN design: model complexity, regularization techniques, optimizer selection methods, hyperparameter tuning strategies, and data preprocessing techniques. We also examined two commonly used patterns – batch normalization and model architectures – and evaluated their effectiveness across multiple tasks and datasets. Our findings provide valuable insights into understanding DNN design and offer guidance for identifying suitable design patterns for individual use cases.
