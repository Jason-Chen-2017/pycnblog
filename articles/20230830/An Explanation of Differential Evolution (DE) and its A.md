# 1.简介
  


Differential evolution (DE), also known as stochastic differential evolution (SDE), is a widely used black-box optimization algorithm that belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms. The main idea behind DE is to modify the population iteratively by applying randomly generated mutations on selected individuals, and to select better ones from the modified population for the next generation. It has been shown to be effective in solving problems with various types of local minima, including those encountered in many practical applications such as global optimization, function approximation, and data fitting. 

However, despite its popularity, there are still some challenges associated with it. For example, DE requires careful parameter tuning based on the problem at hand, which can be challenging especially when dealing with noisy fitness functions or high dimensionality. Moreover, DE is sensitive to noise and does not guarantee convergence to the global minimum if the initial population is poorly chosen, making it more suitable only for smooth, non-noisy objective functions where the algorithm can escape from local minima easily. 

In this article, we will first give an overview of differential evolution and then explain how it works under the hood, followed by discussing its advantages over other popular optimization methods like genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. We will finally present an implementation of DE in Python and compare it with similar techniques using benchmark test problems. We hope that readers gain insights into the inner workings of DE and understand why it is so successful in solving optimization problems.

# 2.基本概念、术语和定义

## 2.1 Population and Fitness Function

The population of solutions represented as vectors $\vec{x}_{i}$ where $i=1,...,N$ represents the current state of the optimization process. Each vector represents one possible solution to the optimization problem being solved. In addition, each individual's fitness value, denoted as $f(\vec{x}_i)$, is computed as the objective function evaluated at each position $\vec{x}_i$. A set of N different solutions forms the population. Initially, all individuals have equal probability of being picked for reproduction in the following generations.


## 2.2 Mutation Operator

The mutation operator changes the position of an individual in the search space while keeping the other components of its representation fixed. In DE, this means generating a random perturbation vector $\vec{\sigma}$, scaling it according to a certain factor $\eta$, adding it to the original solution vector $\vec{x}$, and returning the new mutant:

$$\vec{y} = \vec{x} + \eta\cdot\vec{\sigma}$$

where $\eta$ is called the mutation rate and controls the degree of change applied to the solution vector. 


## 2.3 Crossover Operator

Crossover refers to the process of combining two parent individuals to generate offspring, resulting in new solutions with characteristics inherited from both parents. In DE, crossover takes place between pairs of parents, with offspring inheriting traits from their parents' positions, but with small variations introduced through mutation. Specifically, for each pair of parents $\vec{x}_i$ and $\vec{x}_j$, a child candidate $\vec{z}_k$ is created as follows:

$$\vec{z}_k = c_1\vec{x}_i + c_2\vec{x}_j+\epsilon$$

where $\epsilon$ is a small random term to prevent any exact copies of either parent from reaching the next generation unaltered. $\vec{c}=(c_1, c_2)$ is called the mixing coefficient vector and determines the proportion of traits from each parent assigned to the offspring. In most implementations of DE, $\vec{c}=0.5$ leads to plain binary crossover, while values closer to 1 favor the dominant trait from each parent.


## 2.4 Selection Strategy

Once each individual has reached maturity, i.e., has received enough positive reinforcement to continue in the population, selection must occur to choose the best individuals for reproducing later in the process. One common approach is tournament selection, where $K$-tournaments are held among the individuals in the population, and the winners replace loser members in the population. Alternatively, elitism can be employed, meaning the top performing individuals keep on residing in the population throughout the course of the search process.


# 3.Core Algorithm

Here is a brief outline of the core algorithm steps:

1. Initialize the population with randomly generated solutions.
2. Compute the fitness of each individual in the population using the fitness function.
3. Select the best individuals from the population using tournament or elitist strategies.
4. Generate K random numbers to determine the number of children to produce per parent pair during crossover.
5. Apply crossover between pairs of parents, producing a set of K offspring candidates.
6. Evaluate the fitness of each offspring candidate. If an improvement was found, add it to the population. Otherwise, discard it.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met (such as a maximum number of iterations or a termination threshold).

Note that the above description is simply a general outline and does not cover every detail involved in implementing DE efficiently and accurately. Nonetheless, it should provide a good starting point for understanding what exactly goes on inside DE and how it operates.
