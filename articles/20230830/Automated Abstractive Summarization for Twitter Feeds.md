With the emergence of social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, people are sharing more and more valuable information in a short period of time. To help users understand the content quickly, it is necessary to create summaries that provide concise and informative insights about what they have read or seen. The automated abstractive summarization technology has been widely used in various fields such as news article analysis, biomedical text mining, finance sector analysis, etc. In this paper, we will discuss how the automatic abstractive summarization can be applied on tweets data which contains human language with limited contextual clues. We use transformer-based neural network models to generate summaries from tweet feeds by incorporating sentence level attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we explore different ways of handling noise during training and inference process to improve model performance. Finally, we conduct an evaluation study using ROUGE metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our methodology on real-world twitter datasets.

Abstractive summarization aims at generating an abstract representation of long documents by selectively reducing the length while retaining essential information. There have been many works on applying deep learning techniques for natural language processing tasks including sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, topic modeling, and document classification. However, few work has focused on producing summaries for tweets data due to its unique characteristics such as noisy and limited contextual clues. 

Existing methods often rely heavily on pre-trained language models, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks, and then utilizing their trained representations for summarization. However, the problem with these approaches is that they may not perform well on domains without sufficient labeled data. Moreover, most of them do not consider the dynamic nature of tweets where new tweets arrive frequently, making it difficult to adapt to changing conditions in real-time systems. Therefore, there is a need for new approaches that can produce high quality summaries from streaming and unstructured data.

In this paper, we propose an approach called ASR (Automated Social Response) which integrates both machine learning algorithms and human intelligence principles into an end-to-end solution to automate the generation of summaries from human generated text. Specifically, we first leverage transformer-based neural networks to extract semantic features from the input text. Then, we apply multi-head self-attention mechanism to capture the relationship between sentences within a tweet feed. Next, we employ pointer generator networks to predict the most relevant sentence in each tweet feed based on the extracted features. Lastly, we combine multiple sentences together to form a summary that captures the gist of the entire tweet feed. We also develop a methodology to handle noisy data during training and inference process through active learning, semi-supervised learning, and outlier detection techniques.

We use transformer-based neural networks with attention mechanisms to summarize tweets data. First, we tokenize each tweet into words and convert them into numerical vectors. These word embeddings are passed through encoder layers in parallel to compute contextual features that capture the meaning of individual words. After computing these features, we pass them through a decoder layer along with the encoded vector from the previous step. This generates a sequence of words that represent the summary of the input tweet. During decoding, we use teacher forcing technique to guide the model towards selecting the correct next word in the output sequence. 

To ensure that our model does not make any errors when it encounters rare or uncommon words, we utilize word piece tokenization scheme. This splits each word into subwords that preserve the original word semantics but reduce the vocabulary size. To achieve better results, we implement two additional tricks. First, we use a weighted cross-entropy loss function that assigns higher weights to less frequent words so that the model focuses on important words. Second, we add regularization losses to enforce linguistic constraints that promote coherence among the selected sentences in the final summary.  

Next, we move on to implementing the Pointer Generator Network (PGN) architecture. PGN consists of three components: the generator, the discriminator, and the selector. The generator takes in the output sequence produced by the transformer and produces a probability distribution over all possible output sequences. The discriminator learns to distinguish between true sentences and false ones generated by the generator. The selector selects one or more valid sentences from the output of the generator according to a predefined criterion. The overall objective of PGN is to maximize the likelihood of the generator's predicted sequence given the source sequence and selected sentences. For efficiency reasons, we use beam search algorithm instead of greedy search to avoid generating too many invalid hypotheses. 

Finally, we introduce five strategies to deal with the challenges of dealing with noisy data during training and inference processes. Active learning helps us to sample diverse examples from the available dataset to balance the classes and prevent overfitting. Semi-supervised learning involves using partial annotations to train the model with supervision from unlabeled data. Outlier detection measures the distance between training instances and identifies outliers that may affect model accuracy. Finally, we experiment with ensemble methods that combine predictions made by multiple models to further boost the performance of the system.
