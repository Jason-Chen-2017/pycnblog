Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining most of its information in a lower-dimensional space. It works by finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the original dataset, which contains the variations or patterns among all possible combinations of variables. The resulting vectors are called principal components (PC), ordered by their corresponding eigenvalue magnitude, from highest to lowest, representing the directions along which much variation exists in the dataset. The first few PCs can be considered as linear combinations of the original variables, but they may not be informative enough for further analysis without further reducing the number of dimensions. PCA helps identify the dominant features of the data, where changes in one variable tend to affect other variables, leading to more interpretable results when compared with raw data. 

In this article, we will learn how to apply PCA on a real world dataset using Python and scikit-learn library. We will also discuss some key concepts like eigendecomposition, scatter plots, variance explained ratio, correlation coefficient and feature scaling before applying PCA. Finally, we will test our understanding of PCA through various example datasets and interpret the results. Let's get started!

## 2.Background Introduction:What is Principle Component Analysis?
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. These new values are constructed such that each observation has only two degrees of freedom, making them easier to visualize.

The basic idea behind PCA is to find a new basis for the observed data, such that it explains as many of the variability in the data as possible, while minimizing any loss of information due to multicollinearity. This process can be summarized in five steps:

1. **Centering:** Subtract the mean value of each variable from the respective column. This makes sure that the centered data has zero means and thus no bias towards any direction.

2. **Covariance Matrix:** Compute the covariance matrix between all pairs of variables. The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix represent the variance of each variable, while the off-diagonal elements indicate the amount of covariation between the pair of variables.

3. **Eigendecomposition of Covariance Matrix:** Decompose the covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Each eigenvector corresponds to a principal component, and the associated eigenvalue represents the contribution of that particular component to the total variance.

4. **Construction of Transformation Matrix:** Multiply the normalized centered data by the rotation matrix obtained after performing SVD decomposition on the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. 

5. **Projection onto Principal Components:** Transform the centered data onto the subspace spanned by the principal components found earlier, obtaining a set of reduced dimensional data consisting of only the largest principal components explaining at least 90% of the overall variance in the original dataset.

## 3.Core Concepts/Terms:Let us now understand some core terms/concepts related to PCA:

1. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: If X is a square matrix, then its eigenvectors and eigenvalues correspond to the roots and coefficients of its characteristic equation:

   $$X \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$$

   Where $\vec{v}$ denotes a nonzero vector, and $\lambda$ denotes a scalar value known as the eigenvalue. If there is more than one solution to the above equation, we say that the matrix $X$ has multiple eigenvectors that correspond to different eigenvalues. In general, the choice of eigenvectors and eigenvalues depends on the application and context. However, if the data points are arranged in a fixed coordinate system, we typically choose the eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (i.e., those whose squares have the maximum absolute values).

   
   
2. Correlation and Coorelation Matrix: The correlation coefficient measures the degree of interdependence between two random variables. A positive correlation indicates that as x increases, so does y; a negative correlation indicates that as x increases, y decreases. The correlation coefficient ranges between -1 and +1. The pearsonr() function from the scipy.stats module computes the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between two arrays. Similarly, the corrcoef() function computes the sample correlation matrix between the columns of a matrix. For these functions, each element $(i,j)$ of the correlation matrix gives the correlation coefficient between the $i$-th and $j$-th variables.
   
   
   
3. Variance Explained Ratio: The variance explained ratio is defined as the fraction of the total variance in the input data accounted for by the $k$ selected principal components. If all the components are included, then the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual output would equal the sum of variances of individual variables plus twice the sum of cross-variances between pairs of variables. Thus, choosing fewer components ensures that the model accounts for the majority of the variation in the data while ignoring small details.
   
   
   
4. Feature Scaling: The goal of feature scaling is to rescale the input variables to ensure that they have similar scales. There are several ways to perform feature scaling including standardization, normalization and min-max scaling. Standardization involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Normalization involves shifting the distribution of each variable to have unit mean and unit variance. Min-max scaling involves scaling the variables to a range [0,1] or [-1,+1], depending on the desired range of output values. When using PCA, it is important to normalize the data to avoid large scale differences between variables and preserve the relative orders of variables.
   
   
   
5. Linear Dependence: Two variables are said to be linearly dependent if they can be written in the form a_0 + a_1x_1 +... + a_nx_n, where xi's are constants and ai's are unknown coefficients. In simple words, if we add a constant offset to both variables, the result remains unchanged. More generally, two sets of variables are said to be linearly dependent if there exist constants c_1,..., c_m and b_1,..., b_n, respectively, such that
   
   $$a_{ij}c_i + b_{ij}c_j = c_ib_j$$
   
   for all i=1,...,m and j=1,...,n, where $a_{ij}$ and $b_{ij}$ are scalar multiples of ei and ej, respectively. Note that linear dependence implies that there must be a set of constants that satisfy this condition, whereas simultaneous equality is not sufficient. To check whether two sets of variables are linearly independent, we simply list out all possible equations containing the same variables, and verify that none contain redundant constraints.
