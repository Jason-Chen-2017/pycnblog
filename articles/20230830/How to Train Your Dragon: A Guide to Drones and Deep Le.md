# 2.Background Introduction

Drone Technology has revolutionized the way humans travel around the globe. Since early 2000s, drones have been pioneering a new form of transportation by providing simple yet powerful means of mobile manipulation. They are able to perform many complex tasks on the ground level including surveillance, search and rescue, mapping, video recording, and photography. As the demand for drones continues to grow, so does the need for skilled individuals to master the art of piloting them effectively and efficiently. Therefore, there exists a growing interest among students, teachers, and professionals alike in developing the skills necessary to safely operate drones under all sorts of conditions. To achieve this, several organizations and universities across the country have been establishing programs focused on training and mentoring young minds towards the careers of professional dronemakers. These include the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the International Space Station Board of Governors (ISB). Each of these agencies provides specialized courses in drone training, ranging from basic commanding and flying skills to more advanced components like sensing and computing platforms. 

Although drone development requires significant technical expertise, it's becoming easier to obtain with the advent of affordable hardware and software solutions like Raspberry Pi computers and drones like those made by PX4, ArduPilot, Cleanflight, and Mambo. These platforms come preloaded with popular computer vision libraries like OpenCV, which makes it relatively straightforward to program features like object detection, tracking, and classification within the operating system. Moreover, these devices feature built-in Wi-Fi connectivity making it possible to stream live video feeds to computers for analysis and visualization purposes. Despite this advantage, however, it's worth noting that owning a fully functioning drone still involves significant safety measures such as proper insurance coverage and regular maintenance. Therefore, building an effective drone skillset remains an incredibly difficult task, but it's essential if one aims to succeed in the future.
