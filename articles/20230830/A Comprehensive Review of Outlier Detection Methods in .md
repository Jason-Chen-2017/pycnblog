# 1.简介
  

Outlier detection is an essential and crucial task for various applications such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, network security monitoring, etc. In high dimensional data with many features, outliers can be very difficult to detect automatically because they may not have a clear boundary or shape that separates them from the majority of data points. Therefore, there are several methods proposed to identify outliers in high-dimensional data based on different criteria including density estimation, clustering analysis, and distance measurement approaches. This article reviews popular outlier detection methods in high-dimensional data and discusses their advantages, limitations, and applicability in specific scenarios. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## Outlier Detection 
Outlier detection refers to identifying observations that deviate significantly from other observations within a dataset. These observations can be considered extreme values, i.e., rare events or unusual occurrences that do not conform to a well-defined pattern. The goal of outlier detection is to discover these abnormal observations and take appropriate action on them, which typically includes deletion, flagging, or reporting. 

## High-Dimensional Data (High-D)
In high-dimensional data, each observation has multiple attributes or variables that describe it independently. For instance, in image processing, each pixel represents one attribute and thus the entire image is represented by its pixel values. In social media analytics, tweets, articles, videos, and products all have associated multidimensional attributes that can provide valuable insights into customer behavior, sentiment, and preferences. Despite its importance, researchers still face challenges in analyzing large datasets consisting of millions or billions of instances with thousands of dimensions.

## Density Estimation
Density estimation refers to the process of estimating the probability distribution of a random variable using a small set of observed data points. The estimated distribution is then used to identify regions of high probability density where the observed data points tend to cluster together. Common techniques include kernel density estimation (KDE), local smoothing regression, and minimum variance unbiased estimates.

## Clustering Analysis
Clustering analysis is a type of unsupervised learning technique that involves dividing the data into groups based on similarities between examples. There are two main types of clustering: hierarchical clustering and density-based clustering. Hierarchical clustering starts with individual objects and gradually merges them until there is only one group containing every object. Density-based clustering works by assigning clusters based on proximity in feature space and is particularly effective when dealing with complex structures such as natural images or geographic information systems.

## Distance Measurement Approaches
Distance measurements refer to calculating the distance between pairs of data points in high-dimensional space. Two commonly used metrics are Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance. Other common distances include Mahalanobis distance, cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and correlation coefficient. Distance measurements help determine whether two instances belong to the same class or cluster, which allows for more accurate classification than standard linear models. Additionally, distance measures can capture non-linear relationships between features and can improve performance in some cases.

# 3.Core Algorithm and Techniques
There are several core algorithms and techniques for identifying outliers in high-dimensional data. We will discuss five most popular outlier detection methods in this section: 

1. Local Outlier Factor (LOF): LOF is a novel algorithm that uses the concept of locality sensitive hashing to find density-based clusters in high-dimensional data. It identifies outliers by measuring how much their surrounding neighborhood differs from its own.

2. One-Class SVM (OCSVM): OCSVM is another anomaly detection method that tries to separate data points into two classes - normal and abnormal. OCSVM attempts to maximize the margin between the two classes while also minimizing the number of support vectors required to separate them.

3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is widely used to reduce dimensionality and increase interpretability of high-dimensional data. However, it cannot completely remove all outliers since it depends on the assumption that no meaningful structure exists beyond the first few principal components.

4. K-means Clustering: K-means clustering assigns instances to clusters based on their distances from the centroid of their respective clusters. K-means is often used as a preliminary step before applying other clustering methods like DBSCAN or OPTICS.

5. Isolation Forest (IF): IF is an ensemble method that combines decision trees and bagging to identify anomalies in complex data sets. Similar to random forests, it splits the data into smaller subsets and aggregates their predictions to produce final results. Unlike traditional anomaly detectors, it does not rely on any known distributions and works directly with raw data without preprocessing steps.

All five methods discussed above involve evaluating multiple aspects of the data and taking necessary actions to isolate the anomalies. They differ in terms of computational complexity and accuracy but share certain fundamental principles such as modeling high-dimensionality through dimensionality reduction techniques. Nevertheless, we should note that there are variations among these methods due to varying assumptions about the nature of the underlying data and the desired result. 

Let's now dive deeper into each method in detail.

### 3.1 Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is a popular outlier detection method that relies on the concept of locality sensitive hashing (LSH). It searches for density-based clusters in high-dimensional data by computing the ratio between the distances between a given point and its k nearest neighbors and the average distance to its kth neighbor. Anomalies are then identified as those whose local density is significantly lower than their local density around them.

The basic idea behind LOF is simple. If a point is far away from its kth neighbor, then it is likely to be an outlier because it is unlikely to form a significant density around itself. Conversely, if a point is close to its kth neighbor, then it could be part of a dense region that forms a cluster. By comparing the distances of a point to its kth neighbor and its neighbors, LOF determines the degree of anomalousness. Specifically, if the ratio between the average distance of the point to its kth neighbor and the distance to the k+1th neighbor is significantly higher than the ratio for all other points in its k-nearest neighborhood, then the point is declared an outlier.

Here is a brief overview of the key concepts involved in LOF implementation:

1. Hashing: LSH computes hash functions over the input data points to generate binary signatures. Each signature corresponds to a bin in the hypercube that spans the coordinate space. LSH guarantees that points that are closely packed together end up in the same bin, whereas points that are distant end up in different bins. Together, all the hashed signatures give rise to a multi-resolution partitioning of the original data space.

2. Smoothing: To handle noise introduced during the hashing stage, LOF applies Gaussian smoothed versions of the distance ratios. This ensures that the sensitivity of LOF to local fluctuations in the density function is reduced, leading to more robust detection.

3. Identification: LOF selects a suitable value of k and declares an anomaly as any point whose distance to its kth neighbor divided by the average distance to its k+1th neighbor is significantly higher than the maximum ratio obtained across all other points in the k-neighborhood. Intuitively, a larger deviation indicates greater likelihood of anomalousness.
