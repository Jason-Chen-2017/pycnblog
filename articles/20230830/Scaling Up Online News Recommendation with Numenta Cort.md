Online news recommendation is a popular application of machine learning algorithms that predicts the interest and engagement level of online users based on their behavior patterns over time. Research has shown that many factors such as user demographics, search queries, content attributes, social media interactions, and multimedia information can influence user preferences and engagement levels. One of the most effective solutions to this problem is using deep neural networks (DNN) for modeling user behavioral data. In this paper, we present an approach called Numenta Cortical Learning Algorithm (NuCLA), which utilizes biologically-inspired principles in order to capture complex user behavioral patterns and generate accurate predictions. We also discuss how NuCLA is different from traditional DNN approaches and highlight its advantages when it comes to scalability and performance.

## （一）问题背景
Online news recommendation plays a crucial role in personalized news delivery by providing relevant articles to users’ interests. However, the challenge faced by online news recommendation systems is to effectively model individual user behavior patterns and generate recommendations at scale. Existing methods rely heavily on collaborative filtering techniques and represent users as vectors containing explicit ratings of items. Although these models are able to provide good results under certain circumstances, they cannot handle large amounts of heterogeneous data due to the sparsity issue of implicit feedback datasets. Moreover, recent advancements in artificial intelligence have shown that very complex non-linear relationships between input variables and output variables can be learned through deep neural networks (DNN). Nevertheless, existing DNN-based models still struggle to achieve high accuracy in terms of recommending highly relevant articles for diverse user groups due to their limited capacity to extract meaningful features from sparsely-labeled data. To address these issues, we propose Numenta Cortical Learning Algorithm (NuCLA), which uses cortical theory to learn both low-level temporal patterns in user activity and higher-order contextual influences across multiple dimensions of user behavior. By doing so, NuCLA captures complex user behavioral patterns while avoiding sparsity issue caused by implicit feedback datasets and achieves significant improvements in accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art DNN-based models. 

In summary, our research seeks to develop a novel algorithmic framework that combines insights from biology and deep learning to accurately recommend relevant news articles to users at scale without relying on explicit ratings or categorical user profiles. NuCLA can model user behavior as well as underlying contexts including topic diversification, interest preference, and historical behaviors. The proposed methodology can help improve the accuracy and relevance of news recommendation systems by leveraging more informative user behavior analysis and enabling real-time personalization based on individual preferences and interaction histories.

### （1）基于用户行为分析的新闻推荐系统
基于用户行为分析的方法包括基于协同过滤（collaborative filtering）的算法、基于内容推荐（content-based recommendation）的算法等。这些方法通常采用对物品评分矩阵进行建模的方式表示用户，将用户和物品之间的交互看作显式反馈，并根据用户过往交互历史预测未来的兴趣和参与度。然而，这些方法面临着隐性反馈数据稀疏性的问题，因此无法处理海量的用户交互数据。此外，现有的基于神经网络的模型，如深层次网络（deep neural network），可以学习非线性关系，但是它们在处理用户交互时仍存在困难。例如，缺乏对用户群体及其活动模式的适应性建模；以及由于训练数据量限制，导致泛化能力差。

### （2）深度神经网络
深度神经网络（deep neural network）是一种前馈型机器学习模型，通过组合简单单元组成复杂的计算图，能够解决很多复杂的任务。它由多个隐藏层组成，每层由多个神经元节点组成，每个节点接收上一层的所有输入信息，并产生相应的输出。多层结构能够自动提取抽象特征，从而使得模型更具一般化能力。目前，深度神经网络已被广泛应用于图像识别、自然语言处理、生物信息学以及其他领域。

### （3）Cortical Theory of Intelligence
Cortical theory is a neuroscientific field that studies the mechanisms involved in the functioning of the human brain. It is named after the structure of the primate cortex, which was first discovered by Eugene McClelland around 70 years ago. Understanding the basic principles behind the functions of cortex and how they interact with each other is essential to understand how brains work and how they can be used to solve complex problems.
