Text classification is one of the most important tasks of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves categorizing text documents into predefined categories or labels based on their contents and structure. A key step towards achieving this goal is to represent each document as a numerical vector using techniques such as Bag-of-Words model or Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme. However, these representations do not capture semantic relationships between words and are generally limited to capturing local features of individual documents. To overcome these limitations, researchers have been exploring other techniques that can learn dense representations from language data.

One popular technique for learning word embeddings is called GloVe. GloVe stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation. The main idea behind GloVe is to train a global matrix of word vectors where similar words will be closer together in the space. Each row in the matrix corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary while each column represents its corresponding vector representation. 

In this article, we will explore how to use pre-trained GloVe word embedding models to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews dataset. We will also discuss some advantages and drawbacks of using word embeddings in text classification tasks. Finally, we will conclude with future directions for further research in this area.

Sentiment Analysis is one of the common text classification tasks in natural language processing. This task involves classifying sentences, articles, or documents into positive or negative polarity classes based on their content. It is widely used in various applications including customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, product review analysis, news aggregation, recommender systems, spam detection etc. The primary objective of sentiment analysis is to identify the overall attitude or opinion expressed by an author in terms of positive or negative directionality.

To achieve high accuracy in sentiment analysis tasks, machine learning algorithms typically rely heavily on feature engineering techniques like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF weighting schemes alongside powerful deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). These approaches require extensive labeled training datasets containing both textual and non-textual features such as aspects of human culture and society related to opinions. Additionally, they often require specialized domain knowledge expertise which limits their scalability across different domains and contexts.

A significant limitation of traditional machine learning methods in sentiment analysis tasks is their dependence on handcrafted features such as bag-of-words and term frequency inverse document frequency. Instead, recent research has focused on exploiting pre-trained word embedding models known as GloVe. GloVe learns continuous distributed vector representations for words in a corpus and generalizes them to new inputs by considering contextual information about the words. These models have shown impressive performance on many natural language processing tasks ranging from speech recognition, question answering, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in leveraging pre-trained word embeddings for text classification tasks. There are several reasons why it is becoming more prominent:

1. Pre-trained word embeddings offer a fast way to obtain rich and accurate features for downstream tasks without requiring tremendous amounts of labeled data.
2. Compared to manual feature engineering, pre-trained word embeddings enable much faster development cycles and reduce errors due to inconsistencies in language and cultural conventions.
3. Pre-trained word embeddings provide a strong foundation for transfer learning, enabling us to build powerful classifiers without starting from scratch every time.
4. Domain-specific word embeddings trained on large corpora of texts allow us to handle complex concepts and subtleties of specific domains better than generic ones.

With all these advantages, it is no longer surprising to see pre-trained word embeddings being used in text classification tasks. One common approach to accomplish this is through deep neural networks architectures built upon pre-trained word embeddings. Specifically, when dealing with text data, we can treat each word in a sentence as a multi-dimensional input and feed them into a neural network. The resulting output layer would contain weights associated with each word embedding, making the final prediction decision based on the combined impact of all the words in the input sentence. By stacking multiple layers of neurons in parallel, we can encode rich semantic meaning of words within each sentence before aggregating them into a single output label.

In this article, we will focus on how to apply pre-trained GloVe word embeddings for performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews dataset. We will follow the following steps:

1. Data preparation - Loading and preprocessing the dataset
2. Feature extraction - Extracting GloVe word embeddings from the dataset
3. Model building - Building a deep neural network classifier using Keras library
4. Training the model - Fitting the keras model object to the extracted features and labels
5. Evaluation - Evaluating the performance of the model on test set using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix
