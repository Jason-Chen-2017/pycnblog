Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data, meaning it can predict outputs based on inputs that are already known with some expected output or correct answer. In supervised learning, there are two types of algorithms: classification and regression. 

Classification refers to predicting discrete outcomes such as whether an email is spam or not (binary classification), or what genre an image belongs to (multi-class classification). Regression refers to predicting continuous values such as stock prices or sales forecasts (continuous regression). The goal of both techniques is to learn patterns in the input data and use those patterns to make predictions about new, unseen data points.

In this article, we will focus on one particular type of supervised learning called "classification", specifically binary classification problems. Binary classification means classifying data into two categories - either yes or no, true or false, etc. For example, if we want to build a system that can detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing transaction logs, our training dataset would contain examples of transactions that were flagged as fraudulent ("yes") and examples that were not ("no"). We then train our algorithm using these labels to learn how to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Once trained, our model can be used to classify new, incoming transactions as either fraudulent or not, depending on their features and behavioral characteristics.

This article assumes basic familiarity with probability theory and linear algebra concepts. If you need a refresher course on these topics, I suggest taking Stanford's Machine Learning courses on Coursera. 

Let's get started!
# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the specifics of binary classification, let's first understand some key terms and concepts related to supervised learning. Here are some definitions:

1. Training set: A collection of labeled examples that our algorithm uses to learn how to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

2. Label: The output value(s) corresponding to each example in the training set. In binary classification, the label takes on only two possible values, typically represented as 0 or 1. 

3. Feature: An individual measurable property or characteristic of an object that describes its appearance, shape, size, or other qualities. In supervised learning, the feature vector consists of all relevant information about the observation, which we pass through the algorithm for prediction.

4. Model: The mathematical representation of our understanding of the world. It captures the relationships among variables (features) and produces predictions for new observations based on those relationships. There are several different models for performing binary classification, including logistic regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes classifiers, k-NN, support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks, and random forests.

5. Loss function: A measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. The loss function gives us a numerical value indicating how well our model is able to explain the relationship between features and labels. For binary classification tasks, common loss functions include the cross-entropy loss and mean squared error. 

Now that we have a general idea of the important concepts involved in binary classification, let's move on to defining our problem statement and exploring the underlying data.

## Problem Statement
Suppose we have a dataset consisting of medical records collected from patients over time. Each record contains information like patient name, age, gender, diagnosis, treatment plan, medication usage, severity score, etc. Our task is to develop a binary classifier that can accurately identify cases where a disease has been cured versus those where it remains ongoing. 

Our dataset might look something like this:

|Patient Name|Age|Gender|Diagnosis|Treatment Plan|Medication Usage|Severity Score|Cure Status|
|------------|---|------|---------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
|John Doe|27|Male|Lung Cancer|Radiotherapy|Yes|High|No|
|Jane Smith|49|Female|Breast Cancer|Chemotherapy|Yes|Medium|No|
|Bob Johnson|52|Male|Prostate Cancer|Hormone Therapy|Yes|Low|Yes|
|Mary Lee|32|Female|Colorectal Cancer|Radiotherapy+Chemotherapy|Yes|High|Yes|

We'll call the input variables/features `X`, while the output variable/label `y` represents the outcome of interest - whether a disease has been successfully treated (`Yes`) or is still active (`No`). To perform binary classification, we need to choose a suitable model that maps each pair of input/output values to a probability score between 0 and 1. One way to do this is via logistic regression. Logistic regression is a widely used model because it provides a simple and efficient approach to modeling binary dependent variables. Specifically, logistic regression estimates the log odds ratio of the predictor variables associated with a binary response, given certain values of the independent variables. This allows us to interpret the coefficients of the model as probabilities.

To estimate the log odds ratio, we use the sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function or activation function:

```math
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
```

where $z$ is the linear combination of weights $\beta_j$ multiplied by the input features $x$:

$$z = w_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{p}w_jx_j$$

Here, $p$ is the number of features, $w_0$, $w_1$,..., $w_p$ are the learned parameters, and $(x_1, x_2,...,x_p)$ represents the observation vector containing the values of the input features for a single instance.

The logit function is the inverse of the sigmoid function, so we can write the log odds ratio as follows:

```math
log(\frac{p(y=1|x)}{1-p(y=1|x)}) = z = w_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{p}w_jx_j
```

where $p(y=1|x)$ is the estimated probability of the positive class (disease cured) given the input features $x$. We can now maximize the likelihood of observing the observed data under a specified model using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or Newton methods. 

Once we've optimized the model to minimize the loss function, we can evaluate its performance on a test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, etc. These measures provide insights into how well our model performs across various subsets of the data, making it easy to tune hyperparameters and compare different approaches. 

Overall, building a binary classification model requires choosing a suitable model architecture, preprocessing the data, selecting appropriate evaluation metrics, and optimizing the model parameters using optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam. With practice and knowledge of fundamental statistics and linear algebra, we can easily design and implement a robust solution to a wide variety of real-world problems.
