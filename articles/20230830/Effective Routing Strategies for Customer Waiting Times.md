Customer waiting times play an important role in customer experience (CX), especially when services are provided over a multi-layered network that involves complex routing protocols and mobility management technologies. As the number of customers increases, so does the complexity involved in managing them across multiple layers and providing optimal service to each individual customer based on their individual characteristics such as demand, location, time preferences, workload etc. 

In this article, we will focus on two aspects related to routing strategies for effective customer waiting times in heterogeneous networks: 

1. How can one efficiently allocate traffic among different paths depending on the characteristics of the customer?
2. Can we identify and use appropriate metrics to evaluate routing policies and select the best policy within a limited computational resource budget?

We start by discussing some background concepts and terminologies relevant to our research topic. Then we move on to discuss core algorithms used in these routing strategies. Next, we present examples using real data sets obtained from Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform, which demonstrate how the proposed routing strategies work in practice. We also provide insights into selecting the best routing strategy under different scenarios. Finally, we conclude with future directions and challenges.

## 2.1 Multi-Layer Network Architecture
The traditional client–server architecture is often used today to implement internet applications such as e-commerce websites, social media platforms, email systems, file sharing servers, online gaming platforms etc. However, as businesses grow, more users require access to various web applications or software tools, leading to a need for a scalable, flexible, and dynamic infrastructure that provides resources to all clients equally efficiently irrespective of their geographic location or device type. This requires a new approach to enable efficient distribution of computing resources. One way to achieve this is through the use of cloud computing where shared resources are dynamically allocated between multiple clients who request them. However, implementing such a system poses several challenges including distributed control, secure communication, data synchronization, availability, and reliability issues. Thus, a multi-layered client–server architecture has emerged to address these concerns while maintaining ease of use, scalability, and flexibility. The figure below depicts the basic concept of a multi-layered network architecture:

 
Each layer consists of its own set of hardware components, networking devices, middleware, and software modules that interact seamlessly with other layers to provide end-to-end functionality. These layers include:

### Client Layer
This layer includes endpoints, browsers, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices that connect to the network via wireless links or wired connections. It handles user authentication, session management, content delivery, and application usage.

### Application Layer
This layer consists of applications like e-commerce websites, social media platforms, email systems, file sharing servers, online gaming platforms, and other computer programs that rely on the network for storing, processing, and transmitting data. It acts as the primary interface between the client layer and the backend server layer.

### Backend Server Layer
This layer contains the main components of the network infrastructure responsible for processing and delivering data. It typically consists of high-performance computers running enterprise operating systems, database servers, caching mechanisms, load balancers, reverse proxies, DNS resolvers, and other functions. It serves as a central hub for processing requests and returning responses back to the client layer.

### Network Infrastructure Layer
This layer includes routers, switches, cables, WAN circuits, and other networking equipment needed to establish connectivity between different layers. They act as gateways to transport packets between nodes at different levels of abstraction and convert them to electrical signals that travel through the physical medium.

### Physical Medium Layer
This layer includes transmission lines, coaxial cables, fiber optic cables, and satellite constellations that carry the digital information over a distance. It enables faster transfer of data than standard phone calls or Internet transmissions because of lower latency and higher bandwidth capacity compared to the speed of light.

## 2.2 Arrival Time Variability
As customers become increasingly mobile, it becomes essential to consider variations in arrival times at each node along the path chosen by the routing protocol. When traffic flows through a network, there are many factors that influence its propagation delay, such as signal attenuation, reflections, multipath fading, and dispersion caused by interferences between devices. To account for variability in arrival times, the optimal route can be selected considering the average waiting time experienced by customers during normal operation, rather than the worst case scenario. Therefore, accurate prediction of arrival times at intermediate nodes is critical to ensure efficient and reliable service provision.

Arrival time variability can occur due to various reasons such as:

- Dynamic changes in traffic flow patterns resulting in fluctuating network conditions such as congestion, bottlenecks, and rebalancing.
- Unstable wireless channels caused by frequency swings and noise.
- Random variations in arrival time due to human error or malfunctioning devices.
- Complex traffic distributions such as workloads, peaks, and troughs.

It’s therefore crucial to design routing protocols that take into account these variations when making decisions about packet forwarding. One such approach is called Flow-Based Load Balancing (FBLB). FBLB uses measurements made by link monitors deployed throughout the network to predict the expected duration of network travel time and adjusts the allocation of available bandwidth accordingly. The algorithm allocates bandwidth proportional to the estimated length of time required to complete the current flow, thus ensuring that queues do not build up too long before they reach full bandwidth utilization.

Therefore, detecting and predicting arrival times accurately is critical to enabling optimal routing in heterogeneous networks with variable traffic loads and delays.
