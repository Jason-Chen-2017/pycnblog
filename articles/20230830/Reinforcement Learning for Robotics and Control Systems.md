# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that learns to make decisions in an environment by interacting with it as a dynamic agent. It involves trial-and-error learning from the experience of the agent's actions and rewards, and the goal is to maximize its long-term reward. RL has been widely applied to robotics and control systems because many real-world problems can be formulated into reinforcement learning tasks such as autonomous driving, manufacturing, inventory management, task scheduling, and social robotics. In this article, we will introduce basic concepts and terminology about reinforcement learning algorithms and applications to robotic systems. We will then talk about several key RL algorithms including Q-learning, policy gradient methods, actor-critic methods, model-based reinforcement learning, and evolutionary algorithms. Finally, we will discuss some techniques related to improving RL performance and demonstrate how these techniques work on common robotics and control systems like mobile robots or humanoid robots. By reading this article, readers should gain insights into the basics of reinforcement learning and apply them to different robotics and control systems scenarios.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Agent and Environment
In RL, there are two main actors: an agent and an environment. The agent acts on the environment to achieve its goals through interactions with the environment which includes the observation of the current state, taking action(s), receiving feedback, and updating its internal states according to the received feedback. 

The agent interacts with the environment either directly or indirectly via sensors and actuators. Sensors sense the environment and capture relevant information, such as the position of objects and obstacles in front of the agent. Actuators manipulate the environment and affect the behavior of other entities based on the agent's decision. An example of sensor could be a camera mounted on top of an airplane to detect pedestrians crossing the road. Similarly, an example of actuator would be a thruster controlling the direction and speed of an aircraft.

The environment could take various forms depending on the application scenario. For instance, in autonomous driving, the environment could include road networks, traffic congestion, nearby vehicles, weather conditions, etc. In this case, the agent would learn to navigate around the environment while avoiding collisions with other agents and maintaining safe distances between itself and others. On the contrary, in industrial automation, where machines need to operate safely under uncertain conditions, the environment would likely consist of various physical components such as production lines, machines, operators, suppliers, inputs/outputs, and humans. Here, the agent would learn to optimize operations under multiple risk factors, such as faulty parts, operator errors, maintenance schedule violations, etc., to minimize downtime and costs. 

## 2.2 Reward Function and Return
The goal of the agent is to maximize its cumulative discounted reward over time. At each time step t=1...T, the agent takes action a_t at the current state s_t, receives a scalar value called the immediate reward r_t, and updates its internal states accordingly. After T steps have passed, the return R_t associated with the episode is computed using the formula:

R_t = sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k+1},

where gamma is a parameter less than 1 that determines the importance of future rewards relative to immediate ones. Intuitively, if the agent wants to quickly get a high reward in the short term, it may prefer rewards over longer periods of time. This leads to increasing discount rate γ until eventually all future rewards are equally important and only the present value is considered during optimization.

## 2.3 Action Space and Policy
An agent's policy is a mapping from the current state s_t to one or more possible actions a_t. The set of valid actions can vary depending on the specific problem being addressed. For instance, in autonomous driving, the agent might consider choosing from predefined behaviors like stopping, accelerating, decelerating, turning left, or right. Alternatively, in chess playing, the agent could choose among available moves given the current state of the board.

The choice of actions a_t depends on both the agent's internal state and any external influences such as noise or stochasticity in the environment. A simple approach for discrete action spaces is to randomly sample an action from a probability distribution given by the agent's policy. However, in continuous action spaces, such as those arising in robotic control systems, more sophisticated policies may involve predicting distributions of actions instead of sampling from them directly.
