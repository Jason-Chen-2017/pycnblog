# 1.简介
  

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into different groups based on their purchase history, demographics, and behavior. By segmenting customers effectively, businesses can gain insights about their customers’ needs and preferences, identify marketing opportunities, improve product quality, and optimize pricing strategies. However, customer segmentation can be challenging when there are millions of potential customers to consider. In this article, we will build a customer segmentation model that utilizes hierarchical clustering technique to group customers into similar groups based on their purchasing behaviors. 

Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that involves creating a hierarchy of clusters based on similarity between data points in a dataset. The goal is to discover sub-groups within larger clusters, or create new clusters with members that do not belong to any existing cluster. Hierarchical clustering has many practical applications such as image processing, text analysis, and bioinformatics. 

In this project, we will use Python programming language along with scikit-learn library for building our models. We will also use a sample dataset consisting of transactions made by customers in a supermarket over a period of one year. Our task is to group these customers into segments based on their purchasing patterns so that they can target specific products or services to them at appropriate prices.


# 2.概念及术语介绍
Before diving into the technical details of our solution, let's first briefly go through some common terms used in customer segmentation:

**Customers**: A customer represents anyone who buys goods or services from a business. Customers usually have unique characteristics like age, gender, income level, marital status, etc., which affect their buying habits and preferences.

**Transaction**: A transaction refers to the interaction between a customer and the business. It could involve multiple items sold by the company, with each item potentially contributing towards a revenue stream. Transactions may occur online or offline, depending on how the sales channel operates.

**Purchasing behavior**: Purchasing behavior refers to the sequence of actions taken by a customer while making a transaction, including the order placed, payment method chosen, delivery address provided, etc. Some of these actions may be more relevant than others in determining whether a customer makes a purchase or not. For instance, if a customer frequently orders large quantities of a particular item, it indicates that she might prefer getting those items delivered rather than picking them up at the store.

**Clustering**: Clustering refers to the process of grouping similar objects together. It helps us identify valuable patterns amongst the entire set of data, allowing us to make predictions or decisions based on subsets of data that share similar traits. We typically use clustering algorithms to find natural groups in data sets, where each group contains related instances or examples.

**K-means clustering**: K-means clustering is a popular clustering algorithm that works by partitioning n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). The main steps involved in K-means clustering are:

1. Define the number of clusters (k) you want your data divided into.
2. Initialize k centroids randomly within the range of the input data.
3. Assign each data point to its closest centroid. If two data points are equidistant from two centroids, choose the one with lower index.
4. Recalculate the centroids by taking the average value of all data points assigned to each centroid.
5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until convergence (i.e., no significant change in centroid positions across iterations).

Note that K-means clustering assumes that the data follows normal distributions and is well separated. If these assumptions are violated, other clustering methods should be considered instead.

Now that we understand what customer segmentation is, let's dive deeper into the topic of this project - building a customer segmentation model using hierarchical clustering.

# 3.模型构建过程
## 3.1 数据处理
To begin with, we need to preprocess the data before feeding it to our clustering algorithm. Specifically, we need to remove duplicates, missing values, and encode categorical variables. Here are the general steps we can follow:

1. Remove duplicate transactions: Since each transaction should only appear once per customer, removing duplicates ensures that we don't double count purchases made by individuals.
2. Fill missing values: Filling missing values can help ensure that our clustering algorithm does not encounter unexpected errors during training. There are several ways to fill missing values, but one simple approach is to replace them with the mode of the corresponding variable.
3. Encode categorical variables: Encoded categorical variables refer to converting string variables such as "Male" or "Sunday" into numeric values. This allows our clustering algorithm to work on numerical features rather than strings.

Once we have preprocessed our data, we need to split it into training and test datasets. The training dataset will be used to train our clustering algorithm, whereas the test dataset will be used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. 

Here is the code to perform data preprocessing:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('customer_segmentation.csv')

# Drop duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Fill missing values with mode
mode = df.mode().iloc[0] # Get the most frequent values
df.fillna(mode, inplace=True)

# Convert categorical variables to numeric
le = LabelEncoder()
for col in ['Gender', 'Day']:
    df[col] = le.fit_transform(df[col])
    
X_train = df.drop(['Revenue'], axis=1)
y_train = df['Revenue']

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print("Training data shape:", X_train.shape)
print("Test data shape:", X_test.shape)
```

This code loads the dataset, drops duplicates, replaces missing values with modes, encodes categorical variables, splits the dataset into training and test sets, and prints out the shapes of both sets.

Let's now look at a single row of the processed data:

|Gender |Age   |Income    |Day       |Frequency |Last Purchase Date |Product Purchased|
|-------|------|----------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
|2      |29    |30000     |0         |2                     |2019-07-01         |TV                |


After being cleaned and encoded, this individual customer has been transformed into:

|Gender |Age   |Income    |Day       |Frequency |Last Purchase Date |Product Purchased|
|-------|------|----------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
|0      |29    |2         |0         |2                     |2019-07-01         |0                 |

The encoding scheme converts female to 0 and male to 1, Sunday to 0, Monday to 1, etc. Note that Product Purchased was converted into a binary indicator (either the customer purchased TV or not), because we assume that the presence/absence of a given product in a customer's transaction history cannot determine her revenue generating behavior.
