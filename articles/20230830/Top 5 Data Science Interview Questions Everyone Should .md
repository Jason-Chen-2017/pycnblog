# 1.简介
  

Data Science (DS) is a field that combines statistical techniques with computer programming languages and software tools to analyze large sets of data in order to extract valuable insights. The primary focus of DS is on the analysis, interpretation, and prediction of complex patterns or relationships within datasets. 

In this article, we are going to answer some basic questions related to what you should know before starting your journey as a Data Scientist. We will also provide pointers for further study so that you can build strong skills in each area. By the end of our conversation, you will be prepared to tackle real-world problems by using data science methods effectively.


Let’s get started! 


# 2.Basic Concepts & Terms
## 2.1 Statistics vs Machine Learning: What's the Difference?
Statistics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data in order to draw conclusions from it. It involves applying mathematical formulas, techniques, and principles to identify trends, find correlations, make predictions, and improve decision-making processes. On the other hand, machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows machines to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. In simpler terms, ML systems automatically recognize patterns and predict outcomes based on previously seen examples rather than just following predetermined instructions like those found in statistics.

Here is an example of how machine learning works: If you have pictures of different animals and want to classify them into one of several categories such as dog, cat, bird, etc., you could use machine learning algorithms to train models that can accurately categorize new images. These models would not require human intervention every time they see a new image; instead, they would "learn" through their interaction with training data over time. 

Machine learning is becoming increasingly important because it enables us to automate tasks that were once performed manually, resulting in significant improvements in productivity and efficiency. This includes automated text classification, object recognition, speech recognition, and recommendation engines among many others. Additionally, recent advances in deep learning techniques have allowed for advanced neural networks to outperform traditional machine learning approaches, achieving high accuracy even when trained on limited amounts of labeled data.

So if you're interested in pursuing a career in data science, whether it's a student who wants to specialize in statistics or a professional looking to leverage ML capabilities for greater impact, I recommend exploring both areas to see which ones best align with your goals. You'll be able to choose the course of action that most directly matches your current skill set and interests, leading to a more fulfilling and rewarding career development experience.


## 2.2 Types of Data: Categorical, Numerical, Textual, and Other
In addition to its underlying statistical properties, data comes in various forms depending on its source, purpose, size, and intended use. Here are four main types of data commonly encountered in data science:

1. **Categorical**: A categorical variable represents discrete unordered values, such as gender, color, nationality, occupation, and education level. Examples include variables describing customers' characteristics, products' attributes, or website traffic behavior.

2. **Numerical**: A numerical variable represents continuous numeric values, such as age, income, temperature, speed, distance, and duration. Examples include variables measuring sales revenue, customer ratings, stock prices, or web page load times.

3. **Textual**: Textual data refers to strings of characters used to represent natural language and social media content. Examples include news articles, tweets, reviews, e-mails, comments, or messages. 

4. **Other**: There may be additional data types beyond these four common ones. For instance, audio/video recordings may involve signals recorded digitally alongside metadata, making them worth considering as well. 

All of these data types share certain features, including:

1. Structured versus unstructured: Some data, such as structured tables or relational databases, are organized in a way that allows for efficient access and manipulation. Others, such as text documents or unstructured videos, lack organizational structure and must be analyzed piecemeal. 

2. Temporal: Time series data are often collected at regular intervals, enabling analysts to track changes over time and gain insight into trends and behaviors.

3. Heterogeneous: Not all data sources contain the same types of information. Databases might store multiple types of data such as financial transactions, medical records, and patient health histories, whereas log files containing system events may only contain textual data.

By understanding the fundamentals behind data types and how they fit together, you'll be better equipped to handle any type of data you encounter during your data exploration and analysis phase. 


## 2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Why EDA Is Important 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), also known as Data Understanding and Preparation, is an essential step in any data science project. Its goal is to understand the overall structure, distributions, and correlations of the dataset, as well as identifying any potential issues or inconsistencies that could affect subsequent steps. To perform EDA efficiently, here are the key components to keep in mind:

1. Business Understanding: Gain a clear understanding of the business requirements, expectations, and constraints involved in the project.

2. Data Sources: Identify the source(s) of the data and verify that it meets the necessary criteria for inclusion. Use appropriate tools, libraries, and APIs to gather and clean the data.

3. Data Quality: Ensure that the data is accurate, relevant, complete, and up-to-date. Check for missing values, duplicates, incorrect formats, and outliers.

4. Data Structure: Determine the shape and layout of the data to determine whether it requires transforming, aggregating, or splitting to enable efficient analysis.

5. Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics that describe the distribution of the data, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance. These metrics can give clues about possible outliers, skewness, and identifiable patterns.

6. Visualization: Create visualizations that showcase the relationship between variables and reveal hidden patterns and relationships. Charts such as scatter plots, histograms, heat maps, boxplots, and time series can help highlight trends and relationships.

7. Assumptions: Make assumptions and test them against evidence to validate or invalidate the validity of the model chosen. Analyze results based on the strength and weaknesses of the assumptions, and revise the model or data collection strategy accordingly.

Once EDA is complete, you should have a good idea of the shape, size, and composition of the dataset, as well as any suspicious or problematic aspects that need further inspection. With this knowledge in hand, you can move forward with preprocessing, feature selection, modeling, and evaluation phases, allowing you to dive deeper into the true story of your data.
