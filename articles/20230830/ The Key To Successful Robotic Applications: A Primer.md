# 1.简介
  

Robotics has emerged as a major research area over the past decade and is changing our lives in many ways. From factory automation to disaster response, robots are revolutionizing our industries by enabling us to perform tasks faster and more efficiently than ever before. In this article, we will take a look at key concepts of robotics and algorithms used for building successful robotic applications. We will also discuss how these principles can be applied towards solving practical problems such as autonomous navigation, manipulation, inspection, and safety.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
2.1 What is Robotics?
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that involves designing machines capable of perceiving the world around them, reasoning about it, and manipulating it. It employs various techniques like mechanical engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, artificial intelligence (AI), and economics to develop such machines. 

2.2 Types of Robots
There are several types of robots based on their capabilities and functions:

2.2.1 Industrial Robots 
Industrial robots use advanced technologies for processing data and making decisions. They have the capability to manufacture products or complete specific tasks with high precision accuracy and speed. Some examples of industrial robots include SCARA robots, lathe robots, pipe welder robots, and metal forming machines.

2.2.2 Mobile Robots 
Mobile robots operate independently and move freely through unknown environments without any human assistance. These robots are mainly used in exploration and mapping operations, surveillance systems, transportation, and logistics. Some examples of mobile robots include unmanned vehicles, quadcopters, and drones.

2.2.3 Humanoid Robots 
Humanoid robots imitate the movements and actions of humans including posture, gaits, voice, gestures, and facial expressions. They provide realistic and immersive simulations of life-like interactions between people and technology. Examples of humanoid robots include Microsoft Kinect, Google Glass, and Amazon's Alexa. 

2.3 Control Systems
A control system is a software component that allows controlling devices to achieve desired outputs under specified conditions. It consists of hardware and software components that interact to generate signals or commands to regulate the device’s behavior. Various control systems exist within different application domains, ranging from simple position control to complex multi-agent coordination. Some popular control systems for robotics include closed-loop feedback control, open-loop feedback control, and hybrid control. 

# 3.Core Algorithms & Operations Steps
In order to build a functional robotic system, we need to know the core algorithms and operations involved in its operation. Here are some of the essential algorithms involved in building robotic systems:

## Navigation Algorithms
Navigation refers to the process of determining the current location and orientation of a robot within an environment. This includes calculating the optimal path to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. There are various algorithms that can be used for performing navigation tasks, such as A* search algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, and Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT).

## Manipulation Algorithms
Manipulation refers to the ability of a robot to manipulate objects in its environment using end effectors attached to itself. There are numerous algorithms and techniques used for implementing robotic grasping and manipulation tasks, such as parallel jaw grippers, kinematic controllers, Cartesian impedance controllers, force/torque sensors, and object recognition.

## Sensing Algorithms
Sensing refers to the collection of information about the surrounding environment that enables a robot to make accurate predictions and take action. One example of sensing technique is camera-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) which uses visual sensors to map the environment and track the movement of the robot. Other common sensing techniques include sonar, ultrasound, and laser rangefinders.

## Planning Algorithms
Planning refers to the process of generating plans for achieving certain goals in uncertain environments. Plan generation involves creating sequences of actions that lead to a desired outcome. Common planning algorithms include particle filters, belief propagation, and decision trees.

## Decision Making Algorithms
Decision-making algorithms enable a robot to select among multiple possible actions based on available sensor readings and other factors. The main challenge in making decision is dealing with uncertainty and dynamic changes in the environment. Popular decision-making algorithms include Bayesian networks, Markov decision processes, and reinforcement learning.

# 4.Examples and Code
Now let's consider some practical examples where these fundamental principles can be applied to build successful robotic applications.

## Autonomous Navigation
Autonomous navigation is a critical aspect of many robotic applications that require mobility. The primary objective of an autonomous navigation system is to plan routes through an unknown environment, identify obstacles, and navigate safely to a target destination. This requires combining various algorithms like localization, path planning, obstacle detection, and motion planning into a cohesive framework. An implementation of such an approach can be found in ROS (Robot Operating System), an open source robotics middleware tool.

Here is an example code snippet showing how the A* algorithm can be implemented in Python using the numpy library:

```python
import numpy as np

def heuristic(p1, p2):
    """Euclidean distance heuristic"""
    return np.linalg.norm(np.array(p1)-np.array(p2))

def a_star(start, goal, grid, h=heuristic):
    """Returns a list of tuples as a path from start to goal in grid."""
    if start == goal:
        return []

    # Initialize variables
    frontier = [(heuristic(start, goal), start)]
    visited = set()

    # Loop until the frontier becomes empty
    while frontier:
        f, curr = heapq.heappop(frontier)

        # Check if we reached the goal state
        if curr == goal:
            return _reconstruct_path(curr, parent)

        # Add current state to visited states
        visited.add(curr)

        # Generate children nodes
        children = get_children(grid, curr)

        # Update frontier with valid child nodes
        for child in children:

            # Skip visited nodes
            if child in visited:
                continue

            tentative_g_score = g_score[curr] + cost(curr, child)

            # If node was not seen yet, add it to the frontier
            if child not in came_from:
                heapq.heappush(frontier, (tentative_g_score + h(child, goal), child))
                came_from[child] = curr
                g_score[child] = tentative_g_score

                # Remember the total number of explored nodes so far
                n += 1

                # Return failure if the maximum number of iterations exceeded
                if n > max_iterations:
                    print("Failed to find a solution")
                    return None

    # Failed to find a solution
    assert False, "Failed to find a solution"


def _reconstruct_path(goal, parent):
    """Reconstructs a path from the goal node to the starting node"""
    path = [goal]
    while path[-1]!= start:
        path.append(parent[path[-1]])
    path.reverse()
    return path
```

This code defines a function `a_star` that takes two arguments: `start`, which represents the starting position of the agent; `goal`, which represents the ending position of the agent; and `grid`, which is a rectangular matrix representing the environment. The `h` argument specifies the heuristic function used to calculate the estimated cost of moving from one cell to another. The function returns a list of tuples representing the path from the starting position to the ending position.

The actual implementation details of the `get_children` and `cost` functions depend on the specific problem being solved. For instance, in an autonomous driving scenario, these functions could involve navigating along roads, following lanes, and detecting pedestrians. However, they should always output a list of possible next positions that can be moved to from the current position.
