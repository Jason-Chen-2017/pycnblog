# 1.简介
  

In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have revolutionized computer vision research and have led to some of the most impressive image synthesis results in recent times. Despite their success, they still require careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve high-quality outputs. This is a well-known issue in GAN training that can be alleviated by using techniques such as weight clipping or adding gradient penalty regularization. However, these approaches rely on modifying the generator loss function during training which might hinder convergence due to an increase in discriminator overshooting. In this paper, we propose a new method called Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), which uses the concept of kernel invariance property instead of modifying the generator loss directly. We show that by leveraging the theoretical properties of Wasserstein distance, we are able to train GANs more stably and converge faster than existing methods without significant degradation in quality. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in improving generalization performance.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were proposed in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow et al. They consist of two neural networks competing against each other in a game-theoretic framework. The generator network learns to produce realistic images from random inputs while the discriminator tries to distinguish between generated and real images. During training, both models are updated iteratively with respect to a minimax objective function. At every step, the generator attempts to generate samples that fool the discriminator into believing them to be real, while the discriminator aims to correctly classify real and fake samples. 

Recently, the theory of Generative Models has become increasingly interested in the problem of stable training for deep neural networks. This leads to several works investigating how to make the models less dependent on initialization and improve model stability through techniques like weight normalization or dropout regularization. Moreover, there are also efforts trying to understand why certain GAN architectures perform better than others and developing novel GAN architectures that take advantage of the specific structure of data distribution. 

 # 3.基本概念术语说明
The key idea behind our proposal is to use the theoretical properties of Wasserstein distance to modify the generator loss instead of directly modifying it. Here are some important terms and concepts used in our work:

 ## Discriminator
As mentioned earlier, the discriminator plays the role of a binary classifier that takes a sample and produces a probability value indicating whether it came from the true dataset or was produced by the generator. It receives input batches of real and fake samples from the respective datasets, respectively, along with corresponding labels. The goal of the discriminator is to minimize the classification error of its input, making accurate predictions on both types of samples. The discriminator is trained in a standard supervised learning setting using backpropagation. Given a fixed generator output $x_g$, we can calculate the score assigned by the discriminator to any given real or fake sample $\hat{y}_i$:

  \begin{equation}
  \hat{y}_i = D(x_i) = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{||f_\theta(x_i) - c_\psi(x_i)||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)}
                             {\sum_{j=1}^N \exp\left(\frac{||f_\theta(x_j) - c_\psi(x_j)||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)}, 
  \end{equation}
  
  where $f$ represents the feature extractor function that maps an input image to a dense feature vector representation, $\theta$ denotes the weights of the feature extractor, $\sigma$ is a scale parameter, and $c_\psi$ is another function that generates a set of reference samples from the same distribution as the input.

 ## Gradient Penalty Regularization
One way to prevent mode collapse and enhance the robustness of GANs is to add gradient penalty regularization. This involves calculating the directional derivative of the discriminator’s output w.r.t. the generator’s input and penalizing the magnitude of the gradients if they exceed a pre-defined threshold. Mathematically, the gradient penalty term can be written as follows:

  \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{GP}(\theta) = \beta \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\widetilde{x}~\sim~p_{\widetilde{data}}}[\|\nabla_\theta D(f_\theta(\widetilde{x}))\|_2 - 1]^2, 
  \end{equation}
  
  where $\beta$ is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the penalty, $\widetilde{x}$ is a randomly sampled mini-batch of noise vectors drawn from a standard normal distribution, and $D$ again refers to the discriminator. 

## Feature Space Biases
To further improve the stability of GANs, we introduce a notion of “feature space biases”. These refer to the tendency of the generator to produce images that exhibit a particular visual characteristic, such as being dominated by black backgrounds or showing wide facial features. By modeling the distribution of feature vectors in latent space, we can learn to discriminate between samples that belong to different classes based on this bias information. To accomplish this, we define two functions that map an input image to a low dimensional feature vector representation and vice versa:

  \begin{equation}
  z_l = g_{\phi}(x) \\
  x_k = f_{\theta}(z_k).
  \end{equation}
  
We then train the discriminator to maximize the likelihood of classifying both real and fake samples based only on the shared features extracted from the input images. Mathematically, the Lebesgue measure of the Gaussian distribution is defined as follows:

  \begin{equation}
  \mu_{\epsilon} = \mathbb{E}_{\epsilon~\sim~N(0,I)}\left[\mathbf{z}+\epsilon\right],
  \end{equation}
  
  where $\mathbf{z}$ is the latent variable representing the input image, $\epsilon$ is a zero-mean i.i.d. random vector, and $I$ is the identity matrix. If $z$ is distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $C$, then the probability density of observing a point $\mathbf{x}$ at position $(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{z})^\top C^{-1}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{z})$ equals $\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}\det(C)}$. By comparing the feature vectors obtained from the generator output and the corresponding ones from the reference sample, we can estimate the Wasserstein distance between the distributions:
  
  \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{W}(P_\text{real}, P_\text{fake}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}~\sim~P_\text{real}}\left[D(f_{\theta}(g_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}))-\frac{1}{2})\right]
                                                                                                     + \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}~\sim~P_\text{fake}}\left[-D(f_{\theta}(g_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}))+\frac{1}{2})\right].
  \end{equation}
  
  
 # 4.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤
 ## Preliminaries
Before delving into the core algorithm, let's first recall some preliminary concepts and notation used in GAN training. Specifically, let us assume we have two populations of data points, one called the real data $\mathcal{D}_r$ and the other called the fake data $\mathcal{D}_f$. We also assume that we have a mapping function $G:\mathcal{Z} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$, where $\mathcal{Z}$ represents the set of latent variables used to represent the input data, and $\mathcal{X}$ represents the domain of the target data. Also, we will fix a distribution over the $\mathcal{X}$ space, typically represented as a probability density function $p_{X}$. We wish to find a generator function $G$ that can transform the input $\mathcal{Z}$ to realistic synthetic data $\mathcal{X}$ close to $p_{X}$ under the constraint that the discriminator must return probabilities that are equal to either one for the real data points or zeros for the fake data points.

## Algorithm Overview
Our proposed algorithm consists of four main steps:

1. Initialization: Initialize the parameters of the generator $G_{\phi}$ and discriminator $D_{\theta}$ using suitable initial values.
2. Input Sampling: Sample a batch of random noise vectors from the standard normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ to feed to the generator $G_{\phi}$.
3. Generation Step: Generate fake data $\mathcal{X}_f = G_{\phi}(\mathcal{Z}_f; \theta)$ using the current parameter values $\theta$. 
4. Update Discriminator: Use the real and fake data to update the parameters $\theta$ of the discriminator using backpropagation. 

For the implementation details of each step, please see sections below. 

 ### Generator Loss Function
 Our original GAN architecture relies on the sigmoid cross entropy loss function for updating the discriminator. However, since we want to leverage the Wasserstein metric to measure the distance between the real and fake distributions, we need to modify the generator loss accordingly. One common choice is to use the least squares loss:
 
 \begin{equation}
 \mathcal{L}_G(\theta) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m\left[(f_\theta(G_{\phi}(\mathcal{Z}_i)) - c_\psi(G_{\phi}(\mathcal{Z}_i)))^\top (\frac{(c_\psi(G_{\phi}(\mathcal{Z}_i)) - p_{X}(G_{\phi}(\mathcal{Z}_i)))}{\sqrt{(c_\psi(G_{\phi}(\mathcal{Z}_i)) - p_{X}(G_{\phi}(\mathcal{Z}_i)))^2+(1/T)}} + r(G_{\phi}(\mathcal{Z}_i))\right],
 \end{equation}
 
 where $m$ is the number of samples in the minibatch, $\theta$ represents the parameters of the generator, $G_{\phi}$ the generator function, $\mathcal{Z}_i$ the $i$-th input noise vector, $f_\theta$ the feature extraction function, $c_\psi$ the source distribution encoder, $p_{X}$ the target distribution decoder, $r(G_{\phi}(\mathcal{Z}_i))$ is a regularizer added to enforce Lipschitz continuity and prevents vanishing or exploding gradients when optimizing the generator. 
 
### Updating Parameters 
Given the above expression for the generator loss, the key insight of our algorithm is that we should change the discriminator loss so that the generator loss becomes optimized indirectly through the trade-off between the distance between the real and fake distributions and the discriminator's accuracy on fake examples. Therefore, the discriminator loss can be expressed as follows:
 
\begin{align*}
&\mathcal{L}_D(\theta) &= -\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_X}[\log D_{\theta}(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{z\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\log (1-D_{\theta}(G_{\phi}(z;\theta)))] \\
&+ \lambda_1\mathbb{E}_{z\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[(f_{\theta}(G_{\phi}(z;\theta)) - c_{\psi}(G_{\phi}(z;\theta)))^\top(f_{\theta}(G_{\phi}(z;\theta)) - c_{\psi}(G_{\phi}(z;\theta)))],\\
&\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad + \lambda_2 \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{m}|f_{\theta}(G_{\phi}(z_i;\theta)) - c_{\psi}(G_{\phi}(z_i;\theta))|,\\
&\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad + \lambda_3 \|D_{\theta}\|^2.
\end{align*}

Here, we use the fact that the discriminator predicts probabilities of the form $\hat{y}=sigmoid(f_\theta(x)+b)$ where $b$ is a scalar offset and computes the log-likelihood of $\hat{y}$ given the label $y$. The $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ coefficients control the impact of the second order difference term and the Lipschitz continuity constraint on the generator loss, respectively. The third term enforces smoothness constraints on the discriminator parameters. Since $\hat{y}$ depends on $\theta$ and changes as the generator parameters are updated, computing $\hat{y}(x)$ requires evaluating the discriminator network twice per iteration, once inside the generator forward pass and once outside the backward pass to compute the gradients of the discriminator.

The above expressions for the discriminator and generator losses include all necessary components required to optimize the objective. We begin by initializing the parameters of the generator and discriminator using appropriate initial values and moving towards the solution of the optimization problem using stochastic gradient descent updates. We repeat the process until the discriminator loss stops changing significantly or the maximum iterations limit is reached.
