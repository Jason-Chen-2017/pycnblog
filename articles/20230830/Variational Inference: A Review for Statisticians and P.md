# 1.简介
  

Variational inference (VI) is a class of probabilistic models that make use of techniques such as stochastic gradient descent to find the optimal parameter values given an intractable likelihood function. It was first proposed by J<NAME> Welling in 2011, although earlier works have also used it. VI has been widely applied in machine learning, natural language processing, and other areas where tractable likelihoods are difficult or impossible to compute directly. 

In this article, we will review key concepts related to variational inference and highlight how they can be applied to solve complex problems in data science, statistics, and computer science. We will introduce several popular VI algorithms including ADVI, SVGD, SGVB, and Laplace approximation, and discuss their advantages, limitations, and applications. Finally, we will present some examples of using these algorithms to solve real-world statistical problems, including Bayesian inference for logistic regression, latent variable modeling with deep neural networks, and Gaussian mixture model clustering. By reviewing this topic in detail, you should feel comfortable working with VI methods and applying them effectively to solve various types of problems in different fields.

The contents of this paper are arranged into six sections, each covering one aspect of variational inference, from basic definitions and principles to specific algorithms like Advi, SVG, SgvB, and Laplace approximation. We hope that this guidebook helps practitioners and researchers understand the fundamentals behind variational inference, enabling them to apply it effectively to tackle complex problems in data analysis and machine learning.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Introduction to Variational Inference 
Probabilistic models assume that there exists a set of possible outcomes called the "sample space" and assigns probabilities to all possible outcomes based on observed data. The goal of most probabilistic models is to estimate the true probability distribution of the sample space. However, computing the true probability distribution may not always be feasible due to computational constraints or even intractability of the problem at hand. In such cases, alternate approaches must be taken, which involve approximating the true distribution using a simpler approach, known as variational inference. 

Variational inference involves finding an approximation of the posterior distribution of parameters $\theta$ given observations $x$. Let us denote the true joint distribution of $(\theta, x)$ as $p(\theta, x)$. The task is to learn a family of distributions over $\theta$, $q_{\phi}(\theta|x)$, where $\phi$ is a set of parameters and $q$ represents the mapping from the observation space to the latent variables. 

The main idea behind variational inference is to choose $q_{\phi}$ so that its expected divergence from $p$ is minimized subject to certain regularization constraints. This means that we want to minimize the KL divergence between $q_{\phi}$ and the true posterior distribution, but also enforce some prior beliefs about the form of $q_{\phi}$. These priors help ensure that our approximate posterior is close enough to the true posterior while still allowing for uncertainty. Once we have found the best approximation, we can use it to generate samples from the learned model, predict new outputs, or perform other downstream tasks. 





## 2.2 Types of Variational Approaches

 Variational inference can be categorized according to three main approaches: full-rank and low-rank, deterministic and nondeterministic, and mean field and moment matching. Here's an overview of each type of variational inference method:

  - **Full-Rank** variational inference methods try to optimize a lower bound on the log marginal probability of the observed data under the variational distribution. The lower bound uses both the recognition network and the generative model to represent the joint distribution $p(x, \theta)$, where $x$ represents the observed data and $\theta$ represents the latent variables. Full-rank VI methods include Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI), Stochastic Gradient VB (SVB), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).
  
    While the exact solution to optimizing the objective may be intractable, numerical optimization methods can be used to find approximate solutions that satisfy a desired tolerance level. Therefore, full-rank variational inference offers fast convergence rates and efficient computation times compared to competing methods.
    
  - **Low-Rank** variational inference methods aim to optimize a lower bound on the log marginal probability of the observed data under the variational distribution without explicitly representing the entire joint distribution $p(x, \theta)$. Instead, they seek to learn a reduced representation of the joint distribution, usually obtained through factorization of the covariance matrix. Low-rank VI methods include Deep Exponential Family (DEF) and Matrix-Normal (MN) conjugate vibrations (CVV).
    
    These methods often outperform full-rank methods when the number of dimensions grows too large to efficiently represent the entire joint distribution. For example, MN CVV can scale well up to tens of thousands of dimensions, whereas full-rank methods require exponentially many parameters. 
    
  - **Deterministic** variational inference methods optimize a lower bound on the negative Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) instead of the log marginal probability, making them suitable for models that do not admit an analytic solution. Examples of deterministic VI methods include DREML and Black Box Variational Inference (BBVI).
    
    BBVI computes gradients implicitly by simulating forward passes through the generative model and then using a second-order optimization algorithm like Adam or L-BFGS to refine the initial estimates of the latent variables.
  
  - **Nondeterministic** variational inference methods focus on approximating the variational distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques. These methods incorporate the proposal distribution obtained via importance sampling, resulting in improved mixing properties and more accurate results than standard deterministic methods. Nondeterministic VI methods include MCMC VI, Mean Field VI (MFVI), and Gibbs Sampler Variational Inference (GSVI).
    
We'll now dive deeper into each category of variational inference methods and explore how they differ qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of performance and scalability.  

## 2.3 Variational Inference Methods: Advi, SVGD, SGVB, and Laplace Approximation
 ### 2.3.1 AutoDiff Variational Inference (Advi)
 

AutoDifferentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) is a simple but powerful tool for fitting a wide variety of Bayesian models. It belongs to the class of full-rank variational inference methods because it optimizes the ELBO while also taking into account a prior over the hyperparameters of the variational distribution. ADVI works by iteratively updating the location of the approximate posterior distribution until the change in ELBO becomes small. Each iteration consists of two steps:

  1. Forward pass: Compute the derivative of the ELBO with respect to the parameters of the variational distribution. 
   
  2. Update step: Use the computed derivatives to update the location of the variational distribution. This involves adjusting the mean vector and the diagonal precision matrix of the normal distribution depending on whether the current point is better or worse than the previous points.

To avoid local minima and improve exploration, ADVI employs a random search strategy during the update process, initializing the distribution randomly around previously accepted locations. The algorithm terminates either after a fixed number of iterations or if no improvement in the ELBO is seen within a specified number of iterations. ADVI does not rely on any special assumptions about the structure of the generative model, unlike more advanced methods like MFVI. Despite being relatively simple, ADVI can handle a wide range of models and datasets due to its automatic nature.

### 2.3.2 Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)

Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is another simple yet effective algorithm for variational inference. Unlike traditional variational inference algorithms that depend heavily on expensive mathematical calculations, SVGD only requires evaluating the gradient of a few loss functions (such as KL divergence and log-likelihood) at every step. SVGD is therefore much faster than ADVI, especially for high-dimensional models or very large datasets. 

The heart of SVGD lies in constructing a kernel matrix that maps the latent variables to the input features, similar to the RBF kernel commonly used in support vector machines. At each step, SVGD updates the parameters of the kernel matrix by using stochastic gradient descent with mini-batches. Specifically, SVGD performs the following steps at each iteration:

  1. Draw a mini-batch of training data pairs ($\{x_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^m$) and corresponding weights $\{w_j\}_{j=1}^{|\mathcal{Z}|}$, where $m$ is the size of the batch and $\mathcal{Z}=\{(z^k)\}_{k=1}^{K}$ is the set of all latent variables. 
  
  2. Define the Gram matrix $K_{ij}=k(x_i, z_j)$, where $z_j$ is the jth latent variable sampled from $q_{\phi}(z|x_i)$ for $j = 1,\dots,|\mathcal{Z}|$. 
   
  3. Calculate the gradients of the loss functions with respect to the parameters of the kernel matrix, i.e., $\frac{\partial}{\partial K}\ell(K; X;\mathbf{w})$ for each pair of inputs $x_i$ and $y_i$. 
   
  4. Update the kernel matrix using the computed gradients and a chosen optimizer, such as stochastic gradient descent with momentum or Adam.

Since SVGD only evaluates gradients of the loss functions at each step, it avoids unnecessary computations and can be easily parallelized across multiple GPUs or nodes. Furthermore, SVGD supports incomplete observability, meaning that it can handle missing data or partially observed datasets without further modification. Additionally, SVGD allows for dynamic kernel matrices, which can adaptively capture the relationships among the latent variables and enable expressiveness beyond a simple RBF kernel.

### 2.3.3 Sum-Of-Gaussians Variational Bounds (SGVB)

Sum-of-Gaussians Variational Bounds (SGVB) is a generalization of ADVI to continuous latent variables. As opposed to discrete latent variables, continuous variables typically possess additional degrees of freedom that need to be handled appropriately in order to achieve good approximate posteriors. To address this issue, SGVB proposes to replace the standard ELBO with a closed-form expression that includes expectations over continuous variables. Specifically, the ELBO takes the form:

$$\log p(X;\theta) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}}[\log \frac{p(X,Z;\theta)}{q_{\phi}(Z|X)}] + KL[q_{\phi}(Z|X)||p(Z)]$$

where $Z$ represents the continuous latent variables, and $KL[q_{\phi}(Z|X)||p(Z)]$ is the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the variational distribution and the prior distribution.

To optimize the ELBO, SGVB approximates the expectation term inside the parentheses using Monte Carlo integration, giving rise to a Monte Carlo dropout procedure. The key idea here is to repeatedly draw subsets of $Z$ from the variational distribution and evaluate the target density $p(X,Z;\theta)$ for those subsets. Since the target density depends on both the data and the continuous latent variables, it cannot be evaluated analytically. However, SGVB uses stochastic gradient descent to optimize the approximate q-distribution using backpropagation and the reparameterization trick, which enables the calculation of the gradients of the target density.

Like ADVI, SGVB also supports adaptive priors and supports a wide range of models and datasets thanks to its elegant derivation and ease of implementation. On the other hand, SGVB requires careful initialization of the variational distribution to avoid degeneracy and poor exploration behavior, making it less practical than ADVI for complex models. Nevertheless, SGVB remains a promising alternative for solving challenging problems with continuous latent variables.

### 2.3.4 Laplace Approximation

Laplace approximation, also known as Fisher information maximum principle, is a classic technique for approximating the posterior distribution of a Bayesian model. Laplace approximation assumes that the posterior distribution is a multivariate Gaussian with unknown mean and variance, and tries to maximize the log-posterior density under a certain set of hypotheses. More specifically, Laplace approximation constructs a Hessian matrix at the MAP estimate and solves the equation:

$$\nabla_\theta \log p(D|\theta) = (\nabla_\theta^2 \log p(D|\theta))^{-1} \nabla_\theta \log p(D|\theta) $$

This equation provides a theoretical justification for why we choose the mean-field assumption in a Bayesian model, since the determinants of the Hessian provide a measure of uncertainty for the estimated parameters. However, Laplace approximation can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets or models with high dimensionality. Consequently, Laplace approximation is mostly used as a heuristic approach rather than a rigorous way of performing inference. Nevertheless, Laplace approximation provides a good starting point for understanding the role of the mean-field assumption in Bayesian models and for providing insights into more sophisticated variational inference algorithms.
