# 1.简介
  

In recent years, a lot has been done in the field of machine learning and deep learning using neural networks. One of such techniques is called t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). This algorithm takes high dimensional data as input and converts it into a two or three dimensional space where similar points are close together and dissimilar ones are far away from each other. It helps us to visualize complex data sets and identify clusters among them. But what exactly does this algorithm produce? How can we interpret its results to gain meaningful insights about our data? In this blog post, I will explain the basic concepts behind t-SNE, and then go on to explore different ways we can use these visualizations to analyze and gain insights into our data. I will also present some code snippets that showcase how we can implement t-SNE for various applications like image clustering, text analysis, and document classification.

## 2.1 T-SNE: Introduction and Theory
T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize high dimensional data. The algorithm starts by calculating the similarity between the data samples using a distance metric like Euclidean Distance. Then, it normalizes the values between -1 and +1 to help the algorithm converge faster during optimization. After that, it applies a Student's t-distribution function to the similarities calculated earlier to calculate the probability distribution of the original datapoints being embedded in the lower dimensions. Finally, it uses Bayesian Optimization to find the best positions for the mapped data points while keeping their local structures intact. These steps lead to a low-dimensional representation of the original data which captures most of its structure without any loss of information. Here's a schematic representation of the whole process:



The above figure shows the general flowchart of the t-SNE algorithm. Given high dimensional dataset $X$, firstly, it calculates pairwise distances $\forall_{i\neq j} d_{ij}$. Next, it normalizes the value range of each feature to be within [-1,+1] so that it can work with small weight updates during optimization. Once the normalization step is complete, the algorithm applies a Student’s t-distribution function over the normalized distances to obtain probabilities per sample based on their proximity to others. Based on these probabilities, the algorithm estimates the joint probability of every possible pair of features given a fixed position in the low-dimensional map. Finally, the algorithm optimizes the parameters of the mapping function using Bayesian Optimization methods to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution obtained from the optimized map and the true joint distribution of the original data. The final result of the algorithm is a set of low-dimensional embeddings of the data points which capture most of its global structure.

## 2.2 Visualizing high-dimensional data using t-SNE
So, now that you have a good understanding of what t-SNE is all about, let's see how we can use it to understand and visualize high-dimensional data. We'll start by exploring what happens when we plot the data points directly on the x-y plane or z-axis. 

Let's say we have a dataset consisting of six points in R^2, namely (x_1, y_1),..., (x_6, y_6), i.e., we have only one feature variable. If we try plotting these points directly on the x-y plane, we would get something like this:


This doesn't look very informative since there is no clear cluster separation or correlation among the data points. Now, if we apply the t-SNE algorithm to this same dataset, we get something like this:


Here, we see that even though the data points were plotted on the x-y plane originally, they are much closer to each other after applying t-SNE. Hence, t-SNE helps us to visualize complex datasets in a way that is easy to interpret. Additionally, we can see that t-SNE assigns different colors to the data points indicating their membership to different clusters. Thus, we can easily identify patterns and outliers in the data.

Similarly, if we consider a dataset of n points in R^m > 2, we need multiple dimensions to represent it effectively. When m = 2, we can still use t-SNE but instead of plotting the points directly on the xy-plane, we need to choose another direction to project the data onto. For instance, if we want to project the data along the z-axis, we get the following visualization:


Again, t-SNE makes it easier to visualize high-dimensional data, especially when we don't know the underlying geometry of the data beforehand. Also, we can easily identify clusters and distinguish patterns by observing the color assignments of the data points. Therefore, t-SNE provides us a powerful tool to analyze and gain insights into our data.
