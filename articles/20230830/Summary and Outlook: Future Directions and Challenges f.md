## 1.1概述
Differential evolution (DE) is a population-based stochastic optimization algorithm that belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). It was proposed in 2005 by Deb et al., which can perform global optimization over complex high-dimensional spaces with few or no constraints. In recent years, DE has been extensively applied to various fields such as computer science, engineering, biology, economics, and artificial intelligence, making it one of the most popular and effective optimization techniques used today. This article will summarize the basic concept of differential evolution algorithms including mutation, crossover, selection process, convergence criteria, and some widely used variants of this algorithm. Moreover, we will explore the potential advantages and limitations of DE in solving problems in various fields, discuss some future directions and challenges of its application, and provide several practical examples. Finally, readers are encouraged to comment on these perspectives and suggestions are welcome.
