Augmented Reality (AR) is becoming increasingly popular in the field of robotics and has attracted many researchers from different fields such as computer science, engineering, psychology, etc. AR technology can be used for various applications like augmented human-computer interface, augmented manufacturing system, virtual tourism, medical diagnosis, and so on.

In this blog article we will discuss about interactive robot navigation using AR techniques. In general, an interactive robot navigation technique involves motion capture data collection, data processing, path planning, localization, control algorithm design, trajectory generation, and finally real-time visualization to provide a user friendly environment. We will also explain how AR can be integrated into these algorithms to provide immersive views to the users along with a natural interaction experience. 

Furthermore, recent advancements in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and mobile computing are making it possible to create highly accurate and robust models that can recognize objects, plan paths, and navigate safely. In order to integrate these advanced technologies into our interactive robot navigation system, we need to understand how they work under the hood and use them to improve our performance.  

This article provides detailed information on how to build an efficient interactive robot navigation system using augmented reality techniques. It discusses all stages involved in creating an effective navigation solution through step-by-step approach while also covering important points like practical issues, challenges faced during implementation, and future directions for further development. 

Throughout this article, we assume the reader already knows the basics of robotics and its working principles. If you don’t know any of these concepts then please refer to other articles or resources online before continuing your read.

## 2.1 Augmented Reality (AR)
Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology which combines virtual content with the physical world surrounding the viewer. The main focus of the technology lies within the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In simple terms, AR makes us see things differently, interacting with virtual elements in real-time by adding digital elements to the actual environment around us. This creates a sense of presence amongst ourselves where we can interact with machines and receive feedback.

According to Gartner Hype Cycle Model, AR was one of the fastest growing areas in the past decade. According to Forbes statistics, AR had a market value of USD$7 billion in 2019. AR started gaining popularity over the years due to its ability to bring users back to reality and engage with technology. Furthermore, AR enabled mobile devices to offer personalized experiences and services through Virtual Reality (VR), but nowadays VR is getting more and more expensive. Thus, AR is still the most preferred option for developing interactive robotic systems.

The AR marker can come in various forms including but not limited to Image Marker, QR Codes, Barcodes, NFC tags, Laser Pointers, and RFID. These markers allow computers to identify images, video streams, and locations and convert them into three-dimensional space. Once identified, their position and orientation can be tracked using multiple sensors like IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), GPS (Global Position System), Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging), Camera, and Depth Sensor. With the help of these sensors, AR software can generate a realistic image based on sensor inputs. These generated images can be displayed above the real world providing users with immersive visual experience.

## 2.2 Kinematic Model of Mobile Robots
A kinematic model is a mathematical model of a mechanism composed of a set of rigid bodies connected by joints, without external forces affecting them directly. The basic assumption behind the kinematic model is that the movement of each body depends only upon itself and the relative positions and orientations of adjacent bodies. Among the simplest examples, a ball rolling down a horizontal surface would fit well into the kinematic model.

As mentioned earlier, we want to develop an interactive robot navigation system that uses both AR markers and the knowledge acquired from a researched kinematic model of a mobile robot. Here's what we'll do:

1. Collect motion capture data using an RGB-D camera.
2. Process the captured data to obtain static and dynamic obstacles detected in the scene.
3. Use SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to estimate the robot pose and map the environment.
4. Generate candidate paths using the available local map database and motion primitives.
5. Plan a global path using Dijkstra's Algorithm and optimize it using A* Algorithm.
6. Implement a Control Law that controls the movements of the mobile base according to the planned path.
7. Visualize the robot motion, obstacles, and mapped environment in real-time to provide an immersive view to the user.
8. Allow the user to interact with the environment through gestures, speech commands, and voice recognition.
9. Update the control law dynamically depending on the user input.
