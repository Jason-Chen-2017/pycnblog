# 1.简介
  

Softmax regression is a widely used type of supervised learning algorithm that belongs to the family of neural networks. It has been applied in numerous real-world applications such as image classification and natural language processing (NLP). 

In this article, we will explore softmax regression from a gentle introduction perspective, including its basic concepts, core algorithms, mathematical formulas, code examples, future trends, and common pitfalls or challenges encountered during implementation.

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning 
Supervised learning involves training models with labeled data where each input observation is associated with an output variable or class label. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function between the inputs and outputs based on these labeled data points. In other words, the model learns how to predict the correct output given any new input. For example, in image classification, the inputs are images, and the outputs are labels indicating which category the image falls into. While for NLP tasks, the inputs can be text sequences, and the outputs are typically discrete categories such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or named entity recognition.  

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, does not have any pre-defined outputs associated with the input observations. Instead, unsupervised learning aims to identify patterns, similarities, or relationships within the data without any guidance from external sources. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems. 

To implement softmax regression, we need to understand two key terms:
1. Softmax function: This function converts raw scores produced by a linear regression unit into probabilities over possible classes. 
2. Cross-entropy loss function: This measures the difference between predicted and actual class probabilities, so that we can use it to train our network to minimize errors. 


## Activation Functions 
Activation functions are crucial components of neural networks because they introduce non-linearity into their computation pathways, allowing them to solve complex problems with higher degrees of complexity than conventional linear approaches. Common activation functions used in deep learning include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and LeakyReLU. We will briefly discuss ReLU activation here.

The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) takes a threshold value (e.g., zero) as a hyperparameter and sets all negative values to zero while leaving positive values unchanged. Mathematically, the rectifier function is defined as follows:

$$f(x)=\max(0, x)$$

where $x$ represents the input value. The slope of the line at zero gives us the gradient descent property; i.e., if the function is initially increasing until it crosses the origin, then as we move away from the origin, it becomes decreasing again until it reaches zero. Thus, when using ReLU units, we avoid the vanishing gradient problem.

Another reason why ReLU units work well is that it provides sparse activations, meaning that most of the neurons in a layer receive zero input and therefore do not contribute to the overall output. Therefore, only a small subset of neurons fires and contributes significantly to the final decision making process. However, since ReLU units saturate with very large values, it may lead to slower convergence compared to other types of activation functions like sigmoid or tanh. 

Overall, ReLU activation seems like a good choice for implementing softmax regression in deep learning.


## Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithm
Gradient descent optimization algorithm is one of the popular methods for finding the optimal weights of a neural network during training. It works by iteratively updating the weight parameters of the network to minimize the loss function, also known as error, between the predicted output and the target output. There are many variants of gradient descent, but commonly used ones are batch gradient descent (BGD), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and mini-batch SGD. Here, we will focus on BGD and SGD optimizers.

### Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)
Batch gradient descent calculates the gradients of the entire dataset at once and updates the weights after computing the average gradient over the entire set. To compute the gradients, we backpropagate through the network to calculate the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weight parameters. Then, we update the weights by subtracting the product of the learning rate ($\eta$) and the gradient vector scaled by the number of samples in the dataset, i.e.:

$$w_{i+1} = w_i - \frac{\eta}{m} \sum_{j=1}^{m} (\nabla L(y^{(j)}, h_{\theta}(x^{(j)}))_i )$$

Here, $\eta$ is the step size parameter, $m$ is the number of samples in the dataset, $(\nabla L(y^{(j)}, h_{\theta}(x^{(j)}))_i)$ denotes the derivative of the loss function with respect to the $i$-th weight parameter, and $h_{\theta}$ represents the hypothesis function.

### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) differs from BGD in that it computes the gradients for each sample individually rather than aggregating them across the entire dataset. Therefore, it is more efficient in practice and requires less memory resources. Similar to BGD, we update the weights using the following formula:

$$w_{i+1} = w_i - \frac{\eta}{m} (\nabla L(y^{(j)}, h_{\theta}(x^{(j)}))_i )$$

However, there are some differences in the way we choose the sample indices for each iteration. One approach is to shuffle the order of the training data before every epoch and iterate over the shuffled index list. Another approach is to randomly select batches of fixed size (e.g., 100) and perform the update after each batch, repeating the process multiple times per epoch. Overall, SGD provides faster convergence rates, especially when working with large datasets.
