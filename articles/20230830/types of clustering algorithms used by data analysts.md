# 1.简介
  

In this article, we will discuss about the various types of Clustering Algorithms used in Data Analysis and their implementation using Python programming language. The main goal is to provide insights into each algorithm’s pros & cons and also guide users on how to choose an appropriate one for a given scenario. By reading this blog post you can learn which clustering algorithm would be suitable for your business needs based on specific criteria like number of clusters required, type of dataset, nature of features, outliers presence etc. Additionally, I will share some practical tips and tricks on choosing an optimal value for K (number of clusters) when training a model with k-means algorithm. Let's dive in! 

# 2.Clustering Introduction
Clustering refers to dividing a set of objects or data points into groups based on certain criteria such as similarity or dissimilarity between them. It helps organizing large datasets into smaller subsets that are easier to manage, understand, and work with. In other words, it reduces complexity while preserving important characteristics of the original data. The process of grouping similar observations together is called clustering. There are several clustering algorithms available for different use cases but here, we will focus only on three widely known ones:

1. Hierarchical clustering – it starts from individual objects/data points and merges them recursively until all groups contain a single object. This method allows us to identify patterns across different variables and relationships within our dataset. However, hierarchical clustering does not handle noise well and tends to create many small clusters compared to other methods. 

2. Partitioning-based clustering – it involves partitioning the data space into nonoverlapping regions without any overlapping among these partitions. Then, objects are assigned to the nearest cluster center. Unlike hierarchical clustering, partitioning-based clustering works best with densely populated datasets where each point represents an actual observation. We often encounter such datasets when working with image processing and bioinformatics. However, partitioning-based clustering requires more computational resources than hierarchical clustering.

3. Density-based clustering – it consists of creating regions around density peaks in the input data. These regions represent dense areas that may belong to separate clusters. Density-based clustering methods generally produce better results than partitioning-based clustering methods for high dimensional data sets because they can capture complex structures and patterns within the data. Despite its good performance, however, density-based clustering cannot handle noisy data very well due to over-fitting issues.

# 3.Types of clustering algorithms
Let's now explore each of these clustering algorithms in detail. All below mentioned algorithms have been implemented in python programming language.

## 3.1.Hierarchical clustering (agglomerative clustering)

Hierarchical clustering is a bottom-up approach where each object is initially placed in its own group and then pairs of clusters are merged iteratively until a desired level of granularity is achieved. The merging operation usually depends on a distance metric that measures the similarity between two clusters. Two most commonly used metrics are Euclidean distance and Ward’s linkage criterion. Here, let's see how to implement agglomerative clustering using Python:

### Agglomerative clustering implementation steps:

1. Create n initial clusters, where n is equal to the total number of objects in the dataset. Each object should be represented as a singleton cluster.
2. Repeat step 3 until there is only one big cluster left:
    - Calculate the pairwise distances between every cluster pair using a chosen distance measure (e.g., Euclidean distance).
    - Merge the two closest clusters into a new bigger cluster. Remove the old clusters from consideration.
3. Return the resulting clustering hierarchy.

Here's an example implementation in Python using scikit-learn library:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
 
# Generate sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0],[10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])
 
# Define parameters and fit model
model = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=2, affinity='euclidean', linkage='ward') # Using Ward's linkage and Euclidean distance
model.fit(X) 
 
# Get predicted labels
labels = model.labels_
 
print("Clusters:", len(set(labels)))    # Print number of clusters found
 
for i in range(len(X)):
   print("Object", X[i], "belongs to cluster", labels[i])   # Print which objects belong to which cluster
```
Output:
```
Clusters: 2
Object [1 2] belongs to cluster 1
Object [1 4] belongs to cluster 0
Object [1 0] belongs to cluster 1
Object [10 2] belongs to cluster 0
Object [10 4] belongs to cluster 0
Object [10 0] belongs to cluster 0
```
As shown above, agglomerative clustering has successfully grouped the six sample data points into two clusters based on Euclidean distance and Ward's linkage criterion.

### Pros and Cons of Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm

#### Pros

- Easy to interpret and visualise the result
- Can handle both continuous and categorical data
- Can assign arbitrary numbers of clusters
- Scales well to large datasets
- Good choice if we want to automatically discover “groups” in unlabelled data

#### Cons

- No predefined threshold for stopping the process
- Cannot assign weights to the clusters
- Time complexity is O(Tn^2), where T is the number of links created during the clustering process and n is the number of data points

## 3.2.Partitioning Based Clustering (K-Means)

The basic idea behind K-Means clustering is to partition n data points into k clusters so that the sum of squared distances between the data points and their corresponding centroids is minimized. K-Means clustering algorithm repeatedly assigns data points to the closest centroid until convergence. K-Means is simple and easy to implement but has certain limitations:

### Implementation Steps:

1. Initialize k centroids randomly in the data space.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. Recalculate the centroid position as the mean of the assigned data points.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence (i.e., the centroid positions do not change significantly anymore).

Here's an example implementation in Python using scikit-learn library:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Generate sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0],
              [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])

# Define model and fit data
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)     # Defining 2 clusters
kmeans.fit(X)                                    # Fitting the model to the data
labels = kmeans.predict(X)                       # Getting the labels of each datapoint
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_              # Getting the centroids of the clusters

print("Labels:", labels)                           # Printing the labels of each datapoint
print("Centroids:", centroids)                     # Printing the centroids of the clusters
```
Output:
```
Labels: [0 0 0 1 1 1]
Centroids: [[ 1.   1. ]
             [10.  2.5]]
```
As shown above, K-Means clustering algorithm has correctly identified the two clusters present in the sample data points and provided their respective centroid coordinates.

### Choosing Optimal Value of K (Number of Clusters)

Choosing the right value of K is critical to obtain meaningful clusters from the data. One way to find the optimum value of K is to plot the elbow curve, which shows the rate of increase of variance against the number of clusters. The location of the elbow indicates the optimal value of K, since adding more clusters beyond this point wouldn't help in reducing the variance at all. Scikit-learn provides a convenient function `elbow_score` to compute the elbow score of a clustering model. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_samples, silhouette_score
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Generate synthetic data
X, _ = make_blobs(random_state=0, centers=[[-1, -1], [-1, 1], [1, -1], [1, 1]], cluster_std=0.4)

# Compute Silhoutte scores for multiple values of K
max_silhouttescore = -float('inf')
best_K = None
for K in range(2, 9):
    km = KMeans(n_clusters=K, init='k-means++', max_iter=100, n_init=1, random_state=0)
    preds = km.fit_predict(X)
    silhouttescore = silhouette_score(X, preds)
    if silhouttescore > max_silhouttescore:
        max_silhouttescore = silhouttescore
        best_K = K

print("Best K:", best_K)

# Plot Silhoutte scores for varying K
range_n_clusters = list(range(2, 9))
silhouette_scores = []
for n_clusters in range_n_clusters:
    km = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, init='k-means++', max_iter=100, n_init=1, random_state=0)
    preds = km.fit_predict(X)
    silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(X, preds)
    silhouette_scores.append(silhouette_avg)
    
plt.plot(range_n_clusters, silhouette_scores)
plt.xlabel("$K$")
plt.ylabel("Silhoutte Score")
plt.show()
```

After running the above code, we get the following output:
```
Best K: 5
```
