# 1.简介
  

Inventory management is the process of tracking and managing the assets or goods that are available for use by a business entity. In simple words, it involves recording the details of products stored at different warehouses or stores and ensuring that they are safe, suitable for consumption and maintain their quality over time. Inventory management plays an essential role in controlling costs, improving profitability, and reducing waste. However, as we know, it also has its drawbacks like high labor cost, low productivity, reduced efficiency, and poor customer service quality. Therefore, effective inventory management system designing becomes critical in order to achieve optimum performance. 

TOPSIS(Tennessee Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), developed by <NAME> and Jawahar Lakshmanan in 1981, is a commonly used decision making method which is based on preference coefficients. It assigns weights to each alternative based on the similarity between them and the ideal solution, and then selects the best alternative accordingly. Based on this concept, we will discuss about the implementation of TOPSIS method to select the optimal item from our inventory using Python programming language with some examples and explanations.


# 2.核心概念及术语
## 2.1 Objective function
Objective function refers to the criteria being optimized while solving any optimization problem. In case of inventory management, objective functions can be defined based on various metrics such as revenue, inventory turnover, production cost, delivery time, and others. The goal is to identify the best fit items among all the available ones so that these items should be selected into the final stock level for future usage.

## 2.2 Alternatives
Alternatives refer to the set of possible solutions that we consider when applying an optimization algorithm. In case of inventory management, alternatives may include different types of items, manufacturing methods, raw materials, etc., depending upon the requirements. Each of these alternatives must have specific attributes that can be evaluated against other alternatives, including price, availability, demand, storage space, maintenance cost, physical characteristics, and other relevant factors.

## 2.3 Criteria
Criteria refers to the evaluation criteria used to compare alternatives. There are several ways to evaluate alternatives, but two popular methods are Gini index and Isoprofit. Here, we are discussing only the TOPOSI criterion. TOPSIS stands for Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solution, introduced by Rafee and Prasad in 1981. This approach uses distance measures between each pair of objects to determine the most preferred object, based on the user's specification.

The main idea behind TOPSIS is to assign weights to each alternative based on the degree of dissimilarity between them and the ideal solution. TOPSIS considers five criteria:
* Distance: It calculates the Euclidean distance between the desired values of the objectives and the actual values obtained in the given alternative. The smaller the distance value, the closer the actual value is to the desired value.
* Preferential importance: It represents how important each criterion is to the overall fitness of the alternative.
* Impact: It gives the relative impact of each criterion on the choice of the alternative. For example, if one criterion has high impact, it means that the resulting ranking would depend less on the other criteria than would a criterion with lower impact.

To calculate the preferences for selecting the top n objects out of m objects, we need to apply mathematical operations on the above distances and preferences to get the rankings. We take the inverse of the sum of the squares of normalized weights multiplied by corresponding distances for each alternative to obtain the scaled scores. Then, we sort the alternatives according to their score and choose the top n alternatives as the output.

In simpler terms, TOPSIS compares the alternatives based on similarities and ranks them according to their preferences. It provides a clear view of which alternatives are better suited to meet certain criteria while optimizing the overall objective function. Additionally, it eliminates dominated alternatives and ensures a fair comparison among all alternatives irrespective of their proportions within the population.

## 2.4 Thresholds
Thresholds represent the cut-off points used to classify an alternative into good, acceptable, or poor category, based on a predefined set of criteria. A threshold can be defined for both positive and negative sides. Good thresholds indicate the upper limit beyond which an alternative cannot deviate further. On the other hand, bad thresholds define the minimum standard for improvement needed before the alternative needs inspection.

## 2.5 Optimization Problem
Optimization problems can be classified into two categories - single objective optimization and multi-objective optimization. Single objective optimization targets just one metric while multi-objective optimization targets multiple metrics simultaneously. Both approaches require us to find the best combination of parameters that minimizes the error or maximizes the gain. Multi-objective optimization algorithms such as NSGA-II (Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) are widely used for inventory management due to their ability to handle multiple objectives efficiently.
