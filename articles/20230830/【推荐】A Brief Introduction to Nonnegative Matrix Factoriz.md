Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), also known as non-negative least squares (NNLS), is a popular technique for decomposing a matrix into two smaller matrices with certain properties such that the product of these matrices approximates the original matrix but its entries are all non-negative. The basic idea behind NMF is to find a representation of a data set X in terms of a lower dimensional subspace W and a corresponding upper dimensional subspace H. 

The key step in solving this problem is to optimize a loss function that penalizes large differences between X and WH or vice versa, while ensuring that both W and H have only non-negative entries.

In recent years, NMF has become an essential tool for many applications including image processing, text analysis, bioinformatics, and recommender systems. It has been used to analyze gene expression microarray data sets, identify topics from social media posts, and predict user ratings on products based on their behavior and preferences. However, it remains a challenging task due to its high computational complexity. In this article, we will provide a brief overview of the NMF algorithm and some fundamental concepts, followed by practical examples of using NMF in Python. We hope this article can serve as a useful guide for anyone interested in learning more about NMF and applying it in various fields.

## 2.1 数据集X
The input matrix X is typically represented as a m x n matrix where each entry xi,j represents one observation associated with the jth feature and the ith subject. Each row of X represents the observations made by a particular entity or subject, and each column represents a particular feature or attribute.

## 2.2 正则项（Regularization）
To prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance, regularization techniques can be applied during training. This involves adding a penalty term to the cost function that discourages the model from fitting too closely to the training data. There are several types of regularization methods available, but commonly used ones include L1/L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping. For our purposes, we will use L2 regularization which adds a penalty term proportional to the squared magnitudes of the coefficients of the weight vectors.

## 2.3 因子W与隐变量H
We want to learn two subspaces W and H to represent X efficiently. The goal of NMF is to minimize the following objective function: 

where β is a scalar hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between minimizing the reconstruction error and sparsity constraints. When λ = 0, the first part of the objective function corresponds to the mean-squared-error (MSE) between X and WH, whereas when λ > 0, it includes two terms representing the sparsity constraints on W and H respectively.

The subspaces W and H should satisfy the following conditions:

1. **Non-negativity constraint**: Each element hij in H must be greater than zero.
2. **Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint**: The rows of W and columns of H should be distributed in proportion to their respective variances in X. That is, the sum of the elements in each row of W must be equal to the variance of the corresponding row in X, and likewise for the columns of H. To achieve this, we use another cost function called the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-divergence). 
3. **Trace constraint**: If required, the trace of the final approximation matrix should not exceed a specified value. 


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解:
Non-negative matrix factorization relies upon alternating optimization of the latent variables W and H. At each iteration t, we update the values of W and H as follows:

1. Update W: Solve the following optimization problem: 
    Using gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent algorithms.
    
2. Update H: Solve the following optimization problem:
    Again using gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent algorithms.
    
After optimizing W and H iteratively, we obtain two new low rank matrices W and H, which can be used to approximate the original matrix X. Specifically, we can write X ≈ HW, where × denotes the dot product. As noted earlier, the quality of the approximation depends on the choice of lambda and other parameters such as the number of iterations and the convergence criterion. A small value of lambda ensures that the model fits well to the data at the expense of reduced flexibility, while a larger value can lead to overfitting.

Here's how we can implement NMF in Python using scikit-learn library:
