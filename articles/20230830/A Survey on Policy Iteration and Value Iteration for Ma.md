# 1.简介
  

多数机器学习、人工智能领域的算法都试图通过对经验或数据进行建模，然后找寻能够最大化或最小化某些目标的最佳参数或模型。其中一种十分常见的模型就是马尔可夫决策过程（Markov Decision Process，简称MDP），它描述了在一个环境中，智能体（Agent）如何与周围的各种可能状态及其转移关系做出抉择，以便使得其能够得到一个好的回报。因此，MDP模型已成为许多有关智能控制、规划等方面的问题的研究对象。

MDP模型中的核心问题之一是求解最优策略。不同的算法根据MDP的性质、模型结构或约束条件，分别提出了不同的求解最优策略的方法。如，Value Iteration和Policy Iteration是两种广泛使用的求解最优策略的方法，它们通过迭代计算逐步完善或优化当前的策略，直到收敛到最优策略。本文将对这两个方法进行全面阐述，并结合实际应用案例进一步分析这些方法。 

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology 
## MDP Model Overview 
In a Markov decision process, the agent interacts with an environment to maximize its expected long-term reward. At each time step t, it can take one of k possible actions a_t ∈ {a1,..., ak}, where each action may have some associated cost or penalty depending on the current state s_t. The agent's goal is to find the optimal policy π that maximizes the expected discounted sum of future rewards r_t+1 + γr_t+2 +... under the constraint that the next state s_{t+1} follows the transition probability distribution P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t). 

The agent starts from a state s0 in the initial belief state Ω, which contains all possible information about the environment before the start of the interaction. We assume that the dynamics of the environment are fully observable, meaning that any part of the state can be observed at any point in time. In other words, there are no hidden states that we cannot directly observe. However, the agent has limited control over certain aspects of the system, such as available actions or resources within the environment. These limitations make the problem more realistic than those encountered in reinforcement learning where agents must learn how to adapt to changing environments.

To solve this problem, we need to formulate our optimization problem into an objective function that captures the agent's preferences. This involves defining the expected value of being in a particular state, given our current strategy π: E[vπ(s)] = E[R(s) + γE[vπ(s')]] (where R(s) denotes the immediate reward received at state s and vπ(s') is the maximum expected discounted return starting from state s'.) To ensure that the algorithm converges to a solution, we also add constraints that restrict the set of policies that will be considered by the algorithm. One common constraint is the exploration/exploitation tradeoff, where we want to explore new policies to improve our understanding of the system but avoid getting trapped in suboptimal strategies that only lead to a small improvement in our performance metric. Another constraint could involve ensuring safety and security requirements, such as considering the possibility of hazardous situations or violating physical laws during interactions with the environment.  

## Policy Iteration and Value Iteration
We begin by defining two fundamental algorithms for solving MDP problems: Policy Iteration and Value Iteration. Both methods iteratively refine a guess or approximation of the optimal policy until convergence to a fixed-point or stationary policy. However, they differ slightly in their approach towards finding the best solution. 

### Policy Iteration 
Policy iteration works by iteratively improving a guess or estimate of the optimal policy based on the current estimated values and probabilities of the MDP model. It proceeds as follows:

1. Initialize a random deterministic policy π' that maps every state s ∈ S to a probability distribution over the set of actions {a1,..., ak}.
2. While convergence not achieved do:
   - Evaluate the value function Vπ' using the Bellman equation Vπ'(s) = R(s) + γE[Vπ'(s')] for all s ∈ S using the current version of π', storing these values in a table called Q. 
   - Compute the updated policy π using the stochastic update rule π(s,a) = p(s,a | π') / Σp(s,b | π'), where b∈{a1,..., ak} are all possible actions. Note that here we normalize the probabilities so that they sum up to one for each state, since we don't know if the sum of all action probabilities will always equal 1.
   - Check if the policy π converged to the previous policy π' using a simple difference check. If not, repeat from step 2. 
3. Return the final optimized policy π.

The key idea behind policy iteration is to iteratively compute the value function Vπ'(s), then use this information to update the policy π in order to get closer to the optimal policy π*. Once the policy converges to π*, we can stop the iterations and report the result. This method guarantees that the returned policy will be optimal among all policies whose value functions satisfy the Bellman equations, making it an effective way to solve large MDPs.

### Value Iteration
On the other hand, value iteration is another algorithm for solving MDPs that employs an alternative approach. Instead of optimizing a policy, it tries to directly optimize a value function V*(s) for each state s in the MDP. Similarly to policy iteration, it maintains an estimate of the value function V* for each state s using the Bellman backup formula, V*(s) = R(s) + γmaxa(s,a)[V*(s')] (where maxa(s,a) refers to the highest value obtained after taking action a in state s.) The main differences between policy iteration and value iteration are: 

1. Convergence criterion: while policy iteration checks whether the policy has changed significantly from one iteration to the next, value iteration stops when the change in the value function is below a predefined threshold ε. This means that value iteration might run for several iterations before stopping due to insufficient progress, whereas policy iteration requires precisely one pass through the entire space of policies to achieve convergence.  
2. Update rules: policy iteration updates the policy using the current version of π', whereas value iteration updates the value estimates using the latest set of estimates computed in the previous iteration. 
3. Solution structure: unlike policy iteration, value iteration finds a single global optimum for the value function V*, rather than trying to enumerate all policies that yield the same expected return. Therefore, it does not necessarily provide a guarantee that the solution will be unique. 

Overall, both policy iteration and value iteration share many similarities and principles, such as maintaining estimates of the value function and updating them based on new observations. However, they differ primarily in terms of how they attempt to solve the optimization problem, whether they approximate the true optimal policy or try to directly optimize the value function, and the convergence criteria used to determine when the algorithm has converged to a solution.
