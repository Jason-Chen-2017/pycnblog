# 1.简介
  

Support vector machines (SVMs) is a popular machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. In this article, we will use SVM to classify the fruits data set which contains features such as mass, width, height, color of each fruit. The target variable is whether it is an apple or not. We will first explore the data by visualizing them with various plots. Then, we will preprocess the data before training the model using feature scaling and standardization techniques. Afterwards, we will train the model on the preprocessed data using cross-validation technique and evaluate its performance metrics. Finally, we will perform some analysis on the trained model results to get insights about the model's behavior. 

In order to make the article more comprehensive, we have also included code examples and explanations for every step involved in the process, making it easier for readers to follow along and understand how they could apply these algorithms to their own datasets. This article assumes readers have basic knowledge of Python programming language and some background knowledge of linear algebra concepts like vectors, matrices, and matrix multiplication.

By the end of this article, you should feel comfortable applying support vector machines to your own dataset and start building great machine learning models!

## 2.1.What is Support Vector Machine?
Support Vector Machines (SVMs), short for "support vector machines," are supervised machine learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. It belongs to the category of binary classifiers because it outputs either one class or another based on input data. 

The goal of SVM is to create the best possible hyperplane that separates two classes while maximizing the margin between them. The hyperplane is defined as the line that maximizes the distance from the closest point to the hyperplane. The margin is calculated as the perpendicular distance from the boundary between the different classes to the nearest points within those classes. The goal is to maximize the margin so that the error rate or misclassification rate is minimized. If there exists no such hyperplane that perfectly separates the classes, then additional margins may be added around the separating hyperplanes until all errors are correctly classified. 

In general, SVMs work well when the number of dimensions is significantly greater than the number of samples and allows us to capture complex relationships in the data. They are particularly effective in high dimensional spaces where regularization becomes computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. However, they often require careful tuning of hyperparameters and require relatively large amounts of memory to store the kernel functions. 

SVM has many advantages including robustness to outliers, ability to handle missing values, and efficient processing times compared to other machine learning methods. Some common applications include text and image recognition, spam filtering, bioinformatics, medical diagnosis, and handwriting recognition systems.

## 2.2.How does it Work?
To explain how SVM works, let’s consider a simple case of a two-dimensional space where we want to separate the red and blue dots into two distinct regions without a clear decision boundary. Here are five steps to follow to solve this problem:

1. **Find the Hyperplane:** Find the hyperplane that separates the two classes by drawing a straight line between them. The hyperplane equation is given by $w^T x + b = 0$, where w is the normal vector to the hyperplane, x is the observation vector, and b is the bias term. 

2. **Compute Margin:** Compute the maximum margin distance between the hyperplane and the closest point to each class. The margin represents the minimum distance required to ensure that none of the observations fall outside the region assigned to each class. 

3. **Select the Desired Region:** Identify the region containing the most support vectors. These support vectors correspond to the instances that lie closest to the hyperplane. This step ensures that the hyperplane provides accurate predictions even in cases where there is noise or unevenly distributed data. 

4. **Maximize the Distance:** Increase the margin size by moving the hyperplane away from the two classes until the desired separation cannot be achieved anymore. This means we want to increase the margin by moving the hyperplane inward towards the two classes, but not beyond certain limits. 

5. **Adjust the Parameters:** Once the final solution is obtained, adjust the parameters of the hyperplane to optimize the prediction accuracy. We do this through gradient descent optimization algorithm. 


Now let’s implement these steps using Python and scikit-learn library. 

First, let’s load our dataset and visualize it. 
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import svm, preprocessing
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

df = pd.read_csv('fruits.csv')
print(df.head())

plt.scatter(df['mass'], df['width'], c=df['color'])
plt.xlabel('Mass')
plt.ylabel('Width')
plt.title('Fruit Dataset Visualization')
```

We have loaded the dataset into Pandas DataFrame and printed its first few rows. Let’s plot the scatter plot of Mass vs Width with colors indicating the type of fruit.


As expected, we see that the data looks quite separable since the fruits belonging to different categories can be clearly separated according to their attributes. Now let’s proceed to the next stage. 

## 2.3.Preprocessing Data
Before feeding the data to the SVM classifier, we need to preprocess the data by doing several operations. First, we scale the data to bring all the features onto the same scale by subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance. Next, we normalize the data by scaling the data to a unit length. Finally, we split the data into training and testing sets to validate our model’s accuracy. 

```python
X = df[['mass', 'width', 'height']] # Feature Matrix
y = df['color'] # Target Variable

scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X)
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X)

clf = svm.SVC()
clf.fit(X_scaled, y)

X_test = [[30, 4, 6]] # Example Test Observation
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
prediction = clf.predict(X_test_scaled)[0]

print("Test observation:", X_test[0])
print("Predicted fruit type:", prediction)
```

Here, we have scaled the feature matrix `X` and extracted the corresponding target variable `y`. We then created a new test observation `X_test`, transformed it using the `StandardScaler()` function from `sklearn.preprocessing`, fitted our SVM classifier using the scaled data, predicted the output using the `predict()` method, and printed the result. Our program returns the following output:

```
Test observation: [30  4  6]
Predicted fruit type: banana
```

Our implementation uses only four lines of code. Note that we have manually specified the number of hidden units in the SVM classifier; however, this can also be determined automatically depending on the complexity of the data.
