Genetic programming (GP) is a type of evolutionary computation that involves the creation and manipulation of computer programs using natural selection mechanisms. GP uses genetic algorithms to create a population of candidate solutions and iteratively selects parents through tournament selections and breeds offspring by applying genetic operators such as mutation or crossover to them. Population-based training is used to evaluate the fitness of each solution in the population before selecting it for reproduction. The best performing individuals from the population are then selected to be copied into the next generation, which helps improve the overall accuracy of the program during optimization process. GP can effectively solve complex problems where manual design of rules is not feasible, as shown by its success in many areas including scientific modeling, scheduling optimization, and industrial manufacturing. In this paper, we will apply GP to predict material properties of a new composition based on prior knowledge obtained from previous materials evaluated with similar thermodynamic conditions. We will use a case study approach involving experimental data, material property models, and machine learning techniques to demonstrate how GP can provide valuable insights into unknown materials and enable better decision making.

## Genetic Programming
Genetic programming (GP) is an artificial intelligence technique developed by Cambridge University scientists in the 1990s. It uses the principles of biology and evolution to mimic the processes involved in nature by creating a population of candidate solutions and iteratively selecting the fittest individuals to reproduce. The resulting population gradually becomes more accurate at solving a problem by examining the relationship between individual genes and their effects on the solution. GP has become one of the most effective tools used for optimizing systems, especially those involved in tasks that require extensive computation. Population-based training is used to select candidates with high fitness values and breeding operators are applied to combine them into offspring with improved fitness levels. 

## Candidate Solution
A candidate solution refers to an individual in a GP population that is generated by combining two parent individuals through inheritance or recombination. Each gene in the candidate solution represents a parameter that influences the behavior of the system being optimized. In other words, a single candidate solution contains all the necessary information needed to represent a possible solution to the problem being solved. For example, if we were trying to optimize a car's engine size, the candidate solution would contain parameters such as the mass of the car, the fuel efficiency rating, and so forth.

## Parent Selection
The purpose of parent selection is to choose the individuals whose genotypes will be inherited by the next generation. There are several methods available for parent selection in GP:

### Roulette Wheel Selection
Roulette wheel selection involves drawing random numbers from a roulette wheel and choosing the winner according to its position relative to the other winners. The probabilities assigned to each individual in the population are proportional to their fitness scores. This method ensures that the highest performing individuals have higher chances of survival compared to others, thereby promoting genetic diversity within the population.

### Tournament Selection
Tournament selection involves randomly selecting pairs of individuals and comparing them based on their performance. The fittest pair wins and gets paired again until either a maximum number of rounds or a minimum fitness threshold is met. A benefit of tournament selection over roulette wheel selection is that it reduces the likelihood of getting stuck in local minima and promotes exploration of unexplored regions of search space. Another advantage is that it allows individuals with different skills and abilities to compete against each other without risk of exploitation. 

### Rank Selection
Rank selection assigns a score to each individual based on their rank among the remaining candidates in the current iteration of the algorithm. Individuals who are less fit than some fraction of the worst performers are eliminated early on in the process, thereby avoiding the need for expensive evaluations. This method provides a balance between exploration and exploitation and also avoids oscillating around the global optimum.

### Elite Set Selection
An elite set consists of the top few percentile of individuals in the population who meet specific criteria, such as having high fitness scores or high probability of survival. These individuals serve as parents for the next generation while ensuring that they remain relevant throughout the course of the algorithm. Elite set selection typically improves the convergence speed of the algorithm and brings significant improvement in terms of performance when combined with certain operators such as mutation or crossover.

## Reproduction
Reproduction means the production of offspring through combinations of genetic material from multiple parent individuals. There are three main types of reproduction in GP:

### Single-point Crossover
Single-point crossover involves cutting the chromosomes in half at a randomly chosen point, copying the first half of one parent to the child and appending the second half of another parent after it. This creates unique variations in the children and enables their potential to be useful solutions to the problem. However, too much crossover may result in excessive redundancy and reduce the generality of the population, leading to suboptimal results.

### Two-point Crossover
Two-point crossover involves selecting two points along the length of the chromosomes and swapping the segments between these points between the corresponding sections of the parents. This creates additional variation in the children but requires significantly fewer crossover events than single-point crossover to achieve good outcomes.

### Arithmetic Recombination
Arithmetic recombination involves adding up the alleles of the parent chromosomes with small amounts of noise added to ensure that the resulting products are valid values. This type of recombination is less susceptible to excessive mutations since the added noise acts as a penalty term that discourages large jumps in expression level.

## Fitness Function
The fitness function measures the quality of a candidate solution relative to other candidate solutions in the population. In GP, the fitness function is determined by the output produced by running the candidate program. Common fitness functions include mean squared error, mean absolute error, and correlation coefficient. The choice of fitness function depends on both the underlying problem being solved and the goals of the optimization process. For instance, if the goal is to minimize the amount of time taken to find the optimal solution, a fitness function such as mean absolute error might be appropriate. On the other hand, if the goal is to maximize the profit earned from selling the product, a fitness function such as total sales might be preferred.

## Genotype and Phenotype Mapping
In GP, the genotype corresponds to the sequence of alleles present in a candidate solution, whereas the phenotype corresponds to the actual mathematical expression representing the solution. When a candidate solution is created, the program generator maps the genotype onto the physical hardware of the system by implementing the genotype instructions. During training, the objective function produces a set of fitness values for each candidate solution, indicating how well it fits the requirements of the problem being solved. During testing, the final candidate solution is mapped back to the original domain and tested under realistic environmental conditions. This mapping process occurs automatically and does not require any manual intervention.
