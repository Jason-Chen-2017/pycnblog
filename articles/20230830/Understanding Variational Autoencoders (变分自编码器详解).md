# 1.简介
  

Variational Autoencoder (VAE), recently proposed by Kingma and Welling in 2013, is a type of neural network architecture that combines the ideas of auto-encoding and variational inference to learn complex data distributions. This post will explain VAE from a high level perspective and its application scenarios such as image recognition, speech synthesis, text generation, etc. We will also see how VAE works internally and understand various ways of training it on different datasets with an emphasis on generative modeling tasks like images or natural language processing. Finally, we will talk about some key challenges for developing advanced versions of VAE and possible directions for future research.

本文将从高层次上对VAE进行解释，包括它的应用场景、工作原理、生成模型任务等。我们还将探索VAE内部的机制及如何用不同的数据集训练它，更加关注生成模型的任务，比如图像或自然语言处理。最后，我们会讨论一些VAE的关键挑战及其可能的发展方向。

## 2.1 Introduction
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are deep learning models that combine the idea of auto-encoding and variational inference, which is used in Bayesian statistics to approximate the distribution over hidden variables given observed samples. In other words, they generate new samples from input data while learning the underlying probability distribution using unsupervised learning techniques. The main purpose of VAEs is to find the optimal representation of the original dataset by finding the latent space where the generated samples belong to. 

In general, auto-encoders are neural networks that have two parts: an encoder and a decoder. Encoder takes an input sample x and maps it into a low dimensional latent space z. On the other hand, decoder reconstructs the original input from the encoded vector z. By minimizing reconstruction error, the goal of auto-encoders is to learn the mapping between input and output vectors, effectively compressing and decompressing them. However, during training, auto-encoders suffer from two major problems:

1. Density estimation problem: As the complexity of the input increases, the manifold learned by the auto-encoder becomes more complex and difficult to model. Therefore, the distribution of the output obtained through decoding might not be very accurate because of the presence of high dimensionality.
2. Unsupervised learning problem: Since the auto-encoder learns to map inputs to outputs without any supervision, there can be no guarantee that the latent space actually captures meaningful structure of the input data. Moreover, since the mapping is non-linear, the decoded results may look slightly different than the original inputs.

To address these issues, Variational Autoencoders use Variational Inference to train the parameters of the network, instead of traditional backpropagation based optimization. Variational Inference allows us to estimate the true posterior distribution of the input data without making any assumptions about the form of the prior distribution. By optimizing a lower bound on the likelihood function, the VAE achieves both density estimation and unsupervised learning simultaneously.

Here's a graphical representation of a standard Variational Autoencoder architecture:



In this figure, the red line represents the input data x, blue line denotes the bottleneck layer z, green lines represent the mean and variance of the variational distribution q(z|x). During training, the KL divergence loss measures the distance between the learned normal distribution and the prior normal distribution, ensuring that our latent space has sufficient capacity to capture the input data. The MSE loss between the predicted output y_pred and the actual target y is used for reconstruction purposes. When both losses are optimized simultaneously, the network learns to optimize the joint objective of generating good samples while maintaining a regularization effect on the latent space.

## 2.2 Notation and Terminology
Let’s define some important terms before we proceed further: 

1. Input Data - The raw observations, usually represented as a matrix of dimensions m x n, where each row represents one observation and each column represents one variable. For example, if we are working with images, then the input data could be a tensor of size d x h x w representing RGB values for each pixel location in an image.

2. Latent Space - A low dimensional representation of the input data in a compressed format, often called “bottleneck” or “latent”. It is assumed that the input data lies close to a lower-dimensional subspace in the latent space, meaning that points closer together in the latent space should correspond to similar points in the input space. 

3. Mean & Variance of the Variational Distribution - These quantities represent the parameters of the normal distribution over the latent space z. Both the mean μ and the variance σ^2 determine the shape of the distribution. For the first few layers of the VAE, the mean and variance of the variational distribution start out randomly initialized, but later on the network updates them automatically based on the reconstruction loss. 

Now let's move on to understanding what exactly happens inside the VAE after training.
