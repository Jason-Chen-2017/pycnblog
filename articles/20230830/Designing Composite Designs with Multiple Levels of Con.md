# 1.简介
  

composite design就是由多个不同设计构成的一种组合式设计。通常来说，组合式设计可以降低成本、提高效率、缩短制造时间、改善产品质量。本文主要讨论如何进行复杂的组合式设计，在保证整体性的前提下，尽可能满足不同设计之间的多样性。

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 Composite Design
Composite Design 是由多个不同设计所组成的一种设计。例如，一个组合式设计可以由多个子系统或者组件组成。不同的设计可以是结构性的（如塔楼），也可以是功能性的（如电梯）。组合式设计的一个优点是可以协调它们之间的关系，使得它们共同工作。另外，组合式设计可以帮助实现灵活性和模块化，从而降低成本和减少维护成本。

## 2.2 Multi-Level Constraints and Objectives
Multi-level constraints 和 objectives是指系统中存在的多个层级上的约束条件或目标要求。根据要求的不同，约束条件可分为静态约束和动态约束；目标要求可分为经济性目标、性能目标和用户满意度目标等。

## 2.3 Feasibility Pursuit Algorithm
Feasibility Pursuit Algorithm (FPA)是一种基于局部最优搜索的多级约束整数规划算法。它考虑所有可行解空间中的单个顶点，并通过选择不同的参数配置来尝试找到全局最优解。FPA 可以处理高维变量、多目标优化以及多重约束。

## 2.4 Linear Programming (LP) Problem
Linear Programming is a mathematical optimization method used to find the maximum or minimum value of a linear function subject to certain conditions. It involves solving a system of equations using linear inequalities and equalities as its constraints. In order for an LP problem to be feasible, all of its variables must have finite bounds on both sides, which ensures that there are no undesired solutions. 

## 2.5 Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) are problems where there exists a set of variable assignments such that all of the constraints are satisfied simultaneously. The goal of CSPs is to assign values to these variables so that the total cost or benefit of the solution meets certain criteria specified by the user. The most common types of CSPs include logic puzzles and sudoku boards. 

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
设计组合式设计一般需要对其进行分析、综合评估和优化，即如何设计一个能够实现多种目标和约束的系统。

## 3.1 Basic FPA Process
1. Define the multi-level constraint structure and decision variables. Determine the objective functions.

2. For each level i from bottom up, solve a linear programming (LP) problem to obtain a vertex (i.e., point) for the next level. 

3. Use backtracking to explore all possible vertices at the current level until it reaches the top level. Choose the one(s) that maximize/minimize the objective functions. 

4. Repeat step 3 recursively while adding more levels to consider, if necessary. 

5. Return the optimal solution found after exploring all possibilities. 

## 3.2 Formal Definition of FPA Algorithms
We can formally define FPA algorithms according to three steps: 

1. Vertex Selection: Given a multi-level system design, select the vertex in the lowest level whose feasibility status has not been determined yet. This process continues until all vertices have been processed or excluded based on their feasibility.

2. Facility Placement: Once a vertex has been selected, place any facilities associated with it into the corresponding level. If this operation violates a multi-level constraint, exclude the vertex and move to the next one. Otherwise, continue placing other facilities.

3. Objective Evaluation: After all relevant facilities have been placed, evaluate the global objectives defined by the multi-level system requirements. If the overall performance metric falls below some threshold, return to step 1 to try a different vertex. Otherwise, return the final solution.

## 3.3 Applications of FPA 
FPA is commonly applied to designing composite structures, including buildings, cars, and transportation systems. The algorithm can also handle complex and large scale design spaces. However, since FPA is a heuristic approach, it may struggle with larger instances due to computational limitations. Therefore, alternative techniques like MILP or GIS may perform better depending on the specific application needs.

## 3.4 Extension to Complexity Metrics
One limitation of the original FPA algorithm is that it assumes that only one objective is being optimized. To account for multiple objectives, we can use weighting factors to give more importance to each objective during the evaluation stage. We can also add additional metrics such as weighted complexity measures or profitability estimates to compare trade-offs among design alternatives. These new metrics can help identify suboptimal design choices that were missed by traditional methods.
