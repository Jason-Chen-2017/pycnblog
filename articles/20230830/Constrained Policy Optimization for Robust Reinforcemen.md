# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework that allows an agent to learn complex behaviors from interacting with environments. However, RL has several limitations when applied in safety-critical domains like robotics and autonomous driving systems where unintentional actions can have serious consequences. In such situations, robust reinforcement learning (RRL), which guarantees the agent's safety under uncertainties, becomes crucial. RRL techniques include safe exploration, robust policy optimization, and risk-sensitive training. However, existing works on constrained RRL usually either do not consider task constraints or only work in simple environments with fixed dynamics and low dimensional state spaces. 

In this paper, we propose a new constrained policy optimization (CPO) algorithm for robust reinforcement learning. CPO addresses both the problem of considering task constraints and improving sample efficiency by leveraging the structure of model-based RL algorithms. We first develop an efficient constraint propagation algorithm based on linear programming (LP). Then, we integrate LP into the CPO framework using the Dual Ascent method. Specifically, we solve dual programs to obtain the optimal solution within specified constraints. This approach eliminates the need for costly forward simulations during training, thus enabling high-speed convergence in practical settings.

We evaluate our proposed algorithm on a variety of tasks including locomotion control, manipulation tasks, and autonomous driving scenarios. Our results show significant improvements over prior approaches in terms of safety performance while significantly reducing the sample complexity requirement. Moreover, we demonstrate that CPO outperforms other baseline methods on challenging problems requiring high-dimensional inputs. The source code and data will be made publicly available to encourage further research in this area.

Model-based RL algorithms use learned models of the environment as a basis for planning. These models capture important properties of the system, such as transition probabilities and reward functions, but they are often limited by the fact that they must represent all possible states and actions. As a result, it is difficult to apply standard reinforcement learning algorithms directly to real-world applications where the state space is continuous or highly structured. Instead, model-based methods approximate these models using carefully designed features and neural networks. 

In contrast, value-based RL algorithms use estimates of action values instead of representing the environment explicitly. They can handle continuous or discrete action spaces without explicit representations of the environment, making them more suitable for many problems involving dynamic and structured state spaces. However, they may struggle to enforce specific constraints on the agent's behavior due to their dependence on estimated values rather than true ones. Other RRL techniques rely on adversarial or generative modeling to generate diverse policies that attempt to balance between exploration and exploitation, but these techniques typically require specialized architectures and are less effective at ensuring safety.

Model-based RL methods provide an alternative way to reason about the environment that offers substantial benefits over traditional value-based methods. However, there is still a lack of theoretical foundations and empirical evidence for how best to combine models and policy optimization for robust control. Many RRL methods focus on special cases or prescribed designs for particular types of tasks, making it difficult to compare across different tasks and environments. Our work combines recent advances in model-based RL and convex optimization theory to formulate a general purpose algorithm for constrained policy optimization, which provides a foundation for future research on robust reinforcement learning.

这是一种新型的用于可靠强化学习（RRL）的约束策略优化算法。CPO将任务限制纳入考虑中，并通过模型学习算法的结构利用高效的方法提升采样效率。首先，基于线性规划的约束传播算法被开发出来。然后，将LP融入CPO框架中使用替代方法——对偶上升法。具体地说，通过求解对偶问题获得最优解，该方法排除了在训练时需要昂贵前向模拟的需求。

本文的实验结果表明，CPO相比其他基线算法在许多复杂环境下的性能都得到了显著提升，并且在一定程度上降低了采样复杂度的要求。同时，它展示出在一些需要高维输入的问题上优于其他基线方法的能力。论文源代码和数据将会在公众场合予以发布，促进这一领域的更深入研究。
