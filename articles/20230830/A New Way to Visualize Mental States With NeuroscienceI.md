The recent advance in machine learning algorithms has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and achieved great successes in many areas such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, these advanced models have also shown their limits when it comes to explaining or understanding how humans perceive, understand, and make decisions. In this article, we propose a new way to visualize mental states using neuroscience-inspired multiscale representations (MSRs). We present an approach that combines the principles of human psychology and cognitive science with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The proposed method uses multiple scales of neural activity patterns to represent the mental states of individuals at different levels of abstraction. It provides intuitive insights into how different aspects of a person’s mind work together to produce behavior and decision-making processes. By analyzing and visualizing the data generated by our model, we hope to inspire further research and development on better understanding and predicting individual mental health issues.

In order for machines to become more like humans, we need to develop models that can capture and analyze complex patterns in their brains and bodies. One common tool used to study neural activities is electroencephalography (EEG), which records signals from the brain’s electrical nerves during active periods of consciousness. Although EEG has been widely used in medical and clinical settings to diagnose various diseases, its signal recording is slow and requires specialized equipment and expertise. To address this limitation, several groups have developed computational methods based on mathematical formulas derived from biological experiments. These methods are not optimized for real-time analysis of continuously recorded EEG signals, making them impractical for practical applications. 

Recent advances in deep learning algorithms have allowed us to build powerful models that can perform complex tasks with limited amounts of training data. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can classify images, detect objects, and generate captions given raw text input. Moreover, attention mechanisms have emerged that allow CNNs to focus on important features while attending to background clutter. While these models have made significant progress in various fields, they still struggle to accurately capture the complexity and richness of mental states captured by the human brain. Despite these challenges, there has been little research dedicated towards developing effective visualization tools for understanding mental states. In fact, most existing approaches rely heavily on subjective judgments or heuristic rules to interpret the underlying neural signals. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of the visualizations and the effectiveness of the models' predictions. 

To address these limitations, we propose an approach that combines the principles of human psychology and cognitive science with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Our model involves multiple scales of neural activity patterns obtained through multivariate analysis of time series data collected from the scalp. We hypothesize that the different parts of the brain responsible for different mental functions will show up as distinct clusters at different abstractions, similar to the structure of the human visual system. We use clustering algorithms to group these activations into meaningful subspaces, where each cluster represents a particular mental state or concept. This representation allows us to explore the relationships between different components of the brain and offers insights into how people process information and reason about abstract concepts. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our model enables the exploration and interpretation of complex brain activity patterns across diverse domains such as music performance, sentiment analysis, and autonomous driving. Finally, we plan to release our source code and pre-trained models so that others can benefit from our research and accelerate their own research in this area.

Neuroscience and psychology provide a unique framework for understanding how the human brain works. Understanding the structures and functions of the brain may help us develop more accurate and comprehensive models for mental state modeling and prediction. At the core of our model is a novel approach that captures and interprets brain activity at multiple scales. Rather than focusing solely on single-neuron spiking activity, we aim to capture dynamic interactions among hundreds or even thousands of neurons over a long period of time. Neural oscillations at different frequencies and temporal resolutions reflect different stages of processing within the brain, and multi-scale analysis reveals patterns and connections across layers and modalities. In addition to capturing firing rates, our model collects other physiological and psychological factors that influence brain function, including eye movements, heart rate, breathing pattern, mood, and body temperature.

Our approach leverages machine learning techniques to automatically identify and segment relevant patterns in the data. Specifically, we apply clustering algorithms to identify groups of activation patterns that correspond to specific mental states or behaviors. Unlike traditional clustering algorithms that require predetermined labels or parameters, we adaptively optimize the number and size of clusters based on the availability of labeled data and prior knowledge of typical mental states. Once identified, we extract discriminative features from each cluster to enable statistical classification or prediction tasks. Additionally, we use dimensionality reduction techniques to simplify the large-dimensional representations to facilitate visualization and interpretation. Overall, our model enables the exploration and interpretation of complex brain activity patterns across diverse domains, providing valuable insights into how people process information and reason about abstract concepts.
