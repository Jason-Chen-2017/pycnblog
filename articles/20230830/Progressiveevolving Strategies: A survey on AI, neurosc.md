## 概要概述
Psychological exploration is a fundamental part of intelligent systems’ ability to reason about the world, which has led to a considerable research effort in recent years towards understanding how humans think and learn from experience. Over the past decade or so, various neural mechanisms have been proposed for developing this ability such as hierarchical organization of memory, distributed processing networks, and dopamine signalling among others. However, little is known about whether these processes are entirely conscious or adaptive, i.e., can they formulate their own thoughts and actions without relying on external stimuli? The answer lies in progressive evolving strategies (PES), an artificial intelligence (AI) theory developed by scholars across different fields, that captures the idea that cognitive abilities emerge through gradual development over time with individual differences in skills, knowledge, and attention span. 

In this article, we will explore the PES approach based on recent research advances in machine learning, computational neuroscience, and behavioral science. We begin by defining basic concepts like neural networks and decision making under uncertainty and move forward to discuss the PES model along with its underlying principles and mathematical formulations. Next, we cover the core algorithmic operations and explain them using detailed code examples and explanations. Finally, we evaluate the benefits and limitations of PES in achieving better humanlike intelligence and draw conclusions for future directions in research. 

本文将围绕最近在机器学习、计算神经科学及行为科学方面的研究成果展开。首先，介绍一些基础概念——如神经网络、不确定性下的决策等；然后，阐明PES模型及其原理与数学表达；接着，讨论PES算法及其实现细节，并详细介绍相关代码实例和注释。最后，评估PES在实现更像人类的智能体系中的优势与局限性，并对未来的研究方向进行展望。

## 2.1 人工智能（Artificial Intelligence）简介
Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, is a term used to describe machines with human-like abilities to perceive, reason, and act upon information and data. While some types of AI include natural language processing, speech recognition, and vision, other areas of AI research involve problem-solving techniques such as search algorithms, pathfinding, and knowledge representation. These methods enable machines to perform tasks that would be considered difficult for living beings, including playing chess, identifying objects, navigating environments, translating languages, and solving complex puzzles. 

The scope of AI research spans multiple domains including computer science, engineering, biology, linguistics, physics, mathematics, economics, medicine, finance, and social sciences. To date, there exist several subfields within AI, each focused on a specific area of study, such as game playing, expert systems, robotics, and machine learning. In addition to these traditional branches, new areas of research involving human-robot interaction, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging all share many similarities with traditional AI approaches. Despite this widespread interest in AI, much remains unknown about its design and operation. Understanding why machines behave the way they do requires further investigation into the structure and function of brains and nervous systems.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of machines to simulate human thinking, learning, and reasoning capabilities. It involves computers being able to understand and make decisions based on input data and instructions. AI can help improve decision-making processes, optimize production lines, automate business processes, and enhance user experiences. Researchers are working hard to develop AI systems capable of performing advanced tasks that previously required specialized hardware or software solutions.

## 2.2 认知心理学（Cognition & Psychology）简介
Cognition and psychology are two important interdisciplinary fields of scientific endeavor that interact closely with one another. Cognition deals with the logical development and organization of our brain, while psychology studies human mind and behavior. There are numerous diverse disciplines related to cognition and psychology, but here we focus on the following three pillars:

1. Neuropsychology - focuses on how the human brain works and the effects it produces on behavior
2. Neural engineering - explores the principles of how neurons work together to produce complex behaviors
3. Psychophysics - explains how visual and auditory signals are processed and interpreted in the brain

One popular example of the use of cognition and psychology in AI is self-driving cars. Self-driving cars require a deep understanding of both cognitive functions and motor control, just as people do. This involves training large neural networks of sensors and processors to interpret raw data and generate safe driving behaviors. It also involves optimizing network connections between neurons and integrating sensory feedback loops to ensure safety even in conditions of adverse weather. Additionally, the successful deployment of self-driving cars requires continuous monitoring and improvement of AI models that reflect changes in driver behavior.

Another interesting application of cognition and psychology in AI concerns virtual assistants. Virtual assistants provide a personal touch to interactions with devices via voice commands, enabling users to ask questions and receive responses in real-time. Within the field of natural language processing, chatbots play a crucial role in providing personalized assistance through natural conversation flows. They analyze user input to identify intentions and extract relevant contextual information before generating appropriate responses. Similarly, in reinforcement learning, agents interact with environments and learn to achieve goals by trial and error. Similar techniques also apply to virtually guided decision-making systems, where the agent learns to predict outcomes and take actions accordingly.

Overall, understanding how humans think and learn from experience has significant implications for building robust and reliable AI systems. Efforts at recreating this “thinking” process, particularly in machines, could lead to breakthroughs in various applications, ranging from faster navigation, to improved decision-making, to more efficient communication and entertainment.
