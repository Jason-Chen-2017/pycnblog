# 2.支持向量机(Support Vector Machine, SVM)概述
支持向量机(SVM)是一种著名的机器学习分类模型，被广泛用于图像识别、自然语言处理等领域。它基于一种划分超平面将数据集中的样本点分到两类，使得不同类别的数据点尽可能远离决策边界。其主要优点包括对异常值、不平衡的数据集和高维数据集的鲁棒性、高效率和高度可解释性。目前，支持向量机在文本情感分析、生物信息学、生物标记、分类问题、模式识别等方面都有着广泛的应用。

# 2.1 概念、术语及核心属性
## 2.1.1 支持向量机（SVM）
Support vector machine (SVM) is a type of supervised learning model that uses a hyperplane to separate data into different classes. The hyperplane is chosen based on finding the optimal line or decision boundary that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The goal is to find a separating hyperplane that has maximum number of samples on each side.

The objective function of SVM is to maximize the distance between the positive examples (the training instances belonging to one class) and the negative examples (those belonging to the other). This can be done by introducing slack variables and modifying the objective function to penalize misclassifications. The optimization problem for SVM involves solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem, which can become computationally intensive when dealing with large datasets. To address this issue, a kernel trick can be used to transform non-linearly separable data into higher dimensional spaces where linear separation becomes possible.

For binary classification, SVM can produce a straight decision boundary that separates the two classes perfectly. However, for multi-class classification, several binary classifiers can be combined to form a soft-margin hyperplane. Each classifier assigns a score to each test instance and the final prediction is obtained by taking the majority vote among all the scores. SVMs can handle both categorical and continuous features, and do not require any prior knowledge about the underlying distribution of the data. They perform very well even with relatively small amounts of data due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships. Overall, SVMs offer high accuracy and efficiency for most classification tasks.

## 2.1.2 超平面（Hyperplane）
A hyperplane is a flat, infinite-dimensional space that splits a set of vectors into two sets. A hyperplane is mathematically defined as the intersection of a set of linear equations. In SVM terminology, the hyperplane is usually represented as w^T x + b = 0, where w is the normal vector and b is the bias term. Here, w^T denotes the dot product of w and x, and b represents the offset. If the value of w^Tx+b is greater than zero, then the sample belongs to the first class, otherwise it belongs to the second class. Hyperplanes can be used to classify samples or predict outcomes given new inputs. 

## 2.1.3 支持向量（Support Vectors）
A support vector is a sample whose distance from the hyperplane is minimal and lies within the margin. These points play a crucial role in determining the margin of the hyperplane and affect the choice of the hyperplane's equation parameters. Support vectors are those instances that lie closest to the decision boundary of the SVM. When creating an SVM, only the support vectors matter since they define the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Other instances are irrelevant and do not contribute significantly to the performance of the SVM.

## 2.1.4 决策边界（Decision Boundary）
The decision boundary is the region where the SVM separates the different classes. The border between two classes is called the decision surface. We want the samples to be classified correctly and fall as close as possible to the decision surface to get better accuracy results. 

The decision boundary depends on the combination of the features selected for training. Therefore, it is important to consider the nature of our input data and choose the right subset of features that provide the best representation of the problem at hand. We can use tools like PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

## 2.1.5 拉格朗日乘子法（Lagrange Multiplier Method）
This method is used to solve the QP problem associated with the SVM. It consists of adding constraints to the original optimization problem by introducing lagrange multipliers α and β. In this way, we can minimize the cost function subject to the constraint that the lagrange multipliers must be less than or equal to zero. Once we obtain the solution, we can interpret it as the coefficients of the support vectors, i.e., the weight vector assigned to each support vector. 

We can view the SVM algorithm as follows:

1. Choose a suitable kernel function to map the raw input data into a higher-dimensional space.
2. Train a support vector classifier using the labeled data and the corresponding kernel matrix.
3. Use the computed coefficients to make predictions on new data.

## 2.1.6 参数优化（Parameter Optimization）
Parameters of an SVM include the kernel function, regularization coefficient, and the penalty term to control overfitting. Different combinations of these parameters can lead to different solutions. To tune these parameters efficiently, we can use grid search, randomized search, or Bayesian optimization.

Grid search is a simple approach that iteratively tests multiple values of the hyperparameters and selects the configuration leading to the highest accuracy. Randomized search takes advantage of the probabilistic interpretation of machine learning algorithms to generate candidates from distributions instead of just testing individual values. Bayesian optimization explores the unknown regions of the hyperparameter space to select the configurations that yield the highest expected improvements.

Regularization coefficients help prevent overfitting by shrinking the importance of the misclassified samples towards the decision boundary. Higher values of the regularization parameter cause the model to shrink the margin around the support vectors, making it more likely to generalize well to unseen data. On the other hand, lower values increase the importance of misclassified samples and may result in underfitting. Parameter tuning is essential for achieving good performance on a variety of datasets.

# 2.2 模型训练
## 2.2.1 二分类问题
### 2.2.1.1 数据集的准备
First, we prepare the dataset consisting of training instances and labels. Let’s assume that the dataset contains N instances and D features. Furthermore, let’s assume that there are K distinct classes in the dataset. The label y of an instance indicates the true class of the instance, while y=1 indicates the first class and y=K−1 indicates the last class. Since we are doing binary classification, there are actually only two classes in total. Below is an example of a synthetic dataset:

| Instance | Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Label |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
|   (1)    |    0      |    0      |   1   |
|   (2)    |    1      |    0      |   2   |
|   (3)    |    0      |    1      |   1   |
|  .       |   .      |   .      |  .   |
|  .       |   .      |   .      |  .   |
|   (N)    |    1      |    1      |   2   |

### 2.2.1.2 特征选择
Feature selection refers to selecting a subset of relevant features that contain significant information about the target variable. In practice, we typically select a small subset of highly informative features that are discriminative enough to distinguish between the two classes. A commonly used technique for feature selection is forward selection. Forward selection starts with an empty set of selected features and repeatedly adds the feature that improves the accuracy of the classifier until no further improvement is observed. Using this strategy, we would start by considering only feature 1 as the only selected feature. Then, we would add feature 2 to the selected set if it improves the performance of the classifier. Similarly, we continue to iterate until we have considered all D features, resulting in a smaller set of selected features that are sufficient to represent the variation in the data.

### 2.2.1.3 核函数
A kernel function maps the input space into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separator cannot be found. Kernel functions take into account the similarity of the input vectors, which enables us to learn non-linear relationships between features. There are several popular choices of kernel functions, including polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid, and histogram intersection. Polynomial kernels take the form k(x,y)=θ<x,y>+c, where c is a free parameter that controls the degree of nonlinearity. RBF kernels are similar to polynomial kernels but differ in how they measure the distance between pairs of instances. Instead of using explicit values of x and y, RBF kernels compute the Euclidean distances between the input vectors and apply the Gaussian function. Sigmoid kernels are widely used in neural networks for regression and classification problems. Histogram intersection kernel measures the overlap between histograms of pairwise comparison vectors derived from query and reference images.

Based on the chosen kernel function, we construct the kernel matrix K, which captures the similarity between pairs of instances. Specifically, we calculate the inner products of all possible pairs of instances xi and xj and store them in the diagonal entries of the kernel matrix. Then, we fill off-diagonal entries according to the formula k(xi,xj)=exp(-gamma||xi-xj||^2), where gamma is another free parameter that determines the width of the kernel.

To optimize the SVM classifier, we need to solve the following quadratic programming (QP) problem:

    min_w sum_{i=1}^N [1 - y_i(w^Tx_i)] + ε ||w||^2
    s.t. Kw ≤ 1
        y_i(w^Tx_i) >= 1 ∀i=1..N

where w is the weight vector representing the support vectors, ε is the regularization constant, and y_i(w^Tx_i) is the signed distance of the i-th instance to the hyperplane. In this problem, we try to minimize the weighted hinge loss plus L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. The left-hand side enforces the correct class assignment of each instance, while the right-hand side constrains the weights to satisfy the kernel condition, meaning that the output of the dot product of the instance and the weight vector should be bounded by [-1,1].

Once we obtain the solution, we interpret it as the coefficients of the support vectors, i.e., the weight vector assigned to each support vector. We can now evaluate the quality of the learned model by computing metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Precision tells us the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant to the user, while recall measures the proportion of truly relevant documents that were retrieved. F1-score combines precision and recall into a single metric. AUC-ROC measures the probability that a randomly chosen positive document is ranked above a randomly chosen negative document. Optimal values of the threshold determine the tradeoff between sensitivity (true positives/total positives) and specificity (true negatives/total negatives), leading to a balance between false positives and false negatives.
