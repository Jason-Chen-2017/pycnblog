Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial stage of the machine learning workflow that involves inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and understanding the dataset to find patterns and trends. It helps us gain insights into the data that can inform future modeling decisions and help make better-informed business decisions. However, EDA tasks are challenging as they require analyzing large datasets and complex statistical models. This article provides an overview of various open source tools and techniques for performing EDA on large datasets using Python programming language. We will cover three main components: data manipulation with Pandas library; visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries; and statistical analysis with Statsmodels library. These libraries provide high-level functions that simplify common operations such as merging tables, grouping records by variables, plotting scatter plots, computing correlations between variables, etc., making it easier to perform exploratory data analysis. Additionally, we will discuss how to automate EDA processes using Scikit-learn library's feature engineering pipeline approach, which allows us to build complex transformations of the data automatically based on domain knowledge or rules extracted from the data itself. Finally, this article highlights limitations of current methods and suggests directions for further research.

This article assumes readers have basic familiarity with Python programming language and its scientific computing ecosystem including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels libraries. If you need more background information, please refer to other resources available online, such as Python for Data Analysis by Miller et al. [1].

In summary, this article explores various techniques and tools for performing EDA on large datasets while highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. By combining these tools and techniques, analysts can improve efficiency and productivity when working with large datasets and deliver higher quality results to stakeholders. Overall, this article aims to promote collaboration and communication among data scientists and machine learning engineers to develop best practices for EDA workflows across industries and organizations.

2.基础知识和术语
Data manipulation - The process of selecting, filtering, sorting, aggregating, modifying, and rearranging data within a database or spreadsheet is known as data manipulation. With Pandas library, we can easily manipulate tabular data sets like CSV files or databases table rows. Commonly used functions include loading data from different formats such as CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON files, merging tables, joining tables on specific fields, splitting columns, creating new columns, renaming columns, dropping rows/columns, grouping data, filtering data based on conditions, converting data types, calculating descriptive statistics, and pivoting tables. Some of the most commonly used pandas functions include df.head(), df.tail(), df.shape, df.info(), df.describe(), df.corr().

Visualization - Visualization is another important component of EDA. Visually displaying data points, lines, shapes, and relationships among them is one way to communicate ideas quickly and concisely. The ability to identify patterns, outliers, and anomalies in the data is essential to successful EDA. There are several visualization libraries in Python such as Matplotlib and Seaborn that allow us to create high-quality static and interactive visualizations. Commonly used functions include creating line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, heat maps, box plots, and violin plots. Some of the most commonly used seaborn functions include sns.lmplot(), sns.regplot(), sns.heatmap(), sns.boxplot(), sns.distplot().

Statistical analysis - Statistical analysis refers to the use of mathematical formulas and statistical models to analyze data collected over time. While EDA focuses on identifying trends and relationships within the data, statistical analysis can reveal deeper insights about the underlying mechanisms behind those trends. With Statsmodels library, we can fit linear regression, logistic regression, and generalized linear models to the data and evaluate their performance using statistical tests like t-test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, Chi-squared test, etc. Some of the most commonly used statsmodels functions include OLS(), Logit(), GLM(), ttest_ind(), f_oneway(), etc.
