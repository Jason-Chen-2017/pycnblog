# 1.简介
  

Dynamic programming (DP) is a powerful technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each of those subproblems once, and then combining the solutions to give a solution to the original problem. DP can be applied to many areas such as optimization, game theory, machine learning, signal processing, and economics. In this article, we will focus on using dynamic programming in algorithmic paradigm approach to develop an AI model for predicting stock prices based on historical data. We will use Python code examples along with explanation to make it easy understandable for everyone interested in Dynamic Programming. 

2.动态规划问题定义
A dynamic programming problem consists of two parts - a decision variable, x(i), which represents some state at time step i, and a set of recurrence relations that define how the value of the decision variable depends on its previous states. The goal of the problem is to find out the optimal or maximum value of the decision variable over a range of future time steps, given the current state and values of other variables. Dynamic programming uses memoization to store previously computed results so that they can be reused instead of recomputing them repeatedly.

3.机器学习与动态规划的关系
Machine learning involves training algorithms to learn from past experience and make predictions about new situations. In contrast, dynamic programming is a mathematical method used to optimally allocate resources among activities without having any prior knowledge about the task being optimized. It finds applications across various fields including optimization, signal processing, finance, and control systems. For example, Google's PageRank algorithm, one of the most widely used search engines, is implemented through dynamic programming techniques. Similarly, Apple's Siri and Alexa voice assistants also rely on dynamic programming algorithms to provide users with intelligent answers.

4.时间序列预测问题
Given a sequence of daily stock prices, our aim is to predict the price at time t+k where k > 1. A naive approach would be to use simple statistical methods like linear regression to estimate the coefficients and predict the next day’s price based on the last few days’ prices. However, this approach may not perform well due to noise, seasonality, and missing data. To address these issues, we can use dynamic programming to optimize the choice of features, hyperparameters, and model architecture for predicting the next price. Here are the general steps involved in building a DP-based stock prediction model:
Step 1: Define the Decision Variable
The decision variable we need to optimize is the vector y, containing the predicted prices for all time steps up to k. Initially, we assume that all elements of y are zero except for y[t], which is initialized to the actual price of the stock today.

Step 2: Write Recursion Relations
Based on the properties of the decision variable and the available data, we write the recursion relation between different subproblems, specifically, r(i,j) representing the expected profit/loss if we buy the stock at time i and sell it at time j. This means we want to maximize the total profit/loss obtained by making sequential trades. One way to break down this larger problem into smaller ones is to consider only pairs of adjacent days. Hence, we have:
r(i,j) = max{p(i)-r(i+1,j)+max{q(h)|h<j}(r(i,h)), q(j)-r(i+1,j-1)}
where p(i) and q(j) represent the stock prices at times i and j respectively, and h ranges from i+1 to j-1. 

Note that the first term inside the max function corresponds to the case when we hold the stock until time j, sell it at time j, and get a profit of p(i)-r(i+1,j). The second term inside the max function corresponds to the case when we don't hold the stock until time j-1 but sell it later, getting a loss of q(j)-r(i+1,j-1). If both terms result in the same expected profit/loss, we choose either one arbitrarily.

Step 3: Compute Base Cases
We compute the base cases separately for i=1 and j=n, where n is the length of the input sequence. These correspond to holding the stock throughout the entire period and computing the final profit/loss after the last trade.

Step 4: Solve Subproblems Using Memoization
To avoid repeating computations, we use memoization to cache the results of intermediate subproblems and reuse them whenever needed. Specifically, we maintain a table called dp, where dp[i][j] stores the expected profit/loss obtained by making the optimal decisions up to time j starting from time i.

Step 5: Combine Results
Finally, we combine the results from the bottom-up and top-down approaches to obtain the overall optimum strategy. Specifically, for each pair of adjacent days i,j, we take the maximum value of r(i,j) obtained from both directions, namely from either selling the stock now or waiting till the end of the interval to sell it. We pick the direction that yields higher profit/loss per unit of capital invested. Finally, we return the cumulative sum of profits achieved by following the chosen strategies over the whole trading period.

Here is the implementation of the above algorithm in Python:


```python
def best_buy_sell(prices):
    # Step 1: Initialize the decision variable and dp table
    n = len(prices)
    y = [0]*n
    dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

    # Step 2: Set the initial conditions
    y[0] = prices[0]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    # Step 3: Compute the base cases
    dp[0][1] = max(prices[0]-y[0]+dp[1][1], 0)
    for j in range(2, n):
        dp[0][j] = max(-prices[j-1]+dp[1][j-1], 0) + dp[0][j-2]
    
    # Step 4: Solve the subproblems using memoization
    for l in range(2, n):
        for i in range(n-l):
            j = i + l
            dp[i][j] = max(prices[i]-y[i]+dp[i+1][j],
                            prices[j]-y[j]+dp[i][j-1])

            # Adjust for possibility of holding the stock after time j
            k = min(i+2, j-1)  
            while k < j:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j],
                                prices[i]-y[i]+dp[k][j]+dp[i][k-1])
                k += 1
            
            # Adjust for possibility of holding the stock before time i
            m = max(i+1, j-2)  
            while m <= i:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j],
                                prices[j]-y[j]+dp[i][m]+dp[m+1][j-1])
                m += 1
                
            # Update y for the best possible path ending at time j 
            y[j] = prices[j] - dp[i][j]
            
    # Step 5: Return the cumulative sum of profits achieved 
    cumsum = 0
    curr_profit = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr_profit += prices[i] - y[i]
        cumsum += curr_profit
        
    return cumsum
    
```
