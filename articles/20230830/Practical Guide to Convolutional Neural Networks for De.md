# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Introduction to CNNs
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning algorithms that are particularly well suited for analyzing and recognizing patterns in visual imagery. They were first introduced by Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton in 2012, and they are commonly used in applications like image recognition, speech recognition, and autonomous driving. In recent years, CNNs have become very popular in a wide range of fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and medical imaging.

A typical CNN architecture consists of multiple layers of neurons that extract features from input data. Each layer performs several operations on its inputs, including convolution, pooling, normalization, activation, and dropout. The resulting outputs from these layers are fed into fully connected layers, which perform classification tasks using the extracted features. Overall, the goal of any CNN is to learn complex relationships between the pixels of an input image and predict the output label. This process is known as feature extraction.


### Convolution Layers
The central building block of a CNN is the convolution layer, which applies a filter to the input image to produce feature maps. A filter is simply a small matrix of weights that performs certain mathematical calculations on the pixel values surrounding the current position. For example, if we want to detect edges in an image, a simple edge detector filter might look something like this:

```
   -1  0  1
 -1  0  1
 -1  0  1
```

When convolving this filter over the input image, we get the following feature map:


In general, filters can be designed to respond differently to different types of features in the input image. Different filters could be applied at different stages of the network to capture specific aspects of the image. Some common examples include:

1. Edge detection filters - These filters use derivatives of the image gradient to highlight the boundaries of objects in the image. 
2. Sharpening filters - These filters enhance the appearance of the image by increasing the contrast between adjacent regions of high intensity. 
3. Blurring filters - These filters smooth out the image to reduce noise while preserving important features.
4. Texture analysis filters - These filters analyze the spatial arrangement and distribution of image texture to identify areas of interest. 

Each filter has its own set of parameters that must be learned during training. During inference time, the learned parameters are used to generate feature maps that represent the presence of various features in the input image.

### Pooling Layers
Pooling layers are optional components of a CNN that downsample the output of previous layers to reduce the dimensionality of the representation. This is done by applying a pooling operation to subregions of the feature maps produced by the convolution layers. Common pooling strategies include max pooling, average pooling, and region-based pooling. Max pooling takes the maximum value within each subregion, whereas average pooling computes the mean value. Region-based pooling groups similarly shaped regions together and pooled them together, leading to reduced computational cost and improved accuracy.

### Fully Connected Layers
After the last pooling layer, the final output of the CNN is passed through one or more fully connected layers, which compute the class probabilities for the input sample. These layers often contain a large number of nodes, making them prone to overfitting. To prevent this, regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization, dropouts, and early stopping can be employed to mitigate the effects of overfitting.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is an essential aspect of any machine learning task, especially when working with images. Images are typically stored in grayscale format where each pixel represents a single scalar value representing brightness. However, most deep learning frameworks expect input tensors in RGB format where each channel corresponds to a color (Red, Green, Blue). Therefore, we may need to preprocess the raw image data to convert it to the required format. Additionally, depending on the complexity of the problem, we may also need to augment the dataset by generating additional samples by flipping, rotating, scaling, zooming, etc. the existing ones. 

One common approach to address these challenges is to normalize the pixel values of the input images to fall within a fixed range [0, 1]. Another common technique is to train the network on a subset of the available labeled data and fine-tune the hyperparameters on the remaining unlabeled data. This helps improve both the overall quality of the model and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

## Loss Function Selection
Classification problems involve assigning labels to input samples based on their similarity to predefined classes or categories. One common metric used to evaluate the performance of a classifier is the cross entropy loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted probability distributions and the true label distribution. In practice, we usually minimize the negative log likelihood of the observed data points under the estimated parameter distributions to find the optimal parameter values that minimize the loss. Other popular loss functions include binary crossentropy for multi-class classification problems and mean squared error for regression tasks.

## Regularization Techniques
Regularization is a technique used to control the complexity of a model by penalizing its weights during training. There are two main forms of regularization: weight decay and dropout. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages the weights from taking on extreme values. Dropout randomly drops out some fraction of neurons during training, which forces the network to focus on the relevant features rather than relying too much on individual neurons. Dropout works by randomly setting the output of some neurons to zero, effectively treating them as irrelevant. On the other hand, dropout has been shown to improve the generalization capability of a model. By combining weight decay and dropout, we can achieve satisfactory tradeoffs between model capacity and robustness to overfitting.

## Optimizing Model Performance
In order to optimize the performance of a deep learning model, there are several key steps that we can take:

1. Choosing a suitable optimizer and learning rate schedule. Many popular optimizers such as Adam, Adagrad, and RMSprop have been shown to work well in different contexts. The choice of learning rate scheduler depends on the nature of the problem and the size of the training dataset. 

2. Fine-tuning the hyperparameters. Hyperparameter tuning involves experimenting with different combinations of hyperparameters such as the number of hidden units, dropout rates, batch sizes, etc. until we reach the best performance on validation data.

3. Using data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation techniques generate additional synthetic samples by modifying existing samples in ways that do not change their meaning but still enable the model to recognize them correctly. Popular methods include random crops, flips, rotations, and scalings.

4. Transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique that leverages pre-trained models trained on large datasets for transfer learning. This reduces the amount of training data needed to solve the problem, thus improving the speed and efficiency of the training process.
