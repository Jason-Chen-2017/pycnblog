Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), also known as ConvNet or CNN, are one of the most popular deep learning models in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. In this blog article we will discuss the basics of convolutional neural networks including architecture, layers, operations and implementation using Python with a focus on building a basic CNN model for classifying images. We will also demonstrate how to train the model on different datasets and fine-tune it for better accuracy. Finally, we will compare our results with state-of-the-art benchmarks. The code implementation used here is written completely from scratch without any prebuilt libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch etc., which makes it easier to understand what's happening inside the model. 

In summary, this article provides an understanding of CNNs by breaking them down into their fundamental components such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, activation functions, regularization techniques, data augmentation techniques and loss functions. Additionally, we implement these concepts using Python language with Keras library and demonstrate how to build and train a simple CNN model on CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification task. By doing so, we hope that readers can get started with building and training their own CNN models on various computer vision problems and achieve good performance levels. 

Let’s dive right into it! 


## 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology 

Before diving into details about the various components involved in a typical CNN model, let’s first understand some important terms and ideas related to CNNs. These concepts will be useful throughout the rest of this article.

1. **Convolution Layer:** A convolution layer applies filters over the input image in order to extract features from it. It consists of multiple feature maps that capture different aspects of the input image depending on the filter kernel. Each neuron in the output feature map corresponds to a receptive field within the input image, and its value is computed based on the weighted sum of values in the corresponding receptive field of the input image.

2. **Pooling Layer:** Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps extracted by convolution layers. They apply non-linearities such as max-pooling or average-pooling, which summarize the contents of local regions in the feature map, thereby reducing the dimensionality but retaining important information.

3. **Fully Connected Layers:** Fully connected layers (FCN) are typically applied after convolutional and pooling layers to transform the final feature maps into a vector representation that captures both global patterns and local relevance. FCNs have been shown to perform well on complex pattern recognition tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and scene categorization.

4. **Receptive Field:** Receptive field refers to the region in the visual cortex of the brain that responds to specific stimuli. Similarly, the receptive field of each neuron in a convolutional layer is defined as the region centered around that neuron that takes inputs from a certain set of neurons in the previous layer. This region moves across the entire width and height of the input volume during the forward pass through the network, while varying the depth or channel dimension according to the number of input channels.

5. **Stride:** Stride determines the step size taken by the filters when scanning the input image. In other words, stride controls the overlap between adjacent receptive fields in the same feature map.

6. **Padding:** Padding adds zeros around the border of the input image to preserve the spatial dimensions of the feature maps produced by the convolution operation.

7. **Activation Function:** Activation function is a non-linearity used at the end of every layer except the last fully connected layer. Common choices include Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Sigmoid, Softmax, and tanh.

8. **Regularization Techniques:** Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting of the model to the training data. Some commonly used methods are Dropout, L2/L1 regularization, Batch normalization, and Early stopping.

9. **Data Augmentation:** Data augmentation involves creating artificial copies of existing samples in the training data, which helps to increase the diversity of the training set and improve generalization capability of the model.

10. **Loss Functions:** Loss functions measure the difference between predicted outputs and actual labels in a regression or classification problem. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross Entropy Loss, Hinge Loss, and Binary Cross Entropy Loss.

11. **Optimizer:** Optimizer updates the weights of the model during backpropagation by adjusting the gradients of the error with respect to the parameters of the model. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adam, and RMSprop.
