# 1.简介
  

Differential evolution (DE) is a population-based stochastic optimization algorithm used to solve problems that have continuous search spaces. In this article we will explore the implementation of DE using Tensorflow and Keras libraries as an AI platform for solving deep learning tasks like classification or regression. We will also cover how to apply DE algorithms on various real-world problems and evaluate their performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we will discuss the limitations of DE in terms of computational complexity, robustness, and scalability. This article assumes readers are familiar with basic concepts such as artificial intelligence, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, gradient descent, and backpropagation. 

In summary, our goal is to provide an understanding of Differential Evolution (DE) as an optimization technique suitable for solving complex optimization problems in machine learning and deep learning.

## Population-Based Stochastic Optimization
Population-based stochastic optimization techniques are characterized by two main components: a population of candidate solutions, which represent possible solutions to the problem being optimized; and a method to select parents from the population to produce offspring to be added to the next generation. These techniques adaptively modify the parameters of each individual solution based on the fitness of its parent(s), leading to better convergence rates than traditional global optimization methods. A good example of a popular population-based stochastic optimization technique is genetic algorithms (GA). 

Differential evolution is one type of population-based stochastic optimization technique designed specifically for continuous search spaces. It uses a combination of mutation operators and crossover operators to generate new candidates by applying slight modifications to existing ones. The key idea behind differential evolution is that small changes can lead to large improvements in objective function value. To perform differential evolution, a population of candidate solutions must be initialized randomly, then evaluated according to some criteria before entering into the loop where the following operations are repeated: 

1. Selection: Select a subset of individuals from the current population to act as "parents" for producing offspring. These parents can either be selected uniformly at random or based on their fitness values.

2. Crossover: Apply crossover operator to combine the features of the selected parents to create offspring. The probability of performing crossover is usually set to a small value so that only a small number of individuals get modified during each iteration.

3. Mutation: Apply mutation operator to introduce small changes into the offspring created above. This step ensures diversity among the population and helps avoid local minima. The probability of mutating each feature is also typically low, but higher if the dimensionality of the search space is high.

The process continues until convergence is achieved or a maximum number of iterations is reached. At any point in time, the best solution found by the optimizer can be obtained by selecting it from the entire population. Differential evolution has shown impressive performance in a wide range of applications including image processing, signal processing, finance, engineering, and physics. However, there are several drawbacks associated with DE, especially when applied to deep learning problems due to its intrinsic nature of continuous search spaces. These include slow convergence speeds, lack of exploration around local optima, and difficulty in handling non-convex functions. Therefore, more advanced variants of DE like particle swarm optimization and genetic programming are preferred in deep learning settings.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and functionality of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, representing input signals, which pass through hidden layers, activated by non-linear functions called activation functions, finally outputting results to make predictions or classify inputs. Each layer consists of neurons that carry out different transformations on the input data.

In deep learning, ANNs are commonly employed to solve supervised learning problems, i.e., they learn a mapping between input data and target outputs. In these problems, the network learns to predict outputs given inputs while minimizing errors between predicted and actual targets. Common types of neural networks in deep learning include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

In addition to standard ANNs, we will also use recurrent layers, i.e., RNN cells that process sequential data. One application of RNNs in deep learning is language modeling, where the model takes in sequences of words as input and tries to predict the next word in the sequence. Another common use case of RNNs is speech recognition and synthesis.
