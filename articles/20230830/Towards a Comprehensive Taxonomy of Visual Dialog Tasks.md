Visual dialog systems aim to enable machines to interact with users by generating visual and textual responses that convey concepts or actions in images. The tasks can be broadly categorized into two types: open-ended question answering (OpenQA) and multimodal dialogue understanding (MMSD). In this article, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of these tasks, review existing approaches for each task type, discuss challenges and future directions, and suggest actionable recommendations for researchers and developers who want to advance the field. 

In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing visual dialog systems as they are able to offer several advantages over traditional chatbots: better user experience due to the use of natural language, increased engagement levels through multi-turn interactions, and easier adaptation to new domains compared to static response generation models. However, it is unclear how well visual dialog systems work across different tasks, making it difficult for practitioners to choose which one best suits their needs. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic literature review on existing visual dialog datasets and tasks, analyzing relevant works related to each category and examining common patterns and techniques used in solving them. Based on our analysis, we proposed a comprehensive taxonomy of visual dialog tasks based on both intrinsic properties and user requirements such as problem statement, data format, evaluation metrics, human annotations, and other factors. We also reviewed current solutions for each task type and discussed potential gaps and weaknesses for further improvement. Finally, we made suggestions for practitioners and developers on how to move forward towards building more effective visual dialog systems. 

This paper presents an overview of current trends in the area of visual dialog and provides insights into the current state of the art for each task type. It identifies key challenges faced by researchers and suggests ways to overcome them. Overall, our objective is to provide practical guidance for technical professionals interested in advancing the development of visual dialog systems and to stimulate active collaboration between researchers and industry partners.

The main contributions of this study are: 

1. A comprehensive taxonomy of visual dialog tasks consisting of 7 subcategories.

2. An assessment of current research progress within each subcategory, including a thorough review of existing datasets, benchmarks, methods, and evaluations. 

3. Analysis of common patterns and techniques used in solving each task type, identifying areas where improvements could be made.

4. Suggestions for practitioners and developers on how to improve visual dialog systems, including opportunities for collaborative research, dataset creation, method development, and benchmark evaluation.

We hope that this article will serve as a useful reference tool for developers and researchers working in the field of visual dialog, as well as inspire students to explore cutting-edge research topics at prestigious machine learning conferences. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 任务类型（Task Types）
Visual dialog systems aim to generate natural language responses to image-based inputs, either in open-ended question answering (OpenQA) mode or in multimodal dialogue understanding (MMSD) mode. There are currently three major task categories: 

1. OpenQA: This involves generating answers from a given set of questions about an image. Common examples include "What do you see?" or "Describe the car in the picture."

2. MMSD: This involves understanding the overall context of the conversation by integrating various modality information like visual content, text, speech, etc., into a joint representation model. Common examples include "Where is the restaurant located?" or "When did you go shopping last time?".

These tasks have distinct characteristics and may require different components and architectures to solve them. For example, while OpenQA requires reasoning abilities and high accuracy, MMSD typically relies on deep neural networks and semantic parsing.  

## 2.2 数据集（Datasets）
To assess the performance of visual dialog systems, we need to compare its output against ground truth labels. Therefore, we need labeled datasets that contain paired image-text pairs annotated with correct answers or multi-modal dialogue representations annotated with structured data. There are many publicly available datasets that meet these criteria, some of which are listed below:

1. Visual Genome VQAv2: This dataset contains multiple-choice question-answer pairs extracted from the visual genome dataset, covering diverse visual concepts such as vehicles, buildings, animals, and fashion items. It is commonly used for evaluating QA systems but not limited to it.

2. VisDial v1.0: This dataset consists of visually grounded conversations between crowd workers, captured using mobile devices and webcam videos. Each conversation covers multiple rounds of interaction with a bot, resulting in large scale dataset suitable for training dialogue agents.

3. DailyDialogue Corpus: This dataset includes rich metadata, specifically conversational turns with corresponding emotions, aspects, sentiment, and nonverbal behaviors. It is often used as a pretraining corpus for retrieval-based dialogue systems.

4. Microsoft COCO Captioning Dataset: This dataset consists of captions generated by humans for images in the MS-COCO dataset, which aims to promote computer vision research in the community. The dataset is commonly used for captioning and evaluation purposes.


## 2.3 模型架构（Model Architectures）
Visual dialog systems can be classified into four general categories based on the way they represent input and output representations:

1. Bottom-Up Model: These models encode the image features separately and then combine them into a unified sentence embedding or dialogue state representation. They may rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and transformer networks. Examples of bottom-up models include CLIP, BERT-VGG, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

2. Top-Down Model: These models start by encoding the entire input sequence (image + text) and then decode the required parts of the encoded representation. They may use variational autoencoders (VAE), conditional random fields (CRF), and Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN). Examples of top-down models include LXMERT, MAC, and Coattention Network (CAN).

3. Multimodal Fusion Model: These models fuse separate modalities together before generating the final output. They may use late fusion, early fusion, attention-based fusion, or mixture of experts (MoE) frameworks. Examples of multimodal fusion models include UNITER, FiLM, MIMIC, SIMON, and Concatenation Network (ConNect).

4. End-to-End Model: These models directly take the image input along with text input and produce a single vector representing the entire conversation. They may use seq2seq models with encoder-decoder architecture or transformer models. Examples of end-to-end models include DALL-E, GPT-3, and VirTex.

Each model architecture uses specific computational mechanisms to extract meaningful features from the input, transform them into an appropriate form, and generate outputs accordingly. Different architectures have different strengths and weaknesses, depending on their ability to capture complex relationships in visual and linguistic spaces. Some popular architectures include CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and Self-Attention Mechanisms. 

## 2.4 评估指标（Evaluation Metrics）
As mentioned earlier, we need to evaluate the performance of visual dialog systems by comparing their output against gold standard labels or predicted representations. To measure the quality of predictions, we define several evaluation metrics that capture different aspects of performance, including accuracy, BLEU score, METEOR score, ROUGE score, and cosine similarity.

Accuracy is defined as the proportion of correctly identified label(s). It can only be used when the number of possible outcomes is finite and known in advance. When dealing with continuous variables, such as ratings or probabilities, F1 score or mean squared error should be used instead.

BLEU score evaluates the degree to which generated sequences match the reference ones in terms of n-gram overlap. It can be computed for individual sentences or entire corpora.

METEOR score measures the amount of morphological agreement between generated and reference texts. It accounts for variations in spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and tense.

ROUGE score is another metric widely used for summarizing generated and reference texts by measuring the extent to which they match phrases from a summary reference.

Cosine similarity is a simple yet powerful technique for comparing vectors. It calculates the angle between two vectors, providing a scalar value indicating the degree of similarity between them. Cosine similarity ranges between -1 (no similarity) and 1 (exact match), where values close to zero indicate dissimilarity.

## Subtask Category I: Image Captioning 
### Introduction
Image captioning refers to the process of automatically producing a concise description of an image that conveys its contents to a human observer. Traditionally, image captioning systems have focused on producing descriptions based on object recognition and classification, without incorporating linguistic knowledge. As the capability to communicate in natural languages becomes increasingly important in modern society, image captioning systems are becoming increasingly valuable in applications ranging from entertainment to healthcare. Currently, there are numerous research efforts dedicated to improving the performance of existing image captioning systems, including those based on deep learning models and deep reinforcement learning algorithms. 

In this subtask category, we consider the problem of predicting the most plausible caption for an image provided in a search query or product recommendation system. Given an image, the goal is to develop a model capable of producing a descriptive sentence that accurately captures what objects, people, and scenes are present in the image. One way to approach this task is to use an attention mechanism to focus on salient regions of the image and learn a sequential representation of the scene via an LSTM or GRU network. Another option is to use a fully connected layer followed by softmax activation function to classify all pixels or patches of an image into a fixed vocabulary of words, and select the most likely word combination as the caption. Despite successful approaches, both options still lack accuracy, since captions tend to be long, complex, and imprecise. Nevertheless, achieving near-human level accuracy remains a challenging challenge for image captioning systems. 

### Key Words: Image Captioning; Neural Networks; Reinforcement Learning; Convolutional Neural Networks; Long Short Term Memory; Sequence to Sequence Networks; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis; Deep Learning Methods
### Core Algorithm Principle
One core principle underlying the success of modern image captioning systems is the utilization of a pre-trained feature extractor trained on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) dataset. Although very accurate, these feature extractors do not explicitly encode the linguistic meaning of an image beyond color and texture. Thus, previous attempts to leverage linguistic knowledge in image captioning usually involved adapting existing language modeling or machine translation methods to handle the tension between high-level semantics and low-level features. Alternatively, a hybrid approach that combines a few layers of high-level semantic features with intermediate layers of raw pixel activations might provide a good balance between expressiveness and efficiency. 

An alternative approach to achieve higher accuracy than simply selecting the most likely word combination as the caption is to utilize reinforcement learning techniques that optimize the likelihood of generating fluent and coherent sentences. One approach is to design a policy network that takes in the image and generates a probability distribution over candidate sentences. The agent learns to maximize the expected reward under the policy gradient algorithm, i.e., taking gradient steps proportional to the change in expected rewards, guided by the log-likelihood of the sentences sampled by the policy. This approach avoids the need for explicit optimization of the sentence selection process, leading to faster convergence and better generalization to novel situations. Similar ideas have recently been explored for medical imaging applications, especially radiology diagnosis, using generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Another core principle behind image captioning is the use of an attention mechanism, which focuses on salient regions of the image during decoding and enables the model to attend to different parts of the image independently. Several attention mechanisms have been employed in this domain, including additive attention, multiplicative attention, dot-product attention, and location-based attention. While various attention mechanisms have achieved promising results, e.g., reducing the variance of the loss function, locality constraint, and improved robustness to occlusion, none of them consistently outperformed a fully convolutional baseline using plain convolutional neural networks (CNNs) alone. 

Besides relying on external resources like GloVe embeddings or lexicons, some recent methods also attempt to learn language priors from the training data itself. One popular method is the TreeLSTM, which encodes hierarchical structures of tokens in a tree structure and applies an LSTM cell to each node to obtain token representations conditioned on its parent nodes. Other approaches try to align image and text representations by adopting cross-modal matching functions, which compute the correlation between shared features learned from image and text spaces. However, these methods still fall short of achieving satisfactory results even after multiple iterations of hyperparameter tuning.

### Operation Steps
1. Preprocessing: Convert raw images to the necessary input formats, resize, normalize, crop, and centercrop the image according to specifications specified in the papers. Normalize the pixel intensities by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation calculated on the training set. 
2. Extract Features: Apply a pre-trained feature extractor trained on the ImageNet dataset to extract global and local features. Global features represent the presence of objects, while local features capture the appearance of objects at different spatial scales. Both features are fed into an LSTM or GRU network for capturing the temporal dependencies between consecutive frames of video. 
3. Encode Text: Use an LSTM or GRU network to encode the input text. Optionally, apply additional layers to incorporate the linguistic attributes of the text, such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 
4. Attention Mechanism: Compute the attention weights based on the extracted features and the text encoding obtained above. The attention mechanism selectsively attends to different parts of the image and text encoding to obtain a weighted sum of their elements. 
5. Decoding: Decode the weighted sum using an LSTM or GRU network that produces the final caption. During decoding, each time step selects the next most probable word based on the previously generated words and the attention weights. Repeat until the stop symbol is generated or a maximum length threshold is reached. 
6. Evaluation Metric: Evaluate the performance of the system using metrics such as BLEU score, METEOR score, ROUGE score, and character/word perplexity. These scores measure the closeness between the predicted and target captions, where BLEU score represents the overall coherence of the generated captions while ROUGE score measures the closeness between the generated and reference summaries. 

### Limitation and Improvement Directions
Despite significant progress in recent years, image captioning remains challenging due to the complexity of visual and linguistic concepts, ambiguity, and noise in real world scenarios. Current methods still face a variety of limitations, including limited scope, difficulty in handling long captions, failure to model multi-faceted relationships, slow inference speed, and limited interpretability of the models. Future directions include exploring advanced text processing techniques, leveraging stronger supervised models, and investigating the role of prior distributions in the latent space.
