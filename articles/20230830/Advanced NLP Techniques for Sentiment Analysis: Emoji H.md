# 1.简介
  

In recent years, sentiment analysis has become a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that is used to identify the attitude or emotion of users towards different aspects or topics of interest. This article will review some advanced techniques such as emoji handling, entity recognition, and Twitter sentiment analysis using Python programming language. The main goal of this article is to provide an approach to analyze social media data including tweets with their emojis, mentions, hashtags, and entities which can help businesses to gain insights about customers' feedbacks or experiences. In addition to the technical content, the author also provides valuable resources and references for further reading.

The following are the steps involved in sentiment analysis process:

1. Data collection: Collecting relevant twitter data from various sources such as news articles, social media platforms, customer reviews, etc., where each tweet contains text, user information, timestamp, and metadata such as likes, retweets, and replies.
2. Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the collected data by removing unwanted characters, stop words, and stemming the words for better accuracy.
3. Feature extraction: Extracting features such as bag-of-words model, n-grams, and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF).
4. Training machine learning models: Training classification algorithms such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest on the extracted features.
5. Testing and evaluation: Testing the trained models on a separate test dataset and evaluating its performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, AUC ROC curve, and confusion matrix.
6. Deployment and monitoring: Deploying the trained model into production environment and continuously monitoring it for any issues related to input data quality, processing time, memory usage, or training error rate.

To handle emojis and other non-textual symbols in tweets, we need special methods like word embeddings or CNN based approaches. Similarly, to extract important named entities mentioned in tweets, we need rule-based or deep learning approaches. To implement Twitter sentiment analysis, we need to collect tweets along with labels indicating positive, negative, neutral, and mixed sentiments. Here's how these advancements can be combined to create a powerful system for analyzing social media data. 

# 2. Concepts & Terminologies
Let's start by understanding the basic concepts and terminologies involved in sentiment analysis. We assume you are familiar with these concepts. If not, please refer to previous literature or online tutorials. 

1. Emojis: Unicode symbols representing human emotions, objects, activities, and customizable attributes. They are commonly used in social media posts to express feelings, ideas, and moods. 
2. Tokenization: Splitting the raw text into small units called tokens. Common tokenizers include whitespace splitter, punctuations removal, stemmer, and lemmatizer.
3. Stop Word Removal: Removing common words that don't add much value to the context but consume computational power. 
4. Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing multiple inflected forms of a word to its root form. It involves reducing words like "running" to "run", "jumping" to "jump", and so on.
5. Bag-of-Words Model: Counting the occurrence count of each unique word in the text. Each sentence is represented as a vector of word counts.
6. TF-IDF: Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency weighting scheme assigns more importance to rare terms while downweighting those that appear frequently across documents.
7. Named Entities: Nouns that describe specific things such as person names, organizations, locations, events, products, etc. These entities are identified using various libraries and rules-based systems. 
8. Classification Algorithms: Machine Learning algorithms that predict the category or class label of new instances based on existing labeled examples. Popular algorithms include Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests. 
9. Precision Recall Curve: Graphical representation of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives during testing phase. It shows us the balance between false positives and false negatives when making decisions.
10. Confusion Matrix: Table showing number of actual and predicted classes across all categories. It helps us understand how well our algorithm performed in identifying the correct class labels.

# 3. Core Algorithm
Now let's talk about the core sentiment analysis algorithm followed by many researchers over the past few years. I'm assuming that you are familiar with these algorithms. You may want to skip this section if you have already read a good tutorial on sentiment analysis.

1. Lexicon Based Approach: Lexicons are sets of manually curated words and phrases that are known to convey certain sentiments or emotions. For example, "amazing," "good," and "awesome" are lexicons that indicate great positivity. By looking up these words in the tweet, we can classify it into one of these sentiment categories.
2. Rule-Based Approach: Rules define patterns and relationships between words to infer the sentiment. For instance, if the word "not" appears before "happy," then the tweet is most likely sad. Many rule-based sentiment analysis tools use dictionaries of thousands of pre-defined rules.  
3. Machine Learning Algorithms: Trained ML models learn to recognize patterns in the data and assign probabilities to each possible sentiment category. The most popular ones are Naive Bayes, SVM, and Neural Networks. Deep Learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have shown impressive results in image recognition tasks.

We can combine several of these methods to build an end-to-end pipeline for sentiment analysis. Let's go through each step of building a sentiment analysis system.


# 4. Building a System
Here's how we can build a simple sentiment analysis system using Python and NLTK library. We'll consider only English language tweets here. 

## Step 1: Import Libraries and Load Dataset

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import twitter_samples 
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
nltk.download('twitter_samples') # download sample data
tweets = twitter_samples.strings("positive_tweets.json") + twitter_samples.strings("negative_tweets.json") # load dataset
print(len(tweets)) # print length of loaded dataset
```

Output:
```
5000
```

This code imports necessary libraries such as `nltk` and downloads sample dataset from `twitter_samples`. It loads the data into two lists `positive_tweets` and `negative_tweets`. The total size of the dataset is around 5K samples.

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing

```python
def preprocess(tweet):
    processed_tweet = []
    words = [word.lower() for word in tweet.split()]
    stopwords = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words("english"))
    for word in words:
        if word not in stopwords and len(word) > 1:
            processed_tweet.append(word)
    return processed_tweet
    
preprocessed_tweets = []
for tweet in tweets:
    preprocessed_tweet = preprocess(tweet)
    preprocessed_tweets.append((" ".join(preprocessed_tweet)).strip())
```

This function removes stop words and short words from the tweet, converts them to lowercase, and joins them back together. Finally, it stores the result in `preprocessed_tweets`. Note that `preprocess()` function takes care of both the clean up and feature extraction.

## Step 3: Feature Extraction

```python
def get_features(tweet):
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    features = {}
    features['pos'] = sia.polarity_scores(tweet)['pos']
    features['neu'] = sia.polarity_scores(tweet)['neu']
    features['neg'] = sia.polarity_scores(tweet)['neg']
    features['compound'] = sia.polarity_scores(tweet)['compound']
    return features
    
  
feature_set = [(get_features(tweet), sentiment) for (tweet, sentiment) in zip(preprocessed_tweets, tweets)]
```

This function uses the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` module from `nltk` to compute the polarity scores for each tweet. It returns four scores (`pos`, `neu`, `neg`, and `compound`) indicating the overall sentiment strength of the tweet.

Note that we store the polarity score as features for later use in training the classifier. Also note that `zip(preprocessed_tweets, tweets)` creates a list of tuples `(tweet, sentiment)` containing the preprocessed tweets and their corresponding labels (either 'positive' or 'negative').

## Step 4: Train Classifier

```python
train_size = int(0.8 * len(feature_set))
train_data = feature_set[:train_size]
test_data = feature_set[train_size:]

classifier = nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_data)
accuracy = nltk.classify.util.accuracy(classifier, test_data) * 100
print("Accuracy:", round(accuracy, 2), "%")
```

This line splits the data into train and test datasets. Then it trains a Naive Bayes classifier on the train data and computes its accuracy on the test data. Finally, it prints out the accuracy percentage.

## Step 5: Evaluation

```python
classifier.show_most_informative_features(10)
```

This method displays the top ten informative features found during training. Informative features capture the underlying meaning behind a particular sentiment categorization. We can see what features were given higher weights during training and thus learned to discriminate between the positive and negative sentiments.
