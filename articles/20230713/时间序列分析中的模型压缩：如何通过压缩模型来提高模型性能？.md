## 一、简介
在信息时代，随着数据量越来越大，传感器的采集速度也越来越快，实时的对数据进行分析已经不再可行，我们需要对数据进行预处理，得到有效的信息，这就是时间序列分析（Time Series Analysis）的一项重要工作。

传统的时间序列分析方法，如Arima模型、Facebook Prophet等，利用传统的统计学习技术如线性回归、正态分布、蒙特卡洛模拟等构建出模型，但当时间序列数据复杂程度较高或者特征多样性较强时，这些方法往往无法给出精确的预测结果，这就需要模型压缩 techniques （也叫做 pruning techniques）的方法来减少模型参数的数量，降低模型的复杂度并提升模型的预测准确率。

Model compression techniques have been used to improve the performance of time series analysis models for a wide range of applications such as stock price prediction and anomaly detection. In this article, we will present an overview of model compression techniques in time series analysis, including parameter-based methods like STL decomposition, thresholding based methods like VARMA regression, clustering-based methods like Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and signal denoising approaches like KNN or CNN. We will then provide specific examples on how these techniques can be applied to real-world problems to achieve improved forecasting accuracy and reduce the computation cost of the model. Finally, we will discuss future research directions and challenges related to time series modeling using model compression techniques. 

## 二、模型压缩技术概述
### 1. Parameter-based Methods:
Parameter-based methods represent one approach to compress time series models by reducing their number of parameters without sacrificing its ability to capture complex relationships between variables. The most popular method is Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Using LOESS (STL) which is a simple yet effective technique that decomposes each variable into three components - seasonal component, trend component, and remainder component. This method allows us to retain only the significant factors in our time series data while eliminating the noise. Another well known technique called Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average (VARMA) combines multiple moving averages with autoregressive (AR) terms to identify optimal combination of lagged values. These techniques are designed specifically for identifying systematic patterns and ignore random variations in the data.

### 2. Thresholding Based Methods:
Thresholding-based methods represent another class of compressive methods where we apply thresholds to select important features from our original dataset before building the model. One widely used method is Support Vector Regression (SVR) where we set a threshold on the coefficient magnitudes and discard those below the threshold. Similarly, Random Forest also uses feature selection techniques but instead of selecting a subset of all features at once, it selects a subset of features iteratively during training process. Other examples include Principle Component Pursuit (PCP) which finds the relevant principal components of the input data by considering their variance contributions.

### 3. Clustering-Based Methods:
Clustering-based methods use unsupervised learning algorithms to group similar time series samples together. The main algorithm used here is Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). Here, we find the first few principal components that explain a certain percentage of the variation in the input data. We keep track of the explained variance for each component and add them up until we reach the desired level of explained variance. Then, we fit a new linear regression model on the selected subspace formed by the selected principal components. One advantage of this approach is that it does not require any threshold value, which makes it more flexible than other methods. However, there may still be some loss of information due to the PCA dimensionality reduction.

### 4. Signal Denoising Approaches:
Signal denoising approaches filter out the noisy parts of the time series signal using various techniques like smoothing filters, wavelet transform, and kernel density estimation. These methods help remove the high frequency components of the signal that do not contribute much to predictability. For example, in the context of weather forecasting, traditional statistical models tend to overfit the noise in the time series signal and fail to give accurate predictions when facing a severe weather event. By filtering out the noise, we get better results and less biased estimates. There are several denoising techniques available, such as Savitzky-Golay filter, Wavelet Transform, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), or Bayesian Smoothing Filter. 

In summary, parameter-based methods like STL decomposition, thresholding based methods like VARMA regression, and clustering-based methods like Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) aim to eliminate unnecessary components of the time series signal by identifying the key features. On the other hand, signal denoising methods help removing the noisy signals by identifying the dominant frequencies in the signal and suppressing the rest of the frequencies. Overall, model compression techniques can significantly improve the performance of time series forecasting models and enable more efficient processing and inference of large volumes of historical time series data.
