Data Migration（数据迁移）是指从一个系统或环境把数据转移到另一个系统或环境的过程。它通常包括三个主要步骤:准备、转换、部署。数据迁移的目的是确保在两个不同的环境之间的数据一致性，尤其是在源环境的更改之后的数据需要被同步更新到目标环境中。如今越来越多的公司采用云计算服务，数据中心往往成为瓶颈。因此，数据迁移作为云计算的一个重要组成部分，越来越受重视。虽然目前已经有一些成熟的工具来进行数据迁移，但是仍然存在很多 challenges 需要解决。本文将通过对 Data Migration 的相关知识以及解决这些 challenges 的方法论，来阐述如何设计一个成功的数据库迁移方案。
# 2.基本概念术语说明

## 2.1 Data Warehouse

A Data Warehouse is an information system designed to store and analyze large amounts of structured or unstructured data from multiple sources such as transactional databases, master data repositories, web-based applications, social media feeds etc. The main purpose of a Data Warehouse is to provide a single source of truth for all the organization's business processes and transactions. It enables users to explore, report, and make informed business decisions based on this data. A Data Warehouse can be thought of as an enterprise version of a star schema where fact tables are organized into dimensions that help with aggregating and querying the data efficiently. The dimensional model helps analysts understand how the facts relate to each other by grouping similar entities together so that they can get a better understanding of their interactions within the company. 

## 2.2 ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)

ELT is a data migration technique that involves extracting data from one source system, loading it into a target warehouse, transforming it into a format suitable for analysis, and then updating the target system with the new data. This approach allows for easy management of changes across multiple systems since only the transformation step requires any programming expertise. In ELT, Extract represents the process of obtaining data from the source system using standard database queries or APIs. Loading refers to inserting the extracted data into a staging table or file in the target warehouse. Transformation refers to manipulating the loaded data into a form suitable for analysis, often through SQL transformations or ETL jobs. Finally, the updated data can then be inserted back into the target system or used directly by end-users without requiring another data import.

## 2.3 Database Schema & Tables

Database schema refers to the structure of the database including its tables, columns, and relationships between them. Each table typically has some set of attributes like name, address, phone number, email etc., along with constraints like primary key, foreign keys, unique constraint etc. Tables are essential components of a relational database and play important roles in storing, organizing, and retrieving data. Different types of tables exist depending upon the use case; e.g., dimension tables store metadata about the business, factual tables contain transactional records, audit tables capture who made which changes, and so on.

## 2.4 Column Mapping

Column mapping refers to the relationship between two schemas' corresponding tables and columns. For example, if you have a column called “customer_id” in your source database but want it to have the same name and semantics in your destination database, you would need to define the column mapping between these fields. Similarly, if you have different names or definitions for common columns across both schemas, you would also need to map those differences to maintain consistency throughout the entire migration process.

## 2.5 Streaming Replication

Streaming replication is a type of replication mechanism used in data migration scenarios where updates are being made continuously to the source system while it remains online. In streaming replication, the changes flow incrementally from the source server to the target server, allowing for near real-time synchronization of data. However, because there may be latency involved in transferring incremental updates over the network, longer running batches of data may not always be synchronized exactly at the same time. Additionally, streaming replication does not support complete backups of the source system due to the constant stream of changes.

In summary, several basic concepts and terms related to data migration are discussed here, along with specific methods and techniques needed to successfully implement a successful data migration strategy.
