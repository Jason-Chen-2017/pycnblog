Appendix: Common Questions and Answers
------------------------------------

### Q: What is the difference between computer vision and image processing?

A: Computer vision involves analyzing and interpreting visual information to understand scenes, objects, and relationships, whereas image processing focuses on manipulating and enhancing images without necessarily understanding their content.

### Q: How does computer vision differ from machine learning?

A: While both fields involve processing data and making predictions or decisions based on that data, computer vision specifically deals with visual data, such as images and videos, while machine learning can handle various types of data, such as text, audio, and sensor readings.

### Q: Can computers truly "see" like humans do?

A: Although computer vision algorithms have made significant progress in recent years, they still do not fully replicate human visual perception. Computers typically rely on specific features and patterns in images, while human vision is more holistic and context-dependent. However, computer vision technology continues to improve and may one day rival human visual capabilities.
