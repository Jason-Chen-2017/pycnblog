## 背景介绍

### 人工智能的历史

-  symbolic AI (1950s - 1980s)
-  connectionism and deep learning (1980s - present)
-  the rise of AGI (present - future)

### 什么是AGI？

-  artificial general intelligence
-  the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks
-  contrast with narrow or weak AI, which is designed for specific tasks

### 为什么AGI重要？

-  potential to revolutionize many industries
-  ability to solve complex problems that are currently beyond human capabilities
-  risk of misuse or unintended consequences

## 核心概念与联系

### AGI vs. ANI

-  ANI: artificial narrow intelligence
-  AGI: artificial general intelligence
-  difference in scope and capability

### AGI的 levels of cognition

-  Tabula Rasa systems
-  One-shot learners
-  Few-shot learners
-  General learners

### AGI的 architectures

-  symbolic AI architecture
-  connectionist AI architecture
-  hybrid AI architecture

## 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

### AGI算法原理

-  reinforcement learning
-  unsupervised learning
-  transfer learning
-  meta-learning

#### Reinforcement Learning

-  agent interacts with environment
-  agent receives reward or penalty based on actions
-  agent learns optimal policy over time

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim p_\pi} [\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) Q^\pi(s,a)]
$$

#### Unsupervised Learning

-  agent learns patterns and structure from unlabeled data
-  examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction, density estimation

#### Transfer Learning

-  agent leverages knowledge from one task to another
-  fine-tuning pretrained models
-  domain adaptation

#### Meta-Learning

-  agent learns to learn quickly from few examples
-  optimization-based methods
-  model-based methods

### AGI算法实现步骤

-  define problem and objective
-  select appropriate algorithm
-  preprocess data
-  train model
-  evaluate performance
-  iterate and improve
