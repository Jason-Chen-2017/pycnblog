## 4. Best Practices: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

### 4.1. Predictive Analytics using Machine Learning

The following example demonstrates how to build a predictive model for employee turnover using Python and scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('employee_turnover.csv')

# Preprocess data
X = data[['tenure', 'salary', 'job_satisfaction']]
y = data['turnover']

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Evaluate model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
confusion = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'Confusion matrix:\n{confusion}')
```

This code loads an employee turnover dataset, preprocesses the data by selecting relevant features and scaling them, trains a logistic regression model on the training set, and evaluates the model on the test set. The output includes the accuracy score and confusion matrix, which provide insights into the model's performance.

### 4.2. Chatbots for Recruitment and Onboarding

Chatbots are a powerful tool for automating routine HR tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions, scheduling interviews, or guiding new hires through the onboarding process. The following example demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot using Rasa, an open source conversational AI platform.

1. Install Rasa by running `pip install rasa` in your command line.
2. Create a new Rasa project by running `rasa init`.
3. Define intents and entities in `data/nlu.yml`, such as:

```yaml
nlu:
- intent: apply_for_job
  examples: |
   - I want to apply for a job at your company
   - Can I submit my resume for the software engineer position?
   - How do I apply for the marketing manager role?

- intent: schedule_interview
  examples: |
   - Can we schedule an interview for tomorrow at 10 am?
   - I would like to arrange an interview for next week
   - Set up a phone call with the hiring manager
```

4. Define conversation flows in `data/stories.yml`, such as:

```yaml
stories:
- story: Apply for a job
  steps:
  - intent: apply_for_job
  - action: utter_apply_instructions
  - input: collect_resume
  - action: save_resume
  - utter_application_submitted

- story: Schedule an interview
  steps:
  - intent: schedule_interview
  - action: ask_availability
  - input: availability
  - action: schedule_interview
  - utter_interview_scheduled
```

5. Define conversational components in `domain.yml`, such as:

```yaml
intents:
- apply_for_job
- schedule_interview

actions:
- utter_apply_instructions
- collect_resume
- save_resume
- ask_availability
- schedule_interview
- utter_application_submitted
- utter_interview_scheduled

responses:
  utter_apply_instructions:
  - text: "Please send your resume to [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com) and include the job title you are applying for."
 
  utter_application_submitted:
  - text: "Thank you for applying! We will review your application and contact you if there is a match."
 
  utter_interview_scheduled:
  - text: "Great, your interview has been scheduled for {date} at {time}. We look forward to meeting you!"
```

6. Train and run the chatbot using `rasa train` and `rasa shell`.

This example demonstrates how to create a simple chatbot that can handle two intents: applying for a job and scheduling an interview. By extending the NLU data, stories, and domain files, you can add more functionality to the chatbot and tailor it to your specific HRM needs.

### 4.3. Sentiment Analysis in Employee Engagement

Sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for gauging employee engagement, satisfaction, and morale. The following example demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using Python and TextBlob, a popular NLP library.

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

# Load feedback from employees
feedback = """
I love working here. The team is amazing, and I feel valued and supported.
The only thing I wish was better is the communication from management.
"""

# Analyze sentiment
blob = TextBlob(feedback)
sentiment = blob.sentiment
polarity = sentiment.polarity
subjectivity = sentiment.subjectivity

print(f'Polarity: {polarity}')
print(f'Subjectivity: {subjectivity}')
```

This code calculates the polarity and subjectivity of employee feedback, providing insights into the overall sentiment of the text. Polarity ranges from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive), while subjectivity ranges from 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective). A high subjectivity score indicates that the text contains personal opinions or emotions, while a low score suggests factual information.
