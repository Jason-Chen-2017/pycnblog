         The rise in the popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted in a significant development in various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition. AI-powered technologies have revolutionized our lives by enabling us to perform complex tasks like chatbots or assistants that can communicate with humans easily. Despite this progress, there is a significant gap between developing NLP solutions for new languages and existing languages. This gap is due to the fact that the training data used for building NLP models are limited for many languages especially those spoken less frequently than English. Therefore, transfer learning techniques can help solve this problem by leveraging large pre-trained datasets trained on another similar language. 
         
         Transfer learning techniques aim at transferring knowledge learned from one task to other related tasks using neural networks. There are several transfer learning methods available including domain adaptation, feature extraction, multi-task learning, etc. In recent years, researchers have proposed different lexicon induction methods for transfer learning based on sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or text classification. However, it is not clear how each method works and whether they could be applied successfully to the Indonesian language. 
        
         
         In this study, we will compare six popular lexicon induction methods for transfer learning in Indonesian NLP – Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, Dependency Parsing, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Word Sense Disambiguation, and Text Classification. We will also conduct experiments on two publically available datasets for these tasks. We will analyze their performance, discuss advantages and disadvantages of each method, and propose future research directions.

         ## 3.1 Sentiment Analysis  
         ### 3.1.1 Data preprocessing   
         Before applying any algorithm, we need to preprocess the data by cleaning, tokenizing, stemming, removing stopwords, converting all the text into lowercase letters, and encoding categorical variables.
         
         ```python
            import nltk
            import pandas as pd

            def clean_text(text):
                """cleans text"""
                tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text.lower())
                filtered_tokens = [w for w in tokens if not w in stopwords]
                return''.join([stemmer.stem(token) for token in filtered_tokens])
            
            def encode_labels(label):
                """encodes labels"""
                encoded_dict = {'positive': 1, 'neutral': 0, 'negative': -1}
                return encoded_dict[label]
            
            
            df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
            stopwords = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('indonesian'))
            stemmer = nltk.SnowballStemmer('indonesian')
            cleaned_texts = []
            labels = []
            
            for i in range(len(df)):
                text = str(df['Text'][i])
                label = str(df['Sentiment'][i]).lower()
                cleaned_text = clean_text(text)
                cleaned_texts.append(cleaned_text)
                labels.append(encode_labels(label))
         ```
         ### 3.1.2 Lexicon Induction Methodology  For sentiment analysis, we use two lexicon induction methods namely SentiWordNet and VADER. These methods work differently since they tackle two different aspects of sentiment analysis. SentiWordNet only considers lexicons derived from opinion mining while VADER includes rule-based approaches as well.
          
          SentiWordNet involves collecting a large corpus of human annotated polarity lexicons and implementing a hierarchical structure consisting of four layers representing positive, negative, and objective polarities along with three sub-layers representing strong positives, weak positives, neutrality, and negatives respectively. Each layer contains adjectives, nouns, verbs, and adverbs along with their associated scores indicating their degree of positivity or negativity. The purpose of SentiWordNet is to capture the underlying polarity information about a word through sentiment lexicons rather than relying solely on surface-level semantics. Once the lexicons are constructed, they are used to assign sentiment scores to each word in a sentence. For example, "good" would get assigned a high score for positive and a low score for negative while "happy" might receive slightly higher scores for negative sentiment compared to the same words in a negative movie review. 
          
          On the other hand, VADER is a rule-based approach that uses a combination of lexicons and heuristics to extract subjective features of text such as intensity, positivity, negativity, certainty, and emotionality. It takes into account valence scores, capitalization, punctuation, verb tense, and emoticons to determine the overall sentiment polarity. VADER assigns a composite score ranging from -5 to +5, with values close to 0 indicating neutral sentiment. It provides sentiment scores for over 97% of tweets and comes up with detailed sentiment ratings categorized into five classes – Positive, Negative, Neutral, Compound and Objective. 
          
          
        ### 3.1.3 Applying Algorithmic Techniques    
        
        
        Now let's apply these lexicon induction methods on a publicly available dataset called IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. Here, we will evaluate the performance of the two methods using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
        
        First, let's load the dataset and split it into train and test sets. Then, we will implement both the lexicon induction methods mentioned earlier and compute their respective accuracies on the test set. Finally, we will plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and calculate Area Under Curve (AUC). Let’s write code below:<|im_sep|>
