         Multilingual processing (MLP) has become a crucial component in various applications such as digital assistants and chatbots to support users with diverse languages. However, the development of MLP models is still challenging due to the high dimensionality, diversity, and complexity of language data. To overcome this challenge, we need efficient search methods that can automatically identify the optimal network architecture by searching from a large space of possible architectures. In this paper, we propose a neural architecture search method called NAS-MLP for MLP model optimization. We first design an evaluation metric based on the human judgment accuracy, which encourages the search algorithm to explore more promising regions where better performance can be achieved. Then, we use reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the search process through training the agent based on the reward function that considers both objective metrics such as latency and memory usage, as well as subjective metrics such as user satisfaction, naturalness, and engagement. 
         
         Our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both quality and efficiency. Compared to previous works using handcrafted feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning, our approach achieves comparable accuracy but reduces the search time significantly. Moreover, it enables us to automate the process of generating high-quality multilingual processing systems, which could further enhance MLP services for developers. 
         This article will briefly introduce the main components of NAS-MLP and demonstrate how it optimizes the search of multilingual processing networks. Furthermore, we will explain its application scenarios and future research directions.

         ## 2.1 MLP模型
         
         Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is one of the most widely used feedforward neural networks for supervised learning tasks. It consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node in a hidden layer receives inputs from all nodes in the previous layer and computes an activation value according to a non-linear transformation of those inputs. The final output of the network is then computed by applying another non-linear transformation to the activation values in the output layer. The goal of MLP is to learn a complex mapping between the input features and target labels by adjusting the weights of each neuron in the network iteratively through backpropagation.
         
         ## 2.2 多语言处理任务
         
         Multilingual processing (MLP) refers to the ability of machines to understand and produce text in different languages. Traditional MLP models have been limited by their inability to handle large amounts of language data due to their fixed size input and fixed number of neurons in the hidden layers. Therefore, there has emerged new MLP models that are capable of handling high dimensional language data without sacrificing the representational capacity of traditional MLPs. These include models like transformer models, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer V2), etc., which operate at different levels of abstraction. 
         
         Currently, two types of multilingual processing tasks are commonly employed:
          - Automatic speech recognition (ASR): Convert recorded speech into written text in a specific language.
          - Natural language understanding (NLU): Extract structured information from human language sentences. Examples of NLU tasks include named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging (POS), sentiment analysis, intent classification, etc.
         
         Both ASR and NLU require the MLP model to recognize and extract meaningful patterns from the language data. With increased availability of multilingual datasets, developing effective MLP models becomes increasingly critical. As long as a language is not fully supported by a pre-existing MLP model, additional resources are required to train a new model that handles the new language. Unfortunately, manually building these resources is expensive and error-prone. Thus, automatic solution for identifying the best performing model architecture for multilingual processing is essential.

         ## 3.1 概述
         
         In this section, we will briefly describe the basic idea behind our proposed NAS-MLP algorithm. The key insight of NAS-MLP is that it explores the entire parameter space of the MLP model, including the number and dimensions of the hidden layers, nonlinearities, and regularization techniques. We start from a small set of candidate operators, generate several alternative model architectures, and select the one that performs best according to a predefined criterion. By exploring the full parameter space, NAS-MLP generates models that generalize well across many different languages while also being competitive with the best existing models.
         
         ### 3.1.1 模型搜索空间
         
         For example, let's consider a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation functions and L2 weight regularization and assume that we want to find a good tradeoff between the latency and memory consumption. Here are some possible combinations of parameters:
         
         | Number of Hidden Layers | Neurons Per Layer | Activation Function   | Regularization Technique |
         |:-----------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------------:|:-------------------------:|
         | 1                       | [16]             | relu                   | l2                        |
         | 1                       | [64]             | sigmoid                | l2                        |
         | 2                       | [16, 64]         | tanh                   | dropout                    |
         |...                     |...              |...                    |...                      |
         
         There are potentially millions of combinations of parameters, making manual exploration prohibitively expensive. Additionally, even if we did manage to find a good combination of parameters for English, translating them into other languages would likely involve a lot of trial and error effort.
         
         ### 3.1.2 奖励函数设计
         
         A fundamental limitation of conventional MLP-based multilingual processing systems is that they rely heavily on expertise to tune the hyperparameters and architectural decisions. While modern neural architecture search algorithms such as Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) have shown impressive results in solving computer vision problems, these techniques typically require significant computational resources and do not generalize well to multilingual settings. Consequently, the success of such algorithms hinges on carefully designed fitness functions that take into account factors such as accuracy, speed, scalability, and robustness.
         
         To automate the search process, we develop a new evaluation metric called "human judgment accuracy" that evaluates the predictive power of a particular MLP architecture under a certain task. Unlike traditional fitness functions such as cross entropy loss or mean squared error, human judgment accuracy measures the ability of the model to accurately predict the correct output given the input sentence in multiple languages. Under this metric, we expect the best performing architectures to exhibit high accuracy in all relevant languages.
         
         We also define a new measure called "subjectivity score", which takes into account factors such as user experience, naturalness, and engagement. The higher the score, the better the model performs in terms of appealing to humans and usefulness in real-world applications. Together, these measures encourage the search algorithm to focus on areas where improvement is highly desired.
         
         Finally, we combine the above two measures into a single scalar value called "reward". The lower the reward, the better the model performs overall. In the end, the search algorithm needs to balance between exploring the parameter space efficiently and obtaining accurate predictions in all relevant languages.
