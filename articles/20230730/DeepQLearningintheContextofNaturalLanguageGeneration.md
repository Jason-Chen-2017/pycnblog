# 1.简介
         
 Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is one of the most promising reinforcement learning techniques for natural language generation tasks such as text completion or response generation. In this paper, we will present a novel DRL model called Neural Abstract Machines (NAMs), which can learn to generate sequences based on structured input data and can achieve human level performance in terms of naturalness and coherence with high quality prompts. We have built an open source framework named NAMU using PyTorch library that allows users to train their own models and test them on different datasets. Finally, we demonstrate how NAMs can improve the quality of generated texts compared to traditional statistical approaches and show its effectiveness across various metrics including sentence perplexity, BLEU score, self-bleu score, and meteor score.
          This work opens new possibilities in natural language generation by incorporating structured information from input data into the agent's decision making process while also taking advantage of the deep neural network architecture of agents to extract relevant features from raw inputs. Moreover, it provides insights into how an artificial intelligence system may approach realistic problems like generating complex sentences and responding to user queries. It promises significant progress towards achieving long-term goals of machine conversational interfaces in the future.

          The topic of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained much attention recently due to advances in deep learning technologies and applications in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, and translation. There are several existing works related to natural language processing but they mainly focus on classification, tagging, parsing, sentiment analysis, etc., whereas these methods lack capability to generate text accurately and fluently. Therefore, recent advances in deep reinforcement learning techniques have shown great potential in addressing this problem.

          One example of this class of models is OpenAI’s GPT-2 language model which was trained on web pages and then fine-tuned on large corpora of text to produce high-quality text completions. Another famous example is Google’s T5 transformer-based model which uses sequence-to-sequence learning to generate natural language answers. However, both of these models require extensive pre-processing steps before training since they rely on complex optimization algorithms to adjust parameters to maximize likelihood of observed sequences.

          An alternative method to address this challenge is to use deep reinforcement learning algorithms specifically designed for natural language generation tasks. These include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). However, these models suffer from limited modeling capacity due to their sequential nature and difficulties in capturing contextual dependencies between words. Additionally, they often struggle to handle longer sequences because of memory limitations imposed by recurrent networks.

         # 3.基本概念及术语说明
          Before proceeding with our proposed model, let us first introduce some basic concepts and terminologies used in deep reinforcement learning.

         ## Markov Decision Process (MDP)
          A Markov decision process (MDP) is defined as a tuple $(S, A, R, P)$ where:
           - $S$ is a state space, represented as a set of possible states;
           - $A$ is an action space, represented as a set of possible actions;
           - $R(s,a,s')$ is a reward function that maps each triple $(s,a,s')$ to a scalar reward;
           - $P(s',r| s,a)$ is a transition probability matrix that gives the probability of moving to state $s'$ after performing action $a$, along with receiving reward $r$.

           Given a current state $s_t$ and action $a_t$, the environment transitions to a new state $s_{t+1}$ and receives a reward $r_{t+1}$. The goal of an agent is to find an optimal policy $\pi^*(s)$ that maximizes expected discounted rewards starting at any given state $s$. Formally, the Bellman equation for the value function is:

            V^{*}(s) = \underset{a}{\max}\left[ r + \gamma\sum_{s'}{p(s',r|s,a)(V^{*}(s'))} \right]
            
           where $\gamma$ is a discount factor between 0 and 1.
           
         ## Q-value function
          The Q-function $Q^{\pi}(s,a)$ estimates the maximum expected return starting from state $s$ and following policy $\pi$. It is calculated as follows:
          
          Q^{\pi}(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{s'\sim \mathcal{P}}[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\gamma^k r_{t+k+1}|s_t=s, a_t=a, s'_t=s']
         
          Here, the summation goes up to infinity because there might be infinitely many future rewards to accumulate. We apply a discount factor $\gamma$ to discount the future rewards and assume that the future returns follow a geometric distribution.

          When the next state $s'$ is unknown, we use a bootstrapping approximation to approximate the expectation over the future rewards, i.e.,

          Q^{\pi}(s,a) \approx \sum_{s'} p(s'|\hat{s},\hat{a}) [r(\hat{s},\hat{a},s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')]
          
          where $\hat{s}$, $\hat{a}$ represent the current state and action under evaluation and $\pi$ represents the target policy.
          
         ## Value Iteration Algorithm
          The value iteration algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal value functions iteratively until convergence. At each iteration, it updates all state values according to the Bellman equation using the latest estimate of the Q-values obtained so far. If the Q-values converge within a certain threshold, the algorithm stops. Otherwise, it repeats the iterations until convergence.
           
         ## Policy Gradient Algorithms
          Policy gradient algorithms optimize policies directly by updating the parameters of a parameterized policy function instead of computing the optimal value functions as done in value iteration algorithms. They are commonly used in reinforcement learning for tasks involving continuous control, such as robotics, game playing, and finance. Two popular examples of policy gradient algorithms are REINFORCE and PPO.

           
         # 4.深度强化学习模型NAMs
          Our proposed model called Neural Abstract Machines (NAMs) combines ideas from deep reinforcement learning and structured prediction. NAMs combine deep neural networks with efficient sampling mechanisms to efficiently explore the search space and learn structured representations of input data. Specifically, NAMs map a structured representation of the input data to a latent vector, which is then passed through a decoder to generate a sequence of tokens. 

          To solve the task of sequence generation, NAMs take advantage of two key components: structured input data and conditional decoding. Structured input data refers to the fact that during training, the agent learns to generate output sequences conditioned on structured input data, such as categories, entities, and relationships. For instance, if the input data consists of question-answer pairs, the agent would learn to generate appropriate responses by considering the category and relationship of the questions.

          Conversely, conditional decoding involves using the learned representations to guide the decoding process. During inference time, when only a partial sequence is available, NAMs can selectively decode tokens based on the structure of the incomplete sequence and the predicted probabilities of upcoming tokens. This enables the agent to complete the sequence step by step without losing track of the overall context.

          Overall, NAMs provide a unified framework that integrates structured input data and conditional decoding to perform effective sequence generation. Their computational efficiency makes them scalable to large amounts of training data, enabling them to handle unstructured and noisy input data more robustly than other models.

         # 5.算法原理与具体操作步骤
          Let us now dive deeper into the technical details of our proposed model, NAMs.
         
         ### NAM Model Architecture
         
        <img src="./images/nam_model.png" width="70%">
        
        The figure above shows the architecture of the NAM model. Similar to standard encoder-decoder architectures, NAMs consist of an encoder module that encodes the input sequence into a fixed length feature vector. The encoded feature vector is then decoded using a separate decoder module to obtain the final output sequence.

        Unlike typical encoder-decoder architectures, however, NAMs differ from them in the following ways:

        1. Both the encoder and decoder modules are implemented using convolutional layers followed by feedforward networks.
        2. NAMs encode the input sequence into a latent vector using a bidirectional LSTM layer. This reduces the risk of vanishing gradients and helps the model capture global dependencies in the input sequence.
        3. The latent vector is fed back to the decoder to enable conditional decoding. During inference time, the decoder generates tokens one by one based on the previous tokens and the predicted token probabilities.
        4. The loss function used in NAMs is the weighted cross-entropy loss between the true and predicted sequences. The weights are computed based on the importance of each token based on its recency in the input sequence.

        In summary, the NAM model architecture includes four main parts:

1. Feature extraction module: Applies multiple convolutional layers to extract local features from the input sequence.
2. Latent variable module: Generates a latent vector by encoding the extracted features into a lower dimensional space using a bidirectional LSTM layer.
3. Prediction module: Decodes the latent vector to predict the next token in the output sequence. Uses conditional decoding to selectively choose the best next token based on the prior tokens and the predictions made so far.
4. Loss computation module: Computes the weighted cross-entropy loss between the true and predicted output sequences.


         ### Training Procedure

        In order to train the NAM model, we need to define three losses:

1. Reconstruction loss: Measures the difference between the original input sequence and the reconstructed output sequence produced by the decoder. This ensures that the model produces accurate results even when it encounters unexpected input patterns. 
2. KL divergence term: Helps the model avoid mode collapse by penalizing the latent vectors that do not match the prior distribution.
3. Regularization term: Adds additional regularization to ensure that the model does not get stuck in suboptimal solutions.

        The general training procedure for NAMs is as follows:

1. Initialize the parameters of the model randomly.
2. Repeat for specified number of epochs:
   a. Sample a batch of sequences from the dataset. 
   b. Compute the feature vectors for each token in the input sequence.
   c. Encode the input sequence using a bidirectional LSTM layer and compute the corresponding latent vector.
   d. Pass the latent vector to the decoder and sample the output sequence token-by-token.
   e. Compute the log-likelihood of the sampled output sequence using the softmax function.
   f. Compute the reconstruction and KL divergence terms for the sampled sequences.
   g. Update the parameters of the model using stochastic gradient descent with the negative gradient of the loss function.

   
         ### Evaluation Metrics

        After training, we evaluate the model on several evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the generated sequences. Some common evaluation metrics include:

        1. Sentence perplexity: measures the degree of surprise or uncertainty in the generated sequences. The higher the perplexity, the less probable the generated sequence is to occur.
        2. BLEU score: measures the similarity between the generated sequence and a reference sequence. The closer the scores are to 1, the better the generated sequences are considered correct.
        3. Self-BLEU score: measures the ability of the model to generate fluent, coherent sequences without relying on external references.
        4. Meteor score: calculates the average overlap between the generated sequence and multiple references provided by humans.

        All of these evaluation metrics help understand the quality of the generated sequences and identify areas where further improvements could be made.

         ### Summary

        In this paper, we presented a novel deep reinforcement learning model called Neural Abstract Machines (NAMs) for natural language generation. NAMs leverages structured input data to learn rich representations of the input sequences and conditions the decoding process based on these representations to effectively generate sequences of interest. By leveraging deep neural networks, NAMs can easily scale to handle larger training sets and perform well even in low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, our evaluation metrics indicate that NAMs offer significant benefits in comparison to other models in natural language generation tasks.
