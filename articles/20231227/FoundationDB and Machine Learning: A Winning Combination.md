## 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
### 3.1 FoundationDB Algorithms
FoundationDB uses a unique, hierarchical key-value model to store and manage data. The core algorithms used by FoundationDB include:

- **Hashing**: Hashing is used to map keys to key-value pairs in the database.
- **Consistency**: FoundationDB uses a versioning system to ensure strong consistency guarantees.

Hashing is used to map keys to key-value pairs in the database. The hashing algorithm used by FoundationDB is based on the MurmurHash algorithm, which is a fast and efficient hashing algorithm.

#### 3.1.2 Consistency
FoundationDB uses a versioning system to ensure strong consistency guarantees. When a key-value pair is updated, a new version of the key-value pair is created, and the previous version is retained. This allows for strong consistency guarantees, even in a distributed environment.

#### 3.2.2 Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm that is used to model the probability of a binary outcome. The core equation for logistic regression is:

$$
P(y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta_0 - \beta_1x_1 - \beta_2x_2 - \ldots - \beta_nx_n}}
$$

Where:
- $P(y=1)$ is the probability of the binary outcome being 1
- $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n$ are the coefficients for the independent variables
- $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the independent variables
- $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the housing data from FoundationDB
housing_data = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv')

# Train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(housing_data[['sqft_living', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms']], housing_data['price'])

# Make predictions using the linear regression model
predictions = model.predict(housing_data[['sqft_living', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms']])
```

### 4.3 Running the Linear Regression Model on FoundationDB Data
Finally, we will run the linear regression model on new housing data stored in FoundationDB and make predictions.

```python
# Load the new housing data from FoundationDB
new_housing_data = pd.read_csv('new_housing_data.csv')

# Make predictions using the linear regression model
new_predictions = model.predict(new_housing_data[['sqft_living', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms']])
```
