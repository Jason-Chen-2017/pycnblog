1.1概述
         Probabilistic Reasoning (PR) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses statistical reasoning to solve problems in uncertain environments or situations. PR includes various methods such as Bayesian networks, Markov decision processes, neural networks, MCMC techniques, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, among others. It has been applied in areas like finance, operations research, manufacturing, healthcare, and industrial automation to improve the reliability and efficiency of these systems by predicting and controlling risks. 

         The main aim of this article is to provide an overview on how probabilistic reasoning can be used for building practical AI strategies, which could help businesses and organizations make better decisions based on their risk profile. In order to do so, we will first review deep learning and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithms, followed by detailed explanation of their inner working mechanisms and application scenarios.

         ## 2.1 传统强化学习的局限性
        Prior work addressing the problem of building a strategic AI agent using modern machine learning models have relied heavily on supervised learning approaches, where labeled data sets are available to train the model parameters. This approach suffers from several limitations when it comes to solving complex problems under uncertainty:

         * Limited ability to handle high-dimensional spaces; 
         * Lack of generalization capabilities due to lack of sufficient training examples; 
         * Often requires a large amount of human intervention during training to obtain meaningful policies. 


         To address these issues, various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms were proposed to learn optimal behaviors through trial-and-error interactions between the agent and its environment. However, RL agents often struggle to explore the full state space effectively, resulting in suboptimal policies even though they may perform well on certain tasks. Additionally, reward functions required for traditional RL algorithms are typically not suitable for dealing with real-world applications, making them more difficult to optimize.

        ## 2.2 深度学习和蒙特卡洛树搜索方法的进步与兴起
       As mentioned earlier, the development of advanced probabilistic reasoning methods in recent years has mostly focused on deep learning and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques, two popular paradigms in deep learning for structured prediction tasks. Both methods have shown impressive performance in various domains, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision. Here's a brief summary of how each method works:

       ### 2.2.1 深度学习（Deep Learning）
      Deep learning is a class of machine learning models that use multiple layers of non-linear transformations to extract features from raw input data. It has led to significant breakthroughs in many fields such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing, making it increasingly important for practical applications in industry.

      Specifically, deep learning architectures consist of multiple fully connected layers, each followed by activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh. These layers learn abstract representations of the input data, which is then fed into other layers for final output predictions. In addition, regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay are also commonly used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.

      By using a combination of different types of neural network architecture design choices, hyperparameters tuning, and regularization techniques, deep learning models can achieve excellent accuracy levels without requiring extensive preprocessing steps or handcrafted feature engineering techniques.

      ### 2.2.2 蒙特卡洛树搜索（Monte Carlo Tree Search）
      MCTS is a powerful technique for optimizing complex decision-making problems such as games and decision trees. It leverages the principle of exploration/exploitation tradeoff by repeatedly simulating possible outcomes of the game until convergence to an optimal policy.

      In particular, MCTS starts from a root node representing the initial state of the game, and recursively generates child nodes from randomly sampled moves until the end of the game is reached. At each step, a selection strategy selects one of the unvisited child nodes based on the estimated value of the corresponding actions. Then, a simulation function samples random rollout paths starting from the selected node, and evaluates the rewards achieved along these paths according to a given reward function. Based on these simulations results, the backpropagation algorithm updates the values of all visited nodes accordingly. Finally, the selection process is repeated for all unvisited child nodes until either a stopping criterion is met or enough time has passed.

      Despite being known for its effectiveness in solving various decision-making problems, MCTS has some limitations compared to more established reinforcement learning methods. For instance, the computational cost of performing a single iteration of MCTS grows exponentially with the size of the search tree, making it challenging to run efficiently at scale. Also, MCTS does not take advantage of temporal dependencies between states, which can result in suboptimal policies unless carefully designed heuristics are employed.

     ## 2.3 本文目标与贡献
    Our objective is to provide an overview of deep learning and MCTS algorithms and explain their inner working mechanisms and potential application scenarios. We will begin by reviewing the key concepts behind both methods and introducing their terminologies. Then, we will describe the basic principles of MCTS, including the Monte Carlo Tree search, UCB formula, and bootstrap aggregation. Next, we will discuss the operation mechanism of MCTS, including the sequential move ordering and backup procedure, and present some typical usage scenarios and challenges.

    Beyond a theoretical understanding of the core algorithms, our goal is to demonstrate their usefulness for building practical AI strategies. Therefore, we will further illustrate their application scenarios in terms of risk assessment and decision support systems, as well as showcase their advantages and limitations when faced with real-world problems. Finally, we hope that this paper provides helpful insights for practitioners who want to build strategic AI agents that can adapt quickly to changing risk profiles.
