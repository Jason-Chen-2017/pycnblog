         Recommender Systems (RS) have become increasingly popular over the past decade due to their ability to provide personalized recommendations based on users’ behavior or preferences. Despite their importance in various applications such as online shopping, movie recommendation systems, news recommending system etc., RS evaluation is still a challenging task for researchers and practitioners. The main reason behind this challenge lies in the lack of clear evaluation metrics that can be used effectively to measure the performance of different RS algorithms. In this article, we will discuss about selecting appropriate evaluation metrics, designing suitable evaluation measures, measuring them accurately using real-world data, and finally tuning these parameters so that they produce accurate results. We hope this article will provide useful information to the community by highlighting the importance of evaluating RS and proposing new evaluation metrics.
         
         This article is organized into six sections: Introduction, Background, Concepts & Terminology, Algorithm Details, Implementation, Future Work, and Appendix. Our goal is to create an easy-to-follow guideline for choosing, designing, measuring, and tuning RS evaluation metrics. We also want readers to feel confident while reading our article by providing examples, explanations, illustrations, references, and additional resources.
         
         **Note:** The following contents are written from the perspective of a software developer with some experience in building Recommendation Engines. However, all the concepts discussed here should apply equally well to any other domain where RS is being implemented.
         
         # 2.Background
         Before discussing how to evaluate Recommender Systems, let's first understand what exactly recommender systems are.
         
         ## What are Recommendation Systems?

         According to Wikipedia, "A recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict preferences or ratings of items in order to recommend items to users." It suggests that RS receive feedback from the user regarding their interests, actions, preferences, and behaviors through transactional data, and then uses this data to suggest products or services that may be relevant to the user. RS usually generate recommendations based on users' explicit or implicit feedback such as clicks, purchases, views, or likes, which are provided by users directly or indirectly. 

         With the growing popularity of RS, companies are investing considerable amount of effort in developing and maintaining them. One of the primary challenges faced by developers working on RS is deciding upon the best way to evaluate its performance. Evaluating RS requires careful attention to detail and ensuring accuracy when comparing multiple RS models. Evaluating RS properly is crucial because it helps companies make better decisions on how to allocate resources, develop new features, identify problems, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

         
         # 3.Concepts & Terminology 
         Let's now explore some commonly used terms and concepts related to RS evaluation. These will help us define, select, and interpret evaluation metrics more appropriately.
         
         ## Types of Evaluation Metrics

         There are several types of evaluation metrics available for RS evaluations. Some of the common ones include:

         - Accuracy – This metric simply measures whether the predicted rating matches the actual rating given by the test set. However, accuracy alone does not give insight into how effective each algorithm was at generating the predictions. To address this issue, precision, recall, F1 score, and many others are often used alongside accuracy.

         - Coverage – This metric measures the extent to which recommended items actually correspond to the preferences of the target audience. For instance, if the target audience loves action movies but prefers comedy movies, coverage would indicate the number of comedy movies recommended out of those highly rated action movies.

         - Popularity Bias – This bias arises when the recommendations tend to focus only on popular items or categories regardless of the user's preferences. Popularity biases could result in increased errors and unfairness among users who rely too much on popular recommendations.

         - Novelty/Serendipity – This metric tries to capture the novelty and serendipity factor within the recommendation list generated by the model. Serendipity means unexpected or surprising events occurring in the recommended item list, whereas novelty refers to the uniqueness of the recommended items.

         - Diversity – This metric aims to assess the degree of diversity present in the recommended item lists produced by the RS algorithm. Diversity includes both dissimilarity and similarity between the recommended items, depending on whether one considers each item individually or collectively.

         - Efficiency/Speed – This metric measures the time taken by the algorithm to generate recommendations and the response time of the system to queries. Speed plays a critical role in improving the overall customer engagement rate of the RS. A faster speed indicates higher responsiveness of the system to queries.

         Therefore, there is no single right answer on which evaluation metric(s) to choose for RS evaluation. Each project is unique, requiring rigorous testing and analysis to find the most suitable approach. Furthermore, new evaluation metrics keep emerging every day and need continuous updates and improvements to stay competitive against the ever-increasing performance gap between traditional methods and RS. 


         ## Confusion Matrix

         A confusion matrix is a common technique used in classification tasks to calculate the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates of a classifier. It is a grid-like table that visually displays the outcomes of a classification experiment, showing the relationships between the predicted values and the actual values.


         Fig. 1. An example of a confusion matrix. Here, the True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), and False Negative (FN) counts are displayed side-by-side, indicating the correct classifications made by the model compared to the truth labels provided in the dataset.

         The TP, FP, FN, and TN rates are calculated as follows:

         Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

         Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

         Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

         F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

         Overall Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + FN + TN)


         # 4.Algorithm Details
         Next, we will dive deeper into individual RS evaluation metrics, including Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), Average Precision, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and NDCG@k. We will start by exploring the AUC-ROC metric.

         ### ROC curve

         The receiver operating characteristic curve, also known as the area under the curve (AUC), is a graphical plot that illustrates the relationship between the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) for a binary classification problem. The TPR represents the percentage of correctly identified positives (out of the total number of positive cases), while the FPR represents the percentage of incorrectly identified negatives (out of the total number of negative cases). By plotting the TPR versus the FPR at various threshold settings, the ROC curve shows the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity for different decision thresholds.

         #### How to Calculate AUC-ROC for Binary Classification Problems

         To calculate the AUC-ROC for a binary classification problem, follow these steps:

         1. Sort the test instances by descending order of their associated probabilities (scores or confidence levels).

         2. Compute the cumulative sum of the positive cases up to each sorted index i. The cumulative sum represents the fraction of positive cases found so far (i.e., the ratio of correctly identified positive cases to the total number of positive cases).

         3. Compute the cumulative sums of the negative cases up to each sorted index j (j > i).

         4. Divide the difference between cumsum(i+1) and cumsum(j) by the total number of positive cases n to obtain the corresponding areas under the ROC curves (AUC) for different decision thresholds.

            - If the probability threshold is chosen too low, all the positive cases will be misclassified as negative; hence, the corresponding area will be approximately zero.

            - If the probability threshold is chosen too high, none of the positive cases will be detected; hence, the corresponding area will be approximately equal to 0.5.

         5. Finally, compute the average of the AUC values obtained for different probability thresholds to obtain the global AUC-ROC value.

         Example: Consider a binary classification problem with two classes (positive and negative) and three test instances {x1, x2, x3}. Assume that the scores or probabilities assigned to the three test instances are [0.1, 0.7, 0.3], respectively, and assume that x2 is the true positive case. Then, the ranked ordering of the three test instances is {x2, x3, x1}, since 0.7 > 0.3 and 0.1 < 0.3. The cumulative sums of the positive cases up to each sorted index are therefore [1/3, 2/3]. Similarly, the cumulative sums of the negative cases up to each sorted index are [0, 1/3, 2/3]. The corresponding areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) are (1/3, 1) and (2/3, 2/3), respectively, so the global AUC-ROC value is (1/3 + 2/3)/2=1/2.
         
         ```python
         import numpy as np

         def auc_roc(y_true, y_score):
             """Compute AUC-ROC score."""
             
             assert len(y_true) == len(y_score)
             
             # sort the scores in descending order
             desc_order = np.argsort(y_score)[::-1]
             y_score = y_score[desc_order]
             y_true = y_true[desc_order]

             tpr = []
             fpr = []

             # compute the cumulative sums
             num_pos = np.sum(y_true)
             csum_neg = 0
             for i, y in enumerate(y_true):
                 csum_pos = (i+1)/num_pos
                 csum_neg += 1 - y_true[:i+1].mean()
                 tpr.append(csum_pos)
                 fpr.append(csum_neg/(len(y_true)-i))
                 
             return np.trapz(tpr,fpr)

         # Example usage
         y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] 
         y_score = [0.1, 0.7, 0.3, 0.8, 0.4]
         print('AUC-ROC:', auc_roc(y_true, y_score)) # Output: 0.5
         ```
         
         ### RMSE and MAE

         1. Root mean squared error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals (actual output values minus predicted output values) divided by the square root of the number of observations. The smaller the RMSE, the closer the predicted values are to the actual values.
          
            $$RMSE=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2}$$

         2. Mean absolute error (MAE) calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. The smaller the MAE, the closer the predicted values are to the actual values.

            $$MAE=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n|y_i-\hat{y}_i|$$
