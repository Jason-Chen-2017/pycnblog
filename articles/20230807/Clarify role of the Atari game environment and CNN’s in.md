         The Atari game environment is a widely used benchmark for reinforcement learning (RL) research. In this article we will clarify its role in deep RL approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's). We will present several key concepts related to this field which are crucial for understanding how CNN-based RL agents work. 
         
         To understand why CNN has been applied so successfully in RL applications, let us consider an example. Consider playing Atari games with a human player using standard algorithms like Q-learning or DQN. Let's assume that you have played the Atari Breakout game. When it comes to CNN models, there are two primary reasons:

         1. Much better convergence properties
         2. Easier to capture complex visual patterns
        
        So, what does it mean when we say "Much better convergence"? Well, in conventional neural networks, weights update at each step according to their gradients computed from backpropagation algorithm. However, backpropagation requires the gradient computation over multiple steps through timesteps and also includes the complexity of different layers within the network. This makes training these networks more challenging than traditional supervised learning tasks such as image classification.
        On the other hand, CNN architecture provides a way of approximating the value function directly, i.e., without relying on iterative approximation methods like SARSA or Q-learning. Instead, it learns to compute the state-action values in one pass by transforming the raw input pixels into feature vectors via convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.

        Therefore, using CNN allows for much faster updates compared to traditional neural networks while still achieving good performance. Another advantage of using CNN in RL is that it can effectively learn abstract representations of states and actions instead of pixel inputs. While humans may not be able to interpret the exact details behind every single pixel on the screen, our brains rely on common sense and general principles to make decisions. A well-designed CNN model can leverage those same principles to make smarter decisions about the world. 

        One of the most famous examples of applying deep RL techniques to Atari games is AlphaGo. It achieved superhuman performance on the board games Go and Chess by combining advanced machine learning techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search with Reinforcement Learning agent trained using Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture. Using these powerful tools, AlphaGo was able to master chess and go from scratch using nothing but rule-based expertise. Similarly, many modern deep RL research papers employ CNN architectures for actor-critic or policy-gradient algorithms, making use of the advantages mentioned above.

        2. Basic Concepts & Terminologies 
        Before we dive deeper into specifics, let's quickly review some basic concepts and terminology relevant to the study of deep RL algorithms based on CNN.

         * **Agent** : An AI system or program that interacts with its surrounding environment and produces actions based on its perceptual and internal data. For instance, in robotics, the agent could be a mobile manipulator, while in autonomous driving systems, the agent might be a self-driving car. 

         * **Environment** : Everything outside the agent, including physical factors like weather, lighting, etc., objects, surfaces, etc., everything that the agent can interact with. The environment acts as a context for the agent to perceive its surroundings and take actions. Examples include real-world environments like a hospital setting, a factory automation lab, a gaming arena, or virtual environments like MuJoCo physics simulation engine.

         * **State** : Information about the current situation of the environment that the agent observes. For example, in an open space maze environment, the state could represent the visible walls, hidden walls, and the agent itself.

         * **Action** : Actions taken by the agent to change the state of the environment. For example, in an agent learning to navigate through a maze, the action might be moving forward, backward, left, right, or turning in place.

         * **Reward** : Rewards are feedback provided by the environment to the agent after taking an action. They signal to the agent whether it has succeeded or failed in completing its goal. For example, if the agent completes a task successfully, it would receive a positive reward; otherwise, it would get a negative penalty.

         * **Policy** : A mapping between states and actions that specifies the probabilities of selecting any given action in any given state. The policy represents the agent's decision-making process and helps guide it towards optimal behaviors. A behavior is considered optimal if it maximizes expected long-term rewards. For example, in a reinforcement learning problem where the agent must choose between two options, the policy could specify the probability of choosing option A vs. B in any given state.

         * **Value Function** : A measure of how good it is to be in a particular state. It estimates the expected return if the agent starts in that state and takes all possible actions until termination. Value functions help the agent identify the best actions to take in each state, irrespective of the effects of future rewards. For example, suppose the agent is faced with a choice of three paths: A, B, and C. If the value of path A is higher than both B and C, then the agent should choose A since it leads to the highest expected long-term reward.

         * **Q-value Function** : A special case of the value function where the value is estimated for a particular state-action pair. It combines the quality of the action (i.e., the likelihood of success) with the immediate reward (i.e., the immediate payoff) of the chosen action. The Q-function helps estimate the maximum expected cumulative reward starting from any given state.

         * **Model** : A learned representation of the environment that maps observations to state. Models are typically constructed using sample trajectories collected during training sessions. These samples consist of sequences of observed states, actions, and corresponding rewards.

         * **Trajectory** : A sequence of observed states, actions, and corresponding rewards experienced by the agent during interaction with the environment. Trajectories provide a record of the agent's experiences and serve as inputs to various reinforcement learning algorithms.

         * **Deep Reinforcement Learning** : A class of reinforcement learning algorithms that applies neural networks to solve sequential decision problems. Algorithms like Q-learning, Policy Gradient, and Actor-Critic use deep neural networks to approximate the value function and policy function, respectively. 

        3. Role of Atari Environment in Deep RL Approaches based on CNN

         As discussed earlier, the Atari game environment is a widely used benchmark for reinforcement learning research. The history of Atari games goes back to the late 70s and early 80s, when IBM released several versions of the classic arcade video game - Pong. Despite being old and simple, Pong remained popular and received significant attention due to its simplicity and low stakes nature.

         The Atari Breakout game, released in 1976, offered the opportunity for researchers to apply deep reinforcement learning techniques to play games that were difficult to model. The game had complex dynamics involving motion, collision detection, and scoring points, requiring intelligent strategies that involved multi-agent interactions among multiple players. The fact that this was the first computer game ever created to be driven entirely by artificial intelligence motivated researchers to explore new ideas in reinforcement learning and game theory.

         During the years following Pong and Breakout, DeepMind published several works demonstrating successful application of deep reinforcement learning to Atari games, ranging from Q-learning algorithms applied to simple Atari games like Pong to more complex Atari games like Atari Space Invaders. With advancements in deep learning technology and hardware resources, there is no limit to what types of games and challenges can now be solved using deep RL approaches.

         Now, let's turn our focus to the core concept of this article - Understanding the role of CNN's in Deep RL Approaches.
