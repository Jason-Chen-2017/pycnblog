         “Kubernetes is the de facto standard for container orchestration,” according to the official website of kubernetes.io. It has emerged as an industry-leading technology with many companies and developers using it in their cloud native deployments. Despite being a relatively new technology that’s gaining popularity rapidly, most people still consider it complex and hard to understand. In this article, we will break down how Kubernetes works under the hood to help you get started with developing your own applications based on its principles and concepts. 
         This article assumes readers have some programming experience (Python or Java) and basic understanding of Linux command line operations. We will also use Python to demonstrate various Kubernetes operations such as creating pods, services, replication controllers, etc., but any other programming language can be used too. 

         # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology

         ## Cluster Architecture

         A Kubernetes cluster consists of several nodes, which are connected together via networking infrastructure. Each node runs one or more containers, each of which is isolated from others. The different types of nodes include master nodes, worker nodes, and etcd nodes. The master nodes serve various purposes such as controlling the overall cluster and providing coordination between nodes, while the worker nodes run the actual workloads. etcd nodes store the state information about the cluster including the configuration data, workload metadata, and network topology information. 

         ## Container Orchestration

         When running containers in production, it becomes essential to manage them effectively across multiple nodes and ensure high availability and scalability. Kubernetes provides a powerful set of tools for managing these containers at scale and automating deployment and scaling tasks. It does so by implementing the following core components:

         - **Master**: The control plane of Kubernetes clusters, responsible for managing the cluster's resources and scheduling containers to worker nodes. Master communicates with API server over HTTP RESTful APIs.

         - **Node**: A physical or virtual machine instance in the Kubernetes cluster that hosts containers. All the necessary software, libraries, and dependencies required for running containers should already be installed on each node before adding it to the cluster.

         - **Pod**: A group of one or more containers that share storage/network resources and a unique IP address. Containers within a pod usually communicate with each other using localhost, making them easy to manage and troubleshoot.

         - **Service**: An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access those Pods. Services provide load balancing, service discovery, and name resolution for a set of pods. They enable external traffic to reach internal pods inside the cluster.

         - **Labels and selectors**: Labels are key-value pairs that can be attached to objects like pods, services, and replication controllers. These labels allow users to organize and select groups of objects easily. Selectors specify which labels need to match for a given object to be selected by a controller. For example, a label selector may require a pod to have a particular value for a "role" label to be included into a replicated set.

         ## Declarative Configuration

         One of the main features of Kubernetes is its declarative approach towards application management. This means that instead of specifying individual steps needed to deploy an application, users describe the desired state of the system in terms of what they want deployed without having to manually perform the steps. Kubernetes then applies the changes incrementally, ensuring consistency and reliability throughout the lifecycle of the application. The advantage of this model is that it simplifies the process of deploying, updating, and managing applications, especially when dealing with larger numbers of microservices.

         ### Creating Resources

        There are four fundamental resource types in Kubernetes:

         - **Pods:** A group of one or more containers with shared storage/networking resources and a unique IP address.

         - **Replica Sets:** A higher level concept than pods that manages the creation and deletion of pods based on user-defined policies.

         - **Deployments:** A higher-level concept than replica sets that adds additional functionality such as rolling updates, rollbacks, and history tracking.

         - **Services:** Abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy for accessing those pods.


         To create a new pod, we can use the `kubectl create` command followed by the type of resource (`pod`) and the YAML file containing the definition of the pod. Here's an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp-container
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 30"]
```

This creates a simple pod named `myapp-pod` with a single container that prints "Hello Kubernetes!" every 30 seconds. You can save this YAML to a file called `mypod.yaml`, and then apply it to the cluster by running `kubectl create -f mypod.yaml`.

         Similarly, to create a new service, you would define it in a YAML file similar to the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myservice
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: MyApp
```

In this case, we're creating a service named `myservice` that listens on port 80 and forwards incoming requests to the container port 8080. The selector field specifies that only pods with the label `app=MyApp` should receive traffic directed to this service. 

To delete a resource, simply use the `kubectl delete` command with the appropriate resource type and name. For example, if I wanted to delete the pod created above, I could run `kubectl delete pod myapp-pod`.
