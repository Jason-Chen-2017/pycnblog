        Fishing is a crucial industry for global economic growth and employment opportunities, 
        especially in developing countries where fishing exports have become more lucrative than imports. 
        However, poor data quality can negatively impact the accuracy of fisheries management, leading to negative consequences such as overfishing and land degradation.  
        In this paper we investigate how fish migration patterns vary among different biological communities and are influenced by environmental factors like temperature or water depth. To address these issues, we propose a framework that incorporates three key principles into quantitative methods: 

        - First, we use an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the dynamic movement of individual fishes within the marine ecosystem. This enables us to capture spatio-temporal patterns of fish movements under various conditions and identify emergent behaviors, such as density clustering and migratory routes.

        - Second, we develop a statistical approach called Geographical Information System (GIS) analysis to analyze spatial dependencies between fish movements at multiple temporal scales. By using GIS tools, we can map out spatial distribution of fishes and understand regional trends in fish movement.

        - Third, we use machine learning techniques such as classification and regression algorithms to estimate the relative importance of various environmental factors on fish movement. We compare these estimates with existing literature and identify potential new insights about the role of climate change and human activities in shaping fish movement patterns.

         Based on our findings, we hope that this work will serve as a useful reference guide for researchers, policymakers, and managers in understanding the complex interactions between fish populations, environmental factors, and social dynamics, thereby enabling them to make better decisions regarding their own fisheries and resource management strategies.

         ## 2.1 Agent-Based Model(ABM)

         ABM is a computational simulation method used to study dynamical systems through mathematical modeling of agents interacting with each other. It allows us to simulate complex natural phenomena without relying on physical laws, which makes it highly flexible and practical for analyzing real world problems. 
         
         Here's what an agent-based model typically involves:

         - **Agents**: Individual entities that interact with others via actions and react to their surroundings. Examples include individuals representing birds, mammals, plants, fishes, and humans.

         - **Environment**: The space and surrounding features where all the agents reside.

         - **Actions**: Direct interactions that influence the behavior of the system. Actions could be physical movements, interaction with food, reproduction, etc., depending on the specific problem being studied.

         - **Rules**: Logic and constraints applied to the agent based on its characteristics and current state.

         - **Dynamics**: Mathematical relationships that determine the flow of information between agents and how they respond to changes in the environment and other agents' actions.

         There are several types of ABMs that can be used to study different aspects of ecosystems:

         - **Agent-based Lotka–Volterra models**: Used to simulate population dynamics of predator-prey animal species.

         - **Agent-based Schelling models**: Used to simulate segregation and social disintegration within a city-like environment.

         - **Agent-based cellular automata**: Used to simulate evolutionary processes in cellular structures.

         - **Agent-based simulations of complex networks**: Used to model social, technological, and biological networks.

         ## 2.2 Spatial Analysis and GIS Tools

         GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems. It uses spatial data processing and mapping software to help organizations and governments manage and explore geospatial data. With GIS tools, we can analyze spatial distributions of objects such as buildings, roads, and cities, and visualize spatial patterns of urban activity such as crime hotspots or housing affordability.

          GIS has been widely used in fisheries research since the 1970s due to its ability to accurately represent large spatial datasets. These days, GIS software is becoming increasingly complex and powerful, making it easier to perform sophisticated analyses. One popular tool for analyzing fishery data is QGIS, which provides access to a wide range of functions including data import/export, vector/raster manipulation, network analysis, and database querying.  

           GIS analysis helps us to answer questions related to spatial dependencies between fish movements across regions. For example, we might ask whether certain regions tend to migrate more heavily toward certain locations over time. Additionally, GIS can reveal correlations between regional demographics and patterns of fish movement, indicating the role of regional contextual factors on individual behaviors. 


       ## 2.3 Machine Learning Algorithms

       Machine learning refers to the field of artificial intelligence where computers learn to improve their performance through experience. Specifically, machine learning algorithms enable machines to recognize patterns in data and then predict future outcomes based on those patterns.

        In this paper, we use various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks, to estimate the relative importance of various environmental factors on fish movement. We compare these estimates with existing literature and identify potential new insights about the role of climate change and human activities in shaping fish movement patterns.  

        Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used for binary classification tasks. It estimates the probability of an outcome variable given a set of input variables. In this paper, we use logistic regression to estimate the probabilities of selecting alternative migration routes based on biotic factors, including habitat suitability, food availability, distance from sources, and water depth.

        Decision Trees: Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that split the feature space into smaller subspaces recursively until each leaf node corresponds to one class label. In this paper, we use decision trees to classify regions into high, medium, or low levels of functional connectivity based on percentages of juvenile fish stocks, percentages of female catch, number of predators per reef, percentage of coral reefs, and average depth of coral reefs along each river channel.

        Random Forests: Random forests are a type of ensemble learning algorithm that combine multiple decision trees to reduce variance and improve accuracy. In this paper, we use random forests to classify regions based on biotic factors using aggregated daily values of temperature, precipitation, and salinity across multiple years.

        Support Vector Machines: Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm that is particularly effective when dealing with non-linear data sets. In this paper, we use SVMs to distinguish between two major fish stocks based on abundance, morphology, age structure, and diversity index scores.

        Neural Networks: Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the brain. They are often used for image recognition and speech recognition applications. In this paper, we use neural networks to predict the likelihood of catching both spring and fall tide per year based on weather patterns, seasonality, and fisheries history.
