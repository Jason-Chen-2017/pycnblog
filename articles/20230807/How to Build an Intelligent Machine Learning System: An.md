# 1.简介
         

         This article will give you a comprehensive guide on how to build intelligent machine learning systems using popular libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras in the Python programming language. You'll learn step by step about data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and testing of your models. The article will also include hands-on coding examples that demonstrate how to implement these concepts and provide insights into real-world applications of such systems.

         Machine learning (ML) is becoming increasingly essential for businesses as they automate processes, improve decision-making capabilities, increase efficiency, and decrease costs. However, building intelligent ML systems can be challenging without proper guidance and experience in AI, data science, and software development. With this article, I hope to help you build high-quality, reliable ML systems faster and more accurately.

         In this article, we'll cover five main topics - data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and testing. We'll use examples from medical image analysis to illustrate each concept and show you how to apply it to solve problems relevant to healthcare. By the end of the article, you'll have learned all the necessary steps required to develop successful intelligent ML systems for various domains like finance, transportation, and e-commerce. 

         # 2.基本概念、术语说明

          Before diving straight into code, let's first understand some basic concepts and terms used in machine learning. These are important because understanding them well beforehand helps us better grasp the flow of our approach and avoid common pitfalls when implementing our algorithms. Let's go over the following:


          1. **Data**: Data refers to a collection of information that is processed or analyzed to make predictions based on patterns and trends. It can come in different forms like numerical values, text, images, videos, and so on. Examples of data sets commonly used in ML are the iris dataset which contains information about three species of irises, the MNIST database which contains handwritten digits, and the CIFAR-10 dataset which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

          2. **Labels/Target Variable**: Labels are the desired outputs for a given input data point, and target variable is the specific output being predicted. For example, if we want to classify images, labels could refer to the class of the picture while the target variable would be whether or not the algorithm correctly identified the class.

          3. **Features**: Features are the attributes or characteristics of the data points used to train our model. They can range from simple measurements such as temperature and humidity to complex features like the presence of particular objects or faces in an image.

          4. **Training Set**/**Testing Set**: A training set is a subset of the total available data where the model learns from, while the testing set is held back until after model performance has been evaluated. If there is no test set, the data is split randomly into two parts, with one part being used for training and another for testing.

           5. **Algorithm**: Algorithms are mathematical formulas that take inputs, process them, and produce outputs. Popular algorithms in ML include linear regression, logistic regression, k-NN classification, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and neural networks. Each algorithm works differently depending on its purpose and architecture, and knowing what type of problem you're working on can help select the most appropriate algorithm for your task.
            
           6. **Hyperparameters**: Hyperparameters are parameters that are set prior to training a model and control its behavior during the training phase. They typically affect the speed, accuracy, and other properties of the final model. Common hyperparameters include learning rate, regularization strength, batch size, and number of layers in a neural network.
            
           7. **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Model evaluation metrics are used to measure the effectiveness of a trained model. Some commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. Knowing the metric(s) that best suit your needs can help determine how well your model is performing and how to fine-tune it further.

          Next up, we'll look at some popular libraries and frameworks that can help us build intelligent ML systems efficiently in Python.
