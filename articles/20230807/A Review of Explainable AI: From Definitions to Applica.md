# 1.简介
         
 Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an interdisciplinary field that brings together researchers from various fields such as machine learning and data science with computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and economists to create new technologies that can help humans understand how machines make decisions and achieve their goals. XAI includes a range of techniques for interpreting machine learning models, understanding black-box models, debugging models, and building trustworthy AI systems. 
          This article presents a review of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), including its background, definitions, core algorithms, and applications in finance, healthcare, transportation, retail, education, and security. It provides clear explanations of the fundamental concepts and terminology involved in XAI, and illustrates these concepts using real-world examples from different domains. The review also covers several state-of-the-art methods and approaches used in XAI research, and compares them against each other in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, it highlights the future directions and challenges in XAI development.

         # 2.Terminologies
          **Explainability**: the ability to provide information about why or how a decision was made by a machine learning model.
          **Interpretability**: the extent to which a model's behavior can be explained.
          **Explanation**: a set of human-readable statements that describe the reasoning behind a model's prediction.
          **Decision boundary**: the boundary between two classes predicted by a classification model.
          **Feature importance**: the degree to which a feature influences the outcome of a machine learning model.
          **Counterfactual explanation**: an explanation that describes what would have happened if a specific action had not taken place instead of another one.

          # 3.Machine Learning Model Interpretation Techniques
           XAI involves multiple techniques for interpreting machine learning models, ranging from visualizations and feature importances to decision boundaries and counterfactual explanations. 
           ## Visualizations
            One way to interpret machine learning models is to visualize the internal representations learned by the model. These representations are often transformed into low-dimensional space, where patterns emerge automatically without any additional human supervision. Two popular visualization techniques include t-SNE and PCA, both of which project high-dimensional data into a lower dimensionality while preserving structure and relationships within the original dataset. 
            Another technique involves generating attributions, which measure the impact of individual features on the output of the model. Attributions represent the change in the prediction caused by changes in a particular input variable. Popular attribution methods include Shapley Additive Explanations and Integrated Gradients.
            
            To visualize the predictions made by a model, we need access to a sample of inputs and corresponding outputs. However, obtaining labeled training data may be expensive or impossible in many cases. We can use active learning methods to simulate user feedback and generate useful insights even when only partial training labels are available. For example, in medical imaging, we can ask users to label regions of interest and suggest possible diagnostic tests based on those annotations.

           ## Feature Importances
            Another method to interpret a machine learning model is to identify the most important features that contribute to its performance. These features are commonly called "important predictors" or "top predictors". Other names for feature importances include relevance scores, leverage scores, and permutation importance. Common ways to compute feature importances include mean decrease impurity (MDP) and random forest feature importance. MDP measures the reduction in entropy after removing a randomly chosen feature, and is computed efficiently through recursive partitioning. Random forest feature importance computes the average decrease in accuracy brought by each feature averaged over all trees in the ensemble.

            While feature importances provide insight into what makes a model accurate, they cannot capture subtle interactions between features. Additionally, they do not take into account potential interactions among multiple features. Decision tree models offer a more holistic view of feature importance, but their complexity limits their applicability to large datasets.

            Overall, visualizing or computing feature importances is a quick and easy way to get a sense of what factors influence a machine learning model's decisions, but they cannot reveal precisely why a certain prediction was made or what actions contributed to the result. 

           ## Local Explanations
            Many modern deep neural networks consist of millions of parameters, making them difficult to fully understand. This issue becomes especially acute for complex tasks like image recognition or natural language processing, where the models' output represents a complex function that is hard to analyze manually. Therefore, local explanations provide a way to break down the complexities of complex functions into simpler components. They provide a closer look into the inner workings of a model and enable us to gain a better understanding of how it works. There are several existing methods for generating local explanations, including LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SmoothGrad. LIME generates explanations by approximating the gradients of the model's predictions with respect to small perturbations in the input. SmoothGrad adds noise to the input to approximate higher order derivative, resulting in smoother explanations.
