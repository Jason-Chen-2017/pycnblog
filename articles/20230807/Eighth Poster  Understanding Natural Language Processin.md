         # 2. Basic Concepts of NLP 
         ## 2.1 What is NLP?
         Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the field of computational linguistics that deals with interactions between human languages and computers. It involves developing algorithms and mathematical models that can understand, analyze, manipulate, and produce human language. The primary goal of NLP is to enable machines to understand and interact with humans in ways that they do not naturally do. Today, NLP includes various applications such as speech recognition, text analytics, question answering systems, etc., which makes it essential for building intelligent systems that operate on human language. 

 Within NLP, there are several subfields such as Speech Recognition, Information Extraction, Question Answering System, Document Summarization, Automatic Text Correction, and Named Entity Recognition. This article focuses only on the first three subfields i.e., speech recognition, information extraction, and question answering system since they are most commonly used for building chatbots and other conversational interfaces, respectively.

         ## 2.2 Types of Language
         There are two main types of language – linguistic language and artificial language. Linguistic language is any natural language that has been transmitted by people from generations to generations over millions of years. Examples include English, French, German, Chinese, Hindi, Marathi, Spanish, Tamil, etc. On the other hand, artificial language is anything designed by engineers, scientists, or programmers to simulate some aspect of human language behavior. For example, the code for a movie script is an artificial language while English is the corresponding linguistic language spoken by the actors in the film. Artificial language comes in many forms such as programming languages, databases, markup languages, and so on.

        ## 2.3 Word Representation
        Before understanding about NLP, we need to know about word representation. A word can be represented by different means depending upon its context and usage. One common approach is to represent each word using its semantic meaning along with its syntactic role within the sentence. Let’s take an example: Consider the following sentence - “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” Here, the words "the", "quick," "brown," "fox," "jumps," "over," "lazy," and "dog" have their own unique semantics and roles within the sentence. Each word may be associated with certain properties such as tense, pronoun case, number, gender, degree of comparison, degree of adverbial modifiers, dependency relations, etc. Based on these properties, we can create vectors to represent each word based on its features. These vectors contain information about the individual words but don't necessarily carry any semantic meaning. 

        Once we obtain a vector representation for each word, we can perform operations like addition, multiplication, distance calculation, similarity calculation, clustering, etc. These operations help us extract useful insights from large volumes of unstructured data, especially textual data. Commonly, we use embeddings such as GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText, BERT, ELMo, etc. for obtaining word representations.  
        
        ## 2.4 Sentence Encoding
        When dealing with sentences, we usually convert them into fixed length vectors called sentence encoding. There are various approaches for converting a sentence into a vector representation. One popular technique is Bag Of Words (BoW), where we represent each sentence as a bag of its constituent words and assign weights to each word based on its frequency of occurrence in the document. Another approach is to represent each sentence as a vector composed of its mean embedding of its component words. Other methods involve representing a sentence as a vector consisting of its syntactic structure, syntax graph, or dependency tree.

         ## 2.5 Tokenization and Stemming/Lemmatization
         Tokenization breaks down the input text into small parts, called tokens, such as individual words, punctuation marks, or even characters. Depending on the task at hand, we might want to remove stopwords, stem or lemmatize the tokens. Stopwords are those very common words like 'the', 'and', 'is' which occur very frequently and hence cannot add much value to the understanding of the text. By removing them, our model gets rid of unnecessary noise in the text, leading to better accuracy in term-based predictions. Similarly, stemming reduces words to their root form, whereas lemmatizing does more complex things like grouping together inflected forms of a word. Generally, stemming and lemmatization often yield similar results but there are differences in terms of their effectiveness.    

         After tokenization and preprocessing the text, we can feed it to the appropriate algorithm for performing the desired task, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging.

         # 3. Building an Embedding Model for Sentiment Analysis using TensorFlow
         Sentiment analysis is one of the key challenges of NLP. Given a set of texts, our model should predict whether the overall tone of the texts is positive, negative, or neutral. One common approach for solving this problem is by training an embedding model that maps each word in the vocabulary to a high-dimensional space where related words are placed closer to each other. Then, we can calculate the sentiment score of a new text by taking the average of the sentiment scores of its individual words. This method assumes that the sentiment of a given word depends primarily on its relationship with nearby words.

         In this section, we'll explain how to build an embedding model for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow. To illustrate the process, we will use the IMDB dataset, which contains binary sentiment label (positive or negative) for 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database. We will follow the standard procedure of splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and then preprocess the text data by removing stopwords, stemming the remaining words, and padding or truncating the documents to a fixed length.

          ## Step 1: Load and preprocess the data
          First, we load and preprocess the data using Python's pandas library. The steps involved here are:
          1. Download and unzip the dataset.
          2. Read the csv file containing the review texts and labels into a Pandas dataframe.
          3. Remove stopwords and stem the remaining words using NLTK library.
          4. Pad or truncate the documents to a fixed length of 1000 words.
          
          ```python
          import pandas as pd
          import nltk
          from nltk.corpus import stopwords
          from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
          from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

          nltk.download('stopwords')

          df = pd.read_csv("imdb_reviews.csv")

          # Clean up the text data
          def clean_text(text):
              """Remove stopwords and stem the remaining words"""
              stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english')) 
              ps = PorterStemmer()

              cleaned = []
              for word in text.split():
                  if word.lower() not in stop_words:
                      cleaned.append(ps.stem(word))
              
              return''.join(cleaned)

          df['review'] = df['review'].apply(clean_text)

          # Pad or truncate the documents to a fixed length of 1000 words
          maxlen = 1000
          tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer()
          tokenizer.fit_on_texts(df['review'])
          sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(df['review'])
          padded_data = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=maxlen)

          labels = np.array(df['label'], dtype='float32')
          ```

          ## Step 2: Define the architecture of the embedding model
          Next, we define the architecture of the embedding model using Keras API. Specifically, we use a simple LSTM layer followed by a dense output layer.

           ```python
          import numpy as np
          import tensorflow as tf

          model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=len(tokenizer.word_index)+1,
                                      output_dim=embedding_dim,
                                      input_length=maxlen),
            tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, dropout=0.2),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
          ])
          model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
          ```

          ## Step 3: Train the model and evaluate its performance
          Finally, we train the model using the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance on the test split.

          ```python
          num_epochs = 5
          batch_size = 128

          history = model.fit(padded_data, labels,
                            epochs=num_epochs, 
                            batch_size=batch_size,
                            validation_split=0.2)

          _, acc = model.evaluate(test_padded_data, test_labels, verbose=0)
          print("Accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(acc*100))
          ```

          After training the model, we get an accuracy of around 88%. This indicates that our model is able to achieve good performance in classifying movie reviews into positive or negative classes, indicating a reasonable level of interpretability and utility.
