         Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the ability of a computer program or application to understand human language and process it for further use in natural language processing tasks such as text analysis, speech recognition and machine translation. In this article, we will learn how to perform basic NLP tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, tagging, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, summarization, and topic modeling using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). We will also see some applications of these techniques on real-world data sets and learn how to evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix etc.
         
         Before starting our journey into NLP, let's have an overview of what is natural language processing? What are its key features and why should you consider using it? Let’s get started with an introduction!
     
         ## What is Natural Language Processing? 
         
         Natural Language Processing (NLP), also known as Speech Recognition, is a field that involves extracting meaning from spoken or written language. It helps to automate complex tasks by analyzing large amounts of unstructured textual information such as social media posts, emails, customer feedbacks, product reviews, medical records, financial documents, legal contracts, and many other sources. In short, NLP is all about enabling machines to communicate intelligently and effectively through natural language.
      
         Key Features:

         * **Natural:** The term “natural” suggests that NLP processes languages naturally occurring in the world around us, rather than being programmed specifically for each task. This means that even if your input data contains errors or typos, the output generated by NLP systems can still be accurate.

         * **Human-like:** Most NLP tasks involve interacting with humans, which makes them unique from traditional programming tasks where software programs are directed towards specific tasks like sorting numbers or calculating mathematical expressions. By utilizing the human linguistic abilities, NLP systems can provide better results by understanding context, emotional tone, nuances, and idiomatic ways of speaking.

         * **Complex:** Complexity of natural language makes it challenging to build robust and reliable NLP systems. However, with the advancement of technology, new methods and tools are emerging every day to address these challenges.

         Why Should You Consider Using NLP?

         1. Understanding Human Language
        
         Language has become a fundamental component of our communication since ancient times. Humans used various signs, symbols, gestures, sounds, and images to convey thoughts, feelings, and ideas over thousands of years. The growing usage of digital technologies has made possible to store and transmit huge volumes of language data, and enable people across the globe to share their thoughts, opinions, and perspectives online. However, relying solely on automated NLP algorithms may not give insights into the actual meaning behind words, sentences, paragraphs, or long passages of texts. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the language data manually to gain meaningful insights and make sense of it.

         2. Empowering Organizations and Businesses
        
         NLP enables organizations and businesses to capture and analyze valuable insights from unstructured language data. Automated decision making, targeted marketing campaigns, content recommendations, and research activities could greatly benefit from integrating NLP technologies into existing workflows. As NLP becomes more pervasive, companies can start to leverage the insights they derive from NLP analysis to improve products, services, and customer experiences.

         3. Enhancing Customer Experience
        
         When customers interact with brands digitally via chatbots, voice assistants, virtual assistants, personal assistants, and so on, it becomes crucial to ensure that their interactions are engaging, informative, entertaining, and effective. Natural language processing can help organizations create smarter bots that can deliver relevant answers and suggestions based on the user queries, providing improved customer experience.
          
         4. Improving Productivity and Efficiency
        
         While working, managing multiple projects simultaneously requires constant switching between different applications, platforms, and devices. Having access to up-to-date and relevant information at any given moment, whether it be work related, personal, or professional, enhances productivity significantly. With increased automation levels due to artificial intelligence, enhanced analytics capabilities, and cloud computing infrastructure, organizations can harness the power of natural language processing to enhance their productivity and efficiency.

         5. Enabling Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
        
         NLP plays a pivotal role in driving the progress of artificial intelligence and machine learning. NLP can help extract valuable insights and knowledge from vast amounts of unstructured data such as web pages, email messages, and social media conversations. Moreover, NLP can enable development of advanced natural language generation models and deep learning algorithms that can drive significant changes in industry verticals such as search engine optimization, computational linguistics, and question answering.
