        # 2.定义和历史回顾
        Federated learning (FL) was first introduced by Google AI in 2016, while it has gained widespread attention since then due to its ability to handle large-scale datasets and enable real-time decision making under diverse computing environments. The term 'federated' refers to the decentralization of participants, each holding different parts of the dataset, allowing them to work together without sharing any sensitive information. 

        In recent years, there have been many advances in developing advanced techniques for federated learning, including privacy-preserving mechanisms and optimization strategies. However, despite all these advancements, federated learning remains challenging because it requires sophisticated infrastructure and communication protocols to ensure efficient computation and effective collaboration between parties.

        There are two main approaches to federated learning: vertical and horizontal. Vertical federated learning involves deploying dedicated servers across different organizations, whereas horizontal federated learning relies on smart device networking technologies and software frameworks to distribute tasks across local areas of the network. Both approaches offer unique benefits depending on various factors such as network topology, data size, and computational capacity of devices. One way to visualize the differences between the two approaches is through the lens of human versus automated devices in office environments. Vertical approaches involve remote workers who perform complex computations using powerful hardware, while horizontal approaches leverage low-cost edge devices like mobile phones to carry out simple tasks and communicate with cloud servers to retrieve required resources.

        # 3.基本概念和术语介绍 
        Before jumping into core algorithms and implementation details, let’s briefly define some key terms and concepts related to federated learning.

        **Participants**: These are entities responsible for hosting their part of the federated learning dataset locally. Participants may include individuals, institutions, or IoT devices.

        **Datasets**: Each participant holds a portion of the overall dataset which they can use for training their models locally. Datasets vary from small image classification datasets to large text analysis datasets.

        **Training rounds**: Federated learning methods typically involve multiple iterations over the entire dataset, known as training rounds. During each round, each participant trains their local model on their own partition of the dataset, before aggregating these updates to improve global accuracy.

        **Global model**: The final aggregated model trained across all participating participants, resulting in improved prediction accuracy compared to individual participant models. Global models may also need regular retraining based on new data from participants, similar to traditional centralized learning settings.

        **Local training**: Training process performed on each participant’s dataset to improve the local model. Local training may involve updating weights and biases iteratively until convergence, but other techniques such as stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch SGD are also commonly used.

        **Aggregation**: Process of combining local updates into a single global update. Aggregation techniques vary from averaging to weighted sum, and are designed to balance contribution of each participant’s model towards improving the global model.

        **Communication complexity**: The amount of time and bandwidth needed to send updated parameters from one participant to another, impacting scalability and efficiency of the system. Communication complexity also varies based on the type of machine learning algorithm being used.

        **Collaborative filtering** - A common recommendation system technique utilizing matrix factorization methods. Users' past behavior is modeled as a sparse rating matrix, and collaborative filtering aims to predict ratings for missing items based on the similarity scores between users and items. Collaborative filtering works best when users' past behaviors are represented well enough to capture underlying patterns in preferences.

      # 4.典型联邦学习系统架构
      Different types of federated learning systems exist based on the architecture and communication policies applied within the system. Here are some typical ones:
      
      ## Centralized System
      In a centralized system, the entire dataset is stored at a central server and all processing happens at this location. All client devices connect directly to this server, sending their respective partitions of the dataset to be processed. While this architecture is easy to deploy, it often leads to high latency due to the distance involved in transmitting large amounts of data. Additionally, centralized systems do not scale well as more devices are added to the system. Overall, centralized systems are useful for smaller and medium sized datasets, where the data transfer cost is relatively lower than the processing cost.
      
    
    ## Decentralized Systems
    Decentralized systems differ from centralized systems in how data is distributed and processed. Unlike centralized systems, decentralized systems assign responsibility for specific portions of the data to different nodes, rather than having a central server manage all data. Clients send only the necessary information to the relevant nodes for processing.

    When selecting suitable nodes for processing certain data, decentralized systems rely on a variety of factors, including connectivity speed, power availability, computational capabilities, memory constraints, and storage space available. To achieve maximum throughput and minimize latency, most decentralized systems utilize asynchronous messaging protocols, such as Apache Kafka or MQTT.

    Distributed computing platforms such as Hadoop and Spark are popular options for implementing decentralized systems. Within these platforms, clients send jobs to the cluster, which allocates resources accordingly and handles the distribution of the workload.

    Decentralized systems offer significant advantages over centralized systems in terms of scalability, flexibility, and security. They can be easily scaled up or down according to the demands of the user, supporting large-scale operations. On the other hand, decentralized systems are less susceptible to failures caused by unreliable connections and faulty hardware, as long as appropriate redundancy measures are taken.


    ### Horizontally Partitioned Systems
    Horizontal partitioning is a variation of decentralized systems, where each node stores a subset of the data. Client devices are divided into groups or zones, and each group contains a fixed number of nodes, which process the same portion of the dataset independently. For example, Facebook uses horizontally partitioned systems to divide its social graph into regions and selectively replicate data around the world to reduce latency and increase resilience.

    Although horizontally partitioned systems have better scalability and resilience properties compared to fully decentralized systems, they still face issues associated with managing and synchronizing state across disparate nodes. Moreover, coordination overhead increases as nodes belonging to different zones must communicate frequently during synchronization and recovery.


    ### Edge-based Systems
    Edge-based systems focus on distributing the processing load closer to the source of data, rather than relying solely on central servers. Typically, edge devices run lightweight algorithms and are located close to sensors or actuators within the physical environment. They receive inputs from nearby devices or sensors, apply preprocessing functions to the data, and produce output to trigger actions within the physical world.

    By storing a limited amount of data on the edge device itself, edge-based systems offer tremendous potential for reducing communication costs and enabling real-time decision-making applications. However, deployment is generally more complicated than conventional systems, requiring specialized hardware and software stacks to optimize the resource usage of the devices.


    ### Hybrid Systems
    Some hybrid solutions combine features of different architectures, such as a combination of a decentralized system with a set of edge nodes. Common implementations include federated aggregation, where multiple devices share data, while edge nodes contribute additional input to the global model. Other variants include centralized training and secure aggregation, where one entity acts as the trusted third party to aggregate updates from multiple sources, while protecting against malicious actors attempting to interfere with the system.

    Despite their varying designs, federated learning offers a range of opportunities for optimizing the usage of large-scale datasets, enhancing personalized services, and simplifying machine learning workflows. With careful planning and execution, however, federated learning can be a powerful tool for achieving near-perfect accuracy in complex problems such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis.
