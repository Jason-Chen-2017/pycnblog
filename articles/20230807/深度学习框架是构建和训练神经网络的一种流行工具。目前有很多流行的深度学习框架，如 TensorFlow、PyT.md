# 1.简介
         
 Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to perform complex tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. 
          The most popular deep learning frameworks are TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, CNTK, Keras, and Chainer. 
          
          In this article, we will discuss the basics of deep learning frameworks by comparing their key features: speed, ease of use, flexibility, extensibility, and accuracy.
          
          If you need help in choosing which framework to use for your specific project or task, I can give you my recommendation based on my experience using these frameworks over the past several years.
          
         # 2.TensorFlow
         ## 2.1 Introduction
          TensorFlow (TF) is an open-source software library developed by Google for numerical computations, training deep neural networks, and performing other machine learning tasks like reinforcement learning and natural language processing. It was originally released in September 2015, and it has since become one of the most widely used deep learning libraries due to its simplicity and power.
          

          TF offers several advantages compared to other popular deep learning frameworks, including:

          1. Flexibility - Tensorflow allows users to build models from scratch using low-level ops or high-level abstractions, making it easy to create custom architectures and optimize performance.
          2. Ease of Use - Tensorflow provides APIs in Python, C++, Java, Go, JavaScript, Swift, and more, allowing developers to quickly prototype new ideas and experiments.
          3. Speed - Tensorflow can run models on GPUs or CPUs efficiently, enabling real-time inference applications at scale.
          4. Scalability - With support for distributed computing across multiple machines, Tensorflow can handle large datasets and train deep neural networks on large-scale clusters.

        ## 2.2 Core Concepts
        ### 2.2.1 Tensors 
        A tensor is a multi-dimensional array that describes a set of values. In TensorFlow, tensors have two main types: vectors and matrices.
        
        For example, let's say we want to represent a vector called "x" containing three elements: x = [1, 2, 3]. We can define a tensor representing "x" as follows:

            tf.constant([1, 2, 3], shape=[3])

        Here, `tf.constant` creates a constant tensor with the value `[1, 2, 3]` and the shape `[3]`, meaning it represents a single row matrix with three columns. Note that TensorFlow also supports higher dimensional tensors, but they are less commonly used.

        Similarly, if we wanted to represent a 2D matrix, we could do so as follows:

            tf.constant([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]], shape=[2, 3])

        This defines a matrix with two rows and three columns, where each element corresponds to the corresponding row and column indices.

        ### 2.2.2 Graphs and Sessions
        A graph in TensorFlow is a data structure that stores a series of operations and how they relate to one another. When we run a model in TensorFlow, we construct a computation graph using various operators such as `tf.matmul()`, `tf.add()`, etc., and then evaluate that graph within a session to execute those operations. 

        Each operation in the graph takes zero or more inputs and produces zero or more outputs. For example, the following code constructs a simple graph that multiplies two input tensors together:

            import tensorflow as tf
            
            x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 3))
            y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 3))
            z = tf.multiply(x, y)
            
            sess = tf.Session()
            result = sess.run(z, feed_dict={
                x: [[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]],
                y: [[7., 8., 9.], [10., 11., 12.]]})
            print(result)
            
        
        This creates a placeholder tensor `x` and a placeholder tensor `y`. Then it adds them together using the `tf.multiply()` operator, which returns a tensor `z`. Finally, it evaluates `z` using a session, passing in sample input values for `x` and `y`.

        ### 2.2.3 Variables
        Another important concept in TensorFlow is variables. Unlike placeholders, whose values are fed into the graph at runtime, variables store persistent state across multiple runs of the graph. They are often used to store learned parameters such as weights and biases in a neural network.

        To create a variable, we simply call `tf.Variable()` and pass in an initial value:

            var = tf.Variable(initial_value=1.0)
            
        By default, variables are stored on CPU memory during training and evaluation. However, there are ways to move them to GPU memory if available, which can significantly reduce their computational cost.

        ### 2.2.4 Control Flow Operations
        TensorFlow includes control flow operations like loops, conditionals, and ragged tensors, which allow us to express more complex algorithms.

        For example, here's how we can write a loop in TensorFlow:
        
            def fizzbuzz():
              n = tf.constant(1)
              limit = tf.constant(10)
              
              def body(i, limit):
                  return i+1, tf.cond(tf.equal(tf.mod(i, 3), 0), lambda: tf.Print(i, ['Fizz']), lambda: None)\
                             .__mul__(tf.cond(tf.equal(tf.mod(i, 5), 0), lambda: tf.Print(i, ['Buzz']), lambda: None))\
                             .__mul__(limit).__lt__(limit).__invert__()
                  
              _, output = tf.while_loop(lambda i, *_: tf.less(i, limit), body, [n, ''])
              
              return output
              
            sess = tf.Session()
            print(sess.run(fizzbuzz()))
            
        This defines a function `fizzbuzz()` that generates FizzBuzz numbers up to 10. It does this by defining a nested loop using `tf.while_loop()`. The outer loop iterates from 1 to 10, while the inner loop increments the number `i` and checks whether it's divisible by 3 or 5. If either condition is true, it prints either "Fizz" or "Buzz". Finally, it stops the loop once it reaches the specified limit (`limit`) or when all numbers have been printed.

    ### 2.3 Key Features
    There are many unique features of each deep learning framework that make it stand out among others. Let's take a closer look at some of the common ones:

      * **Speed** - Many deep learning frameworks offer optimized implementations for different hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. These optimizations can dramatically improve the performance of your models, especially for larger and deeper models.
      
      * **Ease of Use** - TensorFlow provides easy-to-use APIs for constructing and executing graphs, managing data feeds, and optimizing performance. It comes with prebuilt classes for handling input data, implementing standard optimization techniques, and exporting models to production formats.
      
      * **Flexibility** - TensorFlow allows users to easily customize their models through low-level ops or high-level abstractions, making it possible to implement complex models with minimal effort.
      
      * **Extensibility** - Since TensorFlow is built on top of the highly scalable infrastructure provided by Google, third party libraries and plugins can be easily integrated into the system.
