# 1.简介
         
 Data normalization is a critical step in the data preprocessing process that involves converting data from different sources into a common format that can be easily processed by other applications. It helps to reduce errors, improve consistency of data quality, and optimize efficiency during analysis. 
          In this article, we will explain why normalization is important in business analysis and how it should be done effectively with guidelines and best practices for achieving better results. 
         # 2.Normalization Concepts and Terminology
         Before discussing about normalization techniques, let’s clarify some basic concepts related to normalizing data. Let’s understand these terms before proceeding further.

         ## Defining normalization
          *Normalization* is defined as the process of organizing, structuring or transforming data so that it becomes consistent, accurate, and complete throughout its life cycle within an enterprise environment. It ensures that all data inputs are valid and consistent with each other in order to avoid any errors or discrepancies between them which may result in inconsistencies in downstream processes. 

         ## Types of Normalization Techniques

          There are several types of normalization techniques including:
            - Functional normalization
            - Denormalization/De-normalization
            - Attribute level normalization
            - Table design optimization
          We will discuss only functional and attribute level normalization here because they have been widely used in practice. The others are beyond the scope of this article.


          ### Functional Normalization
           Functional normalization is also known as first normal form (1NF) wherein a table is in first normal form if every tuple has exactly one value for each attribute. This means there are no repeating groups of attributes in the table such as multiple rows having identical values across columns.

           For example, consider a table named "Employee" containing details like Employee ID, Name, Age, Job Title, Salary etc. Here, since all the attributes belong to the same entity i.e., employee and their information is unique, hence the table would already be in 1NF as per the above definition. 

          ### Attribute Level Normalization
           Attribute level normalization refers to a technique that involves dividing tables into smaller ones based on the type of data stored in them. The goal of attribute level normalization is to minimize redundancy and enhance data integrity by ensuring that each piece of data appears only once in the database.

            However, instead of creating new tables, attribute level normalization maintains references among existing tables using foreign keys. Foreign key constraints ensure that updates made to the referenced record in one table reflect the same changes made to referencing records in other tables. By doing this, data duplication is reduced.

             Another advantage of attribute level normalization over functional normalization is that it allows organizations to modify data without affecting other parts of the system. For instance, when a new job title is added to the employees' table, it does not affect the entire organization's performance metrics or reports as long as proper indexing is done to handle large datasets efficiently. Therefore, it provides more flexibility and scalability than traditional functional databases.
            
            To achieve better results, businesses must adhere to certain principles while performing attribute level normalization. These include:
            
             1. Eliminate data redundancy – Redundant data can lead to inaccuracies and maintainability issues down the road. Therefore, it’s essential to eliminate duplicate entries and make sure that all necessary attributes are present in every row.
               
             2. Use denormalization where possible – When there is a need to update frequently accessed fields, it makes sense to denormalize those tables to speed up query processing times. 
               
             3. Use loose coupling – Schema modifications require careful consideration and can cause incompatibilities between software components if not handled properly.
              
             4. Minimize transactions - Transactions can take significant time to commit even on relatively small datasets, so minimizing transaction size and frequency can help to improve overall performance.
          
          With these principles in mind, businesses can use various tools and technologies to perform effective normalization at scale. Some popular solutions include:
          
             - Database management systems such as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL provide built-in support for normalization techniques. They allow you to define data relationships through primary and foreign keys, indexes, and triggers. 
                  
             - SQL Server supports advanced functions for managing normalization, including partitioning and clustering.
                  
             - Open source frameworks like Hibernate ORM, Apache Spark, and Apache Cassandra offer APIs for working with normalized databases.
