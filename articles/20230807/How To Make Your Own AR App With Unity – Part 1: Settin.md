         Augmented reality (AR) is an amazing technology that enables users to interact with digital objects using their real-world environment. It has many practical applications in areas such as education, entertainment, manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation. In this article, we will create our own augmented reality app using the popular game engine called Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). We will use the Apple iOS platform for developing our mobile application while utilizing the features of the Apple ARKit framework. The aim of this tutorial series is to provide readers with a comprehensive guide on how to build a fully functional augmented reality app from scratch.

         Our first step towards building our AR app would be setting up the required development tools and environments. This involves installing Xcode and then creating a new Xcode project. Then, we can add various content to the scene and finally compile it into a runnable application. By following these steps, we can begin designing and implementing our own AR app that can enhance our daily lives. 

         If you are already familiar with some of the basic concepts associated with the AR industry, or if you have any doubts regarding any particular aspect of the process, feel free to skip ahead and read part two where we start with the basics of project creation and set up. Let's get started!

         # 2. Basic Concepts & Terms

         Before we dive into the actual coding, let’s understand some important terms and concepts that are essential for understanding the code structure. 

         ## 2.1 Physical World vs Virtual World

          The physical world refers to the actual surroundings where the user is situated. These include objects like tables, chairs, walls etc., which physically exist outside the virtual world. A virtual world, however, does not require any representation of anything other than computer graphics. Essentially, the virtual world consists of images or videos displayed on the screen. Everything in the virtual world appears to move around, but there is no direct connection between it and the real world. For example, imagine holding your phone and looking at it through the camera lens. You cannot directly see yourself moving inside the virtual world, only the images or video display on the screen. 

        ## 2.2 Augmented Reality System

        An augmented reality system combines both the physical and virtual worlds together by overlaying virtual representations of real objects onto the physical world. The goal of the system is to make it appear that the objects in the virtual world are actually present within the physical space. Users can interact with them in a natural way by manipulating them with their fingers, gestures, voice commands or handheld controllers. To achieve this functionality, the system typically uses a combination of sensors, cameras, processing units, software algorithms, and special hardware components called anchor points. Anchor points allow the system to locate specific parts of the real world, enabling accurate placement of virtual objects.

        ## 2.3 Device Tracking Technology

        Device tracking technology allows devices to accurately track movement, orientation and position within the physical world. Typically, this technology is achieved via smartphone-based location technologies like GPS or Bluetooth Beacons. Sensors used in device tracking technologies measure acceleration, rotation rate, magnetic field strength, and pressure differences across the device, providing valuable data for precise placement of virtual objects.

        ## 2.4 Computer Vision Techniques

        Computer vision techniques enable the system to identify and interpret visual information provided by the device’s cameras. These techniques detect patterns in real-time, allowing the system to recognize different types of surfaces and objects, including planar targets, scenes, and human figures. Once recognized, the system can generate virtual representations of those objects that act as anchors in the virtual world. The type of object detected also affects the level of detail needed in the generated virtual representation, making the system more versatile and capable of handling a variety of scenarios.

        # 3. Project Creation and Set Up
        
        Now that we have covered some background knowledge about augmented reality, its terminology, and related technologies, we can proceed with the core task of creating our own augmented reality app. Firstly, we need to install the necessary development tools. Then, we need to create a new project and load the appropriate starter assets. Next, we can place various content, such as models, textures, materials, and scripts, into the scene. Finally, we can compile and run our app to test it out before distributing it to end users.

        ## Step 1 - Install Xcode

          1. Go to https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
          2. Click on "Get" to download Xcode
         
        ## Step 2 - Create a New Xcode Project

        1. Open Xcode
        2. Click on "Create a new Xcode project"
        3. Select "Single View App" template
        4. Enter your desired product name and organization identifier
        5. Choose your preferred language and press Continue
        6. Choose options such as Dark Mode Support, Target Devices, and Add Core Data if applicable. Press Finish
        
        ## Step 3 - Load Starter Assets

        1. Drag and drop starter assets into the Xcode project navigator window.
            - Note: Some starter assets may not be available depending on what version of UE4 and Xcode you are running. Please refer to the official documentation for the latest recommended setup.

	## Step 4 - Start Coding

	  1. Understand the Code Structure
	  
	  The main code files in an Unreal project are listed below:

	  - Content/Maps: Contains levels created in the editor, organized by folder structure. Each map contains one or more levels that define different aspects of the experience, such as spawn locations, player starting positions, and decorative details. 
          - Note: As mentioned earlier, the best practice is to create separate maps for each different scene within your app, so they can easily be loaded during runtime.
      
	  - Content/Textures: Stores all image resources used in the project, grouped by category, such as UI elements, characters, props, environmental effects, and particle systems.
	  - Content/Materials: Stores material definitions used throughout the project, organized by shader type, lighting model, and texture usage.
	  - Source/<ProjectName>: Contains C++ source files and blueprint classes defining the behavior and logic of the gameplay. 

	  2. Important Classes to Know 
	  
	  Below are some of the important classes to know when working with augmented reality apps in Unreal Engine:

	    - USceneCaptureComponent2D: Used to capture rendered viewports of the game and save them as screenshots or photos.
	    - AROcclusionMaskPrim: Allows developers to apply occlusion masks to meshes in the 3D scene to simulate partial or total obscuration caused by nearby geometry.
	    - ARLightEstimate: Provides access to estimated ambient lighting conditions over time, enabling developers to adjust the intensity and color of lights dynamically based on the current environment.
	    - ARSessionConfig: Configures properties such as feature support, default light estimation mode, and rendering parameters for the AR session.
	    - ARTrackedImage: Represents a static or moving image captured by the device's camera, tracked against the real-world environment, and registered as an AR reference point.

	    Of course, there are many more classes and functions involved in building an augmented reality app, but these should give you a good foundation for getting started.
