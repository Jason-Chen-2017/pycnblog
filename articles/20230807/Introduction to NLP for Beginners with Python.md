         Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the interactions between computers and human language. With NLP, we can analyze large amounts of text data such as social media posts or customer feedback, extract insights from it, and use those insights to make decisions or predictions. The technology behind NLP has evolved over time and currently offers several advanced methods and applications. 
         
         However, learning how to work with natural language processing techniques requires a significant amount of knowledge about computer science fundamentals, programming languages, and other fields related to software development. In this article, I will provide a brief introduction to NLP for beginners using Python, which includes basic concepts, algorithms, and code examples. This article aims to help readers get started with NLP quickly and easily by showing them practical examples of how to perform common tasks like tokenization, stemming, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling in Python. It also covers more complex topics such as building your own machine learning models to classify documents or generate summaries based on user input. 
         
         Before jumping into the technical details, let's start with some background information.

         ## Who is this article for?
         This article is intended for developers who are interested in working with natural language processing tools but may not have extensive experience with coding and computational linguistics. You should be familiar with at least one programming language like Python or Java, including the basics of object-oriented programming and file handling. Additionally, you need to know the basics of natural language grammar and terminology.
         
         ## What do I assume about my audience?
         My audience expects a level of understanding of computer science fundamentals, including variables, loops, conditionals, functions, classes, and pointers. They should also be comfortable writing simple programs in their chosen language. Ideally, they would already have some familiarity with modern natural language processing techniques like part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.

         ## Tokenization
         Tokenization refers to dividing a piece of text into individual words or phrases. The most straightforward way to tokenize text in Python is to split the string into a list of strings using whitespace characters as delimiters: 

```python
text = "Hello, world! How are you doing today?"
tokens = text.split()
print(tokens)

# Output: ['Hello,', 'world!', 'How', 'are', 'you', 'doing', 'today?']
``` 

However, there are many cases where additional preprocessing steps must be taken before tokenizing text, such as removing stopwords, converting all letters to lowercase, or lemmatizing words to their root form. These processes typically involve analyzing the structure and meaning of each word and phrase to identify its parts of speech and dependencies within the sentence. We'll talk more about these preprocessing steps later. 





## Stemming vs Lemmatization

Stemming and lemmatization are two common ways to convert words into base forms. While both methods produce similar results, there are subtle differences between the two approaches. 

Stemming reduces words to their root form, often without considering contextual cues. For example, stemming the word "running" could result in the root "run", while lemmatization would consider whether the word is used as a verb or noun and adjust accordingly. Stemmers are generally faster than lemmas because they don't require any external libraries or dictionaries.

Lemmatization involves identifying the correct base form of each word based on its part of speech and morphological characteristics. The process usually involves looking up the word in a dictionary and applying rules of morphology to determine the appropriate form. 

For example, when lemmatizing the word "washed," you might look up the word in a dictionary and see that it's derived from past participle "wash," so you return "wash." On the other hand, if you were to apply stemming instead, you'd simply remove the suffixes and endings to arrive at "was." 

In general, stemming is preferred unless there's a specific reason to prefer lemmatization, such as dealing with compound words or dealing with irregular verbs or adjectives.
