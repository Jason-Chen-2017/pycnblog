# 1.简介
  

Data science projects often involve working with large datasets that require cleaning, preparation, and feature engineering before they can be used effectively in a predictive model or analysis. Without the right steps taken to prepare data, it is likely to result in inaccurate models or overly complex analyses that waste valuable time and resources. This article aims at providing best practices and guidelines on how to clean and prepare data for data science projects by highlighting the importance of preparing meaningful features and handling missing values efficiently.
This blog post will focus specifically on data cleaning and data preparation techniques, but also covers other important aspects such as exploratory data analysis (EDA) and selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm(s). Overall, this guide provides clear and practical guidance towards ensuring efficient, accurate results from data-driven decision making processes across all phases of the data science process. 

# 2.数据清洗、准备的基本概念和术语
In order to start cleaning and preparing data for a data science project, it’s essential to understand some basic concepts and terminology related to the subject. Here are some key terms you should know:

1. Data types: There are four main data types - categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal. Categorical variables refer to discrete or nominal variables that represent categories, while numerical refers to continuous variables that have a numeric value. Textual variables are usually stored as strings within a dataset, while temporal variables contain date and/or time stamp information.

2. Missing values: Missing values occur when data is missing or incomplete. They can affect statistical measures like mean and median, which cannot be calculated using incomplete data sets. To handle missing values, there are several techniques including deleting records containing missing values, imputing them with the mean, mode, or median, or estimating their values based on nearby available data points.

3. Outliers: Outliers are extreme observations that deviate significantly from other observations in a sample. These outliers can adversely impact the accuracy of a data set and may need to be removed or handled differently depending on the context. Common methods include trimming the top and bottom percentiles, detecting outliers using different detection algorithms, or transforming the distribution into a normal shape.

4. Duplicates: Duplicates refer to multiple instances of the same record in a dataset. In many cases, duplicates can cause bias or mislead the analysis. Therefore, it's crucial to identify and remove duplicates before further processing the data. One common method involves identifying duplicate records using unique identifiers, such as email addresses or customer IDs.

5. Cardinality: Cardinality refers to the number of distinct values that a variable can take on. Variables with high cardinality could potentially provide little to no additional information beyond its intrinsic properties, leading to overfitting problems during training. It’s crucial to check the cardinalities of each variable and either reduce them if necessary or encode them using one-hot encoding or dummy variables where applicable.

6. Feature engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to capture more relevant patterns or correlations in the data. Some examples of feature engineering techniques include binning, scaling, normalization, and generating interactions between multiple variables. 

7. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): EDA involves an iterative process of summarizing, visualizing, and interpreting the data to uncover insights about its structure, relationships, and dependencies. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the underlying trends, distributions, and patterns in the data that may inform subsequent decisions around data cleaning and preparation. Tools for EDA include summary statistics, scatter plots, histograms, box plots, correlation matrices, and heat maps.

Overall, these fundamental concepts help to establish a framework for thinking about and tackling data cleaning and preparation tasks throughout the entire data science lifecycle. By being aware of these core concepts and applying them thoughtfully, we can build effective data pipelines that can support decision-making processes in a wide range of industries and applications.
