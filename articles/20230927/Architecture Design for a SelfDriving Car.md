Self-driving cars are the next big thing in transportation and will have many challenges to be solved before they can fully take over traffic. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the architecture design for self-driving car systems from various aspects such as perception, planning, control, and communication. We will also discuss some important topics related to safety, security, and reliability such as testing methods and tools, and potential risks involved with these technologies. To conclude, we hope that readers gain valuable insights into the design principles and techniques used by industry leaders who have gone through these complex tasks. 

In order to better understand the details of the system architecture, you should have knowledge about computer architectures, microcontroller programming, embedded software development, sensor integration, path planning algorithms, vehicle modeling and simulation, and artificial intelligence concepts like neural networks, reinforcement learning, decision making, optimization, and machine learning.

This article assumes a good understanding of several fundamental areas including: vehicles, sensors, controls, databases, communications protocols, mathematics, algorithms, operating systems, compilers, and distributed computing. However, even if you do not have all the necessary background knowledge, it will still be useful for those interested in developing their own self-driving cars or contributing to open source projects.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 车辆
A self-driving car (SDC) is a type of motorcycle designed to operate without human input, using advanced sensors and electronics to monitor its surroundings and detect and avoid obstacles. SDCs use various types of sensors such as camera, lidar, radar, GPS, IMU, etc. These sensors collect information about the environment around the car, including road geometry, nearby objects, pedestrians, etc., which helps the car make decisions on how to move forward, turn left or right, stop, park, reverse gears, etc. They may also incorporate additional hardware components such as cameras and LiDAR scanners, actuators, and power supplies. SDCs typically consist of four main subsystems - perception, planning, control, and communication - that work together to produce smooth, safe driving behavior while minimizing energy consumption.

An autonomous car can be classified according to three basic characteristics:

1. Intelligent: The car should exhibit high levels of intelligence, sensing capabilities, and processing speeds, able to recognize and navigate obstacles, recognize and plan routes, and anticipate unexpected events.

2. Adaptive: The car needs to be able to adapt dynamically to changing conditions, including weather, roadworks, crashes, traffic jams, lighting variations, driver behavior, and other factors.

3. Human-Like: The car must emulate the way humans drive, reacting quickly to situations and responding appropriately to user inputs.

Autonomous cars are expected to achieve several levels of automation:

1. Speed: Autonomous cars should accelerate up to 20 miles per hour at a comfortable speed of approximately 60 km/h.

2. Capacity: In addition to the traditional passenger capacity of an automobile, autonomous cars should be capable of carrying more people or goods.

3. Range: Autonomous cars should travel over 30 miles (or more) without stopping every day.

4. Reliability: Autonomous cars should perform well under varying conditions, such as night time, rainy days, snowfall, and windstorms.

5. Cost-Effectiveness: Developing affordable and efficient self-driving cars requires significant investments and new technology breakthroughs.

## 2.2 感知
Perception refers to the ability of a vehicle to gather information about its surroundings and recognize various objects. Perceptual modules include image processing, object recognition, lane detection, and radar processing. Image processing involves converting raw digital images to meaningful representations that help determine what the car is seeing, such as edges and colors. Object recognition analyzes incoming frames to identify specific objects, such as pedestrians, bicycles, cars, signs, and traffic lights. Lane detection uses computer vision techniques to locate and track lanes in the scene. Radar processing extracts information about objects located far away from the car's position, allowing the car to estimate its distance, velocity, and direction of motion based on signals received via radio waves. 

## 2.3 规划
Planning refers to the process of determining optimal trajectories for different scenarios and predicting future outcomes. Planning module includes trajectory generation, prediction, tracking, obstacle avoidance, collision avoidance, and decision making. Trajectory generation considers things like fuel availability, road conditions, and maneuverability to generate feasible and safe paths for the car. Prediction estimates future states of the world, enabling the car to anticipate changes in the road layout, traffic density, and other factors. Tracking ensures that the car stays in sync with the movement of surrounding vehicles, ensuring a continuous flow of traffic throughout the city. Obstacle avoidance addresses any obstacles in the route by generating alternative paths that avoid them. Collision avoidance ensures that the car avoids accidental collisions with moving vehicles or pedestrians. Decision making determines which action to take in each scenario, taking into account constraints like limited battery life, available resources, and time budget.

## 2.4 控制
Control is the part of the vehicle that takes actions based on the current state of the system and its interactions with the external environment. Control modules include motion planning, longitudinal control, lateral control, hazard management, and braking management. Motion planning determines the optimal sequences of movements required to reach a target point, accounting for possible obstacles along the way. Longitudinal control generates throttle, brake, and steering commands that control the acceleration, deceleration, and turning rate of the car. Lateral control adjusts the heading angle of the car so that it maintains proper alignment with the road and turns smoothly when necessary. Hazard management prepares for and manages dangerous situations like sudden brakes or sharp turns by slowing down or stopping the car as soon as possible. Braking management reduces the amount of brake applied to prevent damage to the car's frame or wheels.

## 2.5 通信
Communication refers to the capability of a vehicle to communicate with other devices, users, and systems to exchange information and command it to execute certain actions. Communication modules include wireless communication, controller communication, and telemetry collection. Wireless communication enables the car to send and receive messages with other devices within range, either directly or indirectly through cellular networks or Wi-Fi access points. Controller communication provides a secure interface between the car's onboard processors and other devices, providing real-time feedback and updates during operations. Telemetry collection gathers metrics about the performance of the vehicle, including speed, altitude, and temperature, and transmits these to a centralized database where they can be analyzed and used for decision-making purposes.

## 2.6 安全性、可靠性与实用工具
Safety, security, and reliability are essential concerns for self-driving cars because they pose risk to human drivers and property. To ensure safe operation, the following measures can be taken:

1. Competitive safety standards: Competing companies are responsible for conducting safety inspections regularly to ensure compliance with government regulations. It is important to adhere to established laws and ethical principles to minimize risk and ensure trustworthiness of the customer.

2. Advanced algorithms and models: Algorithms and models used in self-driving cars are continually evolving, requiring rigorous testing and evaluation to ensure robustness and accuracy.

3. Integrated hardware and software: Devices and software that form the core of the self-driving car need to be integrated, tested, and updated regularly to meet ever-changing requirements.

4. Continuous monitoring and maintenance: Overnight crashes and damage could cause major financial losses, and periodic checks are critical to maintain competitive advantage.

5. Emergency response teams: Cars with comparable features are often deployed in emergency scenarios, necessitating prompt and accurate response from specialized personnel.

To improve product quality, production processes can be optimized and automated using modern tools and methodologies. Some common tools used in self-driving car development include unit testing, code reviews, static analysis, regression testing, and fuzzing. A test-driven development approach is recommended because it produces higher-quality code faster and reveals issues earlier in the development cycle.

# 3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤及数学公式讲解
## 3.1 传感器融合
基于相机、激光雷达、惯性测量单元(IMU)等传感器的数据是用来判断车辆的状态和环境信息，然后结合计算机视觉、机器学习、强化学习等领域的知识，通过分析这些数据，提取有价值的信息，比如当前环境的障碍物距离和方位，目标物体的位置和方向等。融合不同类型的传感器数据，可以增加车辆识别障碍物、识别车道线、对齐轨迹、识别行人等功能，有效提升自动驾驶系统的能力。

如何融合？
不同类型的传感器之间存在着不同的采集效率，采样频率和信号噪声，需要根据实际情况进行调整。假设有N个传感器，按照一定规则将其组合成图像或特征，然后输入到机器学习模型中进行训练，最后再与其它传感器的输出混合作为最终的决策依据。

## 3.2 路径规划
路径规划是指在规划车辆行进路径时，根据目标和环境状况以及限制条件，计算出具有最优效果的路径。主要有两种方法：第一种方法是基于全局搜索的方法，它通过枚举所有可能的路径并选择其中最优的一条作为最终的路径；第二种方法是基于局部搜索的方法，它通过在局部区域内计算出一条更优的路径。目前比较流行的路径规划算法包括高德地图中的骑行导航引擎AmapNav，百度地图中的百度无人驾驶规划模块LanePlanner以及美国国家自然科学基金委员会（NSF）开发的Carla平台的自动驾驶系统模块。

路径规划中的关键问题是如何找到一条满足要求的路径，即从初始点到目的点，同时避免所有的障碍物，且满足所有环境条件。

### 3.2.1 Dijkstra算法
Dijkstra算法是一个贪心算法，它以起始节点s为中心，沿着最短距离向外扩展，直到扩展至最终目标点为止，找到一条到目标点的最短路径。该算法采用优先级队列实现，其基本思想是以起始节点为中心，维护一个优先级队列Q，Q中存储了所有尚未确定路径长度的节点，每个元素都有一个key值表示节点到起始节点的估计路径长度，另有一个value值表示节点本身。每当新元素进入队列时，它就被放入队尾。每次从队列中取出队首元素时，则取出了具有最小key值的元素，如果这个元素已经是终点，那么就可以结束算法；否则，便对该元素的所有邻居进行松弛操作，更新它们的key值，并将其放回队列中。这样重复下去，直到最终目标点被取出或者队列为空。

```
function dijkstra_search(G, s):
    dist[s] = 0 # initialize distance table
    Q = priorityQueue() # initialize priority queue
    enqueue(Q, s, dist[s])

    while not empty(Q):
        u = dequeue_min(Q)

        if u == t:
            return dist[t]

        for v in neighbors(u):
            alt = dist[u] + length(u, v)

            if alt < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = alt
                update(Q, v, alt)
    
    return "no path found" 
```

### 3.2.2 A*算法
A*算法也是一个贪心算法，它也是通过广度优先搜索的方式来寻找一条到目标点的最短路径。A*算法在Dijkstra算法的基础上引入启发式函数，该函数用来评估某个节点到起始节点的真实距离，而不仅仅是预估的距离。通常情况下，启发式函数就是一种启发式策略，如估计代价或路径长度。

假设启发式函数h(n)，表示从起始节点s到n的估计距离，h(n)=0表示到起始节点的距离为0，假设从n出发经过a1,a2,...ak能够到达节点m，那么n到m的实际距离等于h(m)+g(n,a1)+g(n,a2)+...+g(n,ak)，其中gk(n,ai)表示从n到ai的实际距离。于是，A*算法的流程如下：

1. 初始化起始节点s，设置初始距离值f=h(s)=0
2. 从初始节点s开始，加入open表，并初始化f(s)=h(s)
3. 在open表中循环查找f值最小的节点，也就是距离目标最近的一个节点u，并将其加入close表
4. 检查u的邻居节点v，计算v的f值，如果v在close表中，那么跳过，否则，计算v的g值等于从u到v的实际距离加上u到初始节点的距离，计算v的h值等于从v到目标节点的估计距离
5. 如果v没有在open表中，那么把它加入open表，并将f(v)=h(v)+g(v)，否则，如果v已经在open表中，那么比较f(v)和f(u)+h(v)，如果后者小于前者，那么更新v的f值等于前者
6. 重复第三步到第五步，直到找到目标节点为止，或者open表为空，此时返回“无法到达目标”

```
function astar_search(G, s, t):
    dist[s] = 0 
    pred[s] = None  
    heuristc[s] = h(s)
    f[s] = h(s)
    P = priorityQueue() # initialize priority queue

    enqueue(P, s, f[s])

    while not empty(P):
        u = dequeue_min(P)

        if u == t: 
            return reconstruct_path(pred, u)

        foreach v in neighbors(u):
            alt = dist[u] + length(u, v)
            if alt < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = alt 
                pred[v] = u
                heuristic[v] = h(v)
                f[v] = alt + heuristic[v]

                if v not in P:
                    enqueue(P, v, f[v])
  
    return "no path found" 

function reconstruct_path(pred, t):
    path = []
    while t!= None:
        path.append(t) 
        t = pred[t]
    path.reverse()
    return path 
```

## 3.3 动态规划
动态规划（Dynamic Programming，DP）是指利用子问题的解来计算问题的一个解，属于回溯法类别。它的特点是只保留有关当前状态的一组解，因此其空间复杂度是$O(n^2)$，适用于求解多项式时间内的问题。

## 3.4 深度学习

深度学习，Deep Learning，简称DL，是一种深层次的神经网络学习方法，由多层连接的神经元组成。深度学习利用多层模型建立多个隐藏层，然后训练每个隐藏层的参数，使得模型能够从输入数据中抽象出抽象特征，从而解决分类、聚类、回归、关联等任务。它的好处在于，它可以使用高度非线性的结构处理复杂的函数，并且不需要手工设计特征函数，可以直接从数据中学习特征。
