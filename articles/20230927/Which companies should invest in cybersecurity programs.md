# 1.简介
  

# Cybersecurity is the protection of computer systems and networks from unauthorized access or attacks by hackers, malicious software, or intrusions that target them. To help organizations stay secure, governments and businesses have created various programs to promote security awareness, education, training, policies, standards, and best practices. These programs can be categorized into three main types:

1) Essential cybersecurity programs: These include basic security controls like firewalls, antivirus, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS), and patch management. They are essential for keeping data safe and preventing cyberattacks.

2) Enhanced cybersecurity programs: These programs provide additional security capabilities such as cloud computing services, advanced threat intelligence, and risk management tools. Their goal is to enhance overall company security posture while reducing the chances of breaches and fraudulent activities. 

3) Disruptive cybersecurity programs: These focus on transforming industries through digitization, IoT devices, and blockchain technologies. These new technologies require a shift in thinking about cybersecurity as they create new vulnerabilities and threats that need to be addressed. 

To understand which companies are most likely to invest in these programs, we first need to explore some fundamental concepts related to cybersecurity. Specifically, let’s review how organizations work together to protect their critical infrastructure against cyberthreats.

# 2.Core Concepts and Terminology
## What is Cyber Security?
Cybersecurity refers to the security measures adopted within an organization to protect its digital assets from potential threats. It includes two components – technical and procedural. Technical component involves maintaining and updating all digital systems to keep them up-to-date with current security requirements and protocols. Procedural component involves implementing policies, procedures, and practices to manage risks across an organization. A core concept behind cybersecurity is defense in depth, where multiple layers of security measures are implemented to prevent and detect attacks. In other words, it requires securing different aspects of an organization separately but working together to achieve an end-to-end approach towards safety.

The following are some key terms used throughout the article:

1) Information Technology (IT): This field covers a range of information processing technology products, including computers, mobile phones, tablets, servers, and network infrastructure.

2) Risk Assessment: This process involves identifying the likelihood and impact of possible threats to an organization. Risk assessment plays a significant role in managing cybersecurity risks and making effective decisions regarding mitigation strategies.

3) Threat Modeling: Threat modeling involves analyzing the attack surface of an organization and developing a model to identify areas of weaknesses. The purpose of this analysis is to enable organizations to take steps towards securing themselves against potential threats.

4) Zero Trust Network: A zero trust network assumes that no one has any trusted relationship or privilege beyond what is explicitly allowed. Every user and device needs to be authenticated before accessing resources, and users must rely on only those mechanisms that are designed to support their goals and functions. Zero Trust Network uses identity and access management (IAM) techniques to enforce least privileges and strong authentication mechanisms that limit the risk of unauthorized access.

5) Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): An SDLC ensures that developers follow security-related best practices during development to avoid common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and sensitive data exposure. It also defines the processes involved in testing and deployment to ensure that applications are securely delivered to production environments.

## How Does IT Work?
Information Technology (IT) relies heavily on networking hardware and software. Most modern business operations depend on fast, reliable connectivity between multiple IT systems. Communication over this network happens via communication protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTPS, SSH, etc., which make use of encryption algorithms to maintain confidentiality and integrity of data being exchanged. However, today's cybercriminals increasingly abuse this capability to exploit weaknesses in enterprise networks.

A core principle of cybersecurity is ensuring that there is always a high level of confidence in the system's ability to protect itself against potentially hostile intruders. One way to do this is by employing several techniques, known as security assurance methodologies. These methods cover a wide range of approaches, including physical security measures, application security, web application security, and network security. Each technique provides unique benefits and trade-offs depending on the context and scale of the operation.
