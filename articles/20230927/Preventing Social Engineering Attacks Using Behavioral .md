Social engineering attacks have been a serious threat to the security of computer systems and information assets in recent years due to their ease of use, low cost, and convenient availability for attackers. To prevent these attacks, various techniques have been developed such as input validation, two-factor authentication, and detecting anomalous behavior patterns. However, biometric-based detection methods offer much more advanced protection against social engineering attacks compared with other traditional techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protect against social engineering attacks using behavioral biometrics. We present a new biometric called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) which captures individuals' neurological symptoms and behaviors. By analyzing different temporal and spatial patterns of ASD data over multiple sessions, we can identify and recognize individuals who may be involved in unauthorized activities or manipulations. Our proposed method is fully automated and efficient, requiring only a few simple steps from the attacker's end. This system can help organizations to enhance their cybersecurity posture by providing real-time monitoring capabilities during user interactions on enterprise networks.

## 2.1 Biometrics
Biometrics refers to technologies that capture physical characteristics or behavior of a person through sensors such as fingerprints, retina scans, heart rate monitors, etc. The captured information can then be used to authenticate a user or perform identity verification tasks. Popular biometric authentication systems include face recognition, voiceprints, iris scans, and palmprints. These systems are widely used in various applications such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and security. 

## 2.2 Behavioral Biometrics
Behavioral biometrics refer to non-invasive systems that capture individual psychological traits such as mood, facial expressions, body movements, eye blink frequency, handwriting style, speech patterns, etc., and analyze them over time to generate unique signatures. Behavioral biometrics can also incorporate contextual information such as location, time of day, surroundings, environmental conditions, or personal history. Examples of behavioral biometrics include PDA (personality disorder assessment), SEDS (sleep efficiency detector), EMG (electromyography), and ASIR (attention span indicator).

## 2.3 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe learning impairment characterized by impaired communication, social interaction skills, attention deficit hyperactivity, delayed word comprehension, and depression-like symptoms. It affects approximately one in every five children born with significant language delay, has widespread impact throughout the adult life course, and is often associated with higher risk for developing later-life diseases. Many people suffer from autism spectrum disorder but it remains underreported and untreated. Therefore, identifying and recognizing those at high risk for acquiring ASD could greatly improve early intervention programs and reduce stigma around mental health issues. In our work, we focus on capturing and analyzing the individual psychological features that contribute towards ASD diagnosis. We call this feature set “Autistic Features”.

Our proposed solution involves three main components:

1. **Data Collection:** Collecting behavioral biometric data from users' devices continuously over long periods of time enables us to track changes in their behavior over time. We collect raw sensor data including accelerometer, gyroscope, electroencephalogram (EEG), respiration rates, heart rate variability (HRV), electrooculography (EOG), thalamic activity, pupil dilation, grip strength, visual perception, touch sensitivity, and audio loudness. 

2. **Pattern Recognition and Clustering:** Once we have collected data over time, we need to extract meaningful patterns from the data. For instance, we want to extract patterns related to movement or eye contact. Then, we apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means and DBSCAN to group similar patterns together into clusters. Each cluster represents a group of users who exhibit similar behavioral patterns.

3. **User Profiling:** Once we have identified groups of users based on their behavioral patterns, we need to understand what makes each group unique. To do this, we build a database of known profiles for each type of group, where each profile contains common features that define each group, such as age, gender, geographic location, education level, occupation, hobbies, interests, and past traumatic events. We compare incoming data points to these predefined profiles to identify unknown groups of users whose behavior does not match any existing profile. This process helps us quickly and accurately identify unknown groups without having to manually examine all the data again.

In summary, our proposed algorithm uses data from several sources to create behavioral models of individuals who demonstrate certain types of autism spectrum disorder. It identifies groups of individuals who share similar patterns of behavior and compares them to known profiles to categorize unknown individuals into appropriate categories. Since this technique relies solely on behavioral biometrics, it should provide effective and scalable protection against social engineering attacks even in situations where traditional security measures fail.
