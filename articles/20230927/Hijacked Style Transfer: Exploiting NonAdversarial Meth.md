Style transfer is a popular technique in image processing that allows us to transform an image from one style into another. It has been widely used in computer vision applications such as photo editing and artistic stylization. In this article, we focus on the use of non-adversarial methods for attacking computer vision systems. Specifically, we propose Hijacked Style Transfer (HST), which exploits multiple sources of adversarial perturbations during training to obtain better results than conventional techniques. To verify our claim, we conduct extensive experiments using different attacks against state-of-the-art models, including SRGAN, VGG-based perceptual losses, and CycleGAN. Finally, we show that hijacking certain layers of the network can further improve the performance by reducing the distortion caused by the input noise. This research paper addresses three important challenges associated with adversarial attacks in computer vision: 

1) Adversarial examples can be easily generated without understanding their underlying mechanism. We demonstrate how carefully designed non-adversarial constraints can significantly reduce the effectiveness of existing attack methods.

2) Adversarial examples can have diverse impacts on the system’s robustness. We provide insights into what makes each layer effective or not effective in achieving desired transformations.

3) The ability to defend against adversarial attacks relies heavily on model architecture design. Our study shows that some critical features of deep neural networks are vulnerable to various forms of attacks, and new architectures can prevent these attacks even when trained using standard loss functions. 

We believe that this work provides new insights into adversarial attacks in computer vision and offers practical solutions to combat them. Therefore, it will benefit both researchers and developers in the field of machine learning security and safety. At present, there is little knowledge about the relationship between adversarial attacks and software development best practices. This gap needs to be addressed in order to promote responsible AI development.

Style transfer refers to the process of transforming an image from one style into another. It has been widely used in computer vision applications such as photo editing and artistic stylization. Recently, several approaches have emerged to generate adversarial examples based on natural images. One common approach is the FGSM method, which generates small adversarial perturbations that fool classifiers. However, it is challenging to control the strength of the perturbation and avoid generating examples that can fool human evaluators.

One way to overcome this challenge is to explore other types of attacks that cannot be easily detected by human evaluators. Another option is to employ more sophisticated optimization algorithms to modify the input image to produce visually imperceptible changes. For example, recent works have proposed image colorization algorithms that aim at making digital images look realistic while preserving the original content. However, these methods do not explicitly address the issue of generating adversarial examples.

In this article, we propose Hijacked Style Transfer (HST), which exploits multiple sources of adversarial perturbations during training to obtain better results than conventional techniques. During training, instead of optimizing for just the minimum cost function value, we simultaneously optimize for multiple objective values that include the usual reconstruction error term and additional terms obtained through various adversarial perturbations. By modifying the inputs to inject multiple attack vectors, we hope to attain better accuracy without being able to detect the individual effects of different attacks. To achieve this goal, we need to carefully design non-adversarial constraints that ensure good tradeoffs between reconstruction error and adversarial penalty terms.

Another promising direction for improving adversarial robustness is to take advantage of attention mechanisms in convolutional neural networks (CNN). Attention mechanisms allow CNNs to focus on particular parts of the input space to make better predictions. These attention maps can provide valuable information about the object category and background behind an image. Therefore, incorporating the attention maps into the loss function may lead to improved performance.

A third contribution of this work is providing insights into what makes each layer effective or not effective in achieving desired transformations. A deeper understanding of these features can help identify potential weaknesses in the system and guide future improvements. Moreover, identifying specific areas of the system where adversarial attacks can cause harm could enable us to develop targeted defense strategies that adaptively counteract such threats.

Finally, we prove that certain key features of deep neural networks, particularly residual connections and batch normalization, are highly susceptible to various types of adversarial attacks. This suggests that it may be possible to enhance the robustness of modern CNNs by adjusting their architecture or modifying their regularization techniques.
