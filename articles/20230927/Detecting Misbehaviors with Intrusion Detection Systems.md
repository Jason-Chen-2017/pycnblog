Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have become an essential component of enterprise network security. However, they are still facing several challenges in dealing with the increasing number of attacks targeting large-scale networks. One of them is misbehavior detection: detecting unusual behavior patterns that indicate malicious or suspicious activities on a network. In this paper, we propose a new approach to identify misbehaviors using intrusion detection system (IDS), specifically, deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs can automatically extract features from input data without being explicitly trained for each type of attack, making it more scalable than traditional machine learning methods. We also design a novel algorithm to classify attack types based on the extracted features. The proposed method is evaluated through extensive experiments using real-world datasets obtained from IDS logs and other sources. Our results show that our approach achieves high accuracy for identifying different attack types, especially those requiring manual intervention. Furthermore, compared to state-of-the-art techniques, our method outperforms them by a significant margin. Overall, this work demonstrates how to use DNNs as a powerful feature extractor for anomaly detection in intrusion detection systems.

## 2.1 基于学习的方法
Anomaly detection refers to the identification of abnormal events that deviate significantly from normal ones. Traditional approaches such as statistical analysis usually require labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Moreover, these methods typically assume a linear relationship between input variables and output labels, which may not always hold in practice.

The concept of anomaly detection has been around for a long time. Early works focused on pattern recognition tasks such as image classification where the goal was to predict the class label of a given sample based only on its features. Later, researchers moved towards generalization problems, where an algorithm must be able to recognize rare instances that were not seen during training.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in applying deep neural networks (DNNs) to anomaly detection. They offer advantages over traditional machine learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVMs) because of their ability to capture complex relationships between input and output variables. Compared to traditional SVMs, DNNs have proven to perform well in many applications including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc., and are becoming increasingly popular due to their high accuracy, flexibility, and scalability. 

## 2.2 IDS概述
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are software tools used to monitor computer networks for potential threats. They analyze network traffic, detect and alert on potentially harmful activity such as hacking attempts, brute force attacks, malware distribution, etc. There are various ways to implement IDS, such as hardware devices, operating systems, and application-level detectors. A centralized or distributed architecture is common in most cases. 

While most IDS systems rely on signature-based rules and heuristics to filter incoming packets, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled DNN-based solutions. These techniques leverage advanced deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn behaviors of typical attacks and create a model that maps inputs to outputs. This makes DNN-based IDS very effective at detecting unknown or unexpected activities. 

## 2.3 DNNs
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are artificial neural networks composed of multiple layers of connected nodes. Each layer represents a transformation applied to the previous one, resulting in a higher dimensional representation of the input data. The final output layer combines all the transformations into a single value representing the predicted outcome of the network.

DNNs are commonly used for a wide range of applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and forecasting. They are highly flexible models that can handle high dimensional input data and can capture non-linear relationships between input and output variables. Despite their popularity, however, DNNs still face some limitations when it comes to anomaly detection.

One problem is the vanishing gradient problem. When backpropagating gradients through the network, small errors cause neurons to spike repeatedly until reaching saturation. This leads to slow convergence of weights and poor performance. Another issue is the curse of dimensionality. As the size of the input increases, the complexity and representational power of the network grows exponentially, leading to computational bottlenecks. To address these issues, modern DNNs adopt techniques such as dropout regularization and batch normalization.

## 2.4 定义
Let $X \in R^{m\times n}$ denote the input matrix containing $n$ samples of length $m$. Let $\theta$ denote the parameters of the DNN consisting of $L$ hidden layers. For simplicity, let $f_l(\cdot)$ denote the activation function used in the $l$-th hidden layer, and let $\sigma$ denote the sigmoid function. Specifically, we define the DNN with input matrix $X$ and parameter matrix $\Theta = \{W^{(1)}, W^{(2)},..., W^{(L)}\}$, where $W^{(l)} \in R^{n_{l}\times n_{l-1}}$ denotes the weight matrix of the $l$-th hidden layer, and $b^{(l)} \in R^{n_{l}}\}$ denotes the bias vector of the $l$-th hidden layer. Then, the output of the DNN is computed as follows:

$$Z^{(L)}=g(XW^{(L)}+b^{(L)})=\sigma(XW^{(L)}+b^{(L)}) $$

for $l=1,\cdots,L$, and

$$y=\text{softmax}(Z)=\frac{\exp(Z_k)}{\sum_{i=1}^K\exp(Z_i)} $$

where $K$ is the number of classes. Here, softmax computes the probability distribution of the $K$ possible classes, given the output of the last layer of the DNN. Finally, we consider two subsets of the input dataset, one called the "training set" and the other called the "test set".

We will use the notation $(x, y)$ to refer to a pair of an input sample $x$ and its corresponding target variable $y$. We will use uppercase letters to denote matrices and lowercase letters to denote vectors. Thus, $(X, Y)$ represents the entire dataset containing both inputs and targets.

To train the DNN, we minimize the following loss function:

$$J(\Theta)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{(x,y)\in\mathcal{D}}-\log\left(\hat{p}_{\Theta}(y|x)\right) $$

where $N$ is the total number of training examples, $\mathcal{D}$ represents the training set, and $\hat{p}_{\Theta}(y|x)$ is the estimated conditional probability of the true class $y$ given the input sample $x$, calculated as follows:

$$\hat{p}_{\Theta}(y|x)=\frac{\exp(z_y)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\exp(z_k)} $$

where $z_y$ is the logit output of the network for the $y$-th class after computing $Z=g(XW^{(L)}+b^{(L)})$.
