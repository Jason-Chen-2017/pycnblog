Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can transfer expert knowledge to the agent and learn to imitate it for solving new tasks in different environments with minimal training data. It uses a generative model of the environment called an adversary network to generate trajectories that are likely to be experienced by the expert during training. The policy learnt by GAIL is then fine-tuned on these generated data points while still maintaining its ability to solve the original task and domain.
In this work, we propose two extensions of GAIL to enable transferring knowledge across domains: first, we use multiple generators instead of one generator to capture the diversity among training tasks and thus improve generalization; secondly, we incorporate the latent space features learned from each generator into the actor’s decision making process to encourage diverse exploration as well as help the agent explore more efficiently within the target domain. We test our proposed methods on several continuous control tasks involving multiple agents in various environments. Our results show significant improvements over conventional imitation learning algorithms including GAIL and BCQ. In particular, they achieve better sample efficiency than BCQ when there is limited training data available, and obtain competitive performance even without any explicit reward function or memory replay buffer.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques, we compare them against other state-of-the-art imitation learning approaches such as behavior cloning (BC), policy distillation (PD), and MPC (model predictive control). We also conduct ablation studies to understand their impact on sample efficiency, robustness, and transferability across tasks. Finally, we demonstrate how our proposed techniques can benefit real-world applications by applying them to autonomous vehicles in dynamic traffic environments. Our extensive experiments and analysis provide strong empirical evidence that demonstrates the merits of GAIL as a powerful approach for transfering expert knowledge across domains. Moreover, our novel ideas and analyses extend GAIL to enhance its transferability capabilities beyond the classical imitation learning problem and enable real-world applications. Overall, our contributions offer significant advantages in terms of sample efficiency, transferability, and scalability compared to existing methods.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved tremendous success recently due to its versatility, flexibility, and stability in handling complex tasks. However, training DRL agents requires a large amount of high-dimensional observations and actions, which makes it difficult to train policies for new tasks quickly without substantial retraining datasets. This is where expert demonstrations come in handy, providing a rich set of experience tuples that represent a good starting point for learning the dynamics of the new task. 

One popular way to leverage such demonstrations is through inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), which trains a supervised learning algorithm to estimate the optimal reward function for a given set of expert demonstrations. Despite its successes, IRL suffers from low sample complexity, high computational cost, and lack of adaptivity towards changes in the environment or the skills of the expert. To address these issues, many recent works have explored generative models of the environment, such as VAE (variational autoencoder), GAN (generative adversarial networks), and RNN (recurrent neural networks), as potential alternatives to traditional IRL approaches. These models can automatically extract relevant features from raw observation sequences and allow us to directly model the probability distribution of future states given past observations and actions. Although promising, these models suffer from the curse of dimensionality, requiring significant amounts of labeled training data.

Alternatively, GAIL (generative adversarial imitation learning) was introduced as an alternative method for imitation learning. It simultaneously learns a policy network (actor) and a value function (critic) by playing a competition between an agent (in our case, the trained agent) and an adversary (generator). The goal of the generator is to produce examples of feasible trajectory segments, representing the expert’s strategy in a particular task. During training, the critic evaluates the quality of the generated samples and provides feedback to the actor via stochastic gradient ascent. By optimizing the objective function that maximizes the expected reward under the policy of the agent, the generator learns to generate more accurate examples of what the agent should do based on observed human demonstrations. Once the generator achieves convergence, we can freeze the generator weights and treat it as an oracle, sampling trajectories from the same prior distribution, conditioned only on current inputs.

However, GAIL only transfers expert knowledge to the agent within the same task and does not take advantage of external information such as commonalities or differences between tasks. To handle multi-domain problems where the agent may need to switch contexts rapidly, we need additional mechanisms that can bridge the gap between the source domain (where the expert demonstrations were collected) and the destination domain (where the agent needs to operate). One approach to address this issue is to introduce a hierarchical structure where the agent maintains a hierarchy of sub-policies, each responsible for operating within a specific subdomain. A top-level policy selects which subdomain to operate within at every step based on internal and external factors, and feeds the appropriate sub-policy's output back to the overall policy for execution. Another approach is to use multiple generators that interact with each other to learn a shared representation of both the environment and the expert’s demonstrations. While effective, multi-generator solutions require careful design of the generator architectures and hyperparameters to optimize their mutual contributions to the final policy.

Our key insight is that while standard imitation learning algorithms typically assume that the expert follows a fixed set of strategies, scenarios, or objectives, humans often adopt diverse strategies based on situational context, cognitive abilities, and personal preferences. As a result, experts may rely on complementary skills and knowledge that are not always present in the demonstrations provided. Therefore, we propose to expand GAIL with three main components:

1. Multiple Generators: Instead of relying on a single generator that generates all possible demonstrations for a given task, we propose to employ multiple generators to learn a distinct set of representations for different parts of the task. Each generator will focus solely on generating samples related to a certain aspect of the task, allowing the agent to focus on the most critical part while exploring additional possibilities from others.

2. Latent Space Features: Another important feature of GAIL is that it captures the underlying dynamics of the environment and learns a structured representation of the world. Our proposal involves integrating the latent space features learned from each individual generator into the actor’s decision making process. Specifically, we modify the policy loss function to penalize deviations in the predicted action relative to the corresponding latent space features inferred from the input image. Additionally, we use intrinsic rewards to encourage the agent to explore more efficient actions within the target domain.

3. Context Switching Mechanism: Since expert knowledge may not apply universally across tasks or domains, we need to develop a mechanism that allows the agent to dynamically select which demo generator(s) to utilize based on its situational context. This could involve utilizing perceptual and cognitive signals from visual sensors, speech recognition, language understanding, and reasoning about the objects and events in the environment.

We believe that our proposed modifications to GAIL will lead to improved sample efficiency, increased transferability across tasks, enhanced robustness, and enormous benefits for real-world applications, particularly those involved in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving.
