Question answering (QA) is one of the most popular applications in natural language processing today and has been a research topic for years. With the advent of artificial intelligence, we are able to automatically generate question-answer pairs using machines. However, generating high-quality QA pairs requires significant amounts of data and resources. This paper proposes an approach to extract question-answer pairs from unstructured text documents such as news articles, blogs, and customer feedback. The proposed method first applies various preprocessing techniques on raw texts to prepare them for entity recognition. It then constructs a knowledge base that contains relevant entities and their corresponding descriptions. Next, it uses graph based algorithms to extract the best matching questions and answers for each paragraph or sentence. Finally, the generated question-answer pairs can be used by search engines to provide accurate and informative results.

The existing approaches for extracting question-answer pairs from document collections mainly rely on keyword searching techniques which are known to fail to capture the contextual meaning of sentences. Moreover, they do not consider variations in terms like negation, tense, modality, and pragmatic words. Hence, there is a need to develop more effective ways of extracting question-answer pairs that can leverage linguistic cues within the sentences. One way of achieving this goal is through semantic analysis which involves identifying coherent relationships between subject, predicate, and object phrases. In order to overcome the limitations associated with traditional machine learning methods, statistical models have also been developed. These models often require large volumes of labeled data and complex feature engineering techniques. Another important aspect to keep in mind is the availability of annotated datasets. Annotating new datasets manually or semi-automatically may be expensive and time consuming. Therefore, developing automated annotation tools would greatly benefit the process of generating high-quality QA pairs.

Our system consists of four main modules - Text Preprocessing, Entity Extraction, Pattern Recognition, and User Interface. The user interface displays the extracted question-answer pairs to the users after successful pattern generation.

1. **Text Preprocessing**: We preprocess the input documents before any further processing steps. Common pre-processing tasks include removing stopwords, punctuation marks, stemming, and tokenizing.
2. **Entity Extraction**: After preprocessing the text, we use named entity recognition systems to identify all unique entities present in the text. Named entity recognition is particularly useful for creating a knowledge base since it allows us to assign types to different entities and describe their properties in detail. 
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Once the entities are identified, we construct a graph representation of the text where nodes represent individual entities and edges connect them according to their syntactic role. We use graph-based algorithms to discover patterns within the text that relate multiple entities together. For example, we can find out which entities occur together frequently enough to form a question-answer pair. 
4. **User Interface**: The final output displayed to the user includes both the original text and the extracted question-answer pairs along with their confidence scores. The user can click on a particular pair to get additional details about the reasoning behind its selection.

We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets - Reuters-21578 dataset and StackExchange-Web Search Dataset. Both these datasets contain millions of web pages with different topics, styles, and languages. Our evaluation measures include precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average error (MAE). Reuters-21578 dataset is a collection of 21,578 news articles categorized into six categories, while StackExchange-Web Search Dataset is a collection of Web search logs collected from Bing. To ensure fair comparison across models, we use similar pre-processing techniques and test the model’s performance under identical conditions. Additionally, we report the amount of memory required to run our model on a given hardware configuration.
