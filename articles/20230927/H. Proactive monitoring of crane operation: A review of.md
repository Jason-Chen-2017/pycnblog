>Proactive monitoring refers to the automated collection of data from various sources with the intention of identifying anomalies or abnormal behaviors that may be indicative of failures or other disruptions within a system. In crane operations, proactive monitoring is increasingly important as it allows engineers to identify potential problems before they cause significant damages, thus reducing downtime costs and improving customer satisfaction. However, existing literatures on proactive monitoring in cranes are lacking in depth and understanding. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge in proactive monitoring of crane systems and highlight critical gaps that require further investigation. The work will also present a roadmap for future research directions in the area of proactive monitoring of crane operations. 

This article first introduces proactive monitoring in crane operations, then reviews several key areas such as sensor design, data acquisition techniques, anomaly detection algorithms, and analysis approaches. It concludes by highlighting critical gaps in current literature that need to be addressed to develop more effective methods for detecting anomalous behavior and maintaining crane reliability over time. Finally, we discuss future directions for research in proactive monitoring of crane operations.

Crane operations are complex, dynamic, and safety-critical processes requiring highly specialized skills. As cranes carry out critical loads at high speeds, accidents can occur frequently. Therefore, it is essential to monitor crane operation to detect anomalous behavior and maintain crane reliability over time. Proactive monitoring involves the use of sensors to collect data about operational conditions at real-time. Sensors can be installed at different locations throughout the crane to capture a variety of signals including vibrations, temperature variations, power consumption, wind velocity, etc. Once data has been collected, an algorithm can analyze the data to detect anomalies or changes in performance patterns. Three common types of anomaly detection algorithms include pattern recognition, statistical methods, and machine learning. Approaches used to evaluate performance of anomaly detection algorithms include precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.

The literature reviewed here focuses on two main areas of proactive monitoring in cranes: (i) pre-flight checks using motion sensing technology, and (ii) post-flight condition monitoring based on telemetry data. In the first case, researchers have developed algorithms to analyze motion data generated during the course of the flight to identify any deviations or errors that could indicate a problem with the crane's maneuverability. Pre-flight anomaly detection algorithms typically rely on motion sensing hardware and software to capture accelerometers and gyroscopes' outputs. For example, the Wang et al.(2017) proposed an algorithm using support vector machines (SVMs) to classify crane movements into normal vs. abnormal classes based on feature extraction techniques like FFT features extracted from accelerometer data. Similarly, the Zhang et al.(2019) proposed a model to recognize anomalies in raw images obtained through video surveillance cameras. While these models achieved good accuracy, they were limited by motion sensing latency which prevented them from identifying anomalous behaviors quickly enough to prevent crashes. In contrast, newer technologies like optical flow and deep neural networks offer promising solutions to reduce latency while still achieving accurate results.

In the second area of post-flight condition monitoring, researchers have focused on analyzing sensor data generated after each flight to assess the health of the crane's components. Telemetry data usually includes information about the state of engines, propellers, hydraulics, avionics, navigation system, etc. Researchers have proposed various machine learning algorithms to predict the remaining lifetime of each component based on historical data. One popular approach is to use long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures with Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) for probabilistic predictions. Another approach uses neural networks to learn correlations between measured variables and component failures to improve prediction accuracy. Despite recent advances in machine learning algorithms, traditional statistical methods like clustering and correlation cannot accurately predict component failure rates due to complex non-linear relationships between factors such as ambient air temperature, turbulence levels, vibration intensities, and GPS signal strength. To address this gap, new computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can be coupled with data analytics tools to generate physical insights and understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for component failures.

Overall, the literature reviewed provides an up-to-date picture of the development landscape in proactive monitoring of crane operation and identifies critical gaps that need to be filled. Future research directions should focus on developing advanced algorithms and efficient processing techniques to effectively handle large volumes of sensor data and enable quick response times even in extreme conditions where delays can become minutes or hours. Ultimately, proactive monitoring is vital in ensuring mission success and safeguard against unforeseen incidents.
