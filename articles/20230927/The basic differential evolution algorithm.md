# 1.简介
  


Differential Evolution (DE) is a stochastic optimization method that belongs to the family of genetic algorithms and is based on the concept of natural selection. It was originally introduced by <NAME> in 1997 and has been applied with various applications ranging from computer engineering design to economics modeling and medical treatment. DE explores the search space by generating candidate solutions using mutation and crossover operations. Candidates are then evaluated using an objective function and those that perform better than their parents are selected as offspring for further breeding. In this article, we will review the basic idea behind DE and present its working principles step-by-step along with a few example problems to showcase how it works effectively. 

# 2. Basic concepts and terminology
## Population
The population refers to all candidates generated during the course of the algorithm's execution. Initially, the population consists of a set number of individuals randomly initialized according to some prescribed distribution or constraints. In each iteration of the algorithm, the population undergoes changes due to the application of mutations and crossover operators which can result in new generation of candidate solutions. Each individual in the population possesses characteristics represented by different genes or parameters.

## Fitness function
Fitness function evaluates the quality of an individual solution. It takes into account multiple factors such as the overall performance of the model, accuracy of prediction, computational efficiency, etc., to determine the fitness level of an individual. We use fitness functions extensively in modern machine learning models and DE can be used to optimize these models towards a specific objective function. For instance, when optimizing a neural network for image classification purposes, the fitness function could consider metrics like accuracy, loss, complexity, etc. 

## Crossover operator
Crossover operator combines two parent chromosomes to produce one child chromosome that may have improved properties compared to either parent. The resulting chromosome contains genetic information from both parents but also represents some degree of randomness. By combining genetic information from different sources, DE ensures diversity in the population and improves convergence to optimal solutions. Common types of crossover operators include single point, two point, uniform and order crossover.

## Mutation operator
Mutation operator introduces small variations to the existing chromosomes within the population. This helps the algorithm explore more possible solutions while avoiding getting stuck in local minima. Common types of mutation operators include bit flip, swap, scramble, insert and delete.

## Selection mechanism
Selection mechanism selects the best fit individuals amongst the entire population to mate and reproduce them to generate offspring for the next generation. There are several methods to select the individuals based on their fitness levels: roulette wheel, tournament, ranking, and stochastic universal sampling (SUS). Depending on the problem at hand, different selection mechanisms can provide significant improvements over others. In case of multi-objective optimization problems, a combination of ranking and SUS can give rise to even greater insights.

# 3. Algorithm details
## Initialization
At the beginning of the algorithm, we initialize the population consisting of n individuals. Each individual in the population possesses a fixed number of gene values representing certain characteristics of the corresponding object being optimized. These charactersitic values can vary continuously or discretely depending on the problem at hand. The initial population is crucial because it defines the scope of search for the algorithm. If the initial population is too small, the algorithm may struggle to find any good solutions as it becomes trapped in local minima. On the other hand, if the initial population is too large, it can take longer time to converge and may end up reaching suboptimal solutions. Hence, selecting proper initial population size is critical. Additionally, initializing the population randomly can help identify patterns and relationships between the variables leading to faster convergence.

## Genetic operators
Once the population is initialized, we apply three genetic operators - mutation, crossover, and selection - sequentially until convergence is achieved. These steps repeat until no further improvement is seen in terms of fitness levels across generations.
### Mutation operator
The purpose of mutation operation is to introduce small variations to the existing chromosomes within the population. This makes sure that the algorithm explores more possible solutions without getting stuck in local minima. Two common forms of mutation are Bit Flip and Swap. Among Bit Flip and Swap, Swap can produce slightly better results, whereas Bit Flip produces fewer but more diverse offsprings. However, applying Bit Flip can lead to premature convergence. Therefore, DE uses a weighted average approach to balance exploration and exploitation during mutation phase. During mutation, DE replaces a random subset of bits in the offspring with the complementary value determined by the weight factor k and the current gene values in the parent chromosome. Here, k is a parameter that controls the mutation strength. Higher values of k result in larger perturbations and hence better exploratory behavior. At times, DE may discard certain portions of the chromosome entirely during mutation process to achieve higher diversity in the population.


### Crossover operator
Crossover operation combines two parent chromosomes to produce one child chromosome that may have improved properties compared to either parent. This helps the algorithm evolve more complex solutions that may not be attainable by chance alone. The resulting chromosome contains genetic information from both parents but also represents some degree of randomness. By combining genetic information from different sources, DE ensures diversity in the population and improves convergence to optimal solutions. There are several ways to combine the genetic information from the parents including Single Point, Two Point, Uniform, and Order crossover. DE typically applies a binary crossover operator wherein each bit position of the offspring is derived from one of the parents' chromosomes. Specifically, DE chooses a random cutting point between the first and second halves of the chromosome and copies the gene segments before and after the cutting point from the chosen parent. The remaining positions of the offspring remain unaffected.

### Selection Mechanism
Selection mechanism selects the best fit individuals amongst the entire population to mate and reproduce them to generate offspring for the next generation. DE utilizes a simple Roulette Wheel selection mechanism. In Roulette Wheel selection, the probability of selecting an individual is proportional to their relative fitness level. The winner is selected with a bias towards the fitter individuals.

# 4. Examples
Here we demonstrate some examples of problems solved using DE to illustrate how it performs well.

## Example 1: Continuous Parameter Optimization
In this example, we want to minimize a quadratic equation y = x^2 + 3x + 1 subject to constraint |y| ≤ 2. To do so, we start by defining our fitness function as follows:<|im_sep|>
