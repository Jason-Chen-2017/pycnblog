# 1.背景介绍


Algorithms are the basic building blocks of computer science. They help to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems that can be solved independently. In this article, we will talk about fundamental concepts in algorithms such as data structures and how they work together with algorithms to solve real-world problems.

Data structures play a crucial role in algorithm design and implementation. A good understanding of data structures is essential for being able to effectively design and implement efficient algorithms. The following are some important data structures used in algorithmic solutions:

1. Arrays: An array is a sequence of elements stored contiguously in memory. It allows for constant-time access to any element within the array using its index or location. Common operations on arrays include insertion, deletion, sorting, and searching.

2. Linked Lists: A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a reference to another node. Each node also has some value associated with it. Linked lists allow dynamic resizing and easy insertion/deletion at arbitrary positions. Common operations on linked lists include traversal (forwards or backwards), insertion at an arbitrary position, and removal of a node from anywhere in the list.

3. Stacks and Queues: A stack is a last-in first-out (LIFO) data structure that stores values in a Last-In First-Out order. This means that when you push something onto the stack, it gets added to the top. When you pop something off the stack, the most recently pushed item comes out first. Queue is a first-in first-out (FIFO) data structure similar to a queue. Unlike stacks, queues maintain their order of insertion until they are explicitly removed from the front.

4. Hash Tables: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values based on a hashing function. This allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions. However, collisions can occur when two keys have the same hash code. To avoid collisions, there are several techniques like chaining, open addressing, quadratic probing, etc. Common operations on hash tables include looking up a key, inserting a new key-value pair, updating an existing key-value pair, and deleting a key-value pair.

5. Trees: A tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node represents a piece of data and points to one or more child nodes. A binary search tree is a type of tree where every left descendant node has a value less than its parent node and every right descendant node has a value greater than its parent node. Common operations on trees include traversing the tree in-order, pre-order, post-order, and finding the maximum and minimum values in the tree.

6. Graphs: A graph is a network of nodes connected by edges. There may not always be a direct connection between all pairs of nodes, but if there is a path connecting them then these nodes are said to be adjacent. Some common types of graphs are directed and undirected, weighted and unweighted. Common operations on graphs include traversing the graph in both directions (BFS and DFS), checking whether two nodes are connected, and computing shortest paths.

The relationships between data structures and algorithms enable us to use different ones depending on our requirements. For example, if we need random access to an element in an array, we should choose an array instead of a linked list or a tree. Similarly, if our problem requires manipulating large amounts of data without losing time due to slow reads or writes, we should consider a database instead of simply storing the data in memory. We'll see many examples of this later in the article.

Now let's take a step back and think of an actual application scenario for implementing an algorithm. Suppose we want to find the kth smallest number in a set of numbers. One possible approach could be to sort the entire set and return the kth element, which would take O(n log n) time complexity. Instead, we can use quickselect algorithm, which takes O(n) time complexity to find the kth smallest element. Here is how quickselect works:

Choose a pivot element from the given set. Partition the remaining elements into two sets, one containing elements less than or equal to the pivot, and the other containing elements greater than the pivot. If the pivot happens to be the kth smallest element, return it. Otherwise, recursively apply the above steps to either the left subset or the right subset until the kth smallest element is found.

Let's now discuss specific algorithms related to each of the above data structures. Let's start with arrays.
