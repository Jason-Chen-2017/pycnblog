# 1.背景介绍


随着现代计算机技术的进步，在全球范围内，许多公司都开始采用区块链技术来解决各种分布式计算中的问题。近年来，基于量子计算机和其它纠缠态物理的研究使得区块链技术的发展变得更加迅速、前景广阔。

对于基于区块链的应用程序来说，量子计算技术可以提供以下三个方面的优势：

1. 量子证明：区块链可以将分布式账本记录下来并共享给其他节点进行验证，而这一过程需要时间很长。在目前的分布式计算中，比特币用作支付系统，而在未来的某些分布式计算场景中，使用量子计算机来生成、验证和验证交易将会提高效率和可靠性。
2. 可伸缩性：量子计算机的处理速度要快于普通计算机。在分布式计算过程中，当任务数量增大时，每台机器的处理能力就会越来越差，因此，利用量子计算机可以降低单个机器的处理负担，增加整个网络的处理能力。
3. 智能合约：智能合约通过控制复杂的分布式网络，可以实现复杂的商业逻辑。基于量子计算的智能合约可以在无需第三方信任的情况下对价值进行安全地交换。

# 2. Core Concepts and Connections to Blockchains
Before discussing the details of quantum mechanical concepts and algorithms, we need to understand some basic terminology in quantum physics:

1. Bra-Ket notation: In quantum mechanics, a bra represents the conjugate transpose (dagger) of an operator, while a ket represents its adjoint (transpose). For example, if a is a complex number, then <a| is represented by |a>^*, and <ab| = |ba| for operators a and b.
2. Dirac notation: Dirac notation refers to using brackets to represent vectors and raising and lowering indices to indicate quantum states. The basis states are labeled by lowercase letters and their corresponding fermionic or bosonic creation/annihilation operators have upper-case labels. For example, if a and b are two quantum particles, then |0> = [1], |1> = [2].

With these basic ideas in mind, let's dive into more detail about quantum computing and how it relates to blockchain development.

## Physical Realization of Quantum Computers
Quantum computers can be considered physical realizations of classical computers based on two intertwined principles: quantum interference and entanglement. Both of these principles involve subatomic particles that behave in non-classical ways when interacting with one another. These phenomena allow quantum computers to perform computations significantly faster than traditional digital ones because they require fewer steps or resources compared to traditional analog computers. 

To explain how quantum mechanical effects play a role in blockchain applications, let's consider a simple example. Imagine Alice wants to send her encrypted message to Bob. To do this she needs to create a key pair, which consists of a private key and public key. She generates a random string of bits called a seed value. This seed value serves as input to a quantum algorithm known as Shor's algorithm, which uses quantum phase estimation to find factors of n.

The quantum algorithm works by encoding the original message into a qubit state, which is then used to prepare a quantum state with the desired properties. Next, it measures the quantum state multiple times using a quantum computer and applies certain gates to refine the result before sending it back to Alice. Once Alice has received the results from the quantum computer, she decrypts them using her secret key to obtain the original message.

Quantum mechanical effects such as quantum interference enable us to use quantum computers to simulate the behavior of matter at the atomic level. By applying appropriate methods like superposition and entanglement, we can design quantum algorithms that operate at different levels of abstraction from classical computers. While most modern quantum computers rely on both classical and quantum hardware to work correctly, blockchain developers can benefit greatly from taking advantage of quantum technologies like QCUs to improve performance and scalability of distributed systems.
