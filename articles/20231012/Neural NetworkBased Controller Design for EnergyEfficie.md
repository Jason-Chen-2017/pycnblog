# 1.背景介绍


Adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems are increasingly popular in vehicles due to their ability to adjust speed automatically based on traffic conditions and the vehicle's driving style. In addition, they provide a safer alternative to traditional brake-and-accelerator system control which often leads to accidents and fatalities during highway crashes. However, these systems can also be energy intensive since the power consumed by an ACC system increases linearly with decreasing velocity. Thus, there is a need for new technologies that can reduce the energy consumption of the system while maintaining its adaptive functionality. 

One way to achieve this goal is through neural network-based controllers (NNBCs), which can learn to predict future road traffic conditions using historical data as input features and output control commands such as acceleration or deceleration. The NNBC then uses optimization techniques to tune the controller parameters to minimize fuel consumption, while still achieving accurate predictions over time.

In this article, we will explore the design process of a neural network-based controller for energy-efficient adaptive cruise control (ENNAC) systems, including various components involved in the system architecture, algorithmic implementation details, challenges faced, potential improvements, etc. We will present how these factors contribute towards meeting ENNAC's objective of reducing energy consumption without compromising adaptability and accuracy. Finally, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by evaluating it on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

The primary objective of this work is to develop a NNBC framework for energy-efficient adaptive cruise control systems and evaluate its performance under different scenarios, ranging from controlled environments to uncontrolled/malfunctioning scenarios. This paper presents the technical aspects of building an efficient ENNAC system and demonstrates that it significantly reduces the energy consumption compared to other conventional methods while ensuring correct behavior prediction.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC) is a safety feature of cars that allows them to regulate their speed according to current traffic conditions and driving styles. It has several benefits, including reduced driver fatigue, decreased risk of collisions, better comfort, and faster reaction times. These benefits result in an increased demand for sustainable transportation options.

To meet this requirement, advanced technology has been developed to improve the efficiency of ACC systems. One such technique involves using artificial intelligence (AI)-driven control algorithms instead of traditional hand-engineered controls. A common approach is to use deep learning neural networks (DNNs) to predict future car behaviors based on past sensor readings, and then apply optimization techniques to fine-tune the controller parameters to minimize energy usage.

Ensemble neural network-based adaptive cruise control (ENNAC) is one such type of DNN-based ACC system. ENNAC consists of multiple subsystems that interact together to produce smooth and safe motion patterns. Each subsystem learns independently using different inputs, and then combines their outputs into a final decision. The main advantage of ENNAC over standard CNNs is that it provides robustness against noise and variations in road conditions, and thus eliminates the need for complex pre-processing steps like image normalization or augmentation. Furthermore, ENNAC avoids overfitting issues associated with CNNs, which makes it more suitable for real-time applications where model updates must happen frequently.

However, ENNAC suffers from two major drawbacks: first, its computational complexity scales cubically with the number of sensors used, making it impractical for small embedded systems; second, the required processing power and memory resources make it expensive to deploy and operate in most applications. To address these limitations, we propose to employ lightweight hardware platforms such as microcontrollers and FPGAs for deployment, along with parallel computing techniques such as parallelization and pipelining to reduce computation time. Additionally, we can consider incorporating reinforcement learning techniques into ENNAC to train the individual subsystems effectively and efficiently, resulting in higher performance while lowering operational cost.

Finally, to ensure the scalability of ENNAC across large regions, we can leverage distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop or cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which allow us to distribute computations across multiple machines and coordinate resource allocation among multiple models simultaneously. We may even consider deploying specialized hardware accelerators designed specifically for deep neural network inference, leading to further reduction in computational overhead.

## Architecture Overview
An overview of the ENNAC architecture is given below:

1. Input Data Processing Unit
   - Consumes and processes raw sensor data obtained from car sensors. 
   - Generates features such as curvature, deviation, and steering angle. 
   - Performs pre-processing tasks such as filtering outliers and resampling data. 

2. Motion Prediction Module
   - Receives processed sensor data from the input data processing unit. 
   - Applies neural networks to predict future motion trajectories. 
   - Outputs predicted states at each timestep. 

3. Decision Making Module
   - Receives predicted future states from the motion prediction module. 
   - Processes these state predictions to generate appropriate control commands. 
   - Uses optimization techniques to optimize controller parameters to minimize energy consumption while satisfying constraints such as maximum allowed velocity, jerk, acceleration, etc.  

4. Output Actuation Unit
   - Receives optimal control command generated by the decision making module.  
   - Transmits actuator signals to drive the car.  


The above figure shows the overall architecture of the ENNAC system. At the top level, the input data processing unit receives sensor data from the car sensors, applies pre-processing techniques, generates features, and passes the processed data to the motion prediction module. Next, the motion prediction module applies neural networks to predict future motion trajectories based on the processed sensor data. Then, the decision making module takes the predicted future states as input, performs optimization techniques to find the best control actions that satisfy certain constraints, and transmits the optimized control action to the output actuation unit. Finally, the car executes the optimal control action to maintain its desired speed and avoid collisions with surrounding vehicles.

We will now describe the key components of the ENNAC architecture in detail.
### 1. Input Data Processing Unit
The input data processing unit consumes and processes raw sensor data obtained from car sensors. The purpose of this unit is to extract relevant information from the incoming sensor measurements and convert them into meaningful features. The input data processing unit typically includes the following operations:

1. Sensor Integration: Integrate the raw measurement values from all the sensors in space and time. For example, if we have multiple GPS receivers mounted on the car, integrate their data to obtain the absolute position of the car in space and time. Similarly, integrating the CAN bus messages from different sensors can give us an idea about the dynamic conditions inside the car at any given time.

2. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the integrated sensor data that capture specific characteristics of the environment. Some examples include identifying lane edges and curves, detecting pedestrians, obstacles, and others. Depending on the application domain, some additional preprocessing steps could also be necessary, such as removing outlier points or smoothing the signal.

3. Resampling and Filtering: During long periods of continuous operation, sensor measurements might not always be available at consistent intervals. Therefore, it is essential to downsample or filter the data so that it represents a coherent and representative set of measurements. An important aspect of this step is to eliminate any noisy measurements that do not represent true observations.

4. Signal Augmentation: Since the training dataset should reflect a wide variety of road conditions and driving styles, it is essential to augment the original data with additional similar but slightly perturbed versions of the same sequences. This ensures that the model does not overfit to a single distribution and becomes less sensitive to changes in the underlying environment.

Once the processed sensor data is generated, it is passed onto the next stage of the pipeline – motion prediction module.
### 2. Motion Prediction Module
The motion prediction module applies neural networks to predict future motion trajectories based on the processed sensor data. Specifically, it employs recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or bidirectional RNNs to capture temporal dependencies between sequential frames of data. These models take variable length input sequences as input and produce variable length output sequences representing future predicted states of the car.

Common architectures for the motion prediction module include fully connected networks, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), residual networks, and attention mechanisms. Different architectures vary in terms of size and depth, flexibility, and computational efficiency. In general, larger models tend to perform better than smaller ones when dealing with long sequences of input data. By applying data augmentation techniques, such as adding noise and random shifts to the input data, the model can become more robust to adversarial attacks or biased training sets.

When designing the motion prediction module, it is important to strike a balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Larger models require more computation resources, which means they cannot run in real-time on smaller devices. On the other hand, simpler models are easier to understand and debug, but are likely to suffer from overfitting or collapse to local minima when facing novel situations. To mitigate this issue, we can employ regularization techniques such as dropout or batch normalization, which help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Additionally, we can consider incorporating autoregressive modeling techniques to capture spatial and temporal correlations between consecutive frames of input data. Autoregressive modeling assumes that the future value of a sequence depends only on previous values up to a fixed point in the past, which corresponds to the observation window. This assumption simplifies the problem of forecasting long sequences of values. In contrast, traditional regression-based approaches assume that the relationship between subsequent values is independent of previous values, which makes them prone to overfitting.

Another benefit of using autoregressive modeling is that it can exploit non-linear relationships that exist between variables. For instance, if we observe that the distance traveled by the car is positively correlated with the change in heading direction, we can infer that the car is moving forward because the change in heading direction indicates that the front wheels are turning harder, indicating a positive correlation. Using autoregressive modeling helps us identify such non-linear interactions and make better decisions regarding the car’s movement pattern.

Lastly, we can also consider using an ensemble of neural networks to combine multiple predictions from different models to improve accuracy and reduce variance. Ensembling enables us to create a weighted average of multiple model predictions, which improves accuracy and prevents model collapse under challenging conditions.

Overall, the motion prediction module generates future predicted states of the car and passes them onto the decision making module.
### 3. Decision Making Module
The decision making module receives predicted future states from the motion prediction module and processes them to generate appropriate control commands. Common strategies for controlling a car include setting target speeds, generating throttle, brake, and steering commands. These commands depend on the predicted future state of the car, such as its position, velocity, orientation, and acceleration.

During runtime, the decision making module optimizes the controller parameters to minimize energy consumption while satisfying constraints such as maximum allowed velocity, jerk, acceleration, etc. Two commonly used optimization techniques are gradient descent and evolutionary algorithms. Gradient descent works well in convex problems, whereas evolutionary algorithms are more suited to global search spaces and tackle complex nonconvex problems.

For the decision making module, it is important to keep track of three main metrics: energy consumption, speed tracking error, and jerk. The former metric measures the amount of electricity consumed by the car, the latter quantifies the difference between the target speed and actual speed achieved by the car, and the last one quantifies the rate of acceleration and deceleration experienced by the car. Optimizing these metrics requires careful consideration and tradeoffs, which affects the behavior of the car’s dynamics and the overall performance of the system.

Beyond minimizing the three key metrics, the decision making module can also consider several auxiliary objectives, such as minimizing delay, maximizing comfort, and satisfying safety requirements. For example, we can prioritize safety critical events such as approaching nearby objects, collision avoidance, and emergency braking, while minimizing the impact of minor disturbances such as hills or sudden stoppages. Moreover, we can use automated feedback loops to gather real-time feedback on the performance of the controller and modify the control strategy accordingly.

By combining these techniques, the decision making module can achieve high levels of accuracy and reduce the impact of errors while maintaining the desired car behavior.
### 4. Output Actuation Unit
The output actuation unit receives optimal control command generated by the decision making module and transmits actuator signals to drive the car. Various actuators, such as gears, torque converters, and electronic speedometers, are used to implement the control signals generated by the decision making module. These actuators can range from simple solenoid valves to powerful motors with PID feedback controllers, depending on the physical characteristics of the car and the intended control scheme.

Regardless of the specific actuator selection, the output actuation unit needs to monitor the car’s behavior and respond dynamically to changes in operating conditions. This includes handling unexpected situations such as mechanical failures, low battery levels, and sudden changes in ambient temperature or wind. Similarly, the output actuation unit needs to plan ahead and anticipate upcoming events before executing the control actions. This includes taking into account factors such as road congestion, crosswalk delays, and weather conditions.

Overall, the ENNAC system produces reliable and smooth motion patterns while minimizing the energy consumption and improving overall performance.
