# 1.背景介绍


Time series forecasting is a common problem in the field of data science and machine learning. It refers to making predictions on future values based on past historical observations or measurements. The goal is to anticipate changes in time-dependent variables such as sales, stock prices, market prices, weather patterns, traffic volumes, etc., to make better decisions for businesses and individuals involved with these activities. 

One way to approach this task is by using regression techniques called "time-series models". These models can be classified into three categories:

1. Simple Moving Average (SMA): A simple moving average model predicts the next period value as a weighted average of previous values over a fixed time interval. For example, an SMA(7) model calculates the rolling mean of the last seven periods' values and uses it as prediction for the next period's value.

2. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA): An autoregressive integrated moving average model combines both trend and seasonality effects in time series data through the use of statistical analysis techniques. Seasonality effects occur when there are recurring patterns that repeat every year, month, quarter, or other time period. This model takes into account both autoregression (the relationship between a variable and its own lagged values) and differencing (taking differences between consecutive periods to remove any non-stationarity).

3. Exponential Smoothing (ESM): An exponential smoothing model also considers the trend component and also adjusts the level over time according to the recent trend. ESM models work well for short-term forecasts because they estimate a smooth curve instead of a single point estimate.

In this article we will focus on SMA and ARIMA models. We'll discuss their mathematical formulations, how they operate in practice, and implement them in Python using popular libraries like statsmodels and scikit-learn. Finally, we'll compare their performance against other models and explore potential applications of time series forecasting in various industries.

## 2.1 Simple Moving Average (SMA) Model
The SMA model predicts the next period value as a weighted average of previous values over a fixed time interval. Let $y_t$ denote the time series at time t, where t=0,...,n-1. Then the SMA(k) model predicts the time series $y_{n+h}$ for h>=1 as follows:

$$\hat{y}_{n+h} = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=n-k+1}^{n} y_i$$

where k is the size of the window (also known as the order), $\hat{y}_{n+h}$ is the predicted value for period n+h, and $i$ runs from n-k+1 to n.

## 2.2 Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model
An ARIMA model combines both trend and seasonality effects in time series data through the use of statistical analysis techniques. Here's the general formula for an ARIMA model:

$$\text{ARIMA}(p,d,q)\;Y_t = c + \phi_1 Y_{t-1} +... + \phi_p Y_{t-p} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} +... + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q} + \varepsilon_t$$

Where $Y_t$ is the time series at time t, which contains both observed and forecasted values. The parameters p, d, q represent the number of autoregressive terms, differences needed for stationarity, and moving average terms respectively. The constant term c represents the overall trend.

Autoregressive terms ($\phi_i$) capture the effect of previous values on the current value, while moving average terms ($\theta_j$) reflect the effect of current errors on the next period value. Differences ($\psi_i$) help to eliminate any non-stationarity in the data. The error term ($\varepsilon_t$) captures all remaining uncertainties that cannot be explained by the AR, MA, or difference components alone.

We need to identify appropriate parameter values for our data before proceeding with further calculations. There are several methods available for finding optimal parameter values, but one commonly used method is grid search. Grid search involves testing multiple combinations of parameter values and selecting the set that results in the best performance metric, typically root mean squared error (RMSE). Once we have identified good parameter values, we can then begin building the final model and computing forecasts.

## 3.1 Statsmodel Implementation Of SMA And ARIMA Models
Let us now implement the SMA and ARIMA models using the Python library `statsmodels` which provides efficient implementations of statistical algorithms. 

### 3.1.1 SMA Implementation Using Statsmodels Library
Here's how you can implement an SMA model using `statsmodels`:

1. Import the necessary modules - `numpy`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`.
2. Create a sample time series dataset using `numpy.random.rand()`. 
3. Define the order of your desired SMA model (in this case, let's assume k=3).
4. Use the `SimpleMovingAverage()` function provided by `statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters` module to fit and generate the predicted values. 
5. Plot the original time series along with the predicted values obtained using `plot_predict()` function of `statsmodels` library.

``` python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import signal
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import SimpleExpSmoothing, Holt, ExponentialSmoothing, SimpleMovingAverage


# Generate Sample Dataset
np.random.seed(12345)
data = np.random.rand(50)*10
print("Sample Dataset:", data)<|im_sep|>
