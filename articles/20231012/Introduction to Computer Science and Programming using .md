# 1.背景介绍


In this article we will introduce the basic concepts of computer science and programming in Python language. We will start by introducing some key terms and defining them, followed by an overview of how a program works, including inputs, outputs, variables, loops, functions, and classes. Then we will dive into more advanced topics such as recursion, file I/O operations, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and graph algorithms. Finally, we will talk about some popular libraries that make it easier for developers to write code efficiently and quickly.

This article is intended for readers who have basic knowledge of math, but may not be familiar with most programming languages. We will also assume you are familiar with basic data structures such as arrays, lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, etc., but may need a refresher course on those if needed. 

Before starting, please ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official website here: https://www.python.org/. If you already have Python installed, please check the version number and update it if necessary. On Windows, you should be able to open command prompt or PowerShell and type "python" to verify if everything went well.

We will use Python 3.7 as our example version throughout the article. Other versions might work slightly differently, so adjustments may be required depending on which version you are using. The same applies to operating systems - Linux, macOS, or Windows, both 32-bit and 64-bit variants are supported.

# 2.Core Concepts and Contacts
## Basic Syntax
Python uses indentation to indicate block structure, just like other programming languages like Java and C++. This means that all statements within blocks must be indented consistently, either left aligned or right aligned.

Here's a simple example:

```python
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is zero or negative")
```

In this example, `print()` is used to output messages to the console, while `if` and `else` are used to conditionally execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Indentation is crucial in Python because it allows us to group related statements together easily, making it easy to read and understand our programs.

## Variables
Variables allow us to store values and perform calculations in memory. In Python, we declare variables using the `=` operator, like this:

```python
my_variable = 123
other_var = "hello world!"
pi = 3.14159
is_awesome = True
```

Once declared, we can access their value later using the variable name, like this:

```python
print(my_variable + 1)    # Output: 124
print(len(str(my_variable)))   # Output: 3
print(type(other_var))     # Output: <class'str'>
```

As mentioned earlier, Python has several built-in data types such as integers (`int`), floating point numbers (`float`), strings (`str`), booleans (`bool`), and others. We can change the type of a variable dynamically using various conversion functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`. For example:

```python
num_string = input("Enter a number: ")
num = int(num_string)      # Convert string to integer
print(num / 2)             # Divide integer by 2
```

Note that when converting between numerical types, potential precision loss may occur due to floating point representation errors. To avoid this, we can explicitly specify the desired output precision using format specifiers:

```python
pi = 3.14159
rounded_pi = "{:.2f}".format(pi)   # Format pi with two decimal places
print(rounded_pi)                 # Output: "3.14"
```

We can assign multiple variables at once using commas, like this:

```python
a, b = 10, 20
c, d, e = [1, 2, 3]   # Assign list elements to multiple variables
```

It's important to note that assigning one variable to another copies its reference, rather than creating a new copy of the object. So any modifications made to one variable will affect the other too. For example:

```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_list = original_list       # Shallow copy of original_list
new_list[1] = 4                # Modify element in new_list
print(original_list)           # Output: "[1, 4, 3]"
```

To create a separate copy of an object, we can use the slice notation `[:]` to extract a portion of the list and create a new list containing only those elements:

```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_list = original_list[:]        # Deep copy of original_list
new_list[1] = 4                    # Modify element in new_list
print(original_list)               # Output: "[1, 2, 3]"
```

## Data Structures
Python provides several built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and user-defined classes that represent collections of objects. Here are some examples of each data structure:

### Lists
Lists are ordered sequences of values, similar to arrays in other languages. They support slicing, indexing, appending, extending, inserting, and removing elements. For example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_data = ["foo", 123, False]

print(fruits[1])            # Output: "banana"
fruits.append("orange")     # Add element to end of list
fruits.insert(1, "grape")   # Insert element at specific index
fruits.extend(["peach", "pear"])   # Extend list with multiple elements
del fruits[1]               # Remove element at specific index
print(fruits[-1])           # Output: "pear"
```

### Tuples
Tuples are immutable lists that behave much like lists except they cannot be modified after creation. The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are faster and consume less memory compared to mutable lists. However, since they are immutable, they don't support modification methods such as `.append()` and `.insert()`:

```python
coordinates = (3, 4)          # Create tuple with two coordinates
color = ("red",)              # Make a tuple with one item
data = "bar", 123, False      # Create tuple directly from literals
```

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are unordered mappings of keys to values where each key must be unique. Dictionaries support various lookup and assignment operations such as getting, setting, updating, deleting items, iterating over keys and values, and checking membership. For example:

```python
person = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
phonebook = {"Alice": "555-1234", "Bob": "555-5678"}

print(person["name"])        # Output: "John Doe"
print("Jane Doe" in phonebook)   # Output: False
phonebook["Charlie"] = "555-9012"   # Add entry to dictionary
for name in phonebook:
    print("{}: {}".format(name, phonebook[name]))
        # Output: Alice: 555-1234
                   # Bob: 555-5678
                   # Charlie: 555-9012

del person["age"]            # Delete item from dictionary
```

### Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique values. A set supports common set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference, and disjointness testing. They are useful for performing mathematical operations on groups of elements, such as finding the distinct members of a list or counting the occurrences of particular words in a document. For example:

```python
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
unique_nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2}   # Duplicate values are automatically removed

union = colors | {"yellow"}         # Find union of two sets
intersection = colors & {"red", "green"}   # Find intersection of two sets
difference = colors - {"blue"}        # Find differences between sets
symmetric_diff = colors ^ {"white"}   # Find symmetric differences between sets
```

Finally, we'll cover some advanced features that are commonly used in complex applications such as recursion, file I/O operations, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and graph algorithms. These features require additional time and effort to master, but they provide significant benefits in reducing complexity and improving performance compared to standard solutions.
