# 1.背景介绍


## 概念
Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT)是一个集成学习方法,它基于决策树算法,并采用了贪心策略,以迭代的方式逐步建立一系列可信赖的预测模型,最后综合这些模型的结果输出最终的预测结果。它的主要优点是能够处理高维、非线性数据、缺失值、稀疏数据的问题,并且在处理文字和图像分类等领域均有着很好的效果。
## GBDT与其他集成学习方法的比较
GBDT方法与Random Forest、AdaBoost、XgBoost等其它集成学习方法的关系是什么?
GBDT与其他集成学习方法的关系:
- Adaboost和GBDT都是属于Boosting的方法,都是将多个弱分类器组合在一起,但是Adaboost的迭代次数较少,而GBDT的迭代次数可以设置多长,通常GBDT使用前向分布算法优化损失函数。
- XgBoost和GBDT一样也是一种Boosting的方法,但是相比Adaboost对离散特征的处理更好。Xgboost通过计算每个特征的分裂阈值来提升树的生长,从而使得结果变得更加准确。
- Random Forest和AdaBoost一样属于集成学习方法,不过它们侧重点不同。AdaBoost随机选择一个样本进行学习,学习完之后,AdaBoost会给该样本赋予一个权重,然后根据权重更新样本的权重,使得不容易出现过拟合现象。而Random Forest则是用多棵树的平均结果作为结果。

## 概念
### Gradient Descent
梯度下降法是机器学习中常用的求解无约束最优化问题的一种方法,其基本思路就是不断寻找使目标函数下降最快的方向,直到达到最优值或者迭代结束。Gradient descent algorithm is a popular optimization algorithm used to minimize an objective function by iteratively moving towards the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative gradient at each step. In other words, it starts with an initial guess for the parameter values and adjusts them in such a way that the loss or error of the model being optimized decreases. Here are some basic steps for using gradient descent on linear regression problems:

1. Initialize the parameters randomly or use pre-trained weights from another model.
2. Iterate over the data points, computing the gradients (derivatives) w.r.t. the loss function J (e.g., mean squared error).
3. Update the parameters by subtracting a small fraction alpha of the gradient times its corresponding feature vector from the current set of parameters.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence. The final set of parameters will be optimal for minimizing the loss function.

### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Stochastic gradient descent is a special case of gradient descent where only one training example is used to update the model at each iteration. It achieves faster convergence than batch gradient descent because it takes advantage of low variance in individual examples, but can lead to slower convergence due to noisy updates. SGD can also be viewed as an approximation of full batch gradient descent when mini-batches of size m=1 are used. There are several variants of SGD including AdaGrad, RMSprop, Adam, etc.

### Mini-batch SGD
Mini-batch SGD refers to a variant of SGD where multiple examples are processed together at each iteration, rather than processing just one example at a time. This reduces the computational cost associated with updating the model at each iteration and allows for more stable convergence rates during training. Mini-batch SGD has been shown to achieve higher accuracy than SGD on large-scale machine learning tasks. 

### L1 Regularization / Lasso Regression
L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that measures the absolute value of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages sparsity in the weight vectors, which can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance. Lasso regression applies L1 regularization to a linear regression problem, which shrinks the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing variable selection and dimensionality reduction.

### L2 Regularization / Ridge Regression
L2 regularization is similar to L1 regularization, except that instead of adding a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, it squares the weights and adds a constant penalty term proportional to their square. This penalizes larger weights more heavily than smaller ones, which can prevent any single feature from dominating the contribution of the model overall. Ridge regression applies L2 regularization to a linear regression problem, which provides improved estimates of the true coefficient values while still providing good interpretability through the estimated coefficients' standard errors.

### Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned directly from data but must be set prior to training the model. They affect the speed and quality of training, and should typically be chosen based on empirical results or cross-validation techniques. Examples of hyperparameters include the number of trees in a random forest, the degree of polynomial interpolation used in a polynomial regression, and the learning rate used in neural networks. Typically, the best choice of hyperparameters requires fine tuning using a combination of experimentation, validation, and grid search methods.
