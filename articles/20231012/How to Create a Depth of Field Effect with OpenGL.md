# 1.背景介绍


Depth of field (DOF) is an optical effect that simulates the depth and range of objects in a camera's lens. It helps the human eye focus on particular parts of the scene rather than distracting from other details. In this article, we will discuss how DOF can be created using openGL graphics rendering API for advanced effects like motion blur or bokeh. We will also compare various techniques available today and explore their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we will conclude by sharing some tips and tricks that may come handy while implementing DOF.

The following are the basic concepts related to depth-of-field:

1. Focus distance: This determines the distance at which the object appears focused. The smaller the value, the larger the effect of DOF becomes. 

2. Aperture size: This controls the size of the opening in the lens where light enters into the system. The smaller the value, the wider the opening is, resulting in less blurry image. However, it also increases the amount of ambient light entering the scene. 

3. F-number: This represents the ratio of the focal length divided by the diameter of the entrance pupil. It affects the speed of convergence of the camera lense as well as the amount of sharpening required in the final image. 

  Overall, these three factors control the degree of blurredness present in the image and help create a realistic sense of depth and distance. They make up the fundamental building blocks for creating high-quality DOF effects.
  
To implement DOF using openGL, we need to understand two main aspects - how do the shaders calculate the depth values? And what happens when an object moves in front of the lens? Let’s dive deeper into each concept below. 

# 3.Core Algorithm & Operations Steps With Math Model Formula Details
There are several methods used for calculating the depth values used by the shaders. Here are some common algorithms used:

1. Perspective Projection Method: 
This method involves projecting the vertices onto the screen surface based on their perspective. For example, if a vertex is located far away from the camera but closer to its focus point, then it should have a higher depth value compared to another vertex located near the same position as the camera. This is because it represents the object being nearer to the observer. To implement this method, we simply need to use the inverse projection matrix provided by the graphics library to transform the coordinates back to world space. 

2. Orthographic Projection Method:
In this method, we map the objects directly onto the NDC coordinates (normalized device coordinates). Objects further away from the camera appear smaller than those close to the camera. Similarly, objects at different positions along the z-axis get projected differently according to their respective distances from the camera. The math model formula involved here is similar to linear interpolation between the near and far clipping planes of the viewport. 

3. Z-buffer Method: 
This method uses a buffer called the z-buffer to store depth information for every pixel in the frame buffer. When we render an object, the z-value of all pixels inside the object gets updated. Then, we read off the depth values of each pixel from the z-buffer to perform the necessary calculations. One advantage of this method is that it allows us to avoid any additional projection matrices or transformations, making it faster and more efficient than other methods. 

Now let's move on to understanding the operations performed by the shaders during the rendering process when an object moves behind or infront of the lens. These steps include the calculation of the texture coordinates and transformation matrices. 

1. Texture Coordinates Calculation:
Texture coordinates represent the position of the fragment within the texture image. For example, if there are four textures on a single object, we would need to specify separate coordinates for each texture element. The texture coordinates depend on the current viewpoint and orientation of the object. Hence, they must be calculated before applying the transformation matrices. If the object rotates too quickly, the corresponding texture coordinates might not accurately reflect the new shape of the object. Therefore, the texture coordinates must be recalculated after rotation to ensure accurate alignment. 

2. Transformation Matrices: 
Transformation matrices represent the position and orientation of the object in world space. We apply these matrices to convert the object's local coordinate system into the world coordinate system. The math model formula used in these matrices depends on the desired transformation operation such as translation, scaling, rotation etc. Some popular transformation matrices are the modelview matrix, projection matrix, normal matrix, texture matrix, and viewport matrix. The modelview matrix transforms the vertices based on the current orientation of the object, whereas the projection matrix maps the transformed vertices onto the NDC space of the viewport. Other useful functions included in the transformation matrices are cross product, dot product, and determinant.
