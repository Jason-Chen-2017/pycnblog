# 1.背景介绍


Collaborative filtering is one of the most commonly used techniques in recommender systems that are based on user preferences or opinions towards items they have interacted with before. It helps to recommend new products to users based on their past behavior and preferences, which can lead to better product recommendations for the future. There are two main types of collaborative filtering: memory-based and model-based approaches. Memory-based methods use explicit ratings given by users to estimate a user's rating for an item based on his/her similar tastes and preferences of other users who have also rated the same item. Model-based methods learn latent factors from user-item interactions without any prior ratings using algorithms like SVD or NMF. In this article, we will focus on matrix factorization as it has become a popular approach for recommendation tasks due to its efficiency compared to traditional methods like k-NN and clustering. 

Matrix factorization is a technique that decomposes a user-item interaction matrix into the dot product of two low-rank matrices where each row of U (user features) represents a user and each column of V (item features) represents an item. The aim is to find these low-rank matrices such that the predicted ratings for all pairs of users and items can be approximated using the dot product between them. This can help us make more accurate predictions when dealing with sparse data sets and avoid overfitting problems that arise when using models trained on large datasets. One advantage of MF compared to the clustering and k-NN based methods is that it does not require extensive feature engineering or domain knowledge, making it easier to apply in real-world applications. Moreover, MF provides interpretable results that reflect how different attributes affect user preferences and thus provide valuable insights into customer preferences and preferences propagation across the system.

In addition to collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, there are many other recommendation techniques like content-based filtering, hybrid filtering, and graph-based filtering. These methods involve extracting relevant information about the items that users have previously consumed and using it to predict what they would prefer next. However, since these methods do not rely solely on implicit feedback and personal preferences but rather extract patterns from the historical data, they may suffer from several limitations including scalability issues and sparsity problems associated with implicit feedback. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider the appropriate methodology depending on the context of the application at hand.

2. Core Concepts & Relationships
To understand collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, we need to first understand some key concepts and relationships that are involved in building recommendation engines. A few core concepts include:

1. Users and Items: Every entity in the recommendation system is either a user or an item. For example, if we are developing a movie recommender system, then the set of users could be people who have expressed interest in watching movies, while the set of items could be various movies released. Similarly, if we are building a music recommender system, then the set of users could be individual music listeners, while the set of items could be various albums and songs. 

2. Interaction Data: The interaction data consists of records indicating whether a user has interacted with an item. Typically, this data includes explicit ratings, timestamps, or binary values indicating whether the user liked or disliked the item. When working with implicit feedback, only the existence or absence of interactions needs to be captured instead of specific ratings. 

3. Latent Factors: Given the fact that we want our recommendation engine to capture complex user preferences and infer new preferences from incomplete data, the choice of matrix decomposition algorithms becomes important. Traditionally, the common choices were principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). However, recently, neural networks have shown great promise in capturing complex user preferences through deep learning architectures and are becoming increasingly popular in modern recommendation systems. 

4. Rating Prediction: Once we have learned the latent factors representing user preferences and item attributes, we can compute the predicted rating for any pair of users and items using the formula: R_ij = u_i^T v_j + b, where i and j represent indices for users and items respectively, u_i and v_j are the corresponding rows of the user and item features matrices, and b is a bias term. We can optimize the parameters of the model using techniques like gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent so that the error between the actual and predicted ratings is minimized. 

Overall, the basic idea behind both collaborative filtering and matrix factorization is to exploit user preferences and item attributes to predict missing entries in the interaction matrix. The closer the prediction is to the true rating, the higher the confidence level in the recommendation engine’s performance. The choice of algorithmic approach should be driven by the nature of the dataset and the problem at hand, taking into account both computational resources and human evaluation criteria.
