# 1.背景介绍


Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning inspired by behavioral psychology and motivated by the goal of achieving optimal performance in complex environments with uncertain rewards. The name "reinforcement" comes from the idea that an agent can learn to make choices or actions that maximize its long-term reward over time by interacting with its environment. RL has been used successfully for tasks such as robotics control, autonomous vehicles, gaming, etc., but it also applies well to other domains like finance, healthcare, and political decision making. In this article, we will focus on an introduction to reinforcement learning and how it works under the hood. We assume basic familiarity with machine learning concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and neural networks. If you are new to these topics, please refer to existing literature on them before moving forward.

# What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement learning involves training an AI agent to take actions in an environment based on feedback received through its observations. It learns by trial and error and gradually adapts to achieve better performance over time by exploring different options and updating its policy accordingly. A key difference between reinforcement learning and supervised/unsupervised learning lies in the fact that reinforcement learning provides feedback on what happened after taking an action rather than simply predicting the output given input data. This makes it unique compared to traditional methods which only provide predictions. Overall, reinforcement learning offers several benefits:

1. Decision Making: As mentioned earlier, agents can explore multiple options and update their policies to achieve higher scores over time.
2. Control Systems: RL enables us to design intelligent systems capable of optimizing a variety of tasks including robotics, autonomous driving, and economic decisions.
3. Exploration & Exploitation: An agent explores the environment and exploits knowledge gathered about its surroundings to improve its score while avoiding getting trapped in local minima.
4. Complex Environments: With the help of deep reinforcement learning algorithms, RL can handle complex environments with uncertain dynamics and rewards.
5. Scalability: RL can be applied across many industries and applications due to its ability to adapt quickly to new situations.

The problem of finding the best solution for any given problem using reinforcement learning requires an understanding of several fundamental concepts, components, and techniques. Before delving into the details of each one, let's first understand how RL works at a high level. 

# How Does Reinforcement Learning Work?
The core component of reinforcement learning is called an agent, which interacts with an environment to receive rewards and takes actions. The agent receives information about the current state of the world via sensors and passes it to an algorithm called a policy network. The policy network generates an action vector representing the next set of actions the agent should take in response to the current observation. These actions may include moving towards a target object, selecting a specific option, or performing a sequence of steps. By applying the generated action to the environment, the agent receives a scalar reward signal indicating how well the action was executed. The process continues until the episode ends, when the agent stops receiving rewards and begins to search for a new task. At this point, another episode starts and the cycle repeats. The goal of training an RL agent is to find the best policy that maximizes expected cumulative reward during the course of repeated episodes.

In summary, the main steps involved in reinforcement learning are:

1. Initialize the environment and agent.
2. Collect experience tuples (state, action, reward, next_state).
3. Train a Q-learning model or deep Q-network using collected experience tuples.
4. Use trained model to generate actions for the agent in the environment.
5. Update agent's policy based on generated actions and observed rewards.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until convergence or specified number of iterations.

To further explain each step in more detail, we will now dive deeper into the various components and terminology associated with reinforcement learning.

# Components of Reinforcement Learning
Let’s break down each of the components of reinforcement learning and understand what they do in practice.

## Agent
The agent is the entity responsible for executing actions within the environment and collecting rewards based on its actions. In most cases, the agent consists of some form of learned decision-making system that takes inputs from the environment and outputs actions based on its internal states and models. Some examples of agents could be robots, animals, drones, and so forth.

## Environment
The environment refers to everything outside the agent, including the physical world, the surrounding objects, and the interaction between those elements. The agent interacts with the environment to obtain information about its current state and send actions back to influence the state of the environment. Examples of environments could be mobile robotics platforms, gaming simulations, or financial trading markets.

## Action Space
The action space defines all possible actions that the agent can perform within the environment. Actions can range from simple movements to complex maneuvers, depending on the complexity of the environment. For example, a discrete action space might consist of up, down, left, right, forward, backward, fire, no-op, pause, and terminate commands. Continuous action spaces allow for the use of smooth functions instead of discrete movements. Common continuous action spaces include velocity vectors, joint angles, and force magnitudes.

## Observation Space
The observation space represents all possible sensory inputs that the agent can perceive from the environment. Sensory inputs could include images, audio signals, GPS coordinates, temperature readings, and accelerometer values. The shape and size of the observation space depend on the type of environment being simulated.

## Reward Function
The reward function specifies the numerical value provided by the agent for accomplishing a particular task. The agent receives positive or negative reward depending on whether it performed the correct action or not. The reward function depends on the objective of the agent, the constraints placed upon it, and the degree to which it achieves its goals.

## Policy Network
The policy network maps the current state of the environment to a probability distribution over all possible actions. This distribution is then sampled to produce the actual action taken by the agent. Different types of policy networks exist, ranging from simple feedforward networks to more sophisticated convolutional networks.

## Value Network
The value network estimates the expected future return of the agent, given its current state. This estimate is used to guide the exploration process of the agent by encouraging it to explore states with high predicted returns early on in the episode and encourage it to exploit known safe states if possible. It is typically implemented using a separate neural network that takes the same input as the policy network and produces a scalar value representing the estimated future discounted reward.

Overall, there are four major components to reinforcement learning: the agent, the environment, the action space, and the observation space. Each of these components contributes to the overall decision making process by providing insights into the current state of the environment and allowing the agent to choose appropriate actions to take. The remaining three components – reward function, policy network, and value network – complement these core components and act as optimization mechanisms to maximize agent performance over time.
