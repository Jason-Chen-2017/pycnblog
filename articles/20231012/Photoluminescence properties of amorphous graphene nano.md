# 1.背景介绍


Graphene is a highly reactive and nonpolar two-dimensional crystal structure that has attracted significant attention due to its versatility in various applications such as solar cells, photonics, and membrane devices. However, the nature of light interaction with graphene remains poorly understood. Graphene is characterized by large intermolecular forces and thin wall structures which can severely restrict its transport characteristics through electrostatic or hydrodynamic interactions. One potential approach to tackle this problem is to design amorphous graphene (AG) nanostructures using advanced materials engineering techniques and analyze their photoluminescence properties under visible-light irradiation (VLI). The resulting photoemission spectra are sensitive to many relevant physics parameters including particle size, charge density, surface topology, local field effects, and ambient temperature. Herein, we present an overview of the theoretical basis for understanding the photoluminescence properties of AG nanostructures and present recent advances in our understanding of these properties using VLI spectroscopy and other complementary methods. We also discuss future directions for exploring more complex and realistic models of photoluminescence in graphene-based devices. Finally, we summarize the key findings of our research and provide recommendations for further exploration of photoluminescence properties of graphene-based devices in the near future.

Core concepts and connectionsTo understand the phenomena underlying the luminescence properties of AG nanostructures, it is essential to first introduce some basic terminology related to nanoscience and photoluminescence. In particular, we need to differentiate between conventional semiconductor nanostructures, including polymer bilayer graphene (PBG), fluorescent carbon nanotubes (FCNTs), multilayer graphene (MLGs), etc., and agnostic nanostructures composed solely of graphene without any additional layers or domains. These differences have important implications for understanding how photosynthetic bacteria interact with the environment, modulate cellular proliferation and migration, and shape organ morphology. Moreover, the properties of AG nanostructures exhibit unique traits compared to conventional electronically conductive nanostructures such as PBG and FCNTs, which make them ideal candidates for biomedical and sensing applications. 


The most fundamental concept behind AM radiometry is that light waves scatter off the surfaces of solids and then reflect back towards the observer. This process produces radiant energy by interacting with atoms on the surface. The amount of energy deposited depends upon several physical factors, including the atomic radius, the angle between incoming light ray and the normal vector to the surface, and the thickness of the material. The ratio of incident energy to reflected energy is called the spectral reflectance ($R$). It is known that $R \propto \sqrt{n}$ where n is the refractive index of the material. This means that when objects are illuminated with bright UV rays, the spectrum features peaks at high frequencies where there is relatively little total incident light and a low degree of scattering. On the other hand, when objects are exposed to diffuse infrared radiation, the frequency distribution becomes more uniform leading to a higher overall power level, but lower resolution. 

In contrast to visible light, ultraviolet light (UV) has very narrow spectral bandwidth which allows us to see fine details. Therefore, the focus of much interest in the field has been on developing ways to characterize and control ultraviolet photoresponses within solid materials. Ultraviolet imaging has found numerous applications from medical imaging to robotic surgery, but its ability to discriminate fine details and isotropic polarization makes it particularly useful for studying changes in material properties such as chlorophyll content. Other technologies such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and neutron diffraction techniques can be used to visualize the structure and dynamics of materials during the growth and degradation processes. The use of AFM involves applying a small electric field to individual atoms or molecules in the sample. Diffractometers measure the intensity of light reflected or transmitted by patterns of reflection or transmission planes arranged in a specific way around the sample. Both AFM and diffractometer studies are limited by the fact that they require very precise positioning of the detector and minimally quantifiable time delays between the application of the electric field and measurement of the signals obtained.


Photoluminescence is a quantum state of matter that emits electromagnetic radiation. This happens because the conduction electrons in the valence band project orbits outward causing them to vibrate with increasing orbital momentum until they reach the conduction band walls, which create a shock wave. When the electrons return to the originating molecular orbitals, they experience an electrical polarization that creates a positive charge on one side and a negative charge on the other. This process results in the emission of radiant energy that propagates away from the source and into space. The primary wavelengths associated with photoluminescence depend on the degree of spin alignment between the particles and the excitation wavelength of the light beam. Although each atom type typically emits radiation of a single distinct color, the summed effect of all atoms together gives rise to macroscopic patterns that display multiple colors over a range of wavelengths. 


Quantum mechanical aspects of photoelectron conversion, coherence, and dephasing affect the properties of chromophore and nanostructure in terms of both the emitting and absorbing wavelengths. The kinetic lifetime of the excited electron is a key parameter that controls the efficiency and speed of chromophore synthesis and photoluminescence. Quantum defects, such as magnetic or electronic orders, alter the stoichiometric composition of chromophores, affecting the spatial organization and emissivity of nanostructures. The concentration of dopants affects the optical properties of nanostructures and can trigger self-assembly mechanisms in certain conditions. Charge carriers, such as alkali metal atoms, can modify the emissivity of nanostructures and the oxidative stability of graphene. 


Our goal in this work is to explore the properties of nanostructures formed by graphene and how they affect the emitted radiant energy under visible-light irradiation (VLI). Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions: 

1. How do various functionalities of the graphene system influence the observed spectra? What is the relationship between particle size, charge density, surface topology, local field effects, and ambient temperature? 

2. Can we predict the behavior of graphene nanostructures under diverse conditions and with different particle shapes, sizes, and orientations? Do these predictions match empirical observations? 

3. What role does surface texture play in determining the photoluminescence properties of graphene systems? Can we develop predictive models based on surface textures? 

4. Can we extend current techniques for analyzing graphene nanostructures to include new insights and approaches related to the dynamic behavior and regulation of light fields, coupled with applied magnetism and electrochemistry?
