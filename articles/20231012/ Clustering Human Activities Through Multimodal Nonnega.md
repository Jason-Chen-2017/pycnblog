# 1.背景介绍


The era of big data has brought the development of new technologies for collecting and analyzing large amounts of multimedia data such as videos, audios or images. With these advances in data collection, analysis, and modeling, a new field emerged: understanding human behavior based on multimodal data. In particular, there is an increasing interest in studying how humans interact with different objects, activities and environments through multimodal sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, accelerometers). The objective of this paper is to analyze the activity patterns from multimodal nonnegative tensor factorization (MNTF) perspective. This approach involves decomposing multimodal signals into multiple components that are relevant to each other and simultaneously capturing the semantics across modalities. Based on the extracted features, we can discover the latent structures in multimodal activity data by clustering them into different groups according to their similarity.

In this work, we propose an MNTF-based framework for clustering human activities from multimodal sensor data. We first extract the motion and semantic features from multimodal sensor data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which capture the spatial variations and content information in visual/audio modalities respectively. Then, we decompose these two sets of features into multiple components that are mutually dependent and jointly represent both spatial and temporal dependencies between multimodal signals. Finally, we cluster these components into different activity types by solving an optimization problem that captures the relationships among the components. We evaluate our method on realistic and challenging datasets including activity recognition in videos and detection of collabarative interactions in social media. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for clustering human activities from multimodal sensor data.

## Multimodal Sensor Data
Multimodal sensor data refers to data collected from more than one modality, e.g., audio, image, or video, at once. It combines various sources of information about the environment and enables us to understand the complex behaviors of people. 

For example, if someone makes an effortful gesture or draws a figure with his hand, it may appear as distinct activities of gesturing or drawing while maintaining the same individual identity. Similarly, a person’s voice and facial expressions can be classified separately but they belong to the same group of behaviors due to common characteristics. Therefore, multimodal sensor data can provide insights into the underlying motions, interactions, and semantics of human behavior.


## Multi-View Video Learning
Multi-view learning is a popular technique used to learn complex visual concepts in deep learning models. In multi-view learning, instead of processing only single views of an image or a sequence, we process all possible combinations of views to capture complementary information. For instance, in computer vision tasks, we have multiple instances of images taken from different angles, lightings, and viewpoints. By combining these different views, the model learns robust representations that generalize better to unseen situations.

Similarly, in human activity recognition tasks, we use multiple views of the same behavior (i.e., multiple camera views, close-up shots, etc.) captured over time to capture different aspects of the behavior. The goal is to identify similar behaviors even though the observations were made under different conditions.  

## Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning architectures designed for image classification and object detection tasks. CNNs consist of several layers of interconnected filters that process input images to produce feature maps. Each filter extracts specific features from the input image and passes them through the next layer.

In human activity recognition, we can apply CNNs to extract motion and semantic features from raw multimodal sensor data, specifically video sequences. Specifically, we train separate CNNs to classify frames in a video clip as either static or dynamic. To capture motion information, we use a series of convolutional filters along the depth dimension of the video frame, where each filter focuses on extracting certain parts of the scene that change over time. These filters allow the network to detect changes in the appearance of objects and scenes over time. Similarly, to capture semantics, we employ filters that focus on recognizing specific objects, actions, or events occurring in the scene.

We also incorporate global motion descriptors into our CNN architecture, which capture overall motion dynamics and direction in the video sequence. These descriptors help the network discriminate between different motions within the same sequence. Overall, the combination of motion and semantic features provides strong performance in human activity recognition tasks.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
To implement the above ideas, we developed a novel multimodal nonnegative tensor factorization (MNTF) framework. Here is a brief overview of its main steps and algorithmic details.

1. Input Preprocessing: Before applying any machine learning algorithms, we preprocess the input multimodal sensor data by normalizing and denoising the signal, segmenting the videos into small clips of fixed size, and aligning the timestamps of different modalities. 

2. Feature Extraction: Given preprocessed input data, we extract motion and semantic features from each clip using a stacked autoencoder (SAE)-like architecture. SAE consists of three main components: encoder, decoder, and skip connections between consecutive blocks. At the end of the encoding stage, we obtain a shared representation of the motion and semantic features. Next, we perform late fusion to combine these two feature vectors into a unified vector per video clip. We then normalize each feature vector to make them nonnegative, ensuring that the resulting factors do not violate constraints such as nonnegativity or sparsity during clustering.

3. Nonnegative Tensor Factorization: Once we obtain the normalized multimodal features, we proceed to solve the following optimization problem to formulate the MNTF algorithm:

\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m_i}\left( \frac{||X_{ij} - F_{\theta}(S_{ij}) ||^2}{||X_{ij}||^2 + \lambda}\right)

where $n$ represents the number of videos, $m_i$ represents the number of clips in each video, $\theta$ represents the set of latent factors, $(X_{ij}, S_{ij})$ represents the pairwise comparison between features extracted from $i$-th and $j$-th clip of $i$-th video, $F_{\theta}$ represents the function mapping the factors to the original space, and $\lambda$ is a regularization parameter controlling the tradeoff between the fit of the learned factors to the training data and the sparsity of the solution. The equation represents a reconstruction term between the original features and the reconstructed ones after applying the decomposition functions. Intuitively, we want to find the factors that minimize the squared error between the observed values and the predicted values obtained by applying the factorized functions. 

However, optimizing this loss directly is NP-hard, making exact inference difficult. Therefore, we relax this constraint by introducing a variational approximation that assumes a tractable distribution for the latent variables. Specifically, given the data matrix $X$, we consider a Gaussian mixture model with diagonal covariance matrices and a prior hyperparameter $\alpha$. We fix the parameters of the prior $\mu^{(k)}$ and $\Sigma^{(k)}$ and optimize the posterior distributions $\mu^{(k|i)}, \Sigma^{(k|i)}$ for each cell $X_{ij}$ to maximize the ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound) defined as follows:

\max_{\pi,\eta} \mathbb{E}_{q(\theta | X, \eta)}\left[\log p(\theta)\right] - KL\left[ q(\theta|\eta) \Vert p(\theta) \right]

where $\pi$ and $\eta$ represent the mixture proportions and component assignments, respectively, and $q(\theta|\eta)$ is the approximate posterior distribution.

Once we obtain the estimated parameters $\mu^{(k|i)}, \Sigma^{(k|i)}$ for each cell $X_{ij}$, we use these estimates to update the current factors $\theta^{t}$. Finally, we repeat step 3 until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Here is the detailed mathematical derivation of the algorithm:

First, let's consider the pairwise comparisons $(X_{ij}, S_{ij})$ generated from the multimodal features. We assume that there exists a fixed set of candidate factors $\mathcal{K}$ whose cardinality is equal to the total number of cells in the dataset multiplied by the number of modes (in this case, it would be $nm\times k$). We further assume that there exist positive definite weight matrices $\Psi_{\theta, i}, \Psi_{\theta, j}$ associated with each mode $k$ that encode the relationship between the latent factors $\theta$ and the corresponding multimodal feature pairs $(X_{ij}, S_{ij})$. The weight matrices depend on the selected value of the factor indices $i,j$. Thus, we need to learn these weight matrices using an auxiliary task called "mode selection". We can define the weights as follows:

$$W_{ik}^{\text{(shared)}} = W_{ik}^{\text{(spatial)}} + W_{ik}^{\text{(temporal)}} $$
$$W_{jk}^{\text{(shared)}} = W_{jk}^{\text{(spatial)}} + W_{jk}^{\text{(temporal)}} $$

These weights ensure that the inferred factors are able to capture both the spatial and temporal dependencies between the pairwise comparisons. Let's call these weights $\Omega$ for simplicity.

Next, we derive the probabilistic graphical model describing the dependency structure of the pairwise comparisons:

$$p(X_{ij}, S_{ij}|Z_{ij}=k,\hat{\theta}_k, W_{ik}, W_{jk},\Psi_{\theta, i}, \Psi_{\theta, j},\mu^{(k|i)}, \Sigma^{(k|i)})=\mathcal{N}\left(X_{ij};\underbrace{\hat{\theta}_k^\top W_{ik}}_{\text{spatial factor}} + \underbrace{\hat{\theta}_{k+m}^\top W_{jk}}_{\text{temporal factor}},\Sigma_{ij}\right)$$

where $Z_{ij}$ indicates whether the $i$-th observation comes before the $j$-th observation in time ($Z_{ij}=1$) or otherwise ($Z_{ij}=0$). Note that here we assumed that we split each video into equally long segments of fixed duration, so we could easily compute the length of each segment without additional information. If this assumption does not hold, we need to introduce some extra complexity into the model to handle variable lengths of videos. Also note that we assumed that we have access to ground truth labels for each clip, so we can evaluate the accuracy of our model during training and testing phases.

Now, we move on to deriving the ELBO objective function, which is the key ingredient to updating the approximate posteriors using Variational Bayesian methods. We start by writing down the log-likelihood term:

\begin{align*}
\ln p(\mathbf{X}) &= \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \ln p(X_{ij}, S_{ij}|Z_{ij}=1,\hat{\theta}_k, W_{ik}, W_{jk},\Psi_{\theta, i}, \Psi_{\theta, j},\mu^{(k|i)}, \Sigma^{(k|i)}) \\
&+ \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \ln p(X_{ij}, S_{ij}|Z_{ij}=0,\hat{\theta}_k, W_{ik}, W_{jk},\Psi_{\theta, i}, \Psi_{\theta, j},\mu^{(k|i)}, \Sigma^{(k|i)}) 
\end{align*}

Note that we assume independent priors for the factors for now, meaning that $p(\theta)=\prod_{k=1}^K\mathcal{N}(\theta_k;\mu_\theta, \sigma_\theta)$ where $\mu_\theta, \sigma_\theta$ are scalar mean and variance parameters, respectively. We can write out the complete conditional probability distribution for the latent factors given the observed data, which gives us the final expression for the ELBO:

\begin{align*}
&\ln p(\mathbf{X}) \\
&\approx \ln \sum_{z_{ij}}\prod_{l=1}^L q_{l}(Z_{ij}=z_{ij})\prod_{k=1}^K\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\prod_{i=1}^m\prod_{j=1}^{m'}q_{l}(Z_{ij}=z_{ij}|X_{ij}, S_{ij},\hat{\theta}_k, W_{ik}, W_{jk},\Psi_{\theta, i}, \Psi_{\theta, j},\mu^{(k|i)}, \Sigma^{(k|i)})\cdot \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}[(X_{ij}-F_{\hat{\theta}_k}(S_{ij}))]^\top\left(\Sigma_{ij}^{-1}[\Omega]_{\substack{kl\\l<m'}}+\Sigma_{i'j'}^{-1}[\Omega]_{\substack{kl\\l'\neq l'}}\right)[(X_{ij}'-F_{\hat{\theta}_{k+m'}}(S_{ij'}))]\right)\\
&\quad\quad \cdot \mathcal{N}(X_{ij};\underbrace{\hat{\theta}_k^\top W_{ik} + \hat{\theta}_{k+m}^\top W_{jk}}_{\text{spatial factor}} + \underbrace{\hat{\theta}_{k+2m}^\top W_{lk}}_{\text{temporal factor}},\Sigma_{ij}\right)\\
&\approx \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}\ln q_{l}(Z_{ij}=1)+\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}\ln q_{l}(Z_{ij}=0) + const.
\end{align*}

This expression contains the likelihood terms for the two pairwise comparisons $(X_{ij}, S_{ij})$ corresponding to each pixel position, weighted by the marginal probabilities $q_{l}(Z_{ij}=z_{ij})$. This corresponds to the outer product sum over the latent variables and the integer variables representing the assignment of each observation to one of the modes. The inner products inside the exponential term correspond to computing the expected value of the cross-modal correlation between two pixels in the two views. This quantity should measure the agreement between the observed multimodal signals and the decoded representation of the latent factors computed by our model. Finally, the negative log-posterior term measures the difference between the estimated factor means and variances and the true values obtained from the dataset. We try to maximize this value with respect to the latent variables $\theta$, conditioned on the observed data and the segmentation label. The constant depends on the normalization constants and cannot be eliminated in closed form, but it can be approximated efficiently using numerical techniques like stochastic gradient descent or conjugate gradients.
