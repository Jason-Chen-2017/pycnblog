# 1.背景介绍


Deep learning has made significant progress in many areas of computer science, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, developing a deep learning application requires expertise in various aspects such as machine learning algorithms, programming languages, data structures, databases, etc., which can be time-consuming and challenging for beginners. In this article, we will introduce how to build a deep learning application using Tensorflow and Keras libraries with the help of an example. We assume that you have basic knowledge about machine learning concepts and practical applications. Moreover, you should have some experience on building neural networks with convolutional layers (CNN). If not, please refer to our previous articles on CNNs or any other resources online.

In general, deep learning is used to solve complex problems by combining multiple shallow models together to create more powerful models. The power of deep learning lies in its ability to automatically learn complex patterns in large datasets without being explicitly programmed to do so. With appropriate techniques such as transfer learning and fine tuning, it is possible to train a model to perform specific tasks faster and more accurately than traditional methods. In addition, the availability of high-performance computing (HPC) systems coupled with cloud platforms enables researchers to scale their workloads to larger datasets. Therefore, building a successful deep learning application requires careful consideration of all these factors.

Before starting writing the blog post, I would like to make sure I am clear on several key points:

1. Who is this article for?
	This article is intended for technical professionals who want to learn how to develop a deep learning application using popular machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow and Keras. Some familiarity with machine learning concepts and practical applications are assumed.

2. What level of expertise does the reader require?
	The average reader should be familiar with basic Python programming skills and at least intermediate understanding of machine learning concepts and applications. Familiarity with deep learning concepts and CNNs would also be helpful but not essential.

3. What background information should the reader already possess?
	To follow along with this tutorial, readers need to have some knowledge of machine learning and deep learning terminology. They must also understand the concept of feature extraction and representation learning. These topics are covered in great detail in our previous articles on CNNs. Additionally, they may find it useful to read through existing tutorials on Tensorflow and Keras to get a deeper understanding of the library's features and functions.

# 2.Core Concepts and Relationship
## Machine Learning Terminology
Machine learning involves the use of algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions. There are different types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and recommendation systems. 

Supervised learning refers to training machines to identify patterns in labeled data. It involves providing the algorithm with examples of input data and correct output values known as labels. During training, the algorithm learns the mapping between inputs and outputs based on examples provided. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Unsupervised learning involves clustering similar examples into groups while ignoring noise or outliers. Reinforcement learning is focused on optimizing rewards or penalties obtained during interactions with an environment. Recommendation systems suggest items or services that users might be interested in based on past behavior or preferences.

When working with deep learning, there are two main categories of terms to keep track of: 

1. Data preprocessing - This involves cleaning, formatting, transforming, and preparing the data for use in machine learning algorithms. 
2. Model architecture - This defines the structure and topology of the neural network used for classification or prediction. 


## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), short for Capsules Networks, are one type of deep neural networks that are particularly well suited for handling visual data. They are specifically designed to process pixel data, making them well-suited for image recognition and object detection tasks. A CNN consists of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers.

A convolution layer applies filters to the input image to extract features that are important for identifying objects in the images. For each filter, the convolution operation produces a set of weights, which are multiplied elementwise across the input pixels to produce new feature maps. Each filter then moves over the input image and creates its own feature map. Pooling layers downsample the feature maps to reduce computational complexity and improve accuracy. Finally, fully connected layers provide classifications or predictions based on the combined results of the convolution and pooling layers.

## Transfer Learning
Transfer learning refers to the technique where a pre-trained model is used as the basis for a new task. This reduces the amount of training required for the new task because the pre-trained model already learned important features that correspond to the same concepts. When applied correctly, transfer learning can significantly enhance performance when compared to training from scratch.

There are three common ways to apply transfer learning in deep learning:

1. Feature Extraction - This involves taking the representations learned by a pre-trained model and applying them to a new dataset. This is commonly done before the final classification layers in a CNN.

2. Fine Tuning - This involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model to fit a new dataset. This is commonly done after the last convolutional layer or pool layer of a pre-trained CNN. The idea here is to preserve the higher-level features learned by the original model and retrain only the final layers for the target task.

3. Domain Adaptation - This involves adapting a pre-trained model to work with a new domain, such as medical imaging. This typically involves altering the pre-trained model to better match the new data distribution and modality.

These approaches can be combined depending on the complexity of the problem and available compute resources.
