# 1.背景介绍


Semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm where labeled and unlabeled data are used together to learn a model or policy that can effectively generalize to new, unseen environments without requiring extensive human labeling of the new environment. It has emerged as an important research area within artificial intelligence due to its ability to solve problems in many real-world applications with limited training data available. In this survey article, we will discuss the state-of-the-art semi-supervised reinforcement learning algorithms, review their key ideas, limitations, and advantages, analyze their performance on various tasks, and also provide insights into future directions for improvement and research opportunities. This work will enable practitioners to select appropriate SSL algorithms for specific problem domains while considering factors such as computational complexity, ease of use, robustness against noisy data, and transferability across different task settings. 

# 2.Core Concepts and Relationships
Semi-supervised reinforcement learning involves using both labeled and unlabeled data during training to improve the accuracy and efficiency of learning policies from experience. The core concepts include "semi-" supervision, which refers to the fact that some information about the labels may be unavailable but can still help to guide the agent's actions; dataset shift, which occurs when the distribution of samples changes over time from the one seen during training to a completely novel one; exploration versus exploitation tradeoff, which determines how much the agent should prioritize exploring new states versus optimizing current knowledge to maximize rewards in the long term. Additionally, several methods have been proposed based on variations of these principles, including active learning, latent variable models, density estimation, kernel methods, domain adaptation, and multi-task learning. We will focus specifically on the most popular techniques, i.e., deep reinforcement learning and active learning. 


Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), also known as Q-learning, combines neural networks with reinforcement learning to find optimal policies directly from high-dimensional observations provided by an environment. DRL has proven itself effective in solving complex control problems and has demonstrated impressive results in robotics, gaming, and other areas where RL is widely used. However, it requires significant amounts of labeled training data to achieve good performance. Active learning, on the other hand, aims at reducing the amount of required labeled data by selecting informative instances automatically using feedback from the agent. It allows the algorithm to train more quickly than traditional methods because fewer examples need to be annotated.


The fundamental idea behind DRL and active learning is to leverage the structure of the underlying optimization problem and the availability of unlabeled data to explore more efficiently and improve learning speed. Specifically, in DRL, the agent interacts with the environment through trial-and-error steps and tries to minimize the expected reward while improving the action selection process based on recent experiences. By using a policy gradient method instead of just looking at the immediate reward, DRL learns faster and converges better to a near-optimal policy. On the other hand, in active learning, the agent selects informative instances based on uncertainty estimates generated by a probabilistic model trained on the labeled data, and trains on only those instances selected for annotation. By sampling instances that are likely to be useful in achieving maximum reward later, active learning reduces the burden of manual labeling and provides improved sample diversity compared to passive learning approaches like random search. Both DRL and active learning can benefit from using semi-supervision alongside labeled data, especially if there is little or no overlap between the two sets.


Dataset shift refers to situations where the input distributions change dramatically from the ones encountered during training, leading to severe challenges for the agent to properly generalize to unseen environments. One approach to address dataset shift is to employ domain adaptation techniques, which adjust the agent's parameters and policy to match the new distribution of inputs. Another technique is to generate synthetic data using generative adversarial networks (GANs), which synthesize images or videos that mimic the behavior of the original distribution. Other techniques involve predicting missing values in partially labeled datasets using techniques such as imputation or regression, or generating pseudo-labels using clustering or k-nearest neighbors classification. Overall, handling dataset shift requires careful design of the learning framework and careful monitoring of the progression of the learning process, ensuring that the agent stays up-to-date and competent even in challenging environments.

Exploration versus exploitation is another critical aspect of the learning process, which controls whether the agent explores new regions of the state space or focuses on promising regions to maximize cumulative rewards. One common strategy is to balance exploration and exploitation using temperature scaling, which decreases the degree of exploration as the agent becomes more confident in its decision making. Alternatively, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) uses game tree search to simulate possible futures and estimate the value of each move before making a final decision. MCTS enables the agent to take advantage of subtle correlations among choices and takes care of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff implicitly.


In summary, SSL consists of incorporating unlabeled data in addition to labeled data to enhance the overall quality and efficiency of the learned model. Deep reinforcement learning and active learning offer efficient and effective ways to learn policies from experience, while minimizing the need for extensive human annotations and dealing with dataset shifts. Domain adaptation techniques and GANs can handle large-scale dataset shift, while prediction methods such as imputation and regression can fill in missing data or correct outliers. Exploration versus exploitation issues can be mitigated by adjusting temperature scaling or using MCTS to balance exploration and exploitation dynamically.
