# 1.背景介绍


Statistical machine translation (SMT) is a challenging problem in natural language processing where the goal is to translate source sentences into target sentences based on statistical information of the source and target languages. The popular approaches to SMT such as rule-based systems, probabilistic models and neural networks are all computationally expensive and slow. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder framework that generates phrase representations from input sequences by encoding them with an LSTM-based recurrent neural network (RNN), and then decodes these representations into output sequences using another RNN. We use attention mechanisms to model the interdependencies between different parts of each sequence during decoding, thereby enabling our system to handle long or variable length inputs. Experiments show that our approach achieves competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art methods in SMT tasks including English-German translation, Chinese-English translation, WMT’14 English-French translation, IWSLT’14 German-English translation, and newswire sentiment analysis.

# 2.核心概念与联系
Before going any further, let us discuss some core terms and ideas that will be used throughout this article. These include:

1. **Phrase representation** - A vector representation of a sentence which captures its semantic meaning through word order and syntactic structure. Word embeddings have been proven effective at capturing contextual semantics but they cannot capture the dependency between words within phrases due to their one-hot encodings. Hence, it becomes important to extract meaningful representations of phrases in addition to individual words.

2. **Attention mechanism** - It enables a decoder to focus more on certain parts of the encoded input when generating the corresponding output token. This can help the decoder generate better translations and reduces the risk of producing nonsensical outputs. Attention scores are computed based on similarity measures between the current hidden state of the decoder and the entire encoded input sequence.

3. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** - An artificial neural network architecture consisting of repeating modules that perform a specific task over sequential data such as time series, text or images. 

4. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** - A type of RNN cell used in deep learning that maintains both short-term memory and long-term memory. LSTMs are capable of handling very long sequences efficiently because of their ability to maintain state without having to reset it frequently.

5. **Encoder-Decoder Framework** - A technique that combines an encoder and a decoder to produce a translation between two languages. Encoders process the input sequence to obtain a fixed sized latent representation while decoders take this representation as input and generate the output sequence.

Now, we move towards discussing the algorithmic details and how they play a crucial role in building up the model. 

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
The proposed method works on the principle of passing sentence level features through multiple layers of LSTM cells until they reach a suitable dimensionality to represent the entire sentence. This is done by concatenating every single hidden layer state obtained after passing each word of the sentence through the LSTM along with positional information like distance between adjacent words or consecutive pairs of words. This final feature vector is fed to a linear layer followed by softmax function which gives out probability distribution for every possible target word given the input sentence. During training, cross entropy loss is calculated between predicted target words and actual ones, and optimizer is used to update weights accordingly. In inference mode, we simply select the most probable target word for each step of decoding.


## Encoding Stage


Firstly, the encoder takes a sequence of words as input, denoted as x = [x1,..., xi], i = 1...n and converts it into a sequence of vectors, z = [z1,..., zn]. Each element of the resulting sequence represents a hidden state h^l(t). Here l refers to the index of the layer and t refers to the timestep within that particular layer.

Each word in the input sequence is embedded into a dense vector using either pre-trained embedding vectors or newly trained embedding vectors. Then, these vectors are processed through several layers of stacked LSTM units, each responsible for obtaining a unique set of hidden states across the entire sequence of words. For each unit, we pass in the concatenation of the previous hidden state h(t-1) and input word embedding at that time step, so that we preserve both the temporal relationships and the global dependencies between words. Finally, we apply dropout regularization to reduce the chance of overfitting to the training data. At each time step t, we also compute an attention score alpha_ti based on the dot product between the hidden state h^l(t) and the output of the previous decoder RNN s_(t-1). Using alpha_ti and weighted sum pooling, we obtain the context vector c_t. We repeat this process for each layer l = 1...L and concatenate the resulting h^l(t) and c_t together to get the final representation h^L(t), which is sent to the next stage.

## Decoding Stage


The decoder module receives the final state h^L(n) generated by the encoder as input and generates the target sentence y = [y1,..., yk] by sequentially selecting the next best word at each step k = 1...n. At each time step k, we pass in the current target word, previous state h^(l)(k-1), context vector c_t, and previous attention weight beta_(k-1), and decode the next target word y^(k+1). The initial decoder input is initialized to be <SOS>, and the final output symbol is <EOS>.

To implement attention, we use the same attention score calculation as before but this time we calculate the attention scores between the hidden state h^l(k) and the previously generated output tokens y_j. The attention weights are normalized by dividing them by the normalizer term Z = sum(exp(alpha_{ij}) for all j = 1...n), and then we multiply them with the appropriate output y_j to get the weighted average representation v_k. We then feed this weighted representation v_k into the next LSTM unit as well as send it back to the previous decoder RNN s_(k-1) along with the current input token y_(k+1). Once again, we repeat this process for each layer l = 1...L to generate the desired number of output words y = [y1,..., yk].
