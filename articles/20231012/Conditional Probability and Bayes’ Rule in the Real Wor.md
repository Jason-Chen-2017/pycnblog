## 2.1 Conditionality
In probability theory, conditional probability refers to the likelihood of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. It is denoted as P(A|B), where A and B are events with P(A) representing the unconditional probability (the probability of occurrence of A without any context). In other words, if we know that a certain condition is true, the probability of seeing the outcome will depend on this condition being true or false. 

For example, let's say you flip a coin twice, then there are four possible outcomes: HH, HT, TH, and TT. If you know that the first flip was heads, then the probability of getting either Tails after the second flip would be equal to 1/2 = P(TH | H), which means that if your first flip resulted in Heads, then your chance of getting tails when you flip again does not depend on whether it lands heads or tails.

Formally, conditional probability can also be defined as follows:
P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, for all A,B such that P(A)>0, P(B)>0. We use the logical AND operator (&) to represent the intersection between two events, and the numerator represents the probability of observing both A and B together, while the denominator represents the probability of observing B alone. The conditional probability tells us how likely an event A is to occur, given that another event B has already occurred, based on our observations. By extension, conditional probabilities can be used to describe many real-world situations in which different factors influence the probability of one result occurring relative to others. For instance, suppose we want to calculate the probability of rolling a certain number on two dice. Suppose we have prior information that the two dice should add up to seven. Then the probability of observing these sums depends on the value rolled on each die; since one die must always land six (for a total sum of nine or ten), the remaining five possibilities are only considered once we observe the sum of the two dice. Therefore, the probability distribution over the values rolled by the two dice conditioned on the requirement that their sum equals seven is determined by analyzing historical data collected from previous rolls.

## 2.2 Bayes' Rule
The Bayesian approach to inference involves expressing uncertainty about unknown variables using probability distributions. Given some prior knowledge of a random variable, the posterior probability distribution can be calculated using Bayes' rule:

$$P(\theta|D)=\frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)}=\frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{\int_{\theta} P(D|\theta)P(\theta)d\theta}$$

Here, $\theta$ represents the set of parameters of interest, $D$ represents the observed data, $P(\theta)$ represents the prior distribution of the parameter space, and $P(D|\theta)$ is the likelihood function, which gives the probability of the data given a particular choice of parameters. Intuitively, the term on the right-hand side of the equation calculates the updated belief in $\theta$ after having seen the data D. This updated belief takes into account the prior information we have about $\theta$, and incorporates the evidence provided by the new data through the likelihood function. To see why this formula works, consider the following thought experiment: Suppose we have a bag containing three red balls and two green balls. We randomly draw out two balls and note that they are both green. Is our initial guess that the next ball we pick out will be green correct? In other words, what is the probability of drawing a green ball at time $t+1$ given that we drew a green ball at time $t$.

To answer this question, we need to evaluate the prior distribution of $\theta_t=w_{t-1}$ and the likelihood function $P(D_t|w_t)$. Let's assume we start off with a prior distribution of $\theta_0=0.5$ for the probability of picking a green ball at time $t$. Based on past experience, we believe that the probability of picking a green ball at time $t$ decreases with every successive failure to get a green ball until eventually it becomes impossible to succeed. Specifically, we expect the probability of picking a green ball at time $t$ to converge to zero as $t$ goes to infinity. Thus, the corresponding prior density function is proportional to $e^{-t}$. We further assume that the probability of getting a green ball after two successes is greater than the probability of failing to get a green ball on the second try, so we model this process using a binomial distribution with parameters $n=2$ and $p=\frac{\text{success}}{\text{total}}=\frac{1}{2}$.

We now look at the likelihood function. If we were to draw a green ball at time $t$ and see it again at time $t+1$, the resulting joint distribution of $(w_t, w_{t+1})$ would be uniformly distributed among the four possible combinations of colors. On average, this would happen $\frac{1}{4}$ of the time, giving a likelihood of $\frac{1}{4}$. Similarly, if we were to see a green ball followed by a red ball, the probability would still be $\frac{1}{4}$, but because the combination is exclusive, we would need to subtract $\frac{1}{4}$ to arrive at the same overall likelihood as before. Overall, assuming that we perform the experiment precisely enough, the likelihood function is constant across all potential future outcomes of the experiment.

Finally, we combine these quantities using Bayes' rule, which says that the final posterior probability distribution over $\theta_t$ is proportional to the product of the likelihood function $P(D_t|w_t)$ and the prior distribution $P(\theta_t)$. Since the prior density function approaches zero as $t$ grows large, the posterior density becomes increasingly peaked around its mode, which corresponds to the highest-probability parameter setting under the prior constraints. Our current best guess is therefore that the next ball drawn will be green, but with more confidence as the experiment progresses.

### Summary
Bayesian statistics provides a powerful tool for modeling probabilistic relationships between data and parameters of interest. Understanding the basic concepts behind conditional probability and Bayes' rule allows us to apply them effectively to a wide range of problems in statistical inference and decision making.
