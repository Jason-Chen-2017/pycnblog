# 1.背景介绍


Neural response generation models typically generate responses based on input sequences and previous system responses as context information. However, their generated responses may not always be appropriate for the given user utterance or task at hand, especially in tasks where explicit goal specification is required such as dialogue systems. Therefore, we need to fine-tune these neural response generation models to the specific target user utterance or domain. In this work, we propose a method called "Retrofitting" that enables us to transfer the knowledge learned from other related domains into our model for better personalized and diverse responses. Specifically, we first train a generic language model using a large amount of unlabeled data collected from multiple domains. Then we apply it to the target domain with only limited labeled training data by jointly finetuning both the textual embeddings and the underlying generative model parameters through backpropagation. We evaluate our approach on two different datasets: Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus (CMDC) and Multi-domain DSTC9 Track 2 dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all metrics for retrofitting CMRD to new domains while achieving competitive performance on CMDT test set. We also explore the potential benefits of applying our approach to dialogue systems and conclude that it could help improve naturalness and accuracy of dialogues under various scenarios.

Language Modeling: A language model generates probability distributions over possible sentences in a natural language according to their likelihood of occurrence in the training corpus. It can be used to calculate the perplexity score of a sentence given its vocabulary and word order probabilities. 

Dialogue Systems: The dialogue system consists of modules like nlu(natural language understanding), dsl(dialogue script language) and dm(dialog management). NLU takes raw user inputs and extracts semantic meaning from them which are then fed to DSL engine for processing. The output of DSL engine is usually an intent and entity list which defines the desired action or object to interact with. DM module then processes the command further and sends necessary messages/response to the end user.

Response Generation: Neural response generator models take a sequence of words as input and produce a continuous vector representation of the corresponding textual response. These models learn long-term dependencies between sequential tokens and use attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during inference time. Language modeling has been widely applied for response generation models.


Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning is a process of adapting pre-trained models to a specific task by updating some of their parameters using gradient descent optimization technique. During fine-tuning, we try to minimize the loss function computed by comparing predicted outputs against actual ground truth labels. By doing so, the network learns more accurate representations of the text and eventually produces more suitable responses for the given user utterance or task at hand.

3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
To retrofit existing neural response generation models to new domains, we follow the following steps: 

1. Train a Generic Language Model using Unlabeled Data: This step involves training a language model using a large amount of unlabeled data collected from multiple domains. Typically, language models such as BERT or GPT are trained on large corpora of text without any human annotation or supervision. Once the model is trained, it can be fine-tuned to the specific target domain to capture the domain-specific features such as syntax and semantics.

2. Apply the Pre-Trained Language Model to Target Domain: After obtaining a pre-trained language model for the target domain, we can simply replace the encoder of our existing neural response generation model with the pretrained one. Specifically, instead of learning an embedding layer from scratch, we can load the weights obtained from the pre-trained language model and freeze most of the layers. During training, we update only those layers that were frozen earlier during pretraining. Additionally, since the target domain may have a different tokenization scheme compared to the original dataset, we will need to preprocess the input data accordingly before feeding it to the language model. Finally, we should ensure that the final response generated by our model is still coherent and makes sense even after being postprocessed. To achieve this, we can add additional constraints such as beam search decoding or top-k filtering during inference time. 

3. Jointly Finetune Textual Embeddings and Generative Model Parameters: As mentioned above, during fine-tuning, we need to optimize the total loss computed by combining the objective functions for the embedded vectors and the output distribution predicted by the generative model. Since the size of the embedding space grows exponentially with the number of unique tokens in the target domain, it becomes crucial to choose a meaningful embedding initialization strategy and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Moreover, when optimizing the output distribution, we need to enforce consistency across different domains by introducing additional losses or penalties such as encouraging diversity and avoiding redundancy. By integrating these techniques together, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on various downstream evaluation tasks.

4. Evaluate Our Approach on Multiple Downstream Tasks: Finally, to measure the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluated our approach on three different downstream tasks. First, we used the CMRC Corpus to evaluate the ability of our approach to transfer general language modeling skills from unrelated domains to the target domain. Second, we used the Multi-domain version of the DSTC9 track 2 dataset to assess the robustness and flexibility of our approach to different types of domains. Third, we implemented our approach within a standard multi-domain dialogue system framework to demonstrate its practical value in real-world applications. Experiments show that our approach significantly improves the performance of neural response generation models on multiple downstream evaluation tasks while still maintaining high inter-domain variability.

5. Conclusion: We presented a novel method called “retrofitting” that combines pre-trained language modeling and neural response generation approaches to enable personalized and diverse responses for users who want to interact with a chatbot in a new domain. We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach on two downstream tasks and discussed the implications of our findings for future research directions in conversation systems. Overall, our work shows that leveraging recent advancements in language modeling and deep neural networks can effectively solve many important problems in natural language processing and machine learning.
