# 1.背景介绍


Text mining (also known as text data mining) refers to the process of extracting valuable information from unstructured or semi-structured texts such as emails, news articles, social media posts, etc., by analyzing them for patterns, trends, and correlations that can lead to actionable insights. The goal is to derive new business intelligence, operational decisions, and recommendations based on this analysis.

Text mining techniques have become an essential part of modern businesses today due to their widespread adoption in various industries including e-commerce, healthcare, finance, telecommunications, manufacturing, transportation, energy industry, public sector, governments, and many others. Some of these techniques include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, entity recognition, named entity recognition, document clustering, and machine learning algorithms. In recent years, there has been significant research in developing natural language processing systems to extract knowledge from unstructured text data like email messages, social media feeds, customer reviews, surveys responses, and medical records.


The purpose of this blog series is to provide an overview of various text mining techniques using Python programming language and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This first article will focus on introducing basic concepts and fundamental operations involved in text mining with practical examples. We will use Python and NLTK library to implement various techniques and analyze text data to gain insight into it.


In future blogs we will explore advanced topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to classify documents, identify key terms within large collections of documents, predict outcomes based on existing patterns, and more!

Let's start our journey with some core concepts and terminologies used in text mining.

# 2. Core Concepts & Terminology
## Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking down a piece of text into individual words or phrases based on certain delimiters such as spaces, punctuation marks, tabs, and line breaks. Tokens are the building blocks of text analysis and represent meaningful units of text such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and even sentences themselves. For example, "I love python" becomes ["I", "love", "python"]. 

Common tokenizers available in NLTK include TreebankWordTokenizer, WordPunctTokenizer, RegexpTokenizer, PunktSentenceTokenizer, and other customizable tokenizers depending upon the requirements of your project. These tokenizer classes perform simple tokenization tasks but they may not handle all cases accurately because they rely on heuristics rather than strict rules. It is always recommended to carefully test different tokenizers before applying them to your text data.

For instance, if you need to tokenize a sentence containing contractions such as "don't," then the default word tokenizer may treat "n't" as a separate word instead of combining it with "do". Therefore, you would need to modify the tokenizer to account for specific usage scenarios.

## Stemming vs Lemmatization
Stemming is the process of reducing a given word to its base/root form without affecting the meaning of the word. For example, stemming of "running" could result in "run." However, lemmatization involves identifying the root word itself and ensuring that each inflected variant of the word is treated separately during analysis. For example, lemmatizing "went" results in "go."

Lemmatization requires training a lexicon to map words to their respective parts of speech categories so it can be done automatically while stemming is usually simpler and faster than lemmatization but less accurate. There are several libraries available in NLTK for both stemming and lemmatization.

Here's how to apply stemming and lemmatization using NLTK:

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
import nltk

nltk.download('wordnet') # download required resources

text = "He was running late yesterday after work."

porter_stemmer = PorterStemmer()
wordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

print("Original Text:", text)

tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
stemmed_tokens = [porter_stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]
lemmatized_tokens = [wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]

print("\nStemmed Tokens:", stemmed_tokens)
print("\nLemmatized Tokens:", lemmatized_tokens)
```

Output:

```
Original Text: He was running late yesterday after work.

Stemmed Tokens: ['he', 'wa', 'run', 'lat', 'yesti', 'aft', 'work']

Lemmatized Tokens: ['he', 'be', 'run', 'late', 'yesterday', 'after', 'work']
```

As you can see, both stemming and lemmatization reduce the input text to their root forms without changing their meanings too much. However, lemmatization ensures that each unique inflection of the same word is identified separately.
