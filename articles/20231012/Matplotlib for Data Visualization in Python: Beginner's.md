# 1.背景介绍

Matplotlib is a popular library used to create high-quality data visualizations. It provides various options such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts and histograms. In this article, we will learn how to use the basic functionalities of matplotlib to visualize data effectively. We will also explore some advanced features like subplots, animation, and formatting styles that can make our visualizations more informative and engaging. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to create professional-looking and visually appealing data visualization using matplotlib. 

## Introduction
In this chapter, we'll cover the basics of creating data visualizations with matplotlib by exploring different types of plots (line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histogram) along with other useful features like subplots and animation. Before diving into the tutorials, let me introduce some key concepts about matplotlib and its terminology which I hope you will understand while reading through this guide.

### What is Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python programming language that was created to provide a convenient way of creating static, animated, or interactive data graphics. The main purpose of matplotlib is to provide a simple yet flexible interface for drawing complex graphics. You can generate figures, charts, and images without having to manually encode tedious details like connecting lines or setting colors. Some important benefits of using matplotlib are:

1. Easy to Use: Matplotlib has an intuitive API that makes it easy to create beautiful graphics.
2. High Quality Output: Matplotlib produces publication quality graphics that look great both on screen and printed out.
3. Customization: Matplotlib allows you to customize many aspects of your graphs, including font size, labels, color maps, and axes limits.
4. Support for Multiple Backends: Matplotlib supports multiple backends - meaning you can choose between displaying output on a screen, saving as a file, or rendering interactively in a web browser.
5. Large User Community: Matplotlib is widely used in scientific computing, finance, and data analysis domains. Many packages build upon matplotlib for specific purposes such as machine learning, geospatial analysis, and statistical modeling.

### How does Matplotlib Work?
The core idea behind matplotlib is that all plot elements are organized into a figure object, which contains all the necessary information required to produce a particular plot. A figure can contain one or multiple subplots that hold individual axis objects. An axis object represents the x-y plane within a subplot. To start working with matplotlib, first import the `matplotlib.pyplot` module and then call the `subplots()` function to create a new figure with a single subplot. 

Here's the code snippet to create a simple line plot using matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

This will open up a new window showing the line plot. You can save this image by clicking on "File" -> "Save As". If you want to add title, legend, etc., you can modify these parameters using `title()`, `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, and `legend()` functions respectively. Here's the updated code with added title and label:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.legend(["Values"])
plt.show()
```

Now when you run this code, you should see a new window with a line plot that shows the values of `x` vs. `y`. The title, xlabel, ylabel, and legend are properly set. These are just some of the basic functionalities available in matplotlib.
