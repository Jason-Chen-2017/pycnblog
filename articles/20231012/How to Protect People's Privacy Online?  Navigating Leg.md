# 1.背景介绍


Privacy has always been a critical issue for people across the world and it is no surprise that recent advances in technology have brought about drastic changes in the way we live our lives online. In order to protect our privacy online, we need to learn from legal experts on how they approach this topic. 

The legal landscape around privacy has also evolved rapidly over the years. The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) introduced by the European Union is one of the most significant lawsuits against companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., leading to massive litigation and fines. Despite being quite controversial and promoting stricter data protection measures, the law still remains complex and challenging to understand for those who are not familiar with the nuances involved.

In addition, various security threats and vulnerabilities such as hacking attacks, malware, and misuse of personal information have caused concern among consumers and businesses alike. These issues could result in substantial losses or damages to both organizations and individuals.

To navigate this complexity effectively, we can break down these challenges into smaller steps and take advantage of existing legal frameworks to develop an effective strategy for protecting privacy online. This article will provide practical guidance through examples based on relevant cases. We'll start by covering basic concepts such as consent, identity, and pseudonymization techniques before moving on to more advanced concepts such as anonymisation and obfuscation. Finally, we'll look at some strategies for managing risks related to digital identity and privacy, including secure storage practices, use of encryption technologies, and user education and training.

## Consent

Consent refers to the act of giving permission for someone to do something, which often involves sharing personal information with another person or entity. Consent itself should be obtained in a respectful and transparent manner so that there is no risk of misunderstanding or unintended consequences. It is important to consider potential negative side effects when granting consents, such as financial losses if consent is withdrawn or limited due to health concerns or family responsibilities.  

Personal data usually requires explicit consent from users before it can be processed, but sometimes certain types of processing may not require consent. For example, automated decision-making processes such as algorithmic recommendation systems typically collect non-personally identifiable information (such as browsing histories), without any individual consent required. However, automated decision-making algorithms may still pose a risk of bias and discriminatory impacts upon individuals depending on their demographics or other factors, particularly if used in combination with survey or questionnaire data. Moreover, third parties such as advertising networks and social media platforms may rely on implicit consent granted by individuals interacting with them. 

## Identity

Identity refers to identifying the true nature or origin of a person, device, or object. An essential component of any system that relies on personal data must ensure that each piece of data is tied back to its source of truth, ensuring that identity cannot be traced back after the point of collection. While physical addresses may serve as stable identifiers, the actual location of a device may change frequently or unexpectedly, rendering GPS tracking obsolete. A unique identifier such as a biometric signature generated by a trusted local authority, called "fingerprint" or "retina", can provide strong evidence of identity without revealing sensitive information such as birthdate or gender. In some cases, additional verification mechanisms such as passwords or challenge questions may be necessary to verify an individual's claimed identity.

## Pseudonymization

Pseudonymization refers to an artificial process where personal data is transformed into meaningless representations that preserve anonymity while allowing researchers to link multiple records together. One popular technique is to replace names and email addresses with randomly generated strings, known as "hashes". While hashes can help establish uniqueness, they can potentially make it difficult to track specific individuals across datasets, making it harder to maintain confidentiality. To prevent reidentification attacks, modern hash functions are designed to make it computationally infeasible to reverse engineer a hash value back to the original data using brute force methods, unless specialized hardware or software is used. Additionally, even if access to a pseudonymized dataset is restricted, it can still enable indirect identification through shared characteristics, such as common usage patterns or geographical locations. 

Additionally, multi-level hierarchies of pseudoanonymization and aggregation can further reduce the risk of indirect identification by combining different sources of data into new synthetic entities representing larger groups. Levels of aggregation and redaction increase the risk of correlating individual behavior within the hierarchy and decreasing the utility of the dataset overall. Therefore, careful consideration needs to be given to the level of detail needed and how much control the data subject has over their own data.

## Anonymisation and Obfuscation

Anonymisation and obfuscation are two different approaches to removing personally identifiable information (PII) from data. Both techniques involve replacing sensitive data with fake or abstracted versions that can still identify individual entities uniquely, but without providing direct evidence of their presence in the database. Examples include masking phone numbers, credit card numbers, and IP addresses with random values. With anonymisation, all occurrences of a particular attribute are replaced with equivalent anonymous ones; whereas with obfuscation, only selected attributes are modified. Both methods still retain some degree of meaningfulness, making it harder for external actors to connect the fake data back to real persons. However, the degree of abstraction and lossiness varies depending on the desired level of anonimity. Obfuscation can be done manually or automatically by applying rules-based transformations, such as shuffling letters or encrypting data.
