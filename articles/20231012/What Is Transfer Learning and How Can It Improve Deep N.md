# 1.背景介绍


Transfer learning is a technique in deep neural networks that allows the transfer of learned features from one task to another related task with less training data or resources. Transfer learning has been widely used for image classification tasks like object recognition, scene recognition, action recognition etc. In this article we will explain what transfer learning is, its benefits, how it works and some practical examples. We will also discuss about limitations and challenges associated with using transfer learning in real-world applications.<|im_sep|>

## 1) What is transfer learning?
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model on a large dataset (such as ImageNet) is fine-tuned to a new, smaller dataset to improve performance on the target domain. The goal is to leverage knowledge gained from the larger dataset to help with the learning process for the small dataset, resulting in improved accuracy and reduced computational complexity compared to training a network from scratch on the small dataset alone. Transfer learning can be seen as an approach to address two important problems:

1. Data scarcity: Transfer learning enables training models on small datasets by leveraging knowledge from a large dataset, thus reducing the need for expensive annotation of additional data. This improves scalability and reduces the cost of building complex models.

2. Domain shift: Transfer learning enables building models that are specialized for the target domain without requiring retraining the entire model architecture, improving generalization ability and ensuring accurate predictions on unseen data.

## 2) How does transfer learning work?
The basic idea behind transfer learning is to use a pre-trained model on a source dataset (e.g., ImageNet), which has learned features relevant to a particular task (e.g., recognizing objects). These features can then be repurposed for the target task through appropriate modifications. Specifically, during the training phase, we freeze all the weights except those of the last layer(s) so that they are not updated during training. Then, we add a few layers at the end of the network to suit our specific target task (e.g., adding a softmax layer for multi-class classification). During inference time, we simply pass input images through the modified network, which produces outputs corresponding to our target task. By doing this, we have effectively transferred the knowledge learned from the source task to the target task while still retaining access to the underlying representations learned in the source task.

### Fine-tuning vs. feature extraction
Another way to think about transfer learning is that it involves either fine-tuning or feature extraction. With fine-tuning, we take both the convolutional base and the output layer of the pre-trained model, remove them from their current state, and train only the latter part of the network. Feature extraction, on the other hand, means taking only the convolutional base of the pre-trained model, freezing everything else, and training a new classifier on top of the frozen features. Although these approaches may seem similar, there are key differences between them:

Fine-tuning:
- requires more computation than just extracting the features from the CNN.
- encourages the model to adapt to the new problem rather than just memorizing the features extracted from the original dataset.
- tends to result in better final performance.

Feature extraction:
- performs better than random initialization if the initial weights are good enough.
- doesn't require any further optimization since the convolutional base is already optimized for the given task.
- is faster to evaluate since you don't need to run the entire network each time.

In conclusion, whether to perform fine-tuning or feature extraction depends on your needs and available compute power.
