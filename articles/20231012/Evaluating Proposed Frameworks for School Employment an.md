# 1.背景介绍



Vocational training plays an essential role in developing the skills of individuals to succeed in today’s global economy. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of vocational programs offered by schools as they have become increasingly dependent on students' abilities to compete with each other in the job market. However, while the traditional vocational education system is still effective at providing employable skills, it also leads to potential shortages and concerns about educational quality. Therefore, there is a need for alternative approaches that can better address these issues. 

The present work proposes an evaluation framework for proposed frameworks designed to promote school-based employment opportunities or enhance student achievement through vocational training. The framework will be based on four main factors: 

1) Suitability of the program to target demographic group; 
2) Quality of the curriculum development approach used to teach skills needed for employment; 
3) Competency of instructors and mentors trained to deliver relevant and appropriate course content and instructional strategies; and
4) Overall impact of the program on students' outcomes and future career aspirations.  

This paper explores the ability of several existing frameworks such as GRE, PSAT, etc., to provide school-based employment opportunities or enhance student achievement through vocational training. It provides insights into which factors contribute most significantly towards improving the success rate of these programs. Based on these findings, this framework could serve as a reference point for evaluating the effectiveness of new frameworks under various scenarios.

## 2.1 Core Concepts

1. **Target Demographics** – Amongst all the schools/colleges in the country, some are well suited for particular demographic groups like minority populations, women, urban areas, among others. While many colleges may offer courses to meet varying levels of needs across the board, some may specialize in certain subjects like Computer Science, Finance, Management, Arts & Social Sciences, Music, etc. This helps them cater to diverse preferences and interests of their learners.

2. **Quality of Curriculum Development** - Many vocational programs start out with basic theoretical concepts taught using textbooks, videos, interactive simulations, etc. But real world situations demand more practical skills that require industry experience. Schools must use curricula that not only emphasize theory but also demonstrate hands-on practical applications. For example, the computer science degree program at a university should include projects related to industry applications, programming languages, data structures, algorithms, networking, database management, operating systems, etc.

3. **Competent Instructors and Mentors** - Today's vocational education landscape requires skilled professionals who can guide learners effectively throughout the program. The successful completion of any vocational program depends heavily upon efficient staffing, counseling, and guidance from top-notch faculty members. These mentors should ensure that students receive high quality training in their chosen field and also provide necessary coaching and support.

4. **Overall Outcomes and Career Aspirations** - Whether students obtain a job after graduation or remain in school for further study and improvement is ultimately up to their own decision. One way to measure the overall outcomes of the program is to evaluate how well they perform a variety of tasks related to their desired occupation. Additionally, schools should continuously monitor their progress against career benchmarks set by competitors to assess whether they are staying ahead or lagging behind. If there is a mismatch between students' expectations and actual performance, then it may be necessary to reassess the program.

## 2.2 Relationship Between Factors

To understand the relationship between factors, we first observe that a higher grade level indicates a stronger understanding of subject matter than lower grade levels. Thus, the highest grades would lead to the best results when it comes to assessing the quality of curriculum and skill sets required for different occupations. Similarly, having experienced staff members can help improve the efficiency of the program and make it easier for students to navigate the vast array of job options available. By monitoring students' progress during term time, one can identify trends in their learning behavior and adapt the program accordingly. Finally, if a school finds itself struggling with a specific area of skill acquisition, it can try alternate approaches or seek professional assistance to boost its performance.
