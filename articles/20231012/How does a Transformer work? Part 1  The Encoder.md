# 1.背景介绍


In this article we will learn about the basic concepts and implementation of the transformer model by understanding its encoder layer in detail. We will also be able to build our own transformer from scratch using Python and PyTorch libraries. The reader should have some knowledge of deep learning models and have at least an intermediate level of proficiency with programming languages like Python or C++. 

The paper that introduces the transformer architecture was published by Vaswani et al in their NIPS conference on machine learning in 2017 [1]. The transformer is a neural network architecture designed specifically for natural language processing tasks and it uses attention mechanism which enables the network to focus on specific parts of input sequence while generating output. It has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks including translation, text summarization, question answering etc. Its key idea behind transformers is to use self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence or convolutional layers to process sequential data.

Before proceeding to understand how the transformer works, let’s understand the terminology used. The following terms are commonly used in the context of the transformer:

1. Input sequence : A sequence of words or tokens representing the input sentence.

2. Output sequence : A sequence of words or tokens generated by the transformer based on the input sequence. 

3. Attention weight matrix : This is a matrix containing weights corresponding to each element of the input sequence while decoding the output sequence. The weights indicate the importance of each word or token in determining the final result.

4. Multi-head attention : The transformer implements multi-head attention where multiple heads attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. Each head computes attention over a separate part of the input sequence.

5. Positional encoding : This term refers to a vector added to the input embeddings at each position of the sequence to introduce spatial information into the embedding space. It allows the network to consider absolute positions of elements in the sequence when computing similarity between them.

6. Feed forward networks : These are simple dense layers consisting of linear transformations followed by non-linear activation functions. They map the representation learned from previous layers to the next one.

Let's now dive deeper into understanding the working of the transformer.

## Introduction to Transformers
The original transformer architecture proposed by Vaswani et al can be decomposed into three main components: the encoder, the decoder, and the output projection layer. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates an encoded representation which is then decoded by the decoder. At the end, the output projection layer maps the final output of the decoder back to the vocabulary size.
### Encoder
The encoder consists of a stack of N identical layers (N is usually set to six), called encoder layers. Each encoder layer is composed of two sublayers:

1. Self-Attention Layer: This is the heart of the encoder as it applies multi-head attention on the source sequence. During training, both self-attention and feedforward networks are trained end-to-end alongside the other layers of the network. However during inference time only the first few layers of the network are trained, while all subsequent layers are fixed and simply copied from the pre-trained parameters obtained after training on a large corpus. Thus, even though there are several trainable parameters in the entire model, they are gradually updated through backpropagation as required.
2. Positionwise FFN: This consists of fully connected layers that follow the attention mechanism and precede the residual connection. The goal of these layers is to reduce the dimensionality of the representations and increase the depth of the feature vectors. In traditional RNN architectures, it is common to use GRU cells or LSTM cells to update hidden states but in contrast, transformer uses the positionwise FFN which operates directly on the inputs without any explicit dependencies on previous outputs. By doing so, the transformer provides better long-term dependency modeling compared to conventional RNNs because it doesn't rely on the order of sequences or on the effectiveness of individual hidden units within a sequence.
