# 1.背景介绍


Streaming Big Data is becoming more popular in recent years. Streaming data comes from various sources like IoT devices, social media feeds, transaction streams etc., all of which are unbounded in size, constantly increasing, and always evolving. The volume of the incoming data has led to a significant increase in computational power required to process it. In order to deal with this new type of data effectively, we need efficient database systems that can handle massive amounts of data in real time. Cloud computing offers an attractive solution to store large volumes of data in highly available servers. 

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases have emerged as the preferred choice among developers due to their high scalability and flexibility, low latency, and high availability. There are several cloud-based NoSQL databases available such as Amazon DynamoDB, MongoDB, and Cassandra, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. In this article, I will demonstrate how to use these three databases for storing and retrieving streaming big data efficiently. 

In addition to explaining the basics behind these databases, I will also provide detailed explanations on relevant algorithms, operations, and performance metrics. Within each section, there will be code snippets demonstrating the usage of the respective database and explanatory comments. At the end, I will conclude by highlighting some future directions and challenges in this area.

 # 2.Core Concepts & Relationships
Before diving into the technical details, let’s discuss some core concepts related to NoSQL databases that may help us understand them better:

**Partitioning:** Partitioning refers to dividing a single logical table or index across multiple physical partitions, where each partition resides on a separate server or node in a distributed cluster. This helps in achieving horizontal scaling of data over many nodes or servers, improving query performance.

Example: A record in a table might be partitioned based on user ID so that records belonging to one user can be stored on the same node. Similarly, indexes can also be partitioned in a similar fashion to improve query efficiency.

**Replica:** Replica refers to maintaining copies of the data across multiple servers or nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Each replica serves read requests directly without any involvement of other replicas. If a replica fails, another copy takes its place immediately.

Example: Every document in MongoDB is replicated across three nodes to achieve high availability and fault tolerance.

**Sharding:** Sharding refers to distributing data across multiple shards, each responsible for handling a subset of the data. These shards can be located on different servers or nodes in a cluster, making them horizontally scalable.

Example: CockroachDB uses range-based sharding to distribute data across multiple nodes.

The main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases lies in the way they organize data. SQL databases focus on structured tables with fixed schema and relationships. They often enforce strict consistency rules that make them reliable but less flexible than NoSQL databases that do not require a predefined structure and allow for flexible schemas and joins. 

 # 3.DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance. It is designed to scale seamlessly, and offers built-in security, backup and restore capabilities, and allows you to enjoy flexible throughput capacity on-demand. DynamoDB can handle large amounts of data while ensuring consistent, low-latency performance.

## Architecture Overview
DynamoDB consists of four components:

* **Tables**: Tables are containers for your data. You create a table and specify the primary key attribute(s). Attributes are columns in your table, and they define the shape and structure of your data. For example, if you wanted to store customer information, you could create a "customers" table with attributes like "customerID", "firstName", "lastName", and "email". 

* **Items**: Items are rows in a table. Each item contains a set of attributes that uniquely identify it within the table. The primary key attribute(s), together with the sort key (if present), form a unique composite key that determines the item's position within the sorted order of items in the table. 

* **Indexes**: Indexes are used to speed up queries and retrieve specific sets of data quickly. You can create global secondary indexes (GSI) or local secondary indexes (LSI), both of which support clustering and filtering. GSI are partitioned across multiple partitions, enabling efficient indexing and retrieval of large datasets. LSI are non-partitioned, which offer faster querying but cannot perform complex queries that involve sorting or aggregation functions.

* **Capacity Units (CU)**: Capacity units represent the amount of throughput capacity that you consume in DynamoDB. Throughput capacity is measured in terms of Read Capacity Units (RCU) and Write Capacity Units (WCU) per second, which determine the rate at which you can read and write data to your table. When you provision a table, you choose the RCU and WCU values for it. 


## Provision Table
To create a table, navigate to the AWS Management Console, click on "Services" > "DynamoDB" > "Create table":


Give a name to your table and select the primary key. The primary key should be chosen carefully since it defines the uniqueness constraint for every item in the table. Choose a simple attribute like "userID" as the primary key because it guarantees uniqueness and enables easy lookup operations. 

You can add additional attributes if necessary, such as "age", "name", "email", etc. Make sure to adjust the projection settings accordingly depending on what kind of queries you want to run against the table. 

After creating the table, go to "Table" tab under "Overview" to see the status of the table creation. Wait until the table status changes to "Active" before proceeding.

## Writing Items
Once the table is active, you can start writing items to it using the AWS SDK or the console. To insert an item, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the AWS Management Console, click on "Services" > "DynamoDB" > Your table > "Items" > "Create Item":

   
2. Add the following fields to the item:
   * **userID**: A unique identifier for the user. We chose userID as our primary key attribute earlier. 
   * **name**: Name of the user. Can be a string.
   * **age**: Age of the user. An integer value.
   * **email**: Email address of the user. Also a string.
   
   Click "Save" when done.

Now the newly created item should appear in the list of items in the table view.

## Reading Items
Reading items requires only a few basic steps:

1. Identify the primary key value of the item that you want to retrieve.
2. Use the appropriate API call to fetch the item from the table. For example, to get the item with userID = 1234, you would use the `getItem()` method provided by the DynamoDB client library:

   ```javascript
   const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB(); // assuming aws-sdk v2
   
   async function getItem() {
     try {
       const params = {
         TableName: 'users',
         Key: {
           userID: { N: '1234' }, // assume number as userID is chosen as primary key
         }
       };
       
       const result = await dynamodb.getItem(params).promise();
       
       return JSON.stringify(result.Item); // convert response to json format and print it
     } catch (error) {
       console.log(error);
     }
   }
   
   getItem();
   ```

3. Process the returned item according to your needs. Depending on the content of the item, you might need to parse the values and display them to the user in a human-readable format.
