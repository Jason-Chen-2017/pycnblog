## What is Empathy?
Empathy refers to the ability of an individual to understand and share feelings, thoughts, and behaviors with others. It enables individuals to have a better understanding of how others perceive their world and make informed decisions that improve wellbeing, health, and productivity. 

At Neptune AI, our goal is to develop products and services that enable people to work together effectively and enjoymentfully. As a company committed to building inclusive organizations, we value diverse perspectives and bring different skills sets and experiences to every project we take on. Our approach towards solving problems is centered around aligning these needs, interests, and resources across all stakeholders.

In order to cultivate such a collaborative culture, it’s essential to build bridges between colleagues who are passionate about similar goals but have different skill sets and life experiences. To do this, we focus on creating positive working relationships amongst team members by ensuring they share mutual respect for each other's ideas, concerns, opinions, abilities, and limitations.

Our values are based on giving back to the community, being compassionate and kind to one another, and supporting diversity and inclusion. We aspire to create an organization that supports and encourages its employees to learn new things and grow professionally through continuous self-development. This creates a culture of inclusiveness and promotes a strong sense of belonging.

## Why Does It Matter? 
As companies move from centralized governance structures to decentralized peer-to-peer networks, it becomes increasingly important to support interactions between individuals without requiring them to violate privacy laws or commit to any specific corporate strategy. In addition, advances in technology and artificial intelligence offer opportunities for organizations to leverage human intelligence to optimize processes and achieve common goals. However, creating effective teams requires investing time and effort into establishing psychological safety as a core component of employee engagement. Research has shown that when employees share personal insights with one another, they tend to exhibit greater empathy and greater success in cohesive team projects than those who remain isolated. The increased engagement comes at the expense of self-esteem and job satisfaction, but the potential payoff outweighs the downside.

At Neptune AI, we aim to provide people with the tools and resources necessary to thrive within a collaborative environment while also building awareness and adoption of best practices surrounding responsible decision making. By focusing on empathy, we can create more efficient and effective teams that function together to accomplish challenging tasks and solve complex problems.


# 2. Core Concepts & Contact
## 1) Emotional Intelligence (EI):
Emotional intelligence involves the ability to recognize, manage, and express emotions effectively. This includes learning to identify, empathize with, and understand the emotions of others, communicate with others in ways that avoid judgment, and adapt emotional behavior to suit personal preferences and needs. Employees with high levels of EI are better equipped to work effectively in teams and lead teams toward shared objectives.

The four key components of emotional intelligence are:
1. Understanding: An individual must understand the underlying motivations, biases, and emotions behind others' actions and responses. They need to be able to observe and analyze situations critically, formulate hypotheses, and reason logically.

2. Communication: An individual must be able to communicate clearly and concisely with others both verbally and nonverbally. They need to demonstrate an appropriate level of confidence and sensitivity, use good language, and listen attentively. 

3. Decision Making: A person with high EI must be able to apply their emotional knowledge to make informed decisions. They must be capable of analyzing multiple factors and selecting the most beneficial option.

4. Self-Regulation: Higher emotional intelligence involves developing strategies for overcoming negative influences and achieving inner peace. This may involve recognizing triggers or disruptors and using intuition to detect and regulate impulsive behavior. 


## 2) Teamwork:
Teamwork involves multiple individuals coming together to achieve a common goal. It can mean resolving conflicts, sharing information, and implementing policies that enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Teams that are composed of individuals with different skill sets and experience require creativity, cooperation, and communication to succeed.

Two main types of teamwork exist:
###  2a. Collaboration: This type of teamwork involves several individuals working together to complete a task. Involves integrating inputs and feedback from various sources, providing clear instructions, and managing conflict resolution effectively. Good collaboration can result in productivity gains, higher quality output, and reduced costs.

### 2b. Competition: This type of teamwork involves two or more individuals attempting to achieve a single objective simultaneously. Often used during contests, tournaments, or competitions, competition can often generate social bonding, inspiration, and increased enthusiasm. When done correctly, competition can yield positive results by allowing participants to meet different challenges and identifying the best performers.  

Competitive environments also encourage a sense of ownership and pride in one's performance. Individuals with high levels of intrinsic motivation tend to excel in competitions because they find meaningful work that challenges themselves. Therefore, it's essential for managers to ensure that their teams are appropriately structured to facilitate high levels of intrinsic motivation.

## 3) Humorous Leadership:
Humorous leadership involves creating a fun and light-hearted way to communicate and influence team members. Slogans like “I'm not your guy” or “It takes two to tango” convey powerful messages and evoke emotions that resonate throughout the group. Humorous leadership can help individuals gain clarity and resolve issues head-on rather than rely on formal authority.

Humorous leadership also promotes a playful attitude that leads to heightened engagement, trust, and morale. Encourage humorous behaviors early in the career path to spark curiosity, encourage team members to laugh, and instill a sense of adventure and discovery in employees. One way to implement humorous leadership is to ask team members to think outside the box and challenge conventional wisdom. Especially if you're looking to get jokes going, consider bringing a friend or family member to join you in joke-making sessions.

# 3. Core Algorithm & Steps

This section will detail the algorithm and steps involved in generating similarities between the text documents and predict whether they are related or unrelated. Here we'll follow the following steps:

Step 1 - Preprocessing the data
Tokenization: Tokenize each document into words and punctuation marks. Convert all words to lowercase. Remove stop words. Stemming / Lemmatization: Use stemming or lemmatization techniques to reduce inflected forms of words to their root form.

Step 2 - Vectorization
Convert each document into numerical vectors using Bag Of Word model.

Step 3 - Similarity Measurements
Compute similarity measure between the vectors obtained in step 2. There are many methods for computing cosine similarity such as Cosine Distance, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Index etc. Choose the method which suits your purpose.

Step 4 - Model Training
Use supervised learning algorithms such as KNN, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest to train the dataset on labeled examples.

Step 5 - Prediction
Use the trained model to classify the input texts as either related or unrelated based on their similarity scores computed in step 3. For example, if the score exceeds some threshold, then the predicted class would be "related", otherwise it would be "unrelated".
