# 1.背景介绍


Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of nature at extreme scales and in complex systems with many interacting subsystems. Its applications range from quantum computing to space research and medical science. To understand quantum mechanical phenomena accurately, we need a deep understanding of quantum information theory and its concepts such as superposition and entanglement. In this article, I will present an overview of quantum information theory and give you an idea about how it is used in modern technology.

Superposition refers to the concept that multiple possibilities exist for the state of a physical system. It can be achieved by spontaneous emission or recombination of particles in a gas, by light rays being scattered by dust particles, or through radioactivity decay of radionuclides. When two (or more) physical states are combined into one composite state, we call it superposition. This means that there exists a ratio of probabilities between these different states which cannot be observed directly. For example, let us take an atom that has three possible states: ground state (gs), first excited state (e1) and second excited state (e2). If we combine gs with e1 together, then we get |g/e1> (superposition of gs and e1), which corresponds to a probability of 33% of measuring either g or e1 when the atom is in the superposition state. Similarly, if we combine gs and e2, then we get |g/e2>, corresponding to another probability distribution which assigns only half the energy to each of the two possible states. Therefore, unlike classical binary logic where we can make deterministic choices based on single bits of data, superpositions allow us to form probabilistic predictions and calculations.

Entanglement occurs when two (or more) quantum systems become entangled i.e., they become strongly interdependent upon each other. These entangled systems have properties that differ from those of independent systems. Entangled states exhibit collective properties that are beyond any individual interaction. One such property is that they can not be separated into their component parts without disturbing the rest of the system. Thus, entanglement acts like a magnet and prevents quantum states from being measured independently. 

The key idea behind quantum computing lies in applying principles of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory to problems in computer science, electronics and physics. Within these fields, superposition and entanglement play essential roles in enabling novel algorithms, protocols, and architectures that can solve problems at breakneck speeds. By combining quantum effects such as entanglement and superposition, we can build scalable and robust quantum computers that perform tasks faster than existing computers using classical methods. Overall, quantum information and superposition provide fundamental building blocks for all technologies that use quantum mechanical effects to achieve exponential advances in performance and power efficiency.

As mentioned earlier, superposition plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. Let's consider some practical examples of how we can create superposition within our quantum circuits and simulate them using simulators available online.

1.Bell State
In the Bell state, Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits. They are initially in a shared Bell state called $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(\ket{00} + \ket{11})$. Here, $\ket{00}$ represents the initial state where both qubits are in the ground state (|0><0| and |1><1|), while $\ket{11}$ represents the maximally entangled state where both qubits are in superposition. After performing various operations on the Bell state, Alice and Bob may end up in a specific state depending on their inputs. The most commonly used circuit design for creating a Bell state is depicted below:


2.GHZ States
The GHZ state, also known as the blockade state, is a quantum system consisting of three coupled qubits arranged in a circular path. Initially, all three qubits are in the |0> state. As each qubit interacts with its neighbouring qubits in the chain, it experiences a phase shift and becomes entangled with the next qubit. Once every qubit has been entangled with its partner, we arrive at the GHZ state, which looks something like this:


To create a GHZ state, we start with a circuit similar to the one shown above and apply Hadamard gates to the leftmost qubit followed by controlled-NOT gates with respect to the rightmost and middle qubits. The final configuration would look like this:


Once the circuit is run on a simulator or device, we obtain the desired GHZ state.

3.Teleportation Protocol
One of the most interesting applications of superposition is teleportation protocol. In this protocol, we wish to transfer a quantum bit from one location to another securely. We assume that the sender already knows the quantum state of the receiver's qubit so that they can communicate efficiently over short distances. However, the sender does not know the exact position of the receiver's qubit in his or her vicinity. 

Here is an illustration of the teleportation protocol. Suppose that Alice wants to send a message to Bob via a channel where she only receives photons from one particular point source located far away. Assuming that the distance between Alice and Bob is small enough to allow for efficient communication, Alice needs to prepare a quantum state that he believes represents the message she wishes to send. He prepares a certain superposition state, say $\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}$, which encodes the message as well as her random noise. She then sends her state to the detector at the other end of the channel along with special control pulses that enable her to transform the received photon stream into Alice's original state. This way, even though the signal travels long distances, Alice still communicates with Bob securely. 


This scheme relies on the fact that the detector at the other end of the channel can effectively detect whether the incoming photon was generated by Alice's original quantum state or by the entangled state formed due to her noise. Depending on the outcome, the detector determines which input basis state gave rise to the detected photon and hence, recovers the original message.
