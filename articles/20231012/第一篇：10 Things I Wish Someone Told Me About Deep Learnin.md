# 1.背景介绍


Deep learning has been a popular topic for a long time and is widely used in many fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc., but not all people understand the basic ideas of deep learning. In this article, we will explain some core concepts and principles behind deep learning, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent optimization, activation functions, regularization techniques, overfitting, and so on. We also provide specific examples to illustrate how these concepts work and apply them to real-world problems. Finally, we discuss future development trends and challenges associated with deep learning technology. These are just a few key points that any technical person should know about when working with deep learning algorithms.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a type of machine learning algorithm that mimics the human brain's ability to learn complex patterns by interconnecting multiple nodes called neurons. Each neuron receives input signals from other neurons or external inputs, performs an activation function, and then sends its output signal to other neurons connected to it. The connection between neurons creates a network structure, which can be trained through supervised or unsupervised learning using training data sets. By adjusting the parameters of each neuron based on feedback from the network, ANNs can learn complex relationships between different variables.

Backpropagation is an iterative process where errors are propagated backward through the layers of the ANN to update the weights of each node in order to minimize the loss function. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is one common optimization method for ANNs, which involves updating the weights after calculating the error at each node. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts memorizing the training set instead of generalizing well to new data. Overfitting is caused by having high variance in the model due to excessive parameter tuning.

Activation Functions: Activation functions are mathematical formulas applied to the weighted sum of incoming signals to each neuron, which decides whether a neuron should activate or passively avoid firing. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU, tanh, and softmax.

Regularization Techniques: Regularization techniques aim to reduce overfitting by adding additional constraints to the cost function during training. Common methods include L1/L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping. L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes large weights. Dropout randomly drops out some neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Early stopping stops the training process if the validation performance doesn't improve over a certain number of epochs.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
The following sections detail the steps involved in building a deep learning system, along with detailed explanations and math models for several important topics related to ANNs and SGD:

1. Sigmoid Function: This is a standard activation function commonly used in ANNs. It maps any value x into the range [0, 1]. Its formula is y = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)), where e is Euler's constant (approximately equal to 2.71). For example, if x=0, then sigmoid(x) = 0.5; if x=-infinity, then sigmoid(x) = 0; if x=+infinity, then sigmoid(x) = 1. To compute the derivative of the sigmoid function, you simply take the derivative of the above equation with respect to x: sigmoid'(x) = y * (1 - y)

    When applying sigmoid function to linear regression outputs, it's useful to add a bias term before applying the activation function, because otherwise the resulting decision boundary might not be aligned properly with the true label distribution. Specifically, given the feature vector x=(x_i1,...,x_id), we add a column of ones to the left of x and concatenate the result with another column containing the target labels y=(y_1,...,y_n), so that X=[1 x_i1... x_id] and Y=[y_1... y_n], where d is the dimensionality of x. Then, the hypothesis h(X)=W*X+b can be written more concisely as follows:
        
        h(X)=sigmoid(W'*X')
        
    Here,'denotes transpose operation.
    
2. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): A variant of the sigmoid function, known as ReLU, produces only positive values. Its formula is max(0, z), where z is the weighted sum of incoming signals. Its advantage is that it is computationally cheaper than sigmoid and avoids vanishing gradients.
    
    The ReLU activation function was introduced specifically for CNNs, and it has become increasingly popular in recent years. One major drawback of the ReLU activation function is that it cannot propagate negative values very effectively, which means that small changes in the inputs may cause large changes in the outputs. This makes it harder for the ANN to learn non-linear relationships between features. However, since most modern architectures use convolutional layers, ReLU units usually don't significantly affect the overall accuracy.
    
3. Softmax Function: Another activation function often used in ANNs is softmax. It is similar to sigmoid, except that it operates on multi-class classification problems rather than binary classification problems. In particular, softmax takes a K-dimensional vector z and converts it into a probability distribution that sums up to 1 across the classes. The i-th element of the resulting vector represents the probability of the sample being assigned to the i-th class.
    
    The softmax activation function is typically used in the last layer of a multiclass classifier, where there are K possible outcomes (K > 2). To convert the raw scores generated by the previous layers into probabilities, we first exponentiate each score and normalize them by dividing by the sum of the exponentiated scores. Specifically, let p = exp(z_k)/Σexp(zi), where k ranges from 1 to K and Σ indicates the summation operator. The final probability vector P=[p_1... p_K] is obtained by multiplying each p by its corresponding weight w_k.
    
4. Loss Functions: A loss function measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. Commonly used loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), cross entropy (CE), Huber loss, and Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL). MSE computes the average square error between the predicted output and the actual output, while CE computes the logarithmic likelihood ratio between the predicted output and the actual output. Huber loss is a smooth version of MSE that is less sensitive to outliers. KL divergence is a measure of information lost when using a generative model to approximate the joint distribution of the input and output variables.
    
       Let L be a loss function that takes two vectors ŷ and y as input, and returns a scalar loss value:
       
           L(ŷ, y) =...
                   
           
    Typical loss functions used in deep learning are cross entropy (for classification problems) and mean squared error (for regression problems). Cross entropy is defined as:
    
        CE[p, q] = −∑[i=1 to n](y_i ln(q_i))
                 
    Where p is the estimated probability distribution, q is the true distribution, and n is the number of samples. The objective of training a deep learning model is to find optimal parameters theta that minimizes the expected loss over the entire dataset D:
    
        J(theta) = 1/|D| ∑[x,y] L(f(x;theta), y)
    
    where f() is the parametrized model function that generates predictions based on input features x, and |D| is the size of the dataset.
    
5. Forward Propagation: During forward propagation, the input data passes through the ANN, producing intermediate activations that are transformed using the nonlinear activation functions. At each step, the ANN applies a linear transformation to the inputs, followed by an activation function, and calculates the weighted sum as output. The output is passed through further hidden layers until the desired output is produced. Mathematically, the forward propagation is expressed as:
    
       Z^[l] = W^[l]*A^[l-1]+B^[l]
              A^[l] = g^[l](Z^[l])
            
    Here, l ranges from 1 to L (the number of hidden layers plus the output layer), W is the weight matrix connecting the layers, B is the bias vector, and g^(l) is the activation function at layer l. Note that the notation ^[l] is used to indicate that the quantity depends on the value of l.
    
    
6. Backward Propagation: Once the forward propagation has completed, we need to calculate the derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases at each layer to perform the updates to optimize the model. The backpropagation algorithm uses chain rule to compute the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias. Specifically, for each neuron in the current layer, we calculate the contribution to the loss function from both the neuron itself and its incoming connections. The partial derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight and bias of the current neuron is calculated as follows:
    
       dJ/dZ^[l] = A^[l]' * dL/da^[l]
                   da^[l] = g^[l]'(Z^[l])*dL/dz^[l]
                   
    Here, A^[l]' is the transposed activation value of layer l. The symbol "'" denotes the transpose operation. 
    
   Given the partial derivatives with respect to the weights and biases of all the neurons in the current layer, we can compute the total derivative of the loss function with respect to those quantities:
    
       dJ/dW^[l] = 1/|D| ∑[x,y] [h(x)^(T)-y].* A^[l-1]
               dJ/dB^[l] = 1/|D| ∑[x,y] [h(x)^(T)-y]
               
    Again, here ".*" stands for the elementwise multiplication operation. 

7. Optimization Methods: Various optimization methods can be used to train the ANN. The most commonly used technique is stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which updates the weights at each neuron based on the partial derivatives computed by backpropagation. SGD uses mini-batches of training data to update the weights efficiently and adaptively, leading to faster convergence and reduced oscillations compared to batch gradient descent. Other optimization techniques include Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam, and AdaMax.
    
8. Regularization Techniques: As mentioned earlier, regularization techniques are used to address overfitting issues. Two common methods are L1/L2 regularization and dropout. 
    
    L1/L2 regularization encourages sparsity in the learned weights by adding a penalty term to the cost function that scales with the absolute magnitudes of the weights. Specifically, the L1 regularization penalty term is |w|, whereas the L2 regularization penalty term is 0.5*|w|^2. By adding this penalty term to the cost function, the SGD optimizer discourages the model from taking large jumps in the weight space, which could lead to underfitting.
    
    Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out some neurons during training. During evaluation, no neurons are dropped out and the output of the remaining active neurons is scaled down accordingly. Dropout works by introducing a degree of randomness during training, which forces the model to learn robust representations that are invariant to noise. This helps reduce overfitting and improves generalization performance.
    
9. Training Time Complexity Analysis: Consider an ANN with N neurons in the output layer and D features per sample. The memory complexity of the model would be O(Nd), where N is the number of neurons and D is the dimensionality of the input features. The time complexity of the forward propagation would be O(Nd), and the time complexity of the backward propagation would be O(LdNd), where L is the number of hidden layers. Therefore, the overall training time complexity of the ANN would depend on the size of the dataset, the choice of activation functions, and the optimization method used.
