# 1.背景介绍


Machine learning (ML) is the field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. The goal is to develop machines that can learn from experience and improve their performance on a task by using algorithms that automatically adjust as they are fed new data. ML has become one of the hottest topics in technology today due to its applications ranging from image recognition to speech recognition to self-driving cars. 

In this article, we will discuss about how machine learning works at an absolute beginner's level. We will start with introducing what is Machine Learning, how it works, and why do we need it? Then we will explore some important concepts related to ML such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model selection and evaluation, and feature engineering techniques. Next, we will dive deep into different types of models used in ML, starting from linear regression to neural networks, and we will implement them in Python programming language. Finally, we will summarize our findings and share some tips on how to get started with ML.

Supervised learning: This is where we have input variables x and output variable y and the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on training examples provided. Examples could be pairs of images and their corresponding labels ("cat", "dog") or sentences and their sentiments ("positive", "negative"). In other words, the algorithm learns to identify patterns in the data. There are two main categories of supervised learning: classification and regression. Classification involves predicting categorical outcomes while regression involves predicting continuous outcomes.

Unsupervised learning: Unlike supervised learning, here there are no labeled training examples given to the algorithm. Instead, the algorithm must find hidden patterns within the data itself. Clustering methods like K-means and hierarchical clustering are commonly used in unsupervised learning. These methods group similar data points together into clusters, allowing us to identify underlying structure or patterns in the data. Another example would be identifying customer segments based on purchase history.

Model Selection and Evaluation: When building machine learning models, we often need to compare and choose between multiple models that may perform well on different datasets. Model evaluation metrics like accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC score, confusion matrix, etc., help us understand which model performs best. Cross-validation technique helps us select optimal hyperparameters for the chosen model before finalizing the results.

Feature Engineering Techniques: Feature engineering refers to the process of selecting, extracting, and transforming relevant features from raw data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. Some common feature engineering techniques include scaling, normalization, binning, encoding, imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and feature extraction. For example, if we have numeric columns but most values are zeros or ones, then we might consider converting these columns to binary format. If we have categorical columns with many unique values, then we might use one-hot encoding to convert them to numerical form. On the other hand, if we have too many features, we might consider performing dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE to reduce the number of dimensions. Similarly, if we have highly correlated features, we might try removing redundant features.

Linear Regression: Linear regression is a simple yet powerful statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and independent variables (X). It assumes that the relationship between X and y follows a linear pattern. We fit a line through the scatterplot of X and y to estimate the slope and intercept. To evaluate the performance of the model, we calculate the residual sum of squares (RSS), which measures the difference between predicted and actual values. If RSS decreases over time, then the model is considered to be more accurate. However, if RSS increases or remains constant, then the model is underfitting or overfitting the data respectively.

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is another popular regression algorithm that is useful when the outcome variable (dependent variable) is categorical. It computes the probability of occurrence of each class using logarithmic odds. During training, we optimize the coefficients of the logistic function to maximize the likelihood of observed data. Once the model is trained, we can use it to classify new instances into different classes based on their probabilities. As with linear regression, we can also evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics like accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC score, and confusion matrix.

Decision Trees: Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. They work by recursively partitioning the data into smaller subsets until a stopping criteria is met. At each node, we split the dataset along one of the available attributes according to the value that provides the highest information gain. Decision tree models are easy to interpret and require little data preparation. However, they tend to overfit the training data since they don't generalize well to new instances outside the training set.

Random Forests: Random forests are ensemble models that combine multiple decision trees. Each tree in the forest is built independently using random subsamples of the data. The final prediction is obtained by aggregating the predictions of all the trees. By averaging the results, random forests produce higher accuracy than single decision trees even though they may be less interpretable. Random forests also address the problem of overfitting by combining diverse trees that focus on slightly different aspects of the data.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses a kernel trick to transform non-linear relationships into linear separable ones. The basic idea behind SVM is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the positive and negative classes. One way to optimize the objective function is to use gradient descent. SVM is widely used in text analysis, image processing, and bioinformatics fields because of its ability to handle high dimensional data.
