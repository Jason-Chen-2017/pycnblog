# 1.背景介绍


Recurrent neural networks (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is particularly powerful for modeling sequential data. RNNs are based on the idea that the past information can influence the future decisions and behavior of an agent. The basic principle behind these networks involves stacking layers of cells called "neurons", where each neuron takes input from its previous layer and passes its output to the next one. 

The relevance of RNN has led to significant advances in natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, time-series prediction, image captioning, and many other fields such as recommendation systems, robotics, etc.

In this article, we will discuss the fundamental principles behind RNN and how they work. We'll also demonstrate with simple code examples using Python's Keras library.

Before diving into the technical details, let us start by understanding what exactly do we mean by'sequential' or 'time-series' data? In general terms, sequential data refers to any collection of data items where the occurrence order matters; for example, textual documents, stock prices, sensor readings, medical records, customer orders, online transactions, etc. On the other hand, time-series data is different from sequential data because it exhibits temporal patterns. For instance, weather data collected at regular intervals over a period of several years would be considered as time-series data whereas sales figures for various products could be considered as non-time-series data. Both types of data play crucial roles in machine learning applications involving sequence analysis.

Now that we have defined what kind of data goes under the category of sequential/time-series data, let's get started with our discussion.

# 2. Core Concepts and Connections

## 2.1 Sequential Data

Sequential data means that there is some underlying pattern in the ordering of the observations. This pattern usually describes a logical progression through space and/or time. It may take place across multiple dimensions, such as two spatial coordinates followed by temperature measurements over a fixed time interval. 

Examples of sequential data include:

1. Textual Documents - Sentences, paragraphs, articles, movie scripts, news articles, blogs, tweets, etc
2. Stock Prices - A stream of numbers representing the daily closing price of a particular stock every minute or second
3. Sensor Readings - Measurements made by sensors placed around the body, which are arranged in a logical sequence
4. Medical Records - An ordered set of patient history entries including diagnoses, treatments, procedures performed, prescribed medications, allergies, family history, surgeries, etc
5. Customer Orders - A record of individual transactions during a visit to a website with chronological timestamps indicating when each item was added to their cart and checked out
6. Online Transactions - A series of events triggered by user interactions within an e-commerce platform, which are related to the purchasing process such as login, search, add-to-cart, checkout, purchase confirmation, etc.

## 2.2 Time-Series Data

On the other hand, time-series data exhibit patterns that are not apparent at first glance but rather arise naturally due to factors such as seasonality, trends, and noise. These patterns are hard to detect manually and require more advanced statistical techniques.

Some common examples of time-series data include:

1. Weather Data - Temperature, wind speed, humidity, cloud cover, and rainfall over time
2. Sales Figures - Total number of units sold by a retail store every month or quarter
3. Credit Card Usage Patterns - Number of transactions processed per day or hour along with the amount spent on those transactions
4. Consumer Behavior - Viewing habits, interests, sentiment towards certain brands, political preferences, demographics, etc over time

It is worth mentioning that both types of data play essential roles in machine learning models used for sequence analysis. 

## 2.3 Autoencoder Architecture

One important concept in RNN is the autoencoder architecture. It consists of two parts - an encoder and decoder. The encoder transforms the original data into a compressed representation while the decoder reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation. It helps preserve the relevant features present in the data and enable better modeling of complex sequences.

Autoencoders can be classified into three categories:

1. Vanilla Autoencoders - They consist only of an encoding step and a decoding step without any hidden layers. They lose the contextual dependencies between consecutive elements in the sequence.
2. Stacked Autoencoders - They combine multiple vanilla autoencoders so that the final output is obtained after passing through multiple levels of abstraction. Each level captures specific features of the input sequence and then propagates them upwards to form a complete latent representation of the entire sequence. 
3. Denoising Autoencoders - It adds random noise to the input sequence before feeding it to the encoder and removes the same noise during the decoding phase to obtain a cleaner output.

## 2.4 Bidirectional LSTM Model

Bidirectional LSTM model is another important concept in RNN. It uses two separate LSTMs, one running forwards and the other backwards in parallel, to capture long-term dependencies in the data even though the observation points are separated in time.

Each LSTM cell processes data sequentially in time. At each time step t, it receives inputs x(t) from both directions of the LSTM. It outputs two hiddens states, c(t) and h(t). The output state h(t) represents the current memory contents of the LSTM unit, while the cell state c(t) maintains internal activations of the neurons inside the LSTM unit.

During inference, bidirectional LSTM applies the forward and backward LSTMs separately on the given input sequence and concatenates the resulting two hidden states to produce a single output vector. During training, both forward and backward LSTMs use the ground truth labels to update their weights. 

# 3. Core Algorithmic Principles and Details

## 3.1 Introduction to Forward and Backward Propagation Through Time

Forward propagation through time refers to computing the activations of the neurons in each layer of an RNN, starting from the input layer and going forward through the layers until the output layer. Backward propagation through time, on the other hand, starts at the output layer and proceeds back through the layers till the input layer, adjusting the gradients of the weights accordingly.

In summary, the purpose of forward propagation through time is to compute the activation values of the neurons in the network for a given input sequence. The subsequent steps involve applying the appropriate transformations to these activations to generate predictions for the corresponding target variable.

The goal of backward propagation through time is to optimize the weights of the network by updating them in accordance with the error signal generated by the difference between predicted and actual target variables. Specifically, it computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight parameter in the network, thus enabling the optimizer algorithm to make updates that reduce the loss function value. 

The forward pass of the network traverses the time dimension from left to right, making note of the input sequence presented to the network. As it processes each element of the sequence, it updates the hidden states of the neurons in each layer using the input received from the previous time step. The results of the computations carried out during the forward pass are stored in the hidden state vectors of the network.

Similarly, during the backward pass, the network begins from the output layer and moves backwards in time, adjusting the weights of the network using the errors computed during the forward pass. Starting from the output layer, it calculates the error term associated with each time step. It then multiplies this error term by the derivative of the activation function applied to the activity of each neuron in the preceding layer, obtaining a contribution to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the respective neurons. Finally, the weighted sum of these contributions is passed back to the preceding layer, where the gradients are accumulated and updated according to the selected optimization method. By following this procedure, the network learns to predict the target variable iteratively, gradually improving its accuracy over time.


## 3.2 Long Short-Term Memory Cells

Long short-term memory (LSTM) cells are special kinds of recurrent neural nets cells that were developed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber in 1997. LSTM cells allow networks to learn long-range dependencies in the input sequence, which are difficult to capture with traditional RNNs alone.

An LSTM cell contains four gates - input gate, forget gate, output gate, and cell state. The key feature of an LSTM cell is that it allows information to persist or vanish depending on the degree to which it is needed. Input gate controls the flow of new information into the cell state, while the forget gate controls the deletion of previously stored information. Output gate determines the strength of the output signal, which is fed into the next time step. The cell state stores the overall activities of the neurons in the cell.

The computational flow of an LSTM cell includes the following operations:

1. Forget Gate - Decides whether or not to delete the content of the cell state. Based on the input from the previous time step and the candidate input, the forget gate decides which components of the cell state should be forgotten. 

2. Input Gate - Controls the flow of new information into the cell state. This gate works similar to the forget gate in that it alters the cell state based on incoming information and the candidate input. However, instead of simply deleting existing information, the input gate adds new information to the cell state.

3. Update Cell State - Updates the cell state based on the input gate and forget gate. This operation combines the newly acquired information with the previous content of the cell state to create a new updated version of the cell state.

4. Output Gate - Generates the output signal from the cell state. This gate produces the output of the LSTM cell by combining the cell state with the output of the previous time step. The output signal is typically sent to the next time step to continue generating predictions.

Overall, the benefits of LSTM cells lie primarily in their ability to handle long-range dependencies in the input sequence and their efficient computation. Another benefit is that they avoid the vanishing gradient problem experienced by traditional RNNs.

## 3.3 Gating Mechanisms in LSTM Cells

Gating mechanisms are important in LSTM cells since they help to regulate the flow of information throughout the cell. The mechanism implemented in an LSTM cell is referred to as the 'peephole connection'. Peephole connections allow the gate mechanisms to directly communicate with the cell state, bypassing the need for additional multiplications and additions.

Peephole connections provide a significant boost in performance compared to standard LSTM implementations. Without peephole connections, the gates in an LSTM cell have no way to access the cell state at previous time steps, limiting their ability to perform long-range dependency handling tasks. With peephole connections, the gates can retrieve the cell state quickly without having to traverse the entire chain of cells.

Another advantage of peephole connections lies in their ease of implementation and reduced hardware requirements. Since peephole connections operate solely on the basis of the cell state and the input from the previous time step, they don't require specialized hardware resources like multiplication and addition units. 

However, despite their efficiency, peephole connections still cannot fully replace the role played by standard gating mechanisms. Standard gates provide greater flexibility in controlling the flow of information, allowing deeper networks to achieve higher levels of performance. Additionally, peephole connections rely heavily on fast reads and writes of external memory, which can limit their scalability to very large networks. Therefore, it is generally recommended to use standard gates unless peephole connections prove to be critical in achieving high performance.

## 3.4 Attention Mechanisms in RNNs

Attention mechanisms are widely used in modern NLP systems for capturing long-range dependencies in the input sequence. In RNN architectures, attention mechanisms incorporate a feedback loop that enables the network to focus on regions of the sequence that are most relevant to the task at hand. Different variants of attention mechanisms exist, including global attention, local attention, and multihead attention.

Global attention involves aggregating representations from all positions of the sequence, providing a strong sense of context and implicitly considering all available information. Local attention focuses on a small region of the sequence, effectively discarding irrelevant contexts. Multihead attention consists of multiple instances of self-attention modules, each operating on a distinct subsequence of the sequence. This approach aims to exploit the strengths of multiple attention mechanisms simultaneously and increase the expressiveness of the network.

Generally speaking, attention mechanisms have been found to improve the accuracy and robustness of sequence modeling tasks such as translation, speech recognition, and dialog systems. Moreover, recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the design of highly effective attention mechanisms capable of handling millions of parameters, making them vital tools in real-world applications.
