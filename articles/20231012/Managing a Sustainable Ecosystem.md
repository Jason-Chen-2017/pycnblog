# 1.背景介绍


The sustainability of an ecosystem is essential to its long-term survival and prosperity. However, managing it well requires careful attention to the environmental impacts and interactions between different actors in the system. The complexity of ecosystems, especially those that include humans, poses significant challenges for sustainability management. To address this challenge, many researchers have developed novel algorithms, technologies, and approaches to help ecosystems better manage their resources and mitigate adverse impacts on human health. However, there remains much work to be done in understanding how these techniques can best integrate into existing systems and services and how they can enhance resilience and adaptability to changing environments. In this article, we review several key concepts and principles related to sustainability management in ecosystems and propose a framework to guide ecosystems' decision making processes during critical transitions such as climate change or natural disasters. We then discuss three practical applications of our proposed framework: addressing issues with water scarcity; improving transportation infrastructure; and reducing carbon footprint through innovative practices. Our goal is to inspire readers to think critically about the future of ecosystems by taking a holistic approach to tackling complex challenges associated with managing them effectively and responsibly.
Sustainability management in ecosystems involves several layers of considerations, including economic development, social equity, ecological balance, and environmental stewardship. A number of factors contribute to overall ecosystem success and failure. Economic development refers to strategies for increasing profitability, investment, and income opportunities through enhanced resource allocation across sectors and individuals. Social equity focuses on achieving wider social inclusion and economic opportunity for vulnerable groups while also ensuring strong institutional support for healthy ecosystems. Ecological balance refers to maintaining fundamental ecological processes, such as water flows, temperature gradients, and nutrient cycling, within acceptable limits. Environmental stewardship ensures that all aspects of the ecosystem are conducive to sustainability, including land use, soil management, water quality, and air quality.

In order to implement effective and sustainable solutions to these challenges, ecosystems must first understand what causes them to fail, why they occur, and how to prevent them from happening again. This knowledge can inform decisions regarding design, technology choices, policies, and actions taken by stakeholders. However, it can be challenging to develop robust management frameworks that cover various stakeholder perspectives, capture interdependencies amongst actors, and anticipate future trends and shocks. To overcome this challenge, we need to build upon established frameworks and methods, as well as introduce new ones tailored to the specific needs of managing ecosystems. These frameworks should provide crucial insights into the potential risks and benefits of each management option, enabling stakeholders to make responsible decisions based on data and evidence. We propose a structured approach to identify key issues and opportunities in an ecosystem, prioritize these concerns, and devise an integrated framework to manage the transition to a more sustainable world.

Our proposed framework includes four main components: (i) Causality Analysis: identifying the root cause(s) behind the problem, which could lead to instability and/or collapse of the ecosystem. (ii) Impact Assessment: determining the severity level and magnitude of negative impacts to human health, habitats, and the planet. (iii) Mitigation Strategies: developing prevention measures that can limit or reverse any adverse effects that may arise due to unforeseen events. (iv) Adaptation Planning: considering different stakeholder views and expectations and formulating plans to prepare for and respond to unexpected changes in conditions. Based on the analysis and planning process, ecosystems can take appropriate action to promote their continued growth and stability.

By applying our framework to diverse real-world examples, we hope to stimulate thoughtful discussions around sustainability management in ecosystems and inspire further research in this area.
