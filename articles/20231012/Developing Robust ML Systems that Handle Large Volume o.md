## What is "Scalability"?
In a nutshell, scalability refers to the ability of a system or network to handle increased demands and resources beyond its current capacity. Scalability can be achieved through various techniques such as replication, partitioning, load balancing, caching, and distribution. In this article, we will focus on scaling machine learning (ML) systems which have been proven to be in high demand by companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon among others. The main challenge of handling large volumes of data with ML algorithms is not necessarily technical but rather cultural and organizational related. It requires continuous integration and deployment pipelines to ensure consistency and reliability at scale. 

The key challenges involved in building robust ML systems are as follows:

1. **Data:** Handling large datasets efficiently requires efficient storage, indexing, and processing capabilities. This includes efficient algorithms for feature selection, transformation, and aggregation. Furthermore, it also involves optimizing hardware usage for distributed computing environments. 

2. **Models:** Training models using large amounts of data requires advanced algorithms and computational resources. This includes parallelization of training across multiple nodes in clusters or cloud environments, dynamic optimization of hyperparameters based on feedback from model performance, and regularization strategies to prevent overfitting. 

3. **Training Time:** As the amount of data increases, so does the time taken to train the models. Proper planning and monitoring of the process is essential to avoid long waits and crashes due to poor resource utilization or slowdowns caused by bottlenecks. 

4. **Inference:** Once trained, inference speed is an important factor when dealing with real-time applications where decisions need to be made quickly. Efficient computation of predictions on large datasets needs special attention since ML models often produce massive output vectors. 

5. **Testing & Deployment:** At scale, testing and deploying new versions of the models becomes challenging due to numerous factors such as resource constraints, heterogeneity of infrastructure, and changing requirements. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools can help automate these processes and reduce errors and downtime.

Overall, handling large volumes of data requires careful consideration of algorithmic design, system architecture, and tooling approaches. We hope that this article provides valuable insights into how to develop and deploy robust and scalable ML systems that can handle large datasets effectively.


## A Brief History of ML Scaling Challenges
Before discussing the specific issues involved in scaling ML systems, let's first talk about some of the historical trends leading up to today's problem statement. 


1970s: Waite and Frankel proposed the first mathematical approach to solving inverse problems using neural networks known as the backpropagation algorithm. Neural networks became popular in image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and other fields due to their superior accuracy compared to traditional methods. However, they were limited to small databases because of the costly computations required to perform gradient descent updates during training. 

1990s: Mitchell introduced the concept of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a simple yet effective optimization technique used widely throughout machine learning community. SGD was able to significantly improve the convergence rates and achieve near optimal solutions while still being very computationally efficient. Despite its success, however, SGD suffered from several drawbacks including low generalization capability and noisy local minima. Additionally, there was limited research on adaptive learning rate schedules, ensemble techniques, or efficient parallel computing architectures to handle larger datasets. 

2000s: Hastie et al., along with collaborators, proposed the Random Forest (RF) method which combines many decision trees into one powerful classifier. RF had significant advantages over SVM and logistic regression in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. However, RF was still sensitive to noisy local minima and underfitted to smaller datasets. Moreover, it relied heavily on randomness and bootstrap sampling to generate diverse subsets of data. By comparison, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) provided more accurate and stable classifiers at lower computational costs than RF, but GBMs still struggled to handle large datasets due to excessively complex models and overfitting.  

2010s: Dias and Gebru developed deep learning techniques that enabled state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks like ImageNet Competition. They built upon ideas from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These techniques not only improved performance, but also allowed for more flexible modeling of complex functions, automatic feature extraction, and end-to-end training without supervision. With the emergence of big data technologies, scaling ML systems has become increasingly critical.

The primary challenges faced by modern ML engineers include:

* Lack of expertise in scalable system design and implementation
* Limited understanding of underlying principles behind scalability and optimization techniques
* Inadequate tools, frameworks, and libraries available for implementing scalable ML systems

Recent years have seen significant improvements in scalability techniques and open source software packages have been created to address these challenges. Here are some examples:

### MapReduce Frameworks
MapReduce was originally designed to scale out Hadoop, a highly popular framework used for big data analytics. Its programming model focuses on mapping input files to intermediate key-value pairs, performing aggregation operations, and finally reducing them down to final output. Today, Apache Spark is another popular framework that extends the MapReduce paradigm to support fast distributed processing of large datasets. Both frameworks use cluster computing to distribute workload across multiple machines, providing better scalability and fault tolerance. Additionally, they offer APIs for integrating third party tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc., making it easier to build complex ML workflows.

### Distributed Computing Platforms
Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP provide scalable compute power and services that allow users to easily launch virtual machines and containers to run distributed jobs. Popular open source distributed computing frameworks like Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, and Apache Flink make it easy to implement scalable ML systems on top of these platforms. Cloud-native platforms like Kubernetes and Istio provide additional features like auto-scaling, self-healing, and service discovery, making it even easier to run production-quality ML workloads.

### Batch Processing Systems
Batch processing systems are suitable for running jobs that require offline processing of large datasets. Examples include Apache Hive, Presto, and Apache Drill. These systems read input data sets from external sources and store the processed outputs in central repositories like HDFS, allowing users to query and analyze the data at scale. Overall, batch processing systems provide good scalability for online prediction use cases involving small batches of incoming data.

### Caching Technologies
Caching is a crucial mechanism used to optimize performance and save costs. Various cache policies like least recently used (LRU), most frequently used (MFU), and time-based (TTL) eviction policies can be employed to manage cache space efficiently. Caches can be implemented either as standalone servers or integrated within application code. For example, Redis, Memcached, and Apache Cassandra are popular caching servers that can be deployed on different types of compute clouds to increase scalability. Similar to caching servers, caching techniques like sharding, partitioning, replication, and asynchronous updates can also be used to further improve scalability.

### Optimized Compute Architectures
Recent advancements in hardware technology have led to the development of optimized compute architectures that can greatly accelerate ML algorithms. For instance, NVIDIA GPUs and AMD ROCm provide dedicated hardware acceleration for linear algebra operations, convolutional neural networks, and machine learning algorithms. These hardware accelerators enable faster execution times and reduced memory consumption, making it possible to process large amounts of data on commodity hardware.

## Strategy #1 - Partitioning Data
Partitioning is a fundamental technique for improving scalability and improving efficiency of working with large datasets. When data is partitioned, each partition represents a subset of the total dataset, enabling parallel processing and distributing workload across multiple machines. Common partitioning schemes involve splitting the data into fixed sized chunks, grouping similar items together, or randomly assigning records to partitions. 

To properly partition data, consider the following guidelines:

1. Choose a meaningful partition size that balances between performance, cost, and ease of maintenance
2. Consider uneven partition sizes if your data varies in size or you want to balance loads across multiple machines
3. Ensure that adjacent partitions do not overlap too much to minimize interference between threads
4. Use appropriate hashing function to map keys to partitions
5. Minimize the number of hot partitions to avoid frequent disk access and improve cache hit ratio

Common partitioning algorithms include range partitioning, hash partitioning, and round robin partitioning. Range partitioning splits the data into contiguous ranges based on a chosen attribute, such as date or customer ID. Hash partitioning uses a hash function to assign records to partitions based on a given key value. Round robin partitioning assigns records sequentially to partitions based on a counter.



## Strategy #2 - Parallelizing Model Training
Model training is typically considered the most expensive operation in ML systems. To obtain maximum benefit from scalable systems, it is necessary to parallelize the process. Parallelism allows multiple processors or cores to execute independent parts of the same task simultaneously. There are two common forms of parallelism for model training: data parallelism and model parallelism. 

**Data Parallelism**: In data parallelism, the same model is trained on different subsets of the training set. Each processor trains on a unique subset of the data, aggregates gradients, and applies updates to the shared parameters. This approach reduces the overall training time by scaling the model complexity relative to the amount of data. While straightforward to understand, data parallelism may not result in optimal performance unless sufficient resources are allocated per processor. Therefore, care should be taken when choosing the degree of parallelism, especially for large models.  

**Model Parallelism**: In model parallelism, different submodels are trained independently on different processors. Each processor holds its own copy of the model weights and computes gradients locally, before synchronizing and updating the global model once all processors have computed gradients. This approach improves the scalability of model training by decoupling individual components and allowing for greater degrees of parallelism. However, it comes at the expense of increased communication overhead and can limit the effectiveness of certain optimization techniques.  



## Strategy #3 - Dynamic Optimization
One of the biggest challenges in scaling machine learning systems is tuning the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms. Hyperparameters represent adjustable settings that affect the behavior of the model and can significantly impact its performance. Tuning can be done manually or automated using a combination of techniques such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning. However, manual tuning is extremely time consuming and error prone. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning often relies on trial and error, leading to wasteful iterations and delays in deployment. 

To address this issue, recent years have focused on developing automated hyperparameter tuning techniques that leverage meta-learning techniques to adaptively learn best practices from previous experiments. Meta-learners examine past hyperparameter configurations and their corresponding objective values, and attempt to predict the next configuration that performs well on average. Based on this knowledge, they propose new configurations to evaluate, leading to faster convergence and better performance.

Therefore, to achieve optimal performance, it is crucial to tune hyperparameters dynamically and continuously monitor the performance of the system. Monitoring metrics such as validation loss, test accuracy, and latency must always be closely monitored and analyzed to detect any anomalies or degradation patterns early enough to take corrective actions.



## Strategy #4 - Avoid Overfitting
Overfitting occurs when a model is fitted to the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to unseen data. To prevent overfitting, it is recommended to follow the below steps:

1. Regularize the model to reduce the influence of irrelevant inputs, such as bias or noise
2. Use dropout regularization to randomly deactivate neurons during training, forcing the model to learn robust features
3. Split the data into separate training, validation, and testing sets to measure the model's performance on holdout data instead of fitting it to the entire training set
4. Use ensemble techniques, such as bagging and boosting, to combine multiple weak models to create a stronger predictor.

Ensemble techniques can provide substantial benefits in terms of accuracy, stability, and robustness. However, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity and slower training times due to the need to combine multiple models. Hence, careful tradeoffs need to be made between model complexity, stability, and training time.
