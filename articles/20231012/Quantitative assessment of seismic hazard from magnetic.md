# 1.背景介绍


Seismic hazard is one of the most important factors in assessing building safety and security at a construction site. The occurrence of earthquakes or other seismic events can have serious consequences such as loss of life, injuries to people and property, damage to infrastructure and structures, and increase in economic losses. It has become essential to develop tools that help to accurately forecast the potential seismic risk based on various factors such as geological variations, climate change, population density, transportation networks, etc., and take appropriate measures to protect the lives and property of human beings and natural resources. In this article, we will discuss the methods used to calculate the seismic hazard using different types of magnetotelluric (MT) sensors for estimating the magnitudes and distances of seismic waves arriving from Earth’s magnetic field. We also present an overview of various MT sensor technologies currently available and their application areas in evaluating seismic hazard from magnetic disturbances. Moreover, we propose several future directions and research challenges for quantitative evaluation of seismic hazard due to magnetic disturbance.

Seismic hazard refers to the potential extent to which a structure or area may experience damage from earthquake-induced vibrations. Seismic hazard can be calculated using various techniques including:

1. Frequency domain analysis of seismic wave propagation, wherein amplitude spectra are analyzed to estimate the relative amplitude of each component of the seismic wave and determine its frequency content. This technique provides estimates of the seismic energy release rate within a given distance range, which can be compared with earthquake intensity parameters to estimate the probability of an earthquake within a certain period of time. 

2. Time-domain analysis of surface motion, wherein surface deformation measurements are made during the earthquake process to identify whether the seismogenic layer beneath the structure is deforming vertically or transversely causing lateral shaking or tremor along the longitudinal direction. These analyses allow us to establish a baseline of movement speed and location over time, and compare it to the observed displacements to estimate the probable hazard of lateral movement within a specific region under future scenarios.  

3. Geodetic imaging techniques, wherein images captured by geodetic satellites are processed to detect changes in velocity and attitude, indicating changes in the distribution of the ground field in space and time. By comparing these images to synthetic models generated from prior observations and scenarios, we can estimate the degree to which the ground field varies across the entire earth surface and evaluate its influence on local seismicity. This approach requires the integration of multiple data sources and modeling techniques, making it challenging to implement and costly.  

  Within MT sensor technologies, two main categories exist - passive sensors (PS) and active sensors (AS). PS sensors measure the magnetic field by applying a weak current through them while AS sensors make use of actuators embedded inside the sensor units to generate magnetic forces. Both PS and AS sensors can be classified into three main families - full-wavefield (FW), split-wavefield (SW), and hybrid-wavefield (HW). FW sensors include Famous Sweetspot (FS) and Amperemeter AUTD, SW sensors include MiniSweet and Vectrino, and HW sensors include Jenoptik EMMOD and GS-550C. These classes cover a wide range of frequencies and resolution capabilities to provide real-time monitoring of ambient seismic activity. In general, modern MT systems typically consist of either one or more fully functional sensor units, or a multiunit arrangement with redundant sensors. Each unit includes numerous components like detectors, amplifiers, filters, digitizers, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and power supplies. Overall, the development of improved sensors and better algorithms coupled with increased processing capability has resulted in significant advancements in the detection and characterization of earthquake sources and impacts.

In summary, there are many ways to calculate seismic hazard from magnetic disturbances. Different approaches require different levels of expertise, equipment complexity, and computational power. However, when combined with robust software frameworks and robust database management, effective quantification of seismic hazard can significantly reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enable reliable risk assessments in all sectors involving construction and mining operations.
