# 1.背景介绍


WebAssembly (Wasm) is an open binary instruction format for executable code that runs in modern web browsers. The increasing popularity of WebAssembly has attracted many developers and organizations to develop smart contracts using this technology. However, executing the code sequentially can be very slow due to its sequential nature and single-threaded execution model. To address these limitations, we propose a distributed computing framework called Decentralized FX (DFX).

DFX provides a mechanism for efficiently executing WebAssembly (Wasm) code across multiple nodes or machines without the need for a central coordinator node. Each machine executes only those parts of the program that it requires based on its local computation resources and dependencies with other programs running on different machines. Furthermore, DFX uses graph partitioning techniques to parallelize computation and reduce communication overhead. This allows DFX to execute Wasm code orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods. We evaluate DFX through experiments using synthetic benchmark applications and real world applications.

In this article, we will introduce DFX and present its design principles, core algorithms, and evaluation results. Moreover, we will discuss future research directions and challenges. Finally, we will provide references and useful links for further reading. 

# 2.Core Concepts and Contact

To understand DFX better, let’s take a brief look at some key concepts:

1. State: A state represents the current values of all variables in a program. In DFX, each machine stores its own copy of the state while sharing data with other machines as needed. 

2. Program: A program consists of a sequence of instructions defined by the Wasm bytecode. It can either be deployed from a developer or loaded dynamically during runtime.

3. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): A directed acyclic graph (DAG) defines how programs are interconnected. Each edge indicates which two programs communicate with each other. A topological sort algorithm is used to determine the order of program execution.

4. Execution Plan: An execution plan specifies the exact set of programs to run on each machine and their corresponding input arguments. During runtime, a scheduler decides which plans should be executed next based on available resources.

With these key concepts in mind, let’s now talk about the main components of DFX.

1. Deployment Manager: The deployment manager is responsible for deploying new programs onto DFX. It analyzes the dependencies between the programs, determines the optimal placement of them, and allocates compute resources accordingly. It also handles failures such as lost network connections and program crashes.

2. Scheduler: The scheduler assigns tasks to the various machines involved in processing the programs. It prioritizes tasks based on performance metrics such as execution time and memory usage, taking into account factors such as task dependency and resource availability. Additionally, it ensures that no one machine exceeds its capacity limits.

3. Network Layer: The network layer coordinates communication between machines. It enables efficient message passing and reduces the amount of redundant information transmitted between machines.

4. Executor: The executor executes individual instructions within a Wasm program. It retrieves data inputs from the state database and produces outputs back to it. It also communicates with other programs and updates the state database accordingly.

5. Monitor: The monitor continuously tracks the health status of the DFX system and detects any abnormalities. It triggers appropriate actions such as rebalancing tasks and restarting failed machines.

Based on these components, let’s move on to discussing the core algorithms of DFX.

1. Partitioner: The partitioner partitions the DAG into smaller subgraphs based on the dependencies between programs. Programs within a subgraph share the same set of functions and global variables. This helps minimize communication overhead among programs that don't need to access shared data.

2. Task Assignment Algorithm: The task assignment algorithm identifies the optimal placement of tasks among the machines based on various criteria such as latency and resource utilization. It also takes into account dependencies between tasks and schedules tasks on machines where they have already been placed earlier.

3. Dynamic Load Balancing: The dynamic load balancing algorithm adjusts the workload distribution over time based on changes in cluster size and load patterns. It also reacts quickly to sudden changes in demand.

4. Dynamic Scheduling Policy: The dynamic scheduling policy adapts the schedule based on changing conditions such as hardware failures or network congestion. It balances the workload among remaining machines and minimizes unnecessary movement of tasks.

Finally, let's discuss the evaluation results obtained so far and analyze why they were successful.

The first experiment evaluated the effectiveness of DFX when dealing with large scale graphs with thousands of vertices and millions of edges. Results show that DFX outperforms existing approaches in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

The second experiment evaluates the effectiveness of DFX when performing computations on diverse data sets such as social media graphs and multi-dimensional grid data. Results show that DFx consistently outperforms existing systems in terms of both speed and accuracy.

Overall, our findings demonstrate that DFX offers significant improvements over existing solutions when it comes to handling massive parallel computations on heterogeneous clusters of machines.

Next, let's discuss the future research directions and possible challenges. There are several areas worth exploring in DFX. Here are some suggestions:

1. Fault Tolerance: Adding fault tolerance capabilities to DFX would improve its ability to handle errors and recover from failures. Currently, there are no specific mechanisms implemented to support this feature.

2. Adaptivity: DFX currently relies solely on static cluster configurations to optimize performance. However, the actual needs of the application may change over time. Therefore, adaptive strategies could help DFX adapt to the changing environment while optimizing performance.

3. Energy Efficiency: As DFX involves complex computations and heavy use of networking bandwidth, energy consumption becomes critical. Researchers have proposed novel power management techniques to reduce the overall energy consumption of the system.

4. Security: While DFX has been designed to protect user privacy and ensure security, additional measures need to be taken to enhance the security of the entire system. Some promising techniques include secure enclaves, encrypted communications, and data encryption.

5. Resource Management: Different types of hardware resources such as CPU, GPU, and storage have varying properties and constraints. DFX must manage the allocation and utilization of these resources appropriately to maximize performance.

These are just some ideas for future work. Let me know if you have any questions or comments!
