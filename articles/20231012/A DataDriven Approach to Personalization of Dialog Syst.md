Personalized dialog systems have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to provide differentiated responses based on the individual user preferences and goals. In this article, we propose a data-driven approach for personalizing dialog systems by training an agent to maximize the expected reward over multiple dialogue sessions. Our model is called CAREL (Contextual Adaptive Reward Estimation Linear), which uses reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to estimate the contextual rewards that are dependent on the current conversation context. We evaluate our method with several datasets and metrics including task completion time, feedback quality, and user satisfaction. We also show how our system can effectively handle variations in natural language understanding between users and demonstrates its effectiveness through empirical results. This work could help to advance the state of art in personalized dialog systems and enable more effective communication among users who share similar interests and needs. 
In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for personalizing dialog systems by leveraging reinforcement learning techniques. We use Q-Learning algorithm to estimate the adaptive reward function based on the current conversation context obtained from the dialogue history. The estimated adaptive reward is used to select the next action taken by the agent during each step of interaction. The key idea behind our method is to use reinforcement learning to learn the best way to interact with the user at any given point in time based on his/her behavior, goal, and context. To achieve this goal, we build upon two important ideas: 1) Contextual adaptation using neural networks; and 2) Reward estimation using linear models. By combining these approaches, we can generate more accurate predictions of what users want, need, and desire about the conversation topic.

Dialogue systems typically consist of a conversational component responsible for generating engaging conversations between the chatbot and human user. They often incorporate intelligent components such as NLU (Natural Language Understanding) modules that extract relevant information from the user's input and return appropriate answers. However, there exists no single strategy for personalizing dialogue systems across all users due to the complexity and diversity of linguistic, cultural, and social factors that influence user preferences and behaviors. Therefore, it becomes essential to develop personalization strategies that leverage user context and preferences to tailor the interactions with the bot.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables agents to learn from experience and take actions to maximize cumulative rewards. It has been widely adopted in many domains, especially in game playing, robotics, and autonomous driving. Similarly, RL has shown success in personalization applications where complex decision making problems require efficient exploration of various possible states and actions in order to obtain good solutions. For example, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero, Facebook AI Research's Dopamine, OpenAI's Gym, and IBM Watson's Conversation API are some notable examples of applying RL to real-world tasks requiring complex decision making. 

To apply RL to personalized dialogue systems, we start by defining the problem statement and formulating the objective. Let us assume that we are building a dialogue system that provides personalized assistance to customers, where the customer’s profile and historical interactions with the service define their preferences and requirements. The aim of our dialogue system should be to optimize the overall quality of services delivered to the user while ensuring high responsiveness and satisfaction. The objectives of our personalization framework include:

1. **Improving task performance**: Given a set of contexts representing user profiles and their past interactions, we need to design an agent that can efficiently navigate through the dialogue space to find the right response to the user query. We need to ensure that the agent selects the most suitable answer without compromising on the overall quality of the conversation. 

2. **Achieving satisfactory user experience**: Despite achieving high task performances, the user may still feel frustrated or dissatisfied with the system’s response, particularly if they don't like the recommended solution or the choice of options presented. Thus, it is crucial to design mechanisms that facilitate the positive feedback loop between the user and the agent.

3. **Adapting to changing user preferences**: As new experiences emerge, the user preferences change and thus the agent must continuously adjust itself to remain up-to-date. Specifically, the agent should keep track of the user’s goals and preferences and dynamically update its policy accordingly so that it remains responsive to the user’s needs even when facing unexpected changes.

Based on the above considerations, let us now dive into the details of our proposed methodology - CAREL.
