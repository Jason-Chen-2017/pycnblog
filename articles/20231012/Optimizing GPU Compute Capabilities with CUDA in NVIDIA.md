# 1.背景介绍


With the increasing popularity of deep learning frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, and Apache MXNet, optimizing the compute capabilities of GPUs for high-performance computing (HPC) is becoming a crucial task that has been researched extensively. With the advent of more powerful CPU architectures like Intel Xeon Scalable Processors, newer generation graphics cards have become cheaper but also less efficient compared to traditional CPUs. As such, it becomes essential to efficiently utilize resources by taking advantage of modern graphics processing units (GPUs). 

However, deploying HPC applications on commodity or cloud servers usually involves complex setups involving many components such as operating systems, programming environments, middleware stacks, networking infrastructure, etc., which can be challenging and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, containers have emerged as an attractive alternative. Containerization offers several advantages including ease of deployment, scalability, isolation, resource sharing, and portability. However, containerized HPC apps may run into performance issues due to suboptimal configurations of compute capabilities, device drivers, and software stack settings. This article focuses on optimizing the compute capabilities of GPUs within containerized HPC apps using CUDA technology in NVIDIA Docker Containers.

## Compute Capability:
A compute capability is a combination of hardware features used by a given version of CUDA and cuDNN libraries. Each compute capability corresponds to certain features available in a particular GPU model, enabling developers to write optimized code targeting specific models. The most commonly used compute capabilities are SM_XY, where XY stands for the major and minor version number respectively. For example, SM_52 represents the compute capability of Tesla V100.

## Device Management Libraries:
CUDA provides two device management libraries - cuBLAS and cuFFT - to simplify development and improve overall system efficiency. These libraries provide highly optimized routines for performing basic linear algebra computations and Fourier transform operations respectively. They can significantly reduce the amount of coding needed for implementing these algorithms while still achieving good performance. Additionally, they enable developers to write portable and vendor-neutral code that runs across multiple devices without changes.

## Memory Management:
In CUDA, memory management refers to the process of allocating and freeing memory on both the host and device. While there are different approaches to managing memory depending on the context, one common approach is page-locked (or pinned) memory, which prevents virtual memory swapping and improves data transfer speeds between host and device.

## Software Stack Configuration:
The software stack configuration determines how much control a developer has over their application's runtime environment. It includes various aspects such as compiler optimization levels, third-party library versions, debugging options, and even the presence or absence of certain libraries altogether. A poorly configured software stack can cause significant slowdowns or crashes when running HPC applications. Therefore, it is important to optimize the software stack configuration to maximize the utilization of available resources.

NVIDIA Docker Containers offer a flexible and lightweight way of packaging and deploying HPC applications. In order to ensure optimal performance, we need to configure our container images appropriately based on the requirements of the target GPU platform. We will use CUDA technologies provided by NVIDIA to achieve this goal.

## Enabling Compute Capability:
To enable a specified compute capability within a container image, follow the steps below:

1. Install the desired driver package on the container image. You can choose from the official Ubuntu repositories or build them manually from source.

2. Set up the appropriate device access permissions for the user executing your application within the container image. You can do this by setting the relevant directories to be owned by the user executing your app and granting permission to read/write to those directories. For example, if you want to set up GPU support for Tensorflow, you would need to add the following line to your Dockerfile before building the image:
```Dockerfile
USER root
RUN mkdir /usr/local/cuda && \
    ln -s /usr/local/cuda-$CUDA_VERSION /usr/local/cuda && \
    echo "/usr/local/cuda-${CUDA_VERSION}/lib64" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/nvidia.conf && \
    ldconfig && \
    chmod +x /usr/local/cuda/bin/* && \
    rm /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/*/include-fixed/limits.h && \
    rm /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/*/include-fixed/syslimits.h && \
    apt update && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y --no-install-recommends \
        cuda-cudart-$CUDA_PKG_VERSION && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && \
    USER $NB_USER
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
Here, `CUDA_VERSION` should match the supported compute capability of the targeted GPU. This creates symbolic links to `/usr/local/cuda`, copies CUDA libraries to `/usr/local/cuda/lib64`, installs necessary dependencies (`cuda-cudart`), and sets the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Note that changing directory ownership and granting file permissions requires `root` privileges so make sure to run the command inside the container after installing the necessary packages.

3. Build the container image and verify its functionality by launching a simple CUDA program. If all goes well, you should see the output of your program indicating that it is successfully able to execute CUDA functions.

## Optimal Software Configurations:
When optimizing the software stack configuration for better performance, we need to consider factors such as compilation flags, linker options, debug symbols, and other related optimizations. Here are some general guidelines to help optimize the software stack for NVIDIA Docker Containers:

1. Use the latest stable release of CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN libraries.

2. Enable debug symbols during compilation to allow easy inspection of errors and warnings. Make sure to remove any unnecessary debug information from production builds to minimize disk space usage and improve load times.

3. Avoid using deprecated APIs or outdated compilers to avoid potential compatibility issues.

4. Disable unused libraries or features to minimize bloat and improve security. 

5. Limit the amount of shared memory used by each application to prevent excessive thrashing. Consider reducing work group size or parallelization strategy to increase occupancy.

6. Minimize kernel launches to keep the workload balanced among threads and improve performance.

It is worth noting that each individual application needs to be analyzed for best practices and tradeoffs unique to that domain. For instance, some applications may benefit from increased thread counts or larger block sizes than others depending on the problem being solved. Similarly, memory access patterns may vary greatly depending on the input data and computational complexity of each application. Taking these factors into account, choosing an optimal software stack configuration may require experimentation and iterative improvement.
