Samsung's new AR solution allows users to interact with objects in real-time and create immersive virtual environments using smartphones or tablets. This technology is set to become the preferred way for consumers to engage with products and services because it offers a more immersive experience than traditional 2D interfaces, making it easier for them to explore their surroundings and make decisions. While Samsung has been working on AR solutions since its launch in 2017, this latest iteration brings tremendous benefits that are yet to be fully explored by consumers. In this article, we will dive deeper into how these technologies work, how they can benefit businesses, and what kind of innovative ideas could be created around them. 

Augmented reality (AR) refers to a technique that enables users to see a digital world through physical markers placed over the environment. Traditionally, augmented reality was used only for entertainment applications such as virtual reality games, where the user had limited control over the movement of the device itself. However, recent advances have allowed developers to create devices that enable users to interact with complex virtual scenes without any limitations. These devices include phones and smartwatches that run specialized software called AR apps. The use cases range from education, manufacturing, retail, and medical industry. One key difference between these AR apps and traditional touchscreen interfaces is that the former provide direct interactions with virtual content while the latter require multiple steps and clicks.

In this post, I'll explain why AR is becoming increasingly popular within business today, discuss some of the core concepts behind the tech, share insights about potential uses and impacts, highlight current obstacles and challenges faced by businesses, and finally outline some possible directions for future research. 

Let's get started!

2.Core Concepts and Relationships
Augmented reality involves two main components: hardware and software. Hardware includes cameras, displays, and various sensors, which capture and process images taken by the camera lens. Software renders the captured imagery onto the display so that it appears like an augmentation over the real world. AR systems consist of several layers that work together to produce a seamless and immersive experience for the user. Here are some important terms you need to know: 

1. Camera: This component captures images and converts them into computer-readable data. It also processes the image data and provides a live view of the surrounding environment. Mobile devices usually come equipped with wide angle lenses to capture high resolution images at distances up to 2 meters. Some AR devices may also incorporate additional features such as depth perception or motion tracking capabilities to improve accuracy and performance.

2. Display: This component presents the augmented reality experience to the user. There are different types of displays, including projectors, screens, head-mounted displays (HMDs), and glasses. Projector-based displays are best suited for low latency and battery life. HMDs offer the most immersive experience but require extra hardware and software setup.

3. Marker Detection: The marker detection module identifies and tracks the markers in the captured images. Each marker is assigned an ID based on its position and orientation relative to the other markers present in the scene.

4. Tracking Module: This component estimates the pose (position and orientation) of each marker relative to the user’s device or world coordinate system. Once the pose of all the markers is known, the rendering layer combines the rendered views from both the camera and the marker detector to form an accurate representation of the augmented reality environment.

5. Rendering Layer: This component takes the output of the tracker and generates the visual elements needed to represent the augmented reality environment. It includes models, textures, and lighting effects to enhance the appearance of the objects in the environment.

6. Input Device: Finally, there are input devices that allow users to interact with the virtual environment. These devices include buttons, gestures, voice commands, and tactile feedback. Users can navigate and manipulate objects by performing movements using these inputs. 

These components communicate with one another via a cloud-based network and exchange data in real time. 

3. Core Algorithm and Operations
To understand how AR works, let's look at a sample scenario involving a person walking down the street looking for a shop. In this case, the person would use his phone or tablet to access the AR app that has been installed on his device. The app detects a marker in front of the store sign and starts tracking its location. As he walks past, the app updates the model of the building in real time, allowing him to explore it in virtual space. During this process, the AR system automatically adjusts the viewpoint to ensure that the entire area visible to the user is shown, even if it extends beyond the field of view of the camera. Additionally, the app monitors the user’s movements to keep track of the player’s point of view. When the person approaches the exit door, the app triggers an alarm indicating that he should stop and leave the building.

Now let's dig deeper into the technical details of the algorithmic operations involved in creating an AR experience. We will start by breaking down the overall processing pipeline and then move on to examine the individual modules and algorithms used to achieve this functionality.

4. Algorithms and Processes
The following are the main stages involved in creating an AR experience:

1. Marker Detection: The first step is to identify the target object(s). This is achieved using various techniques such as feature detection, corner detection, blob analysis, shape recognition, and template matching. For example, when the user places an augmented reality tag on an item, the tag encodes information about the item’s size, color, texture, and location. Based on this information, the marker detection module can locate the corresponding object in the captured image.

2. Pose Estimation: Once the target object is identified, the next step is to estimate its pose in the real world. This is done using mathematical methods such as bundle adjustment and linear/nonlinear optimization. The pose estimation module analyzes the detected markers, calculates their relationships to each other, and infers the pose of each object in the real world.

3. Rendering Pipeline: The final stage is to render the virtual objects in real time. This is typically done using graphics APIs such as OpenGL ES or Vulkan. The renderer applies the necessary transformations to map the objects onto the real world, taking into account factors such as distance, height, perspective, etc., and composites the resulting images with the background of the real world.

4. User Interaction: After the virtual objects have been rendered, the last step is to enable interaction with the virtual environment. This is done using various input devices such as controllers, handheld devices, and gesture recognition algorithms. Depending on the type of application being developed, the input mechanism may vary. For example, in a driving simulator, the user might use a joystick to steer the vehicle, while in an augmented reality shopping application, the user might tap on items to add them to a cart and swipe to browse the store layout. All of these input events are processed by the corresponding subsystems and converted into appropriate actions in the virtual environment.

5. Performance Optimization: Although not strictly part of the overall AR processing pipeline, it is essential for achieving optimal performance and smoothness during the runtime. Various optimizations such as asynchronous rendering, multi-threading, and GPU acceleration can help reduce the load on the CPU and increase the frame rate. Additionally, streaming video or real-time video compression can be employed to further reduce the amount of data transmitted across the network.

We now have a good understanding of the basic principles and architectures underlying AR systems. Let's discuss how AR can benefit businesses and what kind of innovative ideas could be created around them.

5. Benefits of Using AR
As mentioned earlier, AR offers a promising opportunity for businesses due to its ability to create interactive and immersive experiences without requiring extensive hardware or software development efforts. Below are some of the ways in which AR can benefit businesses:

1. Empowering Consumers: AR makes consumer shopping more convenient and accessible compared to traditional interfaces. Businesses can leverage AR technology to redefine e-commerce by providing customers with a rich and immersive shopping experience. Customers can scan QR codes or use NFC tags to enter their purchasing information and receive immediate delivery notifications. They can preview product samples directly on their smartphone, without having to visit a separate website. Similarly, AR can give consumers insight into their daily lives and preferences. For instance, financial institutions can use AR to deliver personalized banking guidance and insurance quotes to individuals who need them.

2. Simplifying Business Operations: AR reduces the complexity associated with managing large numbers of locations. Managers can quickly update inventory levels, customer orders, and shift schedules just by looking at a screen displayed on their mobile device. By using AR, workers can easily view production progress, spot defects early, and optimize resource allocation. Also, by enabling remote monitoring and support, businesses can proactively manage their assets and prevent damage before it occurs.

3. Creating New Brands: AR creates a never-before-seen level of emotional connection between brand owners and their customers. Since consumers can virtually “touch” brands directly, they feel closer to them, leading to stronger emotional connections and increased loyalty. Moreover, consumers can interact with brands directly via social media posts, reviews, and opinions, encouraging them to spread positivity and reinforce brand credibility. Furthermore, the immersion of the AR experience allows brand owners to develop unique marketing strategies that go beyond typical marketing channels.

4. Enhancing Customer Satisfaction: AR can lead to enhanced customer satisfaction, particularly among young demographics who are often impulsive and vulnerable. Products can be designed to intrigue consumers by adding unexpected twists and turns. For example, fashion designers can create clothing pieces that react to different body language patterns and facial expressions. Online gaming companies can offer customizable avatars that mimic human traits, giving players a sense of agency and authenticity. Additionally, services can integrate AR functionalities to provide valuable customer support and troubleshooting assistance.

Therefore, it is crucial for businesses to invest in exploring and leveraging AR technologies to unlock new value creation opportunities and build long-term relationships with their customers. While the core principles and architecture of AR remain relatively unchanged, many advancements and innovations are still being made, and we need to continue staying ahead of the curve to stay competitive in the marketplace.
