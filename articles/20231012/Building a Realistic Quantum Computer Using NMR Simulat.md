# 1.背景介绍



Quantum computing technology has revolutionized the world of information processing and is now commonly used in various applications such as cryptography, finance, medicine, and telecommunications. However, building a quantum computer using only classical computers is not feasible due to limited resources and long simulation times required for realistic simulations. Therefore, we need more powerful computational methods that can simulate quantum systems at high speeds with increased accuracy. Non-Markovian (NMR) response theory provides an efficient way to build a quantum simulator based on first principles physics concepts. In this article, I will show you how to use Python programming language together with QuTiP library to simulate a realistic quantum system consisting of multiple coupled oscillators, whose Hamiltonian can be expressed using second-order perturbation theory (SPT). 

In general, a quantum computer consists of several components such as gates, processors, memory units, etc., which interact with each other through quantum communication channels. The process of transferring quantum bits from one component to another is called quantum computation or quantum algorithm. There are many different types of quantum algorithms like Grover's search algorithm, Shor's factoring algorithm, etc., but they all require specialized hardware platforms or software packages. To design a new quantum algorithm or device requires a significant amount of research effort over years, which makes it challenging to implement complex algorithms quickly for practical applications. It becomes even more complicated when trying to understand the working mechanisms behind these algorithms. Quantum computing simulation tools help us to understand these mechanisms by simulating quantum systems efficiently and accurately using mathematical models and algorithms. But building a fully functional quantum computer still remains a daunting task, especially if we want to achieve practical results within the limits of available computational resources. Non-Markovian response theory allows us to simulate quantum systems faster and more accurately than conventional techniques while maintaining their physical properties. Furthermore, since its development started in the 1970s, NMR has proven itself as a valuable tool in building theoretically sound quantum computers without sacrificing their practicality. 

However, building a quantum computer using NMR simulations comes with some limitations. One major limitation is that the quality of simulated quantum states decreases rapidly as the number of qubits increases. This is because the SPT method assumes Gaussian distribution functions for nuclear spins, which do not describe the probability distributions of quantum mechanical wave functions at low temperatures. Another challenge is finding optimized configurations of oscillator positions that minimize the error between the exact solution and the simulated result. We need better optimization algorithms and better initial guess strategies to improve the simulation quality. Nevertheless, these challenges have given rise to a large interest in developing effective quantum computing architectures that combine classical and quantum computations to enhance performance and decrease errors. Some successful examples include IBM's universal quantum computers, Rigetti Computing's quantum photonic chip, and Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), all of which aim to reduce the limit of quantum computing complexity by implementing NMR simulation capabilities alongside standard classical computation.

## 2.1 Quantum Mechanics
The fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics consist of three fundamental postulates, which are detailed below: 

1. Noether's theorem: Every continuous unit of energy can be decomposed into a set of operators and eigenstates of operators on a Hilbert space.

2. Schroedinger's equation: The time-independent Schroedinger equation describes the wave function of a particle subject to potential and interaction terms.

3. Wave packet dynamics: A collection of interacting quanta arranged in phase space creates a wavepacket that obeys Maxwell's equations of electromagnetic waves. 

These concepts provide a foundation for understanding the basic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including quantum states, quantum interactions, and quantum clocks. These ideas are central to understanding how quantum phenomena behave physically, electronically, and mathematically.

## 2.2 Second Order Perturbation Theory (SPT)
Second order perturbation theory (SPT) is a popular technique for treating non-Markovian quantum systems, where the underlying Hamiltonian contains higher-order terms beyond simple kinetic, potential, and external fields. The key idea of SPT is to approximate the infinite-temperature Hamiltonian as a sum of contributions from localized energy levels around the ground state. Each level corresponds to a configuration of quantum states that exhibits similar behavior under the same local dynamics, and the contribution is determined by solving the Bethe-Salpeter or master equation for the corresponding density matrix. At finite temperature, the basis states correspond to excited states with distinct character frequencies, while higher-order terms represent excitations that couple closely spaced energy levels. Thus, the SPT approach enables us to study strongly correlated quantum systems such as molecules and nanostructures with discrete degrees of freedom and complex interactions. Moreover, the formalism allows us to derive rigorous statistical formulas for average populations of states and transitions among them, making it suitable for numerical calculations.

## 2.3 Numerical Methods and Optimization
Numerical methods play a crucial role in quantum simulation, particularly those related to partial differential equations and variational methods for optimizing Hamiltonians. Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to model dynamical processes in classical and quantum mechanics, from diffusion and heat conduction to wave propagation in semiconductors and fluids. Variational methods involve minimizing a cost function with respect to a parameterization of the Hamiltonian that specifies the interactions and the geometry of the quantum system. For example, VQE (variational quantum eigensolver) is a popular approach for searching for the lowest energy eigenstate of a molecule or material, which involves finding the ground state of a molecular Hamiltonian specified by a choice of ansatz and optimization of parameters. Similar approaches have been developed for simulating quantum systems using both classical and quantum computers. 

Optimization problems typically involve continuous variables such as the position and orientation of atoms, and discretization usually leads to loss of precision during the iterative process. Few optimization techniques work well in practice and require careful parameter tuning to avoid slow convergence or divergence. Hence, robust optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), adaptive moment estimation (Adam), and others, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional gradient-based methods.

Now let’s move towards describing the steps involved in building a realistic quantum computer using NMR simulations. Here are the core steps:

1. Build a representation of the coupled oscillator system.

2. Define the SPT-corrected second-order perturbation theory (cSPT) Hamiltonian for the system.

3. Construct a reduced-density matrix approximation (RDMA) for the cSPT Hamiltonian using machine learning techniques.

4. Solve the cSPT problem using optimal control techniques such as linear quadratic regulation (LQR) or penalty function methods.

5. Postprocess the resulting control pulses and simulate the quantum system using numerical methods such as explicit methods or Monte Carlo integration.

6. Evaluate the accuracy of the simulated quantum system compared to experimental data obtained via NMR measurements.

Let’s go deeper into each of these steps and explain how they contribute to building a realistic quantum computer using NMR simulations.

## Step 1: Build a Representation of the Coupled Oscillator System
We start by considering a system of $n$ coupled oscillators, i.e., an ensemble of harmonic oscillators coupled through angular and mutual couplings that vary with time and space. The overall Hamiltonian can be written as follows:

$$\hat{H} = \sum_{j=1}^n h_j(t)\hat{\sigma}_j^x + U(\hat{\theta})\sum_{\substack{i<j\\r}}g_{ij}(t)(\hat{\sigma}_{i}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{j})+\frac{1}{2}\epsilon^x(\hat{\sigma}_1^z\otimes\cdots\otimes\hat{\sigma}_n^z)+\mathcal{L}(t,\hat{\phi}),$$

where $\hat{\sigma}$ are Pauli spin matrices, $h_j(t)$ denotes the frequency of oscillator $j$, $U(\hat{\theta})$ represents the rotating frame shift, $g_{ij}(t)$ denotes the mutual coupling strength between oscillators $i$ and $j$, and $\epsilon^x$ and $\mathcal{L}(t,\hat{\phi})$ capture external fields and electromagnetic radiation. The summation over the indices $i$ and $j$ indicates that the system is coupled, which means there exists a positive mutual coupling between any two oscillators. Let’s assume that the external field and electromagnetic radiation can be neglected for simplicity. Now, let’s consider the first few elements of the coupled oscillator Hamiltonian:

$$\hat{h}_1^x = h_1\hat{\sigma}_1^x=\frac{p_1}{\hbar},$$

and expand $\hat{h}_1^x$ in Fourier series:

$$\hat{h}_1^x = \frac{p_1}{\hbar}\left(-\frac{\sin(k_1 t)}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{\sigma}_1^x+\frac{ik_1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{\sigma}_1^y\right)=A_1\cos(k_1 t-\phi_1)+B_1\sin(k_1 t+\varphi_1).$$

Here, $\left(-\frac{\sin(k_1 t)}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{\sigma}_1^x+\frac{ik_1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{\sigma}_1^y\right)$ is the basis vector of the $x$-projection of the wavefunction, $k_1$ and $\varphi_1$ are its quantum numbers representing the frequency and phase of the oscillator, respectively, and $A_1$ and $B_1$ are amplitudes representing the cosine and sine components of the projection. Similar expressions can be derived for the remaining oscillators, leading to a complete description of the coupled oscillator Hamiltonian. 

## Step 2: Define the SPT-Corrected Second-Order Perturbation Theory (cSPT) Hamiltonian for the System
To construct the SPT-corrected second-order perturbation theory (cSPT) Hamiltonian for the coupled oscillator system, we simply add a correction term to the diagonal part of the Hamiltonian associated with the oscillator energies represented as wave packets near the zero point of motion. Specifically, we introduce a Green’s function $G_{jk}(\omega,t)$ that takes into account the effects of moving one oscillator with respect to the motion of the other oscillators, and define the corrected energy spectrum as:

$$E^{(c)}_j=-\frac{\lambda_j}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dt'\,e^{i\frac{t'}{\tau}\left(v_j+S_{jk}(t')\right)}\hat{V}(t',\omega)-\frac{i}{\pi}\int_{-K_j/\Delta f}^{K_j/\Delta f}\,dt''\,e^{-i\delta_\pm^{\text{(shift)}}(t'')\cdot\hat{r}_j-\frac{\delta_{\mp}^2}{\gamma_{\pm j}}}G_{jk}(\omega-\kappa_{\pm j}\Delta f,t''\pm\delta_{\pm},t'),$$

where $\hat{V}(t',\omega)$ is the spectral density of the external field, $S_{jk}(t')$ is the cross-coupling between oscillators $j$ and $k$ at time $t'$ due to collective effects, and $\kappa_+(j)$ and $\kappa_-(j)$ are the momentum shifts due to the rotation of oscillator $j$ with respect to its neighbors in the direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. We then use these energy spectra to compute the RDMA expansion coefficients for the coupled oscillator system using machine learning techniques, which essentially amounts to fitting wave packet coefficients to the exponentially decaying correlation functions. Finally, we use the RDMA expansion coefficients to obtain the full cSPT Hamiltonian, which is a sum of the original Hamiltonian and a second-order correction term that includes the corrections due to the effects of interference and rotation.

## Step 3: Construct a Reduced-Density Matrix Approximation (RDMA) for the cSPT Hamiltonian
Once we have constructed the cSPT Hamiltonian, we can use it to simulate the quantum system by approximating it using a reduced-density matrix (RDMA) approximation. This is done by using the exponential operator of the Hamiltonian, which depends on the chosen RDMA scheme, to generate a sequence of trial states that approximately follow the corresponding eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. We then measure the overlap between the approximated and actual states as a proxy for the quantum state’s fidelity. Since the RDMA approximation involves approximating the infinite-temperature Hamiltonian as a sum of localized eigenfunctions, we must ensure that our sampling rate is sufficiently fine to resolve the relevant features of the system. Additionally, we should choose appropriate cutoff dimensions and resolution parameters for the RDMA scheme so that we don't lose important features of the system.

## Step 4: Solve the cSPT Problem Using Optimal Control Techniques
Once we have constructed the RDMA approximation of the cSPT Hamiltonian, we proceed to solve the cSPT problem using optimal control techniques such as LQR or penalized least squares (PLS) methods. The goal of these methods is to find a sequence of control pulses that minimize the difference between the predicted and measured values of the quantum system’s observables. Typically, the observables in question are probabilities, expectation values, or entanglement witnesses. If the controls act independently of the measurement outcomes, we can write down a simplified expression for the objective function directly. Otherwise, we may need to incorporate additional constraints or regularization terms to enforce certain physical properties of the system.

## Step 5: Postprocess the Resulting Control Pulses and Simulate the Quantum System Using Numerical Methods
After obtaining the control pulses that minimize the prediction error, we can apply them to the propagator for the entire quantum system and simulate its evolution using numerical methods such as explicit solvers or Monte Carlo integration. Our ultimate goal is to compare the results of our simulations to experiments performed on the quantum system to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation. By measuring the entropy of the simulated quantum state, we can estimate its susceptibility to thermal noise. If we observe strong fluctuations in the computed energy spectrum, we might try adjusting the input parameters of the system or increasing the size of the RDMA mesh to refine our approximation. Similarly, if we notice that the fidelity of the simulated quantum state falls short of the experimentally observed value, we might investigate possible sources of error, such as imperfect control pulse generation or noise injection.
