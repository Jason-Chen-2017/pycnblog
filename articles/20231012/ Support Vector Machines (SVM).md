# 1.背景介绍


Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector classification or binary classifiers are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification problems. In this post, we will go through the basics and main ideas behind SVMs including its key features and how it works. 

SVMs use a hyperplane to separate data into different classes. The hyperplane is defined by a separating line that maximizes the margin between two classes. The objective of an SVM model is to find the optimal hyperplane that provides the largest possible separation among the data points without falling into any errors. It does so by finding the best set of hyperplanes that can split the data in such a way that the margins are wide enough to accommodate new instances but not too wide to cause misclassification. Therefore, it has become one of the most popular machine learning algorithms due to its ability to handle high dimensional data effectively and achieve good accuracy with less computational complexity compared to other algorithms. 

In addition to traditional linear models like logistic regression and decision trees, SVMs have gained popularity because they offer more flexible approaches than standard linear models while still achieving competitive results with low computation time. Additionally, SVMs provide a clear interpretation of what the algorithm is doing by analyzing the coefficients assigned to each feature. This makes them useful for understanding the underlying relationships between variables and their impact on predicting outcomes in complex domains. Overall, SVMs are a powerful tool for solving many real-world problems, especially those related to classification tasks.

Let's first understand some core concepts and terminology associated with SVMs:

1. Hyperplane: A hyperplane is a flat surface that separates space into two parts. In the case of SVMs, it represents the boundary between different classes within the input space. 

2. Margin: The distance between the hyperplane and the closest data point from either class. The larger the margin, the better the classification accuracy.

3. Optimal hyperplane: The hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes.

4. Support vectors: The data points that define the margin around the hyperplane. These points play a crucial role in determining the position of the hyperplane.

5. Soft margin: A soft margin allows some misclassifications even if the hyperplane cannot perfectly separate the data points. However, under certain circumstances, hard margin may be preferred over soft margin for better generalization performance.

To put these terms together, here is a simplified explanation of SVMs:

1. Input space: We start with a dataset consisting of labeled examples x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>. Each example consists of n attributes/features x<sub>i1</sub>,x<sub>i2</sub>,...,x<sub>in</sub>.

2. Learning phase: At this stage, we want to build a model that maps inputs to outputs using a mathematical function f(x). To do this, we train a SVM classifier which chooses an optimal hyperplane based on a cost function that penalizes wrong predictions.

3. Classification phase: Once our model is trained, we can make predictions about new unlabeled inputs using the same function f(x). If the prediction is positive, then the input belongs to the class corresponding to the hyperplane; otherwise, it belongs to another class.

Now let's dive deeper into the technical details of SVMs. Let's assume that we have a binary classification problem where we need to classify objects into two categories: Positive and Negative. Our goal is to develop a classifier that can accurately identify positive and negative samples based on their features.

Here are the steps involved in building an SVM:

1. Normalize the data: It is important to normalize the data before applying the SVM algorithm. Normalizing the data helps in making sure that all the features have similar scales and avoids any issues caused by varying scale of the features.

2. Select the kernel function: Kernel functions enable us to project the input data into higher dimensions. Various types of kernels are available such as polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid kernel. Choosing the right kernel function depends on the properties of your data and choice of hyperparameters.

3. Solve the optimization problem: SVM uses an optimization technique called quadratic programming (QP) to solve the optimization problem. QP involves finding the minimum of a quadratic objective function subject to linear constraints. The final solution is obtained by minimizing the Lagrangian multipliers provided by the penalty term.

4. Train the SVM model: After obtaining the parameters of the SVM model, we can apply it to classify new instances. When testing the classifier, we calculate the score for each test instance and output the predicted label accordingly.

Finally, here are the equations that form the foundation of SVMs:

1. Objective function: 

$$\min_{w,b}\frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^m\xi_i$$

2. Constraints: 
- $y_i(\mathbf{w}^T \cdot \mathbf{x}_i+b)\geq 1-\xi_i$, $\forall i$
- $\xi_i\geq 0$, $\forall i$ 

3. Lagrangian multiplier update rule: 

$$\begin{array}{ll}L_{\lambda}(w, b,\xi)&=\frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i[(1-\alpha_i y_i(\mathbf{w}^T \cdot \mathbf{x}_i+b))+\alpha_i] \\&\quad + \sum_{i=1}^m \xi_i\\&\quad+\lambda_{\xi}(\sum_{i=1}^m\xi_i)-\frac{\lambda_\max}{\mu}K(x_i,x_j)\\& s.t.\quad \alpha_i\leq\zeta_i,i=1,2,\cdots,m,\\ & \quad\quad \beta_i\leq\omega_i,i=1,2,\cdots,p.\\end{array}$$

where $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ represent the dual variables, $\xi_i$ is the slack variable, $\zeta_i$ and $\omega_i$ are the upper and lower bounds for $\alpha_i$. $\lambda$ and $\lambda_\max/\mu$ control the tradeoff between the hinge loss and regularization term respectively. K is the kernel function chosen earlier.
