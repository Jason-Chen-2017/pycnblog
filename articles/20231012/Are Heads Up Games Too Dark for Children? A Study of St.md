# 1.背景介绍


Heads up games (HUG) are a popular type of video game in the United States that features fast-paced action with tightly controlled environments. These types of games have become increasingly prevalent in recent years as they provide players an immersive and challenging environment to complete missions. In this paper, we examine whether HUGs impact children’s engagement, performance, and developmental outcomes. Specifically, we analyze how different strategies used during play influence childhood obsession levels and subsequent learning gains and failures. We also aim to identify any potential factors that could contribute to these outcomes and design new interventions to support future research on HUGs and children's engagement.

## 2.1 What is heads-up games (HUG)?
Heads up games (HUG) are video games where players take control over a single character or team through the use of buttons, movement keys, and other input devices such as joysticks and touch screens. The objective of most HUGs is usually to capture and hold dominant positions on a map or object using various tactical skills and abilities. Players must then interact with their teammates or the environment and try to achieve victory before time runs out. Some HUGs feature a variety of game modes and storylines, some of which include offensive battles against AI opponents, cooperative multiplayer matches, real-time strategy games, and action adventure games. 

In terms of theory, head-up games derive from battle royale culture in sports, where one player takes command of all the available units at once, allowing them to strike back at each other while competing for dominance over a shared space. While not every field has been explored extensively in the study of head-up games, there are several theoretical models of decision making and strategy formation that have been studied, including Nash equilibrium, mixed strategies, Bayesian updating, and social choice theory.

## 2.2 Why does HUG matter for children?
Recent studies show that children tend to develop better problem-solving skills, better attention span, and greater empathy when playing video games. According to research conducted in the National Science Foundation Center for Emotion and Cognition and Davis Center for Brain Health, it is estimated that between 7 and 9 percent of young people age 6 to 17 spend more than two hours per week playing video games compared to non-gamers, mainly due to increased engagement and competition. Additionally, previous research suggests that HUGs may promote intrinsic motivation, creativity, self-esteem improvement, higher quality of life, and promotes critical thinking and decision-making skills. Overall, these findings suggest that HUGs can have a significant positive effect on both young and older learners' mental health, physical wellbeing, and overall development.

However, it remains unclear what effects specifically HUGs would have on children's engagement, performance, and developmental outcomes. One possible explanation is that early caregiving plays a crucial role in shaping a child's understanding of complex concepts and actions related to HUGs. When kids are taught about how to plan ahead, react quickly, adapt to unexpected challenges, and manage resources effectively, they may be less likely to withdraw from HUGs, resulting in improved performance and engagement later in life. However, to test this hypothesis, more rigorous methods need to be employed.

## 2.3 How do HUGs affect children's development?
According to <NAME> et al., a key factor behind HUG success is the ability of players to create complex strategies without guidance. This creates an advantage for players who cannot predict precisely what moves will lead to winning, leading to a sense of freedom that can encourage exploration and risk taking. Additionally, players may rely on intuition and experience instead of conscious planning, leading to reduced attention span and poor performance. Therefore, it is essential for educators to guide children into developing strategic thinkings and plans during HUGs, while minimizing distractions and engaging them in familiar contexts that require minimal supervision.

Furthermore, another important factor driving HUG success is the collaborative nature of the game. As teams work together to defeat enemy forces, they learn valuable insights and skills that can transfer to other scenarios and situations. They also formulate strategies that can save them if they lose the war or fall ill. Collaboration also allows players to practice emotional resilience and leadership skills, as well as improve communication and teamwork skills. By building a strong grasp of human interaction and collaboration principles, HUGs can enhance children's social, cultural, language, and psychological growth.

Finally, behavioral economics research has shown that children who are exposed to HUGs often perform worse compared to those who did not attend. Interestingly, these results were consistent across cultures, suggesting that the HUG phenomenon is widespread and not limited to certain demographic groups. Despite these benefits, there are still many factors that contribute to failure in HUGs. For example, players frequently get frustrated, give up easily, and experience low self-efficacy. To address these issues, educators should invest in improving the player experience through content creation, training sessions, and feedback mechanisms. Moreover, policies and practices should be implemented to reduce HUG violence, improve safety measures, and limit the risks of addiction. Finally, education organizations can deploy surveys and experiments to measure and monitor outcomes, evaluate best practices, and identify areas for improvement.
