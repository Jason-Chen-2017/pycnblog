## Medical Treatment Technology (MTT)
The rise in the number of patients suffering from serious diseases such as heart failure and diabetes mellitus has led to the development of advanced treatments that assist physicians with their decision-making processes during these critical situations. One such approach is computer-assisted medical treatment (CAT). CAT uses algorithms or mathematical models to guide doctors’ decision making and provide accurate information about patient health status which enables them to make better clinical decisions. CAT technology plays a significant role in ensuring that patients receive optimal care by providing real-time feedback on symptoms and severity, guiding prescribed medication dosage adjustments and allowing early detection of disease progression. This advancement in CAT technologies alongside technological advances in diagnostic imaging and wireless communication also enable new ways to manage chronic conditions like depression and anxiety. Therefore, there is a strong need for qualified professionals in this field to ensure that they deliver high-quality outcomes to patients and improve overall quality of life of all involved. 

However, many physicians today are reluctant to adopt CAT due to various reasons such as concerns related to safety and security issues associated with using computer systems to manage their patients, lack of expertise required for implementation and training of system users, technical complexities involved, etc. To address these challenges, there has been significant interest in establishing professional associations dedicated to CAT technologies under the banner of Computer Assisted Therapy and Research (CAST) or Computer-Assisted Interventions (CAI). These organizations have paved the way for the rapid growth in the area of CAT research and education and can act as a platform for transferring knowledge, skills and experiences among practitioners and researchers working in the field.

## Clinical Decision Support System (CDS)
A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) is a computerized software tool used to support clinical decision making in the healthcare setting. It analyzes data gathered from multiple sources to identify patterns or trends, generate recommendations, or direct interventions to enhance patient care. The process involves capturing relevant evidence, integrating it into one cohesive picture, evaluating alternative options based on medical judgment, and selecting the best course of action. A key feature of CDS is its ability to integrate contextual information about patients, including demographics, lifestyle factors, medical history, family history, and other relevant medical records. 

CDS helps physicians gain insight into the condition of their patients and use that knowledge to make more informed decisions when treating them. As compared to traditional paper-based methods, CDS allows for quicker access to current information and analysis, streamlined workflows, greater efficiency in decision making, and improved adherence to regulatory guidelines. In addition, CDS offers additional benefits such as predictive analytics, adaptive interface design, and multi-modal integration across disparate data sources. However, implementing a successful CDS requires careful planning, resource allocation, and ongoing maintenance of the infrastructure needed to capture, store, analyze, and report data effectively.


## Computer Assisted Review (CAR)
Computer Assisted Review (CAR) refers to the combination of automated tools and manual review techniques applied to large sets of medical records to help physicians make faster, more efficient, and higher quality reviews. CAR tools often use natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and statistical algorithms to extract relevant findings from medical records, classify them according to severity, prioritize them, and assign severity ratings to each finding. They then present the results in a user-friendly format, enabling physicians to easily understand what needs further investigation, where appropriate therapy is needed, and how to proceed with care. While effective at improving patient outcomes, most CAR tools still require human involvement, though modern approaches such as crowdsourcing and virtual reality may alleviate some of this burden over time. 

Another form of CA review is called Adverse Event Reporting (AER), which involves monitoring and recording patient events that could negatively impact their health, such as hospitalizations, accidents, suicides, poisonings, drug overdoses, etc., and reporting them to authorities for proper follow-up. Many AER programs use computer-aided annotation tools to automate data collection and verification processes, but the initial setup and training of staff members remains a challenge for many physicians. Additionally, while AER reports may be informative, they typically only show the presence or absence of specific types of events rather than quantifying the severity or magnitude of those occurrences. 


## Concept Maps
Concept maps are a visual representation of ideas and concepts. They illustrate relationships between different ideas and concepts by mapping out their interdependencies and interactions. They serve as a useful tool for explaining the principles, mechanisms, or processes underlying a particular topic. There are several types of concept maps available, including entity relationship model (ERM), business process model, and decision tree maps.

Entity Relationship Model (ERM): An ERM represents entities (e.g., people, things, or ideas) and their relationships. Each entity is represented as a node, and each relationship between two nodes is shown as an arrow connecting them. ERMs are commonly used in database design, project management, and software development.

Business Process Model: A business process model shows how business activities interact with each other, both within the organization and with external stakeholders. Activities are represented as boxes containing text describing the steps taken to complete them. Commonly used in industrial engineering, operations management, and marketing.

Decision Tree Map: A decision tree map presents a series of choices or options leading down a path towards a conclusion. Each choice leads to another level of the tree until a final result is achieved. Examples include retirement planning, loan approval, or inventory optimization. Commonly used in risk assessment, portfolio investment, and product selection.

## AI/ML-Based Methods
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have revolutionized the field of medical image analysis, diagnosis, and treatment. With the introduction of cheaper and more powerful computing resources, more sophisticated AI/ML techniques have become increasingly popular for conducting medical image analysis tasks. Some examples of ML-based methods include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). CNNs are particularly effective for detecting abnormalities such as tumors and lesions in medical images. RNNs are widely used for sequencing medical data, tracking temporal changes in body temperature, and forecasting outcomes. GANs have been utilized for synthesizing realistic synthetic data, simulating breast cancer scans, and creating mimicry fakes. 

Recent advances in deep learning have helped develop novel techniques for medical image analysis. Several papers have demonstrated the potential for applying deep learning to assist radiology departments in identifying tumor metastases, which would not have previously been possible without deep learning methods. Within biomedical applications, studies have highlighted the importance of incorporating prior medical knowledge and clinical experience into AI-powered radiology workflows, which requires building comprehensive and interactive digital platforms that combine computational capabilities with domain knowledge of medical procedures and experts in the field.
