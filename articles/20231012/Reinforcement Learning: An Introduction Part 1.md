# 1.背景介绍


Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on how software agents can take actions in an environment to maximize their reward over time. It has been used for applications such as robotics and game playing, where autonomous machines learn from trial-and-error experience. RL algorithms have the potential to improve many aspects of human intelligence, including cognitive abilities like learning, planning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision making, as well as the ability to perform complex tasks like navigation or decision-making under uncertainty. 

In this article, we will introduce fundamental concepts and terminology related to reinforcement learning, review some popular techniques, and discuss future directions. We assume readers are familiar with basic machine learning principles such as supervised/unsupervised learning, linear regression, and decision trees. We will also provide references to other sources for more detailed explanations. The goal of this article is to provide a solid understanding of the field so that readers can confidently apply it to real-world problems.

# 2. Core Concepts & Terminology
## 2.1 Agent-Environment Interaction
The key idea behind reinforcement learning is that an agent learns to interact with its environment by taking actions at each step based on its perception of its state and reward signal. The interaction between agent and environment takes place through the following three steps:

1. Observation: The agent receives observation about its current state from the environment. This includes information such as the current location and velocity of the agent, the positions and orientations of objects within its vicinity, or pixels within an image captured by its camera.

2. Action Selection: Based on the observations received, the agent selects one or more actions to take. These may include moving forward, turning left or right, opening a door, etc., depending on the capabilities of the agent. Actions often affect the next state of the system, which is determined by applying physical laws or dynamics.

3. Feedback: Once the action is taken, the environment generates a new set of observations, rewards, and termination signals. This feedback helps the agent determine whether its behavior was correct or not, and provides additional information about the expected return if the chosen action were followed. Rewards can be positive or negative, and depend on various factors such as the performance of the previous action, the distance traveled, or any other relevant criteria. If the task is terminated prematurely due to errors or limits of resources, the agent might receive less reward than optimal.

This process continues until either the agent reaches a terminal state (e.g., reaching a destination), or the agent runs out of time or energy.

## 2.2 Markov Decision Process (MDP)
We can formalize this agent-environment interaction into a Markov decision process (MDP). A MDP consists of four components:

- States (S): The set of all possible states that the agent could find itself in during its interaction with the environment. For example, in a grid world, the states could be the position of the agent in each cell of the map. In Atari games, the states could be pixel values representing the screen output from the game.

- Actions (A): The set of all possible actions that the agent can take in response to its observations. Each action corresponds to a change in the underlying state of the system, resulting in a new observation and potentially a different reward signal. Actions typically correspond to movements or decisions made by the agent, but they can involve multiple choices and outcomes. Examples of actions in a grid world include moving north, east, south, west, up, down, left, or right. In Atari games, actions typically consist of selecting buttons to press, shooting missiles, or using special powers.

- Reward Function (R): A function that maps each state transition to a numerical value called the reward. Positive rewards indicate good behavior, while negative rewards indicate bad behavior. The goal of reinforcement learning is to discover a policy that maximizes the long-term sum of rewards obtained through repeated interactions with the environment. The specific reward function depends on the desired objective of the learning task.

- Transition Probability Matrix (T): A matrix that specifies the probability of transitioning to each successor state given a particular action and starting state. T(s',r|s,a) represents the probability of transitioning from state s to state s' with reward r after taking action a from state s. To solve the MDP efficiently, we use dynamic programming to compute these probabilities recursively, assuming the agent knows nothing about the environment except what is revealed through observations and rewards.

In summary, the agent observes the state of the environment, chooses an action, and receives feedback in terms of new observations and a scalar reward signal. The updated state transitions back into the next state according to the specified transition probability matrix and repeat the process until a terminal condition is reached.
