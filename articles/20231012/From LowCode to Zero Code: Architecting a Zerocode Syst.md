# 1.背景介绍


The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has given birth to an increasing number of use cases that require complex and sophisticated systems for handling large amounts of data. However, building these complex system architecture solutions is challenging as they involve expertise in various fields such as software engineering, computer science, mathematics, databases, networking, etc., which can be time-consuming and expensive. Thus, there has been an urgent need for zero-code approaches to simplify this process by allowing non-technical domain experts to create automated architectural designs with minimal human intervention. In recent years, several companies have leveraged AI and machine learning technologies to automate their process of generating system architectures. Examples include Salesforce’s “Architect” solution and AWS’ Serverless Application Model (SAM). These platforms provide a low-code approach to generate cloud-based applications without any coding experience from developers. However, it remains difficult to achieve similar simplicity when creating system architectures outside the realm of cloud computing environments where tools like Visual Studio or Eclipse are available for code customization.

In this paper, we will discuss how a technical specialist, CTO, could leverage AI techniques to develop a Zero-code System Architecture (ZSA) tool for customizing user-defined system architectures while ensuring high accuracy. We will present a new technique called Multi-modal Genetic Programming (MMPG), which applies multiple modalities of input data – text, images, audio, and videos – during its search space exploration phase to enhance the overall performance of the model. MMPG generates novel system architectures based on different perspectives including functional viewpoints, feature extraction, constraint satisfaction, and structural analysis. To demonstrate our methodology, we will apply it to build an AI-powered ZSA tool using Python programming language.

# 2.核心概念与联系
Multi-modal Genetic Programming (MMPG): A genetic algorithm framework that allows for multi-modality in its search space representation. It incorporates image and video data into its search space exploration through encoding them as sequences of visual features extracted from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, text data is processed via natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant keywords and topics. The resulting semantic vectors serve as inputs to genetic operations that mimic evolutionary processes within the search space.

ZSA Tool: An end-to-end system architecture designer platform that automates the entire workflow of generating a customized system architecture in real-time, making it easy for non-technical domain experts to implement business requirements quickly and effectively. The platform provides an interface for specifying key components, their interactions, constraints, dependencies, and attributes. Based on the user's preferences and criteria specified, the system architecture generator applies MMPG to optimize the generated architecture to satisfy all the specified objectives.

## 3.1 MMPG - Multi-modal Genetic Programming Framework
The main idea behind MMPG is to explore the search space of possible system architectures by combining multiple modality types – text, image, audio, and video – during the search space exploration stage. This is achieved through utilization of deep CNNs for extracting image features and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for extracting keywords and topics. The semantic vectors obtained from each modality type then act as inputs to genetic operators responsible for altering the system architecture under consideration. 

To understand how MMPG works in detail, let us consider an example scenario of optimizing a car rental service system architecture. The objective of this task is to minimize the total cost incurred over a period of one year. We assume that the user specifies the following details regarding the system architecture:

1. User Management Module: Includes functionality related to registering and managing users, authentication, authorization, and access control.
2. Rental Planning Module: Allows customers to book cars online before arrival at the pickup location.
3. Vehicle Booking Module: Enables customers to select vehicles directly from the vehicle inventory and arrange appointments.
4. Driver Dispatch Module: Provides information about nearby drivers, routes, and prices.
5. Payment Module: Generates payment receipts and manages transactions between driver and customer.
6. Customer Feedback Module: Collects feedback from customers after trip completion.

Based on the above specifications, we start by identifying what needs to be included in each module. For instance, the User Management Module requires functions such as registration, login, account management, password recovery, notification services, and billing. Similarly, other modules may include functions such as availability checking, booking confirmation, fare estimation, rating, review submission, etc. 

Next, we need to identify the relationships between the different modules and determine whether they interact with each other and with external entities. Since the primary focus here is on minimizing costs, it would make sense for some modules to depend on others. For example, the Rental Planning Module may depend on the availability of cars in the inventory, whereas the Payment Module may depend on the successful execution of the booking transaction. Another aspect to keep in mind is that not every module needs to interact with every other module – sometimes certain modules may be independent of each other.

After analyzing the specification and defining the required modules and their interactions, we move on to setting up the problem formulation. Here, we define the decision variables that affect the output of the system architecture, i.e., the modules, their interaction points, component choices, and configurations. For example, we might decide that the cost per hour of the driving service should be considered along with the hourly rate charged to drivers by the company. We also set the fitness function that evaluates the quality of the proposed system architecture based on the objectives defined earlier.

Finally, we proceed to configuring the MMPG search space exploration strategy. There are several factors that influence the choice of individuals in the population and their likelihood of reproduction. Firstly, diversity promotes adaptation of the best solutions found so far. Secondly, exploiting promising regions of the search space encourages the exploration of unexplored territory. Finally, pruning reduces redundancy in the population and helps to avoid local minima.

Once the initial population is created, MMPG begins iteratively applying genetic operators to evolve the population towards better solutions. One of the most popular genetic operators used in MMPG is mutation, which randomly alters the structure or weights of individual components or connections throughout the network. Other common genetic operators include crossover, which combines two parent individuals together, and selection, which determines which individuals survive and pass down to the next generation.

## 3.2 ZSA Tool - End-to-End System Architecture Designer Platform
Our ZSA tool consists of three major components: 

1. Component Library: Stores pre-built blocks of reusable system components, including hardware components such as servers, switches, routers, storage devices, and software components such as operating systems, webservers, and database management systems.
2. Graph Editor: Designed specifically for creating graphical representations of system architectures consisting of predefined nodes representing components, connectors connecting components, and edges indicating the directionality of data flow. This makes it easier to visualize and analyze the complete system topology.
3. Algorithmic Configuration Engine: Takes the graph representation of the system architecture and uses optimization algorithms to find optimized topologies meeting user-defined criteria. Our engine uses MMPG to combine multiple modality types during the search space exploration stage, providing enhanced search capabilities than conventional methods.

Overall, the goal of our tool is to enable non-technical domain experts to easily customize system architectures without requiring specialized knowledge of software development frameworks. We hope that by integrating powerful AI and NLP techniques into our system architecture design pipeline, we can create a platform that can reduce the barriers to entry for businesses wanting to adopt AI driven technology.

2. Preprocess the data by parsing out relevant keywords and converting the diagrams into a standardized format.
3. Train the Multimodal GP model using the preprocessed data to generate novel architectures that meet user-specified objectives.
4. Implement a front-end interface for users to interact with and configure the system architecture.
