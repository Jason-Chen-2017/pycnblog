# 1.背景介绍


As we move into this new era where humans are becoming more dependent on technology to accomplish their goals, how do we rethink our approach towards shared spaces? With increased automation, connectivity, and sensing capabilities, humans have become increasingly capable of interacting with each other digitally while they are sharing physical spaces. However, as social media and other digital tools become central elements in modern life, there is an urgent need for thoughtful design considerations that preserve privacy, dignity, and autonomy within a global collaborative environment. 

In this article, we will explore some of the core concepts and principles behind the future of collaboration and community in shared spaces through the lens of virtual reality (VR) technology. VR has been used extensively by professionals, scholars, and entertainers to create immersive environments, such as museums, galleries, theaters, or hospitalities. Moreover, it has been shown that VR can be useful for education, healthcare, training, and research. Furthermore, VR technologies enable us to unveil previously hidden insights and knowledge from multiple perspectives and contexts across geographical boundaries. Therefore, considering the importance of these technologies in today’s world, how should we design collaborative spaces for the next generation of workforce members and organizations alike? How can we leverage emerging technological advancements to develop new forms of communication and interaction that better support human-centered collaboration and community building? What role can AI play in improving the quality of experiences created in VR space? We will demonstrate these ideas through specific examples related to online learning and teaching, and discuss potential implications and opportunities for future design directions.

We first start by defining what “shared” means in terms of VR. Then, we focus on understanding different ways people interact with each other in a virtual space, which includes verbal and nonverbal communication methods like gestures and facial expressions, body language, eye contact, etc., and identify key factors that influence individual behavior when interacting with others. Next, we understand how current VR systems may not always foster healthy interactions between people, especially during periods of intense engagement and collaboration. Finally, we examine several examples of collaborative spaces designed using VR technology, including museums, galleries, offices, hotels, restaurants, and hospitals, and analyze them based on their features, functionality, and user experience. Based on these analyses, we propose a set of guidelines and recommendations for developing effective and enjoyable shared spaces for users of all ages and skill levels.

# 2. Core Concepts and Principles
## 2.1 Virtual Reality (VR)
Virtual reality (VR) refers to a type of simulation software that provides a realistic view of a virtual environment via computer displays. The system uses various devices to capture images, audio signals, and movement data from around the user's head and hands, allowing the observer to feel as if they are inside the simulated environment. For example, Oculus Rift is one such device used for VR applications on the PC platform. While traditional video games were originally developed for consoles only, VR has allowed developers to bring virtual reality to a wider audience. According to Statista, in December 2017, up to 9% of total sales in video game companies involved VR content creation and distribution. As of January 2022, there are over 4 billion VR headsets sold globally, representing half of the entire HMD market share. This boom in popularity underscores the growing interest in utilizing VR technologies in various fields, including education, healthcare, training, entertainment, research, and public safety.


According to Gartner, as of 2020, 85% of businesses expect their employees to use virtual reality at least once per week due to its benefits for productivity, efficiency, wellness, and creativity. Additionally, a survey conducted by McKinsey & Co. found that virtual reality could help companies reduce costs and enhance operational efficiencies by enabling workers to spend less time waiting in line and instead performing tasks faster and more effectively. Overall, the growth in the use of VR technologies continues to grow year after year. 


However, many misconceptions and myths surrounding VR exist amongst stakeholders. Some common ones include:


### Misconception #1: VR Doesn't Affect Brain Function
One commonly held belief is that the presence of virtual reality does not affect the brain functioning. Although studies show that certain types of activities performed in virtual environments can improve cognitive abilities, very little research has been done on whether VR affects brain functioning or promotes neuroplasticity. In fact, it has been suggested that even brief amounts of virtual reality usage could lead to decline in mental agility, attention span, problem-solving skills, and memory capacity [1].


### Misconception #2: VR Is Not Replacement For Human Beings
Another common misconception is that VR replaces human beings entirely. Despite its immersive qualities, research shows that VR users often report feeling disoriented, lost, distracted, and confused during their use [2]. Moreover, recent findings indicate that VR users still rely on visual stimuli for navigation, decision making, and information processing [3]. It is essential to understand that VR offers an alternative way to learn and practice skills, rather than replace humans completely.


### Misconception #3: VR Is Always Better Than Traditional Technology
It has been argued that VR is always better than traditional technology because it helps individuals improve their abilities and performance. However, recent research suggests that this argument is flawed and contradictory. First, there is no clear evidence showing that VR actually improves performance compared to traditional techniques. Second, most VR applications target certain domains, such as gaming, medical imaging, or education, and therefore cannot directly compare apples to apples. Third, recent studies also indicate that VR applications are prone to errors, causing negative impacts on users' mental health and physical health [4].


### Misconception #4: VR Can Cause Autism
While research shows that VR can cause autism, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of these claims. Research shows that VR may indeed encourage certain behaviors, but those behaviors might not be immediately harmful or detrimental to an individual's development. Nevertheless, significant challenges still remain before VR can be safely adopted as a treatment for autism [5].



Based on the above observations and misconceptions, let's now define the concept of shared spaces in VR.


## 2.2 Definition of Shared Spaces in VR
Shared spaces refer to virtual spaces that allow multiple users to interact with each other simultaneously and together. These spaces can range from co-living rooms to multiplayer games or virtual classrooms where students can meet face-to-face with professors or teachers. In VR, a shared space allows two or more users to gather together virtually and interact with each other. They can communicate verbally, express emotional states, and manipulate objects or devices collectively. These unique characteristics make shared spaces highly valuable in virtual environments, particularly for communities of practice and professional groups who require close interaction with colleagues or clients.


Key aspects of a shared space that distinguish it from traditional office buildings or living rooms are:


**1.** **Spatial arrangement**: Shared spaces typically consist of seating areas, tables, walls, mirrors, light fixtures, and other components for setting the scene. These elements provide structure and organization to the space, ensuring that everyone has access to their desired positions. 


**2.** **Natural lighting**: Many VR applications incorporate natural lighting effects to enhance the immersion and sense of presence experienced by participants. This helps to create an environment conducive to social interaction and collaboration. 


**3.** **Crowd dynamics**: As the number of participants increases, so does the pressure on them to stay together physically. To counteract this effect, VR applications offer adjustable floor heights, which ensure that participants maintain a comfortable distance from one another. 


**4.** **Presence detection**: VR applications use various sensors and algorithms to detect participant presence, movements, actions, and expressions. These data points can be analyzed to understand individual preferences and motivations and determine appropriate interactions accordingly. 


**5.** **Interactive objects**: Shared spaces may feature interactive objects, such as furniture, props, or vehicles, that users can interact with collectively. These objects may serve as working surfaces or breakout areas for individual conversations or teamwork sessions. 



Overall, shared spaces in VR are both spatially organized and naturally lit, offering ample privacy and personal control. They also enable high degrees of freedom of expression and communication, giving participants the opportunity to exercise agency and participate in meaningful relationships. Despite their unique characteristics, however, challenges still exist regarding privacy, security, accessibility, and flexibility of interactions. Ultimately, shared spaces in VR must be designed with careful consideration of individual needs, desires, and preferences to promote positive outcomes for participants and their teams alike.
