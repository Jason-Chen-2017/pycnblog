# 1.背景介绍


Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier is a simple yet powerful algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this article, we will learn about the basic idea behind NB and how it works on some practical examples.

In statistics and machine learning, Naïve Bayes classifiers are probabilistic machine learning models based on Bayes' theorem with strong (naïve) independence assumptions between the features. The main aim of the model is to calculate the probabilities of each class given a set of attributes or predicting new values for unseen data points using probability distributions. 

The "naïve" assumption means that the presence of a particular feature does not affect the presence or absence of other features, which simplifies the computation of conditional probabilities. For example, if we have two features A and B, then assuming they are independent leads us to the following formula for calculating the probability P(B|A):

P(B|A)=P(B∩A)/P(A)

where ∩ denotes the intersection operator. This assumes that the occurrence of one feature alone cannot cause the occurrence of another without any interaction. However, this may not always hold true and hence the naïve assumption should be taken into account while working with real-world datasets.

## 2.1. Binary Classification Problem
Binary classification refers to a problem where there are only two possible outcomes or classes, typically represented by the labels ‘0’ and ‘1’. In binary classification problems, we want to identify whether an input belongs to one of these two classes or not. 
Examples include spam filtering, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, disease diagnosis, etc.

## 2.2. Multinomial Model
Multinomial modeling uses the multivariate Bernoulli distribution as its likelihood function. In the multinomial setting, the outcome variable Y takes on k different values ranging from 0 to k-1, where k is the number of classes. Each outcome corresponds to a specific combination of the input variables X1 through Xd. 

For instance, in image recognition, the output could correspond to a label identifying a dog breed or a car brand. When performing multiclass classification, we assume that all the outputs come from the same categorical distribution family. We use a priori probabilities θk to represent the probability of the kth output occurring, and likewise, we estimate the parameters of the likelihood function using observed data. We maximize the joint log-likelihood of the entire dataset under the assumed generative process to obtain our estimated parameter vectors. 

## 2.3. Gaussian Model
Gaussian modeling provides a way to handle continuous variables in addition to discrete ones. In general, the likelihood function for continuous variables is usually assumed to belong to a normal distribution. As a result, we can apply standard linear algebra techniques such as matrix multiplication and determinants to compute the posterior probability density function. In the case of multiple inputs, we extend the above methods to accommodate them, which involves using vectorization and broadcasting operations instead of loops. Additionally, when dealing with large datasets, we may need to optimize the training process using stochastic gradient descent algorithms like AdaGrad or Adam.

The steps involved in implementing the Naive Bayes algorithm for binary classification include:

1. Data pre-processing - Since the algorithm is very sensitive to the quality of the data, we preprocess the data by removing missing values, handling outliers, scaling the numerical values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Training phase - The next step is to train the model on a labeled dataset. During the training phase, we update the prior probabilities θk and the conditional probabilities P(Xij|Yj) for each attribute xi in relation to the corresponding output yj. 
3. Testing phase - Once the model has been trained, we can test it on a separate testing dataset to evaluate its performance. To make predictions, we first compute the product of the conditional probabilities for each attribute for each record in the testing dataset, and take the argmax across all the outputs to get the final predicted class.

Now let's consider an example to understand the maths behind the algorithm. Consider a binary classification task where the input variables are x = {x1, x2} and the output variable is either “+” or "-". Let’s say we have n records {({x1i, x2i}, yi)} where xi = {x1i, x2i} is the input vector and yi is the corresponding output (+/-) value.

## 3.1 Prior Probabilities
Let π(+) and π(-) be the prior probabilities of positive and negative class membership respectively. These can be estimated from the total count of records belonging to those respective classes. Mathematically,

π+(n+) + π-(n-) = n+, i.e., π+(n+) ≡ π-(n-), so that:


π+ ≈ n+/n
π- ≈ n-/n
 
Here, n+ and n- are the counts of positive and negative records respectively, and n is the total count of records. 

## 3.2 Likelihood Ratios
For each input variable xi, we can define the conditional probability table P(xi|y=+), P(xi|y=-), where P(xi|y=+) represents the probability of xi given the positive class membership and similarly for P(xi|y=-). Now, for each input variable xi, we can estimate the probabilities based on their frequency of occurence in the positive and negative class samples. The formulas used here depend on whether the variables are categorical or continuous.  

### Categorical Variables
If the variable xi is a categorical variable with k categories, then we can use maximum likelihood estimates to estimate the probabilities. Specifically, suppose that the variable xi can take on the values v1 through vk, and there are ni instances of xi taking the value vi in the positive and no instances of xi taking the value vi in the negative sample. Then, the probability of xi taking the value vi conditioned on the positive class being present can be calculated as follows:

P(vi | y=+) ≥ ni / (ni + n-k)
where ni is the number of times xi takes the value vi in the positive sample, and n-k is the remaining count of distinct values that xi takes in the negative sample. Note that we add a pseudocount of 1 to avoid division by zero errors during estimation.

Similarly, the probability of xi taking the value vi conditioned on the negative class being present can be calculated as follows:

P(vi | y=-) ≥ n-k/(n+nk)
where nk is the count of distinct values of xi that appear exactly once in the negative sample.

Finally, we combine the conditional probabilities along with the priors to arrive at the overall probability tables P(+|x), P(-|x) and P(|x).

Mathematically, the updated probability tables can be obtained as:

 
P(+|x) = prod_{j=1}^m (P(xj|y=+) * π+)^ei  * (P(xj|y=-)*π-)^{n_i-ei}   , where m is the number of input variables, j=1,...,m and ei is the evidence count for the jth variable xi.
P(-|x) = prod_{j=1}^m (P(xj|y=+) * π+)^ei  * (P(xj|y=-)*π-)^{n_i-ei}
P(x) = P(+) * P(-) + ε



### Continuous Variables
When the variables are continuous, we assume that they follow a normal distribution. Therefore, we can use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to fit the normal distribution to the data and determine the mean μ and variance σ^2 for each variable xi in the positive and negative class samples. From these estimates, we can estimate the probability distributions p(x|+) and p(x|-) using the Normal PDF functions. Finally, we combine the results with the priors to obtain the overall probability tables P(+|x), P(-|x) and P(|x).

Mathematically, the updated probability tables can be obtained as:

 
P(+|x) = prod_{j=1}^m N(x_j;μ_+[j],σ^2_+)   * (P(yj|y=+) * π+)^ei  * (P(yj|y=-)*π-)^{n_i-ei} , where j=1,...,m and yi is the output variable (+/-).
P(-|x) = prod_{j=1}^m N(x_j;μ_-[j],σ^2_-)   * (P(yj|y=+) * π+)^ei  * (P(yj|y=-)*π-)^{n_i-ei}  
P(x) = P(+) * P(-) + ε




## 3.3 Prediction
Once the likelihood ratios have been computed for each record, we can simply multiply the individual probabilities together and choose the highest scoring category as the final prediction. Alternatively, we can also use MAP inference to assign higher scores to categories that have higher posteriors, giving rise to a soft assignment rather than hard decisions.
