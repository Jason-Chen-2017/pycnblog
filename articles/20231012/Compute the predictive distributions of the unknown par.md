# 1.背景介绍


在许多实际应用场景中，例如运筹学、风险管理等，我们需要对未知参数进行预测，特别是在复杂的系统中有着复杂的依赖关系时，如何有效地求解这些未知参数的概率分布是一个重要的问题。传统上，人们往往通过手工计算或基于规则的预设方法求解未知参数的概率分布，然而随着数据量的增长，预设的方法不能适应快速变化的系统动态。因此，利用机器学习的方法或优化算法求解未知参数的概率分布则成为当前的研究热点。本文主要讨论利用深度学习的方法求解未知参数的概率分布。


# 2. Core Concepts and Connections with Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (PGM)
Probability density function (pdf) is a fundamental concept in statistics that represents the likelihood of observing certain values or events given some assumptions about the process generating these observations. In PGM, we consider directed graphical models where nodes represent variables or factors and edges represent dependencies between them. The joint probability distribution over all variables can be factorized into product of conditional probabilities, i.e., p(X1, X2,..., Xt)=p(X1)*p(X2|X1)*...*p(Xt-1|X{t-1}). By marginalization, we obtain the unconditional distributions for each variable, which are represented as conditional densities using Bayes' rule. 

In machine learning and statistical modeling, it is common to use probabilistic inference algorithms such as variational inference or expectation maximization (EM), which compute approximate posterior distributions by updating their parameters iteratively based on observed data samples. However, since those methods only approximate the true posterior distribution, computing its exact form may still be challenging. To address this problem, deep neural networks have been proposed as an alternative approach to parameter estimation in complex systems due to their ability to learn highly non-linear relationships among inputs and outputs.

To connect deep neural networks with PGMs, let's recall Bayesian neural networks (BNN). BNNs are specifically designed for probabilistic inference and model complex dependencies among random variables. They consist of multiple layers of hidden units that take input features x and produce output predictions y_hat along with a set of learned weight matrices W. For example, if there are t input features xi1, xi2,..., xit, the predicted mean vector μt=W1*xi1+W2*xi2+⋯+Wt*xit is obtained through a sigmoid activation function applied on the summation of weighted inputs followed by multiplication by weights. Given sufficiently many examples of training data {x1,y1}, {x2,y2},..., {xt,yt} from the same underlying distribution, the goal of BNNs is to estimate the parameters of the weight matrix W that minimize the negative log likelihood loss L=-log p(y|x,θ), where θ denotes the collection of all parameters of the network. This optimization leads to stochastic gradient descent updates on the parameters θ until convergence.

We can see how BNNs can provide a powerful way to learn complex dependence structures among random variables without assuming any parametric forms. Moreover, they do not require handcrafted feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning, making them easy to apply to different problems. We can interpret BNNs as natural generalizations of Bayesian techniques to probabilistic inference in graph models.

However, one key challenge of applying traditional methods like EM or vi to compute the predictive distribution of unknown parameters is that they typically assume Gaussianity or conjugacy structure among variables. To deal with more complicated dependency structures, recent research has focused on extending the scope of Bayesian analysis to include more expressiveness, particularly in terms of non-conjugate priors and nonlinear transformations of the latent variables. Among these extensions, probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) offer an elegant solution to handle both linear and non-linear dependencies by introducing a series of non-linear transforms, called multiscale architectures, on top of standard fully connected layers. PNNs also allow us to specify additional constraints on the prediction distribution, such as ensuring mutual information between pairs of variables, reducing the degree of coupling between neighboring variables, and imposing smoothness constraints on the output functions. These extensions enable us to capture more complex and flexible dependencies in the predictive distribution than standard approaches, leading to better performance and interpretability.



# 3. Algorithmic Principles and Details
The main idea behind PNNs is to introduce a new type of non-linear transform to replace the standard fully connected layer. Rather than simply passing the input directly through a single hidden unit, PNNs perform a series of transformation operations before feeding the result to the next layer. Each transformation operation consists of two parts: an element-wise mapping and a non-linear activation function. Let's call these maps T and σ respectively, where T performs a linear transform while σ applies a non-linear activation function such as ReLU, softmax, etc.

Let's say our input x is a vector of size n and we want to map it to a higher dimensional space of size k using a series of transformation operators T1,T2,...,Tk. Denote the transformed input by h=T1(x), T2(h),..., Tk(hj-1). Then we concatenate the resulting vectors h1, h2,..., hk together to get a final representation z=[h1; h2;... ;hk] of size n+k. This step essentially involves concatenating several consecutive linear mappings so that we can leverage the expressivity of deeper models. Finally, we pass the resulting vector z through another linear layer followed by a non-linear activation function σ to generate the final output y_hat. Mathematically, we can write this algorithm as follows:

```python
for l = 1:L
    # Perform transformation operation Ti(x) on input x
    w_il ∼ N(0, s^2I)   // Initialize weight matrix Wi with zero mean and variance s^2
    zi = σ(Wxi)          // Apply linear transformation to input and add bias term
    
    # Concatenate intermediate representations hi onto previous ones z_{l-1}
    if l>1
        zk = [z_l-1; zi]    // Stack current representation with last iteration's
    else
        zk = zi             // First iteration case
    end
    
    # Pass concatenation through another linear layer and non-linear activation function
    wi ∼ N(0, s^2I)      // Initialize weight matrix Wf with zero mean and variance s^2
    zo = σ(Wf*(zk))     // Apply linear transformation and add bias term
    
    if l==L            // Output layer case
        y_hat = zo       // Final output value
    else                // Hidden layer case
        z_l = zo        // Update internal state for subsequent iterations
    end
    
end
```

Here, we initialize the weight matrices Wi and Wf with small variances s^2, which controls the amount of flexibility in the model. At each layer l, we first perform the transformation operation Ti(x) on the input x, which produces a new representation zi that gets appended to the previous internal state z_l-1 to form a new concatenated state zk=[z_l-1;zi]. We then apply another linear layer followed by the non-linear activation function σ to generate the output zo. If this is the final layer, we return the final output value y_hat; otherwise, we update the internal state z_l for the next iteration. Note that the non-linear activations σ ensure that the final output y_hat satisfies certain properties, such as being bounded within a reasonable range, having finite second derivative when taking gradients, etc.

One important aspect of PNNs is that they can be trained end-to-end by minimizing the negative log-likelihood objective function. Specifically, during training, we fix all but one set of parameters at initialization and optimize the remaining parameters by backpropagating the gradient through the entire computation graph. Despite the complexity of this algorithm, the basic idea remains simple: we combine the strengths of convolutional neural networks and Bayesian methods to create a powerful tool for capturing complex and non-parametric dependencies in high-dimensional spaces.
