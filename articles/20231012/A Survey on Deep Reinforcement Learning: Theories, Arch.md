# 1.背景介绍


Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of machine learning that aims to teach machines to act in the real world by interacting with an environment using reinforcement signals such as rewards and punishments. In this article, we will give a comprehensive overview of DRL research efforts over the past decade, including its theoretical foundations, applications, architecture designs, algorithms, and implementation details. We will also discuss the current challenges and future opportunities for DRL research. This survey paper will serve as a starting point for further investigation into deep reinforcement learning in different areas and industries. 

# 2.Core Concepts and Interactions
## 2.1 Agent-Environment Interaction
The agent-environment interaction process involves two entities: the agent (also called "actor") and the environment (also called "world"). The agent takes actions in response to observations received from the environment. These actions can be simple commands like moving forward or turning left, but they can also be complex control policies learned through experience. By making these decisions, the agent learns to achieve goals in the environment. 

In DRL, there are three main components involved: policy, value function, and reward function. The policy specifies how the agent chooses actions based on observations from the environment. It maps states to probabilities of selecting each possible action, which defines what the agent should do next. The value function estimates the long-term expected return (reward) of being in any given state, taking into account all possible actions that may lead to that state. The goal of training the agent is to find the best policy that maximizes the total expected reward it receives while interacting with the environment. Finally, the reward function determines the immediate reward or penalty associated with an agent's actions, typically represented as a scalar signal. 

The interactions between the agent and the environment are iterated until either the agent achieves a desired goal or it becomes bored or frustrated. During each iteration, the agent sends an observation to the environment, which generates an action. Based on the feedback provided by the environment, the agent updates its policy, value function, and/or reward function. The loop continues until either convergence or a fixed number of iterations have elapsed. Depending on the problem at hand, the policy optimization algorithm used may differ, ranging from synchronous gradient descent techniques to asynchronous methods based on distributed computing platforms.

## 2.2 Markov Decision Process (MDP) Framework
The MDP framework provides a mathematical foundation for analyzing and solving problems related to sequential decision making under uncertainties. It consists of four key concepts: states, actions, transitions, and rewards. States represent the current conditions of the system; actions represent the choices that agents make in each state; transitions describe the effect of actions on the system dynamics; and rewards provide feedback about the performance of the system. The aim of reinforcement learning is to learn optimal policies that maximize the expected sum of discounted rewards over time, where future rewards are discounted by a factor known as gamma.

To solve a problem defined using MDP, one must first formulate the problem in terms of states, actions, transition probabilities, and reward functions. Once the model is established, various algorithms can be applied to search for the optimal policy that maximizes cumulative reward during a limited horizon. The optimal policy can then be evaluated using simulation experiments or real-world testing to assess its performance. There are many variations of the basic ideas behind MDP and reinforcement learning, reflecting its widespread use across a range of fields, including robotics, planning, control, game playing, healthcare, finance, etc. However, understanding the principles and intuitions underlying reinforcement learning requires some amount of background knowledge in probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, and computer science.

## 2.3 Exploration vs Exploitation
One of the most critical issues in RL is exploratory versus exploitative behavior. As mentioned earlier, the agent interacts with the environment sequentially, observing its current state and taking an action. Therefore, if the agent has never encountered certain situations before, its policy may not be well-defined and exploration is required to discover new options. On the other hand, if the agent has already experienced similar situations, it may have developed a good grasp of the environment and may exploit those skills to improve performance. This balancing act between exploration and exploitation, known as the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, is fundamental to ensuring that the agent efficiently explores the environment to build up a rich set of experiences, rather than relying too heavily on prior experiences alone.

The simplest approach to handle this trade-off is to set hyperparameters controlling the degree of exploration vs exploitation. For example, in traditional Q-learning, the epsilon parameter controls the fraction of random actions chosen, whereas in deep Q-networks, the exploration rate is dynamically adjusted based on recent performance. Other approaches, such as UCB, Thompson sampling, or Bayesian bandits, combine exploration and exploitation by introducing additional uncertainty into the choice of action. These techniques adaptively balance the exploration and exploitation dilemma based on information gathered from previous trials.
