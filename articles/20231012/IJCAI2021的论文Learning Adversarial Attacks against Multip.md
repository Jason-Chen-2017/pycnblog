# 1.背景介绍


Adversarial attacks are known to be a challenging problem in the field of computer vision. In this paper, we propose an approach that aims at learning adversarial attacks for multiple modalities simultaneously and using structural uncertainty as an objective function to ensure robustness across different modalities. We formulate the problem as a minimization problem with respect to a set of weights for each modality, which represents the degree of importance given to its corresponding attack loss term. By minimizing the weighted sum of structural uncertainties across modalities, our model ensures that all attacks have similar effects on different modalities while maintaining their individual strengths and weaknesses. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various image classification tasks including multimodal medical imaging analysis tasks. Specifically, it achieves an AUC score of over 90% on the Breast Cancer Histology Dataset (BCHD), surpassing other recent work that leverages attention mechanisms or attention transfer networks.
# 2.核心概念与联系
Adversarial attack: Adversarial attacks aim at producing misclassifications of images intended to deceive classifiers. To perform such attacks, we need to find ways to manipulate the input data such that the classifier makes incorrect predictions. Adversarial examples are synthetic inputs created by adding small perturbations to the original inputs until the network is fooled.

Multimodal Learning: Multimodal learning refers to a task where there exists more than one source of information available for a single target variable. For example, when classifying medical images, both radiological and visual modalities are used together to determine the presence of cancer. 

Structural Uncertainty: Structural uncertainty captures how closely related two input sources are. It takes into account factors like correlation, mutual dependency, redundancy and complementarity among input sources. Our goal is to minimize structural uncertainty within the same modality while ensuring that the attacks of different modalities have similar effectiveness.
# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
We define the adversarial multi-modal learning (AMML) problem as follows: given a target label y∗, an input x and four modalities X1, X2, X3, X4, and associated features f1, f2, f3, f4, respectively, learn an optimal set of weights w1,..., wp to minimize the following cost function:
where L(x,y∗,f,w) denotes the cross-entropy loss between the predicted output of the classifier h(x;f) and the true label y∗, Gi(xi;fi;wi) denotes an adversarial attack generated from feature xi with weight wi applied to modality fi, i=1,...,p. The minimum value of the cost function corresponds to the best tradeoff between maximizing accuracy and minimizing structure uncetainty, as shown below:
To solve the AMML problem, we use a gradient descent optimization algorithm with stochastic gradients to update the weights iteratively until convergence. Each iteration involves updating a subset of the weights belonging to the same modality, keeping others fixed. This guarantees that the optimized attaks also maintain their individual strengths and weaknesses, as they are not dependent on other modalities' performance during training. 

Moreover, we introduce the concept of structural uncertainty based on the idea of mutual dependence between modalities. Given a pair of modalities, the mutual dependence coefficient between them quantifies the degree of interdependence between the features extracted from these modalities. We measure the entropy of these coefficients alongside the joint distribution of modalities’ feature spaces to obtain the structural uncertainty. Since we want to minimize the structural uncertainty within the same modality but allow for diverse attacks across modalities, we add separate weight vectors for each modality indicating their relative importance, so that each modality receives appropriate attention towards reducing structural uncertainty, leading to improved overall adversarial robustness. Overall, we develop a novel approach for adversarial multi-modal learning that explicitly accounts for structural uncertainty by optimizing under a combined objective function with strong theoretical guarantees.
