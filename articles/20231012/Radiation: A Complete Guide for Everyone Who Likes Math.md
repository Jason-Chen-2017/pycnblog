# 1.背景介绍


Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from atoms and other matter, including radioactive materials such as uranium or lead. It plays an essential role in our daily lives such as cigarette smoke, breathing, and radiations used by x-ray imaging devices, among others. 

The main sources of radiation are nuclear reactions that produce atomic electrons (alpha, beta, gamma), charged particles (neutrons and protons) through fission and fusion reactions, and cosmic ray propagation within the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. However, radiation can also be emitted directly from the sun, stars, or other bodies with high temperatures and pressures - commonly referred to as supernova remnants. Supernovae are a rare event that generate millions of years of radiation every day, leading to health effects, environmental pollution, and economic losses. Therefore, understanding how radiation works is critical in order to manage these risks and preserve humanity’s ability to contribute to the protection of nature.

This article will provide a comprehensive guide on how radiation works using basic mathematical principles and physical laws. We will start by discussing different types of radiation such as X-rays, gamma rays, neutrinos, and astrophysical radiation. Next, we will explore how radiation affects humans and animals using mathematical models and simulations based on experiments. Finally, we will discuss various methods to control radiation and potential threats of its misuse. This article aims to cover all aspects of radiation physics with sufficient detail and clarity for anyone interested in learning about it.

# 2. Core Concepts & Connections
There are several key concepts involved in the study of radiation that need to be understood before proceeding further. The following list summarizes them briefly:

1. Emission spectrum: The spectrum of radiation indicates the range and frequency of wavelengths available to radiate energy. There are two main types of spectra:
    * Radioactive spectra: These include alpha, beta, and gamma rays, which are produced by nuclear reactions like fission and fusion processes, respectively. Each type of particle has unique properties related to its behavior under the accelerated electric field created by an electromagnetic wave. 
    * Infrared spectra: These include visible light (red light, green light, blue light), ultraviolet (violet light, indigo light), and near-infrared (ultraviolet red). These frequencies are normally associated with heating and cooling of objects during nighttime activities like reading books, watching television, and shining flashlights. 

2. Energy transfer: Radiation emits energy by scattering or absorbing incoming photons into smaller quantities or leaving them unaffected. This happens mainly due to interaction between atoms, molecules, and ions, which results in changes in their physical and chemical characteristics. Different types of radiation have different ways of dealing with this phenomenon. Gamma rays, for example, may pass through solid metal surfaces while X-rays fall off in air and reach ground level. Neutrinos, on the other hand, remain freely scattered throughout space and decay without interacting with matter. 

3. Interaction with matter: Since radiation comes from outside the atom, it interacts with matter in numerous ways. First, there is the conventional collision mechanism where lighter ions strike harder ones causing stronger and more frequent collisions. Second, some radiation types create magnetic fields, which influence magnetism and alignment of particles in crystals. Third, X-rays may reflect off glass, water, or other transparent media and penetrate deeper into structures. Fourth, direct thermal interactions between atoms and molecules cause them to vibrate faster than the rest of the system. 

4. Damage mechanisms: Different types of radiation produce different damage mechanisms in organisms. Gamma rays for instance, propagate upward through tissues, leading to chronic injuries caused by excessive calcium levels. Other radiation like ionizing radiation or synchrotron radiation can result in sudden death, particularly when combined with certain diseases. 

5. Sources of radiation: Some of the most common sources of radiation are nuclear reactions, cosmic rays, solar flares, X-rays from artificial sources like telescopes, gamma rays generated from surface detectors on satellites or robotics systems, and neutrinos released from mass ejections of supernovae. Additionally, small amounts of radiation are also present in biological systems, such as those responsible for regulating gene expression and maintaining cell identity.

These core concepts form the basis for the remainder of this article. Let us now move towards the detailed analysis of each concept and how they connect to one another.
