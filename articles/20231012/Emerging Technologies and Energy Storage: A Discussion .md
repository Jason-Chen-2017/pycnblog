In conclusion, our aim is to raise awareness about the importance of exploring new technology for achieving better solutions in addressing the critical issues of global warming, energy security and pollution prevention. 

Renewable energy resources such as wind power and solar panels are increasingly becoming popular alternatives to fossil fuel based power generation systems due to their low cost, clean energy production, environmental impacts, and other advantages. However, efficient operation of large scale systems requires complex technical knowledge, which has hindered the penetration rate of these technologies worldwide. Over the last few decades, several promising technologies have emerged, ranging from conventional batteries to novel high capacity electric motors, ultracold electronics, superconductivity, quantum computing, and cloud computing that may one day become a reality.

Energy storage devices like batteries or lithium-ion cells hold significant promise in achieving long-term economic viability with minimal maintenance costs. However, conventional energy storage mechanisms rely on traditional battery chemistries that do not function efficiently at room temperature and heat up quickly leading to short term losses. To overcome these issues, advanced technologies like Li-Ion batteries, LFP/CMOS integrated circuits (ICs), and graphene-based conductive polymers could be used to create more efficient energy storage systems that function at lower temperatures and consume less power while providing longer lifetimes. This article focuses solely on the area of advanced energy storage technologies with potential impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, energy security, and water quality.

The rapid advancement of renewable energy technologies coupled with low cost development and open access to data have resulted in a surge in research interest in renewable energy and energy storage technologies. Many countries around the globe are actively pursuing research and deployment programs aiming at developing renewable energy projects that employ these technologies for a variety of purposes, including smart grid management, energy efficiency, and power backhaul networks. Therefore, it is crucial to stay abreast of the latest trends in renewable energy technologies and understand how they can benefit different sectors of society and ultimately transform the way we think about energy distribution.

## Energy Storage Technology - Definition & Types
Energy storage technology refers to the use of materials or components to store energy rather than relying on external energy sources such as fuels. It involves converting stored energy into usable form through chemical processes such as electrochemical discharge or oxidation. There are four main types of energy storage technologies:

1. Battery – A device that stores energy without the need for any direct input from outside sources. It uses various forms of metal oxides or metals to charge and discharge the stored energy. They come in various sizes and capacities depending on the requirements such as size, voltage, depth of discharge etc. These devices are used extensively in mobile phones, laptops, cars, medical equipment, refrigerators, air conditioners etc.

2. Hydrogen Batteries – One type of battery specifically designed to store hydrogen gas instead of liquids such as oil, natural gas, or coal. These types of batteries utilize photoelectrical effect, reverse osmosis, or centrifugal force to convert sunlight into hydrogen gas and thus achieve greater energy density compared to other types of batteries.

3. Photovoltaic Cells – PV cells work by absorbing light infrared radiation emitted by objects in the sun. By utilizing the energy collected during the conversion process, PV cells generate electricity. These devices produce small amounts of energy but require a lot of solar irradiance and large areas to operate effectively. For example, single-cell photovoltaic arrays cover only small areas whereas multi-cell arrays cover larger regions making them suitable for city planning and urban development.

4. Micro-grids – A system consisting of micro-scale solar power generating units connected via transmission lines to serve local demands. They are often found in municipal grids alongside conventional power plants to provide electricity when there is no nearby source. Comparing to conventional power grids, micro-grids offer flexibility, reliability, and ease of installation while producing limited or no carbon dioxide emissions.

## Advanced Energy Storage Technologies - Classification
Advanced energy storage technologies refer to those having significant technological advances beyond what was previously available or demonstrated. Various industries, companies, and organizations have been investing heavily in the research and development of advanced energy storage technologies. These include semiconductor manufacturers, electronic design firms, biomedical companies, biotechnology companies, and political leaders. Some of the advanced technologies include:

1. Spin-Coating Process for Metal Oxide Batteries – The spin-coating technique allows for the creation of very thin and light weight metal oxide layers on top of the silicon substrate of conventional batteries. This leads to reduced degradation rates, increased cell cycle times, improved stability, and decreased overall weight. This approach is being adopted by some manufacturers already. 

2. Field Effect Transistor Arrays for Energy Harvesting – FETAs are resistive structures made of transistors, where each transistor is made of a tunnel barrier that creates a potential difference between two adjacent holes. This results in continuous flow of current through the array, allowing for harvesting of energy from the surrounding environment. Using these devices, machines can extract raw materials from soils, analyze aqueous environments, and control other processes such as heating and cooling.

3. Supercapacitors – Supercapacitors store huge amount of energy compared to conventional batteries. Instead of storing negative charges inside, they store positive charges inside. Unlike conventional batteries, supercapacitors have much higher storage capacity compared to their counterparts due to their reversible nature. As a result, they can handle high charging currents and keep running even after extended periods of discharge.

4. Graphene-Based Conductive Polymers for Energy Storage - Graphene is a lightweight material that has unique properties like high conductivity and optical transparency. Several research groups have proposed using graphene-based conductive polymers for energy storage. Such conductive polymers enable fast and reliable discharging of energy. They have proven themselves to be effective at managing large quantities of energy required for a wide range of applications. Applications include scientific instruments, radio communications, and storage of large amounts of energy.
