# 1.背景介绍


Charging containerized applications is a critical challenge that requires us to make some technical trade-offs and develop better approaches for both resource allocation and optimization in the context of microservices architectures with dynamic scaling capabilities. This article will present an overview of this research area by reviewing relevant literature on resource management, elasticity, autoscaling, and workload characterization. 

The main objective of charging containerized applications is to optimize application performance while minimizing its energy consumption. While several studies have proposed solutions to this problem, there are still many limitations and challenges that need to be overcome before we can efficiently charge containerized applications using current technologies such as containers, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms like AWS ECS or GCP GKE. In particular, several factors play a significant role in deciding how much power a containerized application needs to run successfully, including hardware specifications, network connectivity, operating system configurations, and application behavior patterns. To address these challenges, we need to devise practical techniques that provide insights into application runtime behavior, predict the optimal utilization of available resources, and adaptively adjust the container's CPU and memory settings during execution based on the collected data. Moreover, we also need to ensure that our approach does not interfere with existing infrastructure services such as load balancers, DNS servers, and distributed databases. Finally, we must consider different levels of automation and integration between cloud platforms and other software components in order to enable cost-effective and seamless charging of containerized applications.

# 2.核心概念与联系
In this section, we will briefly introduce some key concepts and terminologies related to charging containerized applications. These terms are essential for understanding the core ideas behind the study and their relationship with one another. We assume readers already familiar with these concepts and skip them if necessary.

2.1 Container Orchestration Platforms (COPs)
A container orchestration platform (COP) manages the life cycle of containerized applications across multiple nodes within a cluster. COPs provide abstractions that simplify deployment, scaling, and coordination of containers across a fleet of hosts. They offer a variety of features, including scheduling policies, service discovery, automatic healing, logging, monitoring, and visualization tools. COPs allow developers to focus on building scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems while managing underlying infrastructure complexities. Popular COPs include Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos/Aurora, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), etc.

2.2 Microservices Architectures with Dynamic Scaling Capabilities
Microservices architectures are architectural styles that break down large monolithic applications into smaller, independent modules called microservices. Each microservice runs inside its own container on its own server instance. The idea is to increase agility and flexibility when designing and developing complex applications by enabling rapid delivery of new functionality without sacrificing stability or reliability. However, in microservices architecture, dynamic scaling plays a crucial role since it allows microservices to scale up or down depending on changing demands from users or other microservices. There are two types of dynamic scaling strategies commonly used in microservices architectures - Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling. 

2.3 Resource Allocation Policies
Resource allocation policies specify how microservices should allocate their required resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth among the various instances of the same microservice. There are three common policies - Static Policy, Dynamic Policy, and Auto-scaling Policy. 

2.4 Workload Characterization Techniques
Workload characterization techniques help determine the behavior pattern of a microservice. These techniques include profiling metrics such as request rates, response times, error rates, and concurrency levels. Some examples of workload characterization techniques include Application Performance Monitoring Tools (APM tools), Distributed Tracing Systems, Log Analysis Engines, etc.

2.5 Elasticity
Elasticity refers to the ability of a system to quickly react to changes in workload requirements. It involves allowing individual microservices to grow or shrink their computing capacity according to varying demands from clients or other microservices. 

2.6 Autoscaling Policies
Autoscaling policies define a set of rules that automatically adjust the number of running instances of a microservice based on historical or real-time resource usage data. There are four common auto-scaling policies - Scale Up, Scale Down, Stepwise Autoscaling, and Predictive Autoscaling.

2.7 Hardware Specifications
Hardware specifications describe the constraints placed upon the physical hardware resources that host microservices' instances. This includes CPU cores, memory, storage devices, network interfaces, and other compute resources.

2.8 Network Connectivity
Network connectivity determines whether a microservice instance has access to external resources such as databases, message queues, and web APIs. It typically takes the form of IP addresses assigned to each microservice instance and routing tables updated accordingly.

2.9 Operating System Configurations
Operating system configurations control the way a microservice instance interacts with the underlying operating system. These configurations affect things such as process priority, virtual memory allocation, file descriptor limits, kernel scheduler parameters, and other properties.

2.10 Application Behavior Patterns
Application behavior patterns reflect the overall activity pattern of a microservice. These patterns may involve long periods of idle time, frequent requests to expensive resources, burstiness in traffic volumes, and so on.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
In this part, we will present detailed explanations about how to implement a framework for predictive autoscaling of containerized applications based on past observations. Our goal is to accurately predict the amount of power needed by a containerized application at any given point in time based on its recent behavior pattern and hardware specifications. To achieve this, we need to use machine learning algorithms and statistical modeling techniques to capture the correlation between application behavior and hardware specifications. Here are the steps involved in the implementation:

3.1 Data Collection
We collect a dataset containing information about the behavior and hardware specifications of all containerized applications under consideration. The dataset contains attributes such as application name, namespace, CPU request, memory request, CPU limit, memory limit, requested network bandwidth, actual network bandwidth, hostname, timestamp, and status code. 

3.2 Feature Extraction and Preprocessing
Next, we extract relevant features from the raw data such as the average CPU frequency, average temperature, average power consumption, CPU efficiency rating, and similar. We then preprocess the extracted features to normalize and standardize their values. 

3.3 Model Selection and Training
To train the model, we first select a suitable algorithm based on the nature of the prediction task and the size of the dataset. For example, linear regression models may work well for predicting relatively simple relationships between the input variables and output variable, whereas deep neural networks may perform well for more complex tasks. 

After selecting the appropriate model, we split the dataset into training and testing sets, apply feature engineering techniques such as polynomial expansion, label encoding, and normalization, and fit the selected model on the training set. During training, we monitor the performance of the model on the validation set and early stop the training process once the model stops improving. 

3.4 Model Evaluation and Validation
Once the model has been trained and validated, we evaluate its performance on a separate test set. We calculate various metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, R-squared score, and mean absolute percentage error. If the performance is satisfactory, we proceed to deploy the model. 

3.5 Model Deployment and Operation
When deployed, the model continuously observes the behavior of each microservice instance and updates the CPU and memory allocations dynamically based on the predicted values. The model reconciles the difference between the observed and allocated amounts of power to minimize the impact on the application’s performance. Additionally, the model integrates with the rest of the container ecosystem and ensures seamless operation with other infrastructure components such as load balancers, DNS servers, and distributed databases.

In summary, we have developed a methodology for predictive autoscaling of containerized applications based on past observations. Using machine learning algorithms and statistical modeling techniques, we captured the correlation between application behavior and hardware specifications, and developed a predictive model that accurately predicts the amount of power needed by a containerized application at any given point in time based on its recent behavior pattern and hardware specifications.
