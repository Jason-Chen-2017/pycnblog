# 1.背景介绍


Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of resources and scaling based on demand. In this way, developers can focus more on developing features and services rather than managing servers or other infrastructure related to running applications. This article will describe how serverless technologies like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and SNS can be used to build highly scalable and cost-effective applications. 

This article assumes that readers are familiar with basic concepts such as cloud computing, distributed systems, microservices architecture, and software development lifecycle (SDLC). It also includes background knowledge in several technical areas such as web application frameworks, data storage techniques, messaging protocols, and machine learning algorithms.

The goal of this article is to provide an introduction to building serverless applications using AWS' serverless technology stack. We will cover key concepts and components involved in designing and implementing serverless architectures, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), serverless compute services, and open source toolkits. We will demonstrate how different AWS services can be used together to create serverless applications for real-world scenarios such as image processing, IoT analytics, and chatbots. Finally, we will explore various use cases, challenges, and future directions for serverless computing.

## 2.1.什么是serverless计算？
Serverless computing refers to a cloud-computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of resources and scaling based on demand. In this case, "server" does not refer to physical machines but rather virtual functions provided by the cloud platform. Developers do not need to provision and manage servers or other infrastructure associated with running their code, instead they simply upload their code into a cloud environment and it gets executed whenever needed. 

The main benefits of serverless computing include reduced costs, faster time to market, improved scalability, and better flexibility when developing new applications. Serverless platforms allow developers to concentrate on business logic and functionality without worrying about provisioning and maintaining servers, which simplifies the overall development process and reduces operational overhead.

Some popular examples of serverless computing platforms include:

* AWS Lambda - A serverless function service that allows users to run code in response to events triggered by any source within the AWS ecosystem, including s3 bucket uploads, dynamodb table updates, sns topic subscriptions, kinesis streams, etc. 
* Azure Functions - Microsoft's serverless hosting solution that offers a variety of programming languages and runtimes, including Node.js, Python, Java, PowerShell, C#, F#, and TypeScript.
* Google Cloud Functions - Allows you to write lightweight, single-purpose functions that respond to specific triggers, trigger via HTTP requests, or execute periodically. These functions automatically scale up and down according to traffic needs.

Overall, serverless computing provides a flexible and economical approach to building and deploying applications. However, there are some drawbacks compared to traditional server-based solutions, especially when it comes to high concurrency levels and long-running processes. Additionally, serverless environments may have restrictions on certain types of tasks, such as CPU intensive workloads. Nevertheless, these limitations make serverless computing attractive for certain use cases, such as event-driven microservices architectures and data processing pipelines.

## 2.2.为什么要选择AWS上的serverless计算服务？
Amazon Web Services (AWS) has several offerings in its serverless compute category, including AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, AWS API Gateway, AWS AppSync, AWS Firehose, AWS Kinesis Data Streams, and many others. While each offering has unique features and capabilities, they share common principles around ease of deployment, low cost, automatic scaling, and seamless integration with other AWS services. 

In general, AWS serverless compute services are well suited for rapid prototyping, small-scale projects, and non-critical workflows. They are often preferred over traditional serverful architectures due to their lower operation and maintenance costs, simpler management, and ability to horizontally scale. Furthermore, since AWS operates the underlying infrastructure, customers have access to expertise from a wide range of AWS professionals who are committed to improving customer experience, security, reliability, and performance.

Additionally, while the exact feature set of each AWS serverless offering varies considerably, all offer similar capabilities such as quick provisioning, auto-scaling, and simple integration with other AWS services. Choosing one service over another primarily depends on factors such as the programming language being used, the level of control required by the developer, and the target audience of the application. For example, if your project involves complex backend logic and requires strict control over resource utilization, then choosing AWS API Gateway with AWS Lambda would likely be your best option. On the other hand, if your project involves moderately sized datasets or event driven workflows, then AWS Lambda with AWS DynamoDB might be a good fit.

## 2.3.什么是云函数（Cloud Function）？
A cloud function is a self-contained piece of code that runs on the cloud platform and executes on-demand. It can be written in multiple programming languages and deployed via the respective SDKs. There are two major categories of cloud functions:

1. Event-driven functions - Triggered in response to external events such as incoming emails or file uploads. Their primary purpose is to handle large amounts of data or perform long-running computations. Examples include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions.
2. Scheduled functions - Run on a schedule, allowing them to periodically execute specific tasks. Examples include AWS Events, Google Cloud Scheduler, and Azure Functions.

Both types of functions enable efficient scaling by automatically allocating and releasing resources based on demand. Additionally, they provide great flexibility because they can accept inputs from other sources such as databases, queues, and other APIs. Overall, cloud functions offer a convenient and affordable alternative to running containers or VMs on premises.
