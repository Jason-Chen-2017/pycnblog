# 1.背景介绍


Robotics and control systems (RCs) are at the forefront of modern technology due to their impact on people's daily life. In recent years, RCs have been playing a crucial role in advanced technologies such as autonomous driving, healthcare, industrial automation and education, which further enhances human living quality and enjoyment. Despite its importance, however, many researchers still struggle to understand the mechanisms behind RCs' behavior and how they can be improved with reinforcement learning algorithms. Therefore, this paper is intended to provide a comprehensive review of RL algorithms that can improve robotic systems' performance. 

Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most popular areas of machine learning and has been used successfully in various domains including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, finance, etc. RL involves an agent interacting with an environment through actions and receiving rewards based on its decision-making process. It allows an agent to learn from experience without explicitly specifying what kind of rules or procedures it should follow. The goal of RL is to design agents capable of taking optimal actions given current observations and performing well under certain constraints and uncertainties.

The need for RL in RC has grown significantly over the past decade owing to the complexity of underlying system dynamics, the sheer size of the task space, and the heterogeneous nature of the system components. This makes implementing automated control techniques using traditional methods challenging and time-consuming. Moreover, increasingly complex environments like factory floors, warehouses, and hospitals require more powerful controllers that can adapt quickly to changes in the operating conditions. 

In view of these challenges, several RL algorithms have been proposed to address the problem of controlling robotic systems. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of RL algorithms that can be applied to RC tasks by reviewing key concepts, algorithmic approaches, applications, and future directions.

## Markov Decision Process (MDP)
A Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical model that describes a stochastic environment where an agent interacts with possible states and actions. MDPs are commonly used to describe problems in dynamic programming, reinforcement learning, operations research, game theory, and control theory. The key idea behind an MDP is that the state of the environment evolves over time, and the agent acts upon the state to generate a reward signal. Based on the agent's action, it receives some value in return, but there may also be other negative consequences if the action is not appropriate in the current state. Mathematically, an MDP consists of four main components:

1. State Space - The set of all possible states the environment could be in.
2. Action Space - The set of all possible actions the agent could take in each state. 
3. Reward Function - Defines the reward received when the agent takes an action in a particular state.
4. Transition Probability Matrix - Represents the probability of moving between different states after taking an action in the current state.

The primary purpose of MDPs is to define the problem of finding the best policy that maximizes cumulative reward, given a fixed finite horizon. In other words, we want to find the sequence of actions that will lead our agent to reach its maximum cumulative reward within a limited number of steps.

## Dynamic Programming (DP)
Dynamic programming (DP) is a classic technique used in solving MDPs. DP uses bellman equations to recursively compute optimal policies and values. Each step in DP corresponds to solving a smaller version of the original MDP by considering only a subset of the state variables and achieving suboptimal solutions first before proceeding to the final solution. DP algorithms typically involve computing expected returns and state-value functions until convergence.

## Value Iteration (VI)
Value iteration (VI) is another classical method for solving MDPs iteratively. VI begins by initializing the state-value function V(s) to zero and then iteratively updates the function by following the Bellman optimality equation. Unlike DP, VI converges much faster than DP because it updates only one variable per iteration rather than recomputing entire state-value tables. 

Another advantage of VI is that it can handle infinite-horizon MDPs without any approximation error. However, VI requires a full knowledge of the transition probabilities matrix in order to solve it efficiently. Therefore, it cannot be used to estimate the Q-values in off-policy settings, such as in adversarial or multi-agent scenarios.

## Q-learning
Q-learning (QL) is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by Q-theoretic analysis. The basic idea of QL is to maintain a table called Q-table, which stores the estimated action-value function Q(s,a). At each time step t, the agent selects an action a_t according to the epsilon-greedy strategy, which explores new actions with probability ε and exploits known actions with probability 1−ε. Then, the agent observes the resultant state s′_t+1 and generates a reward r_t based on the observation and evaluates the utility of the resulting state by updating the Q-table using the Bellman equation. Finally, the agent continues acting according to the updated Q-table and repeats the process. QL is highly efficient because it does not rely on approximations, making it particularly suitable for large or continuous action spaces.

However, QL suffers from exploration-exploitation dilemma where the agent tends to get stuck in local optima because it relies heavily on exploring unknown actions. To avoid this issue, extensions of QL include double Q-learning, prioritized replay, and dueling networks.

## Policy Gradient Methods
Policy gradient methods (PGM) are an alternative approach to RL where the policy network directly learns the optimal policy instead of estimating the Q-function or maintaining a separate Q-network. PGM uses a neural network policy parameterized by θθ to predict the probability distribution over actions ππ given the state xx. During training, PGM optimizes the parameters of the policy network so that it produces actions with higher predicted probabilities under the current policy, leading to greater cumulative rewards.

There are two main classes of PGM algorithms: actor-critic algorithms and REINFORCE variants. Actor-critic algorithms combine deep learning methods with policy gradient methods to create an end-to-end framework for learning complex policies. They use a policy network pi(s; θφ) and a value network v(s; θv) to simultaneously maximize the expected discounted reward while improving the policy. While conventional PGMs optimize both the policy and the value function separately, AC algorithms directly optimize the critic loss to improve the stability and efficiency of learning. For example, the DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm belongs to this family of algorithms.

REINFORCE variants differ in terms of how they update the policy network during training. REINFORCE uses Monte Carlo estimation to approximate the policy gradient, whereas actor-critic methods use an explicit formula derived from the sample returns. Common variants include TRPO (Trust Region Policy Optimization), PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), and A2C (Advantage Actor Critic).

## Model-based Reinforcement Learning
Model-based reinforcement learning refers to the concept of learning the dynamics of the environment and applying them to a reinforcement learning agent. In general, a model-based algorithm estimates the model of the environment either through supervised learning or unsupervised learning, and then applies it to the reinforcement learning agent to select actions. Two common types of models are probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs).

For example, in robotics, model-based reinforcement learning has been widely used in motion planning and trajectory optimization. In such cases, the model captures the physical properties of the world, such as joint limits, friction coefficients, and material properties, and incorporates them into the planning procedure. Other examples include weather prediction and stock market forecasting. Another application of model-based reinforcement learning is self-driving cars, which leverage a learned map of the environment to plan routes and drive safely around traffic jams.
