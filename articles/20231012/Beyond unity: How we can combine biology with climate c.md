# 1.背景介绍


Climate change is becoming a global issue of concern and as one of the most pressing challenges of our time. The natural world has been impacted by changes in temperature, rainfall, and other factors that are causing global warming, leading to changes in land use, vegetation patterns, and ecosystem functioning. Climate change is having a profound impact on ecosystems through such processes as habitat loss, biodiversity collapse, soil erosion, water pollution, desertification, and tropical storms. In this article, I will discuss how different aspects of biology and chemistry play an important role in regulating the carbon cycle, atmosphere, oceans, and wildlife. Specifically, I will focus on how genetics, metabolism, and immunity systems interact to influence the composition, structure, and function of plants, animals, and fungi across diverse environments. Based on these insights, I will propose ways for creating sustainable ecosystems using combined approaches from biology and technology.
In recent years, scientists have developed novel technologies and methods for studying and understanding biological mechanisms underlying environmental changes, including genome sequencing, high-throughput phenotyping, gene expression analysis, cellular dynamics, electron microscopy, and comparative physiology. However, there remains a lack of knowledge about how these biochemical mechanisms contribute to ecosystem functioning and their overall effectiveness in conserving biodiversity and managing global warming. To address this gap, my research combines advances in interdisciplinary areas such as mathematics, computer science, statistics, and ecology. More specifically, I am interested in developing mathematical models to explain complex interactions between life cycles, nutrient cycling, hormonal balance, and genetic drift during different stages of organism evolution and under different climatic conditions. These models provide valuable insight into the dynamic nature of living systems and may help us understand the mechanisms behind ecosystem adaptability, conservation, and management.

The main concepts and relationships involved in ecosystems are listed below: 

1. Habitats: Ecosystems exist in different habitats ranging from terrestrial to marine. Habitats include freshwater bodies like streams, lakes, and rivers, semi-aquatic bodies like estuaries and seas, and terrestrial areas like forests, grasslands, savannas, and wetlands. Each habitat possesses unique characteristics such as hydrology, geography, and availability of suitable resources. 

2. Components: Organisms belong to different components of the ecosystem – plants, animals, and fungi. Plants and fungi are multicelluar eukaryotes consisting of cells of various types arranged in colonies, while animals are single celled eukaryotes that feed on plants and live within colonies or burrows. All three components interact with each other and with the rest of the environment via physical exchanges such as photosynthesis, respiration, and excretion. 

3. Metabolism: Biomolecules must be broken down by cells to produce energy, which allows them to perform essential functions. Energy comes in many forms - heat, light, electrical power, etc., and it is derived from both chemical compounds (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) and nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, and vitamins). During the daytime, animals use up large amounts of stored food and store excess energy as fatty acids. Similarly, plants use nitrogen and phosphorus as well as sunlight and water to convert solar radiation into chemical energy called photosynthetic activity. Therefore, the exchange of materials and energy among all the components of the ecosystem plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis. 

4. Genetics: The genetic makeup of species varies according to their parental lineage, culture history, and mutations. Some individuals carry beneficial alleles that promote certain traits such as resistance to disease, tolerance to stressors, and increased production of polymers. Other individuals develop deficient alleles that reduce those traits or even cause disease. Overall, genetic diversity provides opportunities for adaptive responses and natural selection to improve survival rate and fitness of populations. 

5. Physiology: Cell structures, functions, and signal transduction pathways define the behavior of organisms. For example, muscles in humans and vertebrate embryos act as force transmission devices that allow movement, but insects do not need such organs since they rely upon gross differences in mechanics. The same applies to plant growth, development, and reproduction cycles. Understanding the details of these physiological processes requires specialized expertise and is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, understanding the relationship between physiology and genetics could help us identify potential trade-offs between traits and diseases that contribute to poor population health and why some species thrive in arid regions while others struggle to cope with drought. 

6. Interactions: Various effects of climate change also affect individual interactions among the components of the ecosystem. Carbon dioxide and other gases released by human activities, landscape degradation due to overgrazing and harvesting, industrial pollution, acid rain, extreme weather events, extreme cold and hot summers, snowstorms, floods, and firestorms can result in declines in biodiversity, fragmentation of habitats, reduction in fisheries, decrease in poverty levels, and displacement of people away from cities. This makes it crucial to monitor and manage ecosystem-level issues to preserve biodiversity and ensure economic recovery. 

Together, these concepts form a basis for designing effective strategies for preserving and improving biodiversity and managing global warming by using scientific tools, techniques, and technologies. In this paper, I propose combining approaches from biology and technology to explore how genetics, metabolism, and immune system regulate the distribution, structure, and function of plants, animals, and fungi across diverse environments. I aim to use computational modeling to simulate the response of plants, animals, and fungi to varying levels of elevated CO2 concentrations and drying out of their habitats, as well as demonstrating how genetic variation and clonal expansion contributes to shifting morphology, reproductive strategy, and immunological responses to changing environmental conditions. Additionally, I hope to demonstrate how symbiotic interactions between plants and microbes, and mutualistic interactions between animals and microbes, might modulate the control of climate change by influencing the complexity, variability, and stability of ecosystems. Finally, I plan to suggest practical measures that can be taken by governments, organizations, and businesses to enhance coordination and integration among stakeholders, institutions, policies, and actions towards mitigating climate change impacts on ecosystems and restoring biodiversity.
