# 1.背景介绍


In the past decade, disasters caused significant damage to buildings and their infrastructure across the world. The early detection of these incidents can significantly reduce losses that could occur during a natural disaster. However, it is not always feasible to monitor every building and its components continuously, especially at large scale. To address this challenge, digital twins have been widely used to simulate realistic virtual representations of buildings and their components, which can be accessed through sensors installed on remote sites or over a network connection. These virtual models provide a powerful tool for decision making by enabling advanced analytics to analyze data from multiple sources and identify patterns and trends that may indicate emerging risks or vulnerabilities. For example, with such an approach, healthcare professionals can detect abnormal activities and conditions within an affected area before they become major concerns. Similarly, public safety officials can use such an approach to quickly assess potential threats to the people, vehicles, and infrastructure in an affected area, leading to faster response times to mitigate potential risk and loss. Nevertheless, although digital twins are increasingly being utilized for disaster response purposes, there remains much work to be done to improve their effectiveness and scalability.

This article presents a technical report on big data analytics for disaster response decision making in building operations based on the concept of cloud computing and edge computing. It discusses key concepts related to the architecture design, algorithms, programming models, and communication protocols involved in developing such systems. Furthermore, we present several case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate how these technologies can help achieve better accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional approaches. Finally, we also discuss future directions and challenges associated with this research topic. 

The objective of this project is to develop a new framework that uses a combination of hardware and software tools to automatically collect, store, process, and analyze massive amounts of data generated by the physical processes and behaviors of buildings. By analyzing this data, the system will make decisions that enable faster recovery and less injuries in building occupants during a natural disaster. This will greatly enhance the resilience and sustainability of buildings throughout the world, reducing costs and improving quality of life for people living in them.

Cloud Computing: Cloud computing refers to a model of service delivery where shared resources like storage, processing power, and networking capabilities are provided as a service to customers. In this context, cloud computing enables users to access computing services through the internet without having to purchase dedicated hardware. Services include virtual machines (VMs), database hosting, serverless functions, platform as a service (PaaS) offerings, etc. Cloud computing provides flexibility and cost reduction compared to traditional local deployments, allowing organizations to easily scale up or down as needed. Among other benefits, cloud computing offers economical pricing, fast provisioning time, elasticity, availability, fault tolerance, and security features.

Edge Computing: Edge computing refers to a paradigm that involves deploying computation and data analysis close to end-user devices, rather than relying solely on centralized servers. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing has several advantages including low latency, lower bandwidth demands, and reduced traffic costs. Edge nodes are small computers located near or next to user devices and act as gateways between the cloud and local applications. They receive inputs from the device, perform calculations locally, and transmit outputs back to the cloud for further processing. Edge computing is particularly useful for applications involving real-time video streaming, machine learning inference, voice recognition, image and object processing, fraud detection, and mobile computing.

Big Data: Big data refers to large volumes of unstructured and/or semi-structured data, typically stored in distributed file systems or databases. Big data can come from various sources such as social media platforms, IoT devices, web clicks logs, sensor data, etc., and cover different domains such as finance, medical care, retail, e-commerce, transportation, and military. Big data analytics involves complex processing tasks that require handling large volumes of data. This includes exploring the data, identifying patterns, relationships, and outliers, transforming and cleaning the data, applying statistical methods, and visualizing the results.

Disaster Response Decision Making System: A disaster response decision-making system is designed to rapidly respond to critical events that affect buildings. As such, it should leverage both cloud and edge computing technologies for effective decision making. Cloud computing helps to manage data that is too large to handle locally, while edge computing allows for low-latency data collection and analysis. The overall goal is to use data collected from the physical behavior and processes of buildings to make accurate predictions about the likelihood of certain events, such as firebreaks, falling structures, explosions, flood winds, tornadoes, etc., happening within a given time frame. This information can then be used to optimize resource allocation and rescue teams' strategy, resulting in more efficient and effective disaster response efforts.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
We propose the following algorithm for disaster response decision making using big data in a building operation scenario:

1. Collect data: Data collection begins when the first event occurs, either physically or virtually. There are two primary types of data that need to be collected: aerial imagery and ground-level data. Aerial imagery is obtained via drone surveys and drones fly over the affected areas to capture images. Ground-level data can be obtained from sensors placed around the buildings, such as temperature, humidity, airflow, and water level readings. Other forms of data collection, such as active sensor networks, passive sensing, and crowdsourcing, can also be employed depending on the type of event.

2. Preprocess data: Once the raw data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed before it can be analyzed. Preprocessing involves removing noise, filtering signals, and transforming data into a format suitable for analysis. Some common techniques include smoothing, filtering, feature extraction, and normalization.

3. Analyze data: After preprocessing, the processed data can be fed into an anomaly detection algorithm. Anomaly detection is a popular technique used in many fields, such as computer vision, pattern recognition, and signal processing, to identify outlier points in the data set. We can use standard machine learning algorithms, such as isolation forest, Gaussian mixture model, deep neural networks, or support vector machines, to implement this step. Another option would be to use probabilistic clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN, k-means++, mean shift, or hierarchical clustering, to group similar points together and define clusters. If any point falls outside a cluster's range, it is considered an anomaly.

4. Model data: Using the detected anomalies, we can generate predictive models that describe the underlying distribution of normal behavior and alert the relevant stakeholders of emerging issues. Predictive modeling involves training a machine learning model using historical data to predict outcomes based on new input samples. Some examples of predictive models include linear regression, random forests, and support vector machines. Since the problem domain is dynamic, these models must be retrained frequently to remain relevant.

5. Act on insights: Based on the learned models, the system can take actions to prevent or recover from the impact of the disaster. Recovery strategies might involve closing gates, opening windows, and moving individuals away from unsafe areas. Safety measures might involve implementing additional monitoring systems, such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Eventually, the goal of the system is to minimize human intervention and fully automate all aspects of response.

To ensure scalability, the system can be deployed in a hybrid model, combining cloud computing and edge computing components. Cloud components can serve as the primary source of data collection, preprocessing, and analysis, while edge components can be responsible for transferring the data to the cloud for further processing. The system can be designed to run autonomously, without operator intervention, using real-time scheduling and coordination mechanisms. While initially targeting one building at a time, the system can later be extended to accommodate larger and more complex scenarios. Overall, the proposed algorithm combines big data analytics and cloud computing principles to create an automated disaster response decision-making system.
