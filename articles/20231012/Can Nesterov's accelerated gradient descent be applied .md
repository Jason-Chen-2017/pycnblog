# 1.背景介绍



Recently, we have seen a lot of work on applying Nesterov’s method to different machine learning models including linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, K-means clustering, and many others. In this article, I will discuss how Nesterov’s acceleration can be leveraged to train neural networks using backpropagation.

To start with, let us recall the general idea behind the backpropagation algorithm: at each iteration, it propagates the error signal backward through the network to update the weights based on the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight parameter. However, the standard gradient descent algorithm has some drawbacks when it comes to handling vanishing gradients which occur frequently in deep neural networks due to sigmoid and ReLU activation functions. To address these issues, Nesterov’s method was introduced and extended into its most advanced form known as Accelerated Gradient Descent (AGD). 

In addition, there are several variants of AGD such as Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Adam, etc., each with their own advantages over the basic version. These variants can further boost the performance of neural networks compared to the standard SGD algorithm while still maintaining good generalization ability to unseen data. Therefore, choosing the right variant of AGD depends on the specific task and the amount of available computational resources.

Now, let us consider applying Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent to neural networks specifically. The key insight of this approach is to use both the current and next position of the parameters during the forward pass instead of only considering the gradient at the current position. This way, the direction of steepest ascent is biased towards the future direction even if the current position does not lead to improvement in terms of loss. In simple words, the step size can be adjusted dynamically based on the progress made so far in case the direction appears to diverge from the correct one. By doing so, the algorithm becomes much more robust against oscillations and explosions that may occur when using vanilla gradient descent alone.

Furthermore, since computing the next position of the parameters requires performing multiple forward passes and corresponding backward passes until the final output layer, implementing Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent within deep neural networks directly leads to significant speedups over traditional approaches. Moreover, adaptive regularization methods like dropout can also be used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization capability. Overall, the combination of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with efficient implementation techniques makes it an excellent choice for training large scale neural networks.

## Backpropagation Algorithm
The core concept underlying all neural networks is the backpropagation algorithm, also called the "credit assignment" or "error backpropagation" algorithm. In brief, given the output prediction $\hat{y}_i$ and the ground truth label $y_i$, the goal of the backpropagation algorithm is to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters $(W_{ij}, b_j)$ at each node or neuron in the network. Mathematically speaking, the updates for the weights and bias terms are computed according to:

$$\delta^l_j = f^\prime(z^l_j)\sum_{i}w_{ji}^T \delta^{l+1}_{i}$$

where $f^\prime(\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the activation function $f(\cdot)$ at the jth node in the lth layer; z^l_j is the weighted sum of inputs to the node plus any applicable bias term; $\delta^{l+1}_{i}$ is the contribution of the error induced by nodes i in the subsequent layer and w_{ji}^T denotes the transpose of the connection matrix between layers l and l+1. Finally, the gradients with respect to the weights and bias terms are updated by subtracting a fraction of the product of the gradient and the learning rate:

$$W_{ji}^{l+1}\leftarrow W_{ji}^{l+1}-\eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_{ji}^{l+1}}$$

$$b_j^{l+1}\leftarrow b_j^{l+1}-\eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial b_j^{l+1}}$$

where $\eta$ is the learning rate hyperparameter.

## Nesterov's Acceleration Method

$$v^{t+1}=\gamma v^t + \eta g^t$$

$$\theta^{t+1}= \theta -v^{t+1}$$

where $\theta$ is the parameter being optimized, t is the time step, $\eta$ is the learning rate, and g^t is the gradient evaluated at the current position. In contrast to vanilla gradient descent, where the update is done solely based on the gradient information, AGD uses a moving average of the velocity to predict the next position in order to achieve faster convergence under certain conditions. Additionally, momentum can be added as another hyperparameter to enhance stability and encourage exploration of local minima.

Using the above equation, AGD performs updates on a smoothed path and provides better control over the step size than vanilla gradient descent. By smoothing out the path taken by the update variable, AGD is able to escape saddle points and find narrow minima that would otherwise get trapped in plateaus. Nonetheless, AGD still suffers from high variance and low bias and thus faces challenges such as slow convergence rates and high memory requirements.

One advantage of Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent over AGD is that it avoids recomputing the gradient at every iteration, leading to significant reduction in computation cost. However, it remains sensitive to hyperparameters such as the learning rate, momentum factor, and batch size, making it difficult to tune and optimize effectively. Other downsides include slower initial convergence and higher probability of getting stuck in local minima. Overall, Nesterov’s method offers significant benefits for improving the efficiency and accuracy of modern deep learning systems but should be used with caution and careful consideration of the tradeoffs involved.
