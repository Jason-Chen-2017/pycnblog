# 1.背景介绍


Domain adaptation (DA) is a common problem in machine learning that aims at transferring knowledge from source domain (usually large-scale data and high-dimensional features) into the target domain where labeled data are scarce or unavailable. The performance of current DA methods can be substantially improved if we use adversarial training to make them more robust against noisy or adverse input samples in both domains. However, existing works mainly focus on reducing the discrepancy between the source and target domains but not on improving their classification accuracy. In this work, we propose three ways to improve DA performance with adversarial training: 

1. Minimizing intra-domain discrepancies 
2. Introducing an auxiliary classifier 
3. Enforcing consistency among multiple classifiers within each domain 

We will show how these ideas can be used to achieve state-of-the-art results in various DA tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. To evaluate our methods’ effectiveness, we will conduct extensive experiments on various datasets including Office-31, VisDA-17, and CIFAR-10/100. Our method outperforms several baselines and is competitive with some recent approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Moreover, we find that the proposed approach consistently outperforms other methods when applied to different types of DA problems. We hope this work can serve as a starting point for future researchers who want to explore new directions in DA using adversarial training techniques.

Adversarial training is a technique to train neural networks by generating “adversarial” examples which are intentionally perturbed to deceive the network during training. This way, the network learns a robust representation of the input space rather than relying solely on clean inputs. DA involves training models on one domain (source) and testing them on another (target), where the goal is to learn a mapping function to transfer information from the source to the target while minimizing any loss of relevant characteristics such as class labels. To ensure that the learned mappings are accurate, adversarial training has been shown to be particularly effective. 

In this paper, we propose three novel ideas to enhance the performance of DA with adversarial training:

1. Minimizing intra-domain discrepancies: Existing works typically optimize the model parameters towards lower losses on the source domain, without paying much attention to aligning it closely with the target distribution. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical approach where two discriminator networks are trained separately, each corresponding to a layer of the feature extractor. These discriminators aim at identifying whether the activations at that particular level in the network capture patterns specific to the source or target distributions. By minimizing the discrepancies between the discriminator outputs, the optimization process encourages the model to extract discriminative features that are tailored specifically for the given domain, thus achieving better generalization ability.

2. Introducing an auxiliary classifier: A crucial aspect of DA is ensuring that the mapped features are discriminative enough to separate the classes well across both domains. Traditional adversarial training methods rely only on the primary task objective (e.g., cross-entropy loss), and do not enforce the consistency among multiple classifiers within each domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose an additional auxiliary classifier called Domain Separation Network (DSN) to encourage consistent predictions by penalizing the mismatches between predicted and true domain membership probabilities.

3. Enforcing consistency among multiple classifiers within each domain: Consistency refers to maintaining a common understanding of what each individual classifier represents within its own domain. For example, we might have multiple independent classifiers within the same domain, and they should all agree on the correct class label for the same sample of interest. To ensure that there is consistency, we introduce a set of consistency constraints implemented as penalty terms added to the primary task loss function. Specifically, we add a gradient reversal layer after the last hidden layer of each domain classifier, which forces the opposite output sign (i.e., positive instead of negative for the source domain). This constraint ensures that gradients flow smoothly through the entire architecture, preventing undesirable artifacts caused by inconsistent interpretations of the same activation map.

These three ideas form the basis of our proposed method, referred to as Heterogeneous Adversarial Transfer Learning (HAETL), which uses these techniques to boost the accuracy of domain adaptation under challenging conditions such as heterogeneous sources and targets.

To implement HAETL, we need to combine these ideas into a unified framework that incorporates feature extraction, source and target discriminators, DSN, and consistency constraints. Since building and training such complex architectures is computationally expensive, we present a lightweight version of HAETL called Simple Heterogeneous Architecture (SHAETL), which consists of a single shared backbone and two domain discriminators, DSN, and optional consistency constraints. This simple version still produces good results even in the absence of extra components such as a multi-head discriminator or source classifiers, making it easy to deploy and experiment with.

Overall, our proposed method significantly improves the performance of conventional DA methods on various DA problems, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead compared to similar state-of-the-art approaches based on GANs.

This section will provide detailed explanations of the core algorithms used in our proposed method, SHAETL. First, let us briefly review the basic concepts behind adversarial training before delving deeper into the details of our method.

## Adversarial Training
Adversarial training is a technique to train neural networks by generating “adversarial” examples which are intentionally perturbed to deceive the network during training. This way, the network learns a robust representation of the input space rather than relying solely on clean inputs. One of the most popular attacks is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack, which changes the signs of the gradient vectors in order to fool the network into producing incorrect predictions. Other attacks include iterative attenuation (ITA) and projected gradient descent (PGD), which randomly perturb the images in a way that maximizes the likelihood of making the right prediction. These attacks are designed to produce imperceptible perturbations that do not change the original image too greatly, and hence do not affect the quality of the final decision made by the network. Therefore, adversarial training makes the network more robust to such noisey inputs and helps it converge faster to better solutions. 

The key idea behind adversarial training is to apply the FGSM attack to minimize the difference between the original and the generated adversarial examples, effectively forcing the network to learn robust representations of the input space. It does so by computing the gradient of the network's loss function w.r.t. the input, taking the sign of the gradient, and adding the result to the original input vector to generate the adversarial example. At test time, the attacker provides the original input and the modified adversarial example together with the ground truth label, and the system either accepts the adversarial example or rejects it depending on the severity of the perturbation. If the network correctly identifies the adversarial example, then the attacker wins; otherwise, the defender wins. The strength of the attack depends on the magnitude of the perturbation introduced and the nature of the underlying loss function of the network. The larger the perturbation, the stronger the attack. 

However, since the FGSM attack requires access to the full gradient of the loss function, it becomes computationally intensive for deep neural networks. To address this challenge, clever approximations such as stochastic gradients descent (SGD) or momentum may be employed instead. The resulting algorithm is known as stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) or adaptive momentum. SGDMs perform better than standard SGD because they dynamically adjust the step size based on the previous gradients and momentum values, leading to faster convergence and better generalization ability.

Regardless of the choice of attack and optimization method, adversarial training remains sensitive to hyperparameters such as the attack strength and the number of iterations, and therefore it is important to tune them accordingly. Nevertheless, recently several papers have demonstrated that carefully selecting hyperparameters can lead to significant improvements in the security and privacy of deep neural networks.

Now that we have reviewed the basics of adversarial training, let us proceed to discuss the details of our method.

## Heterogeneous Adversarial Transfer Learning (HAETL)
### Feature Extraction and Discriminator Networks
Feature extraction plays a fundamental role in the success of deep neural networks. While the exact architecture varies across different tasks, many commonly used models include convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, fully connected layers, and non-linearities. Once we obtain a fixed-size representation of the input image, we can feed it into the domain discriminator(s) for binary classification.

Our first step is to design the feature extractor, which typically takes a batch of images as input and maps them to a dense embedding vector. Typically, the extracted features encode higher-level visual concepts such as edges and textures, enabling downstream tasks like object recognition or image synthesis. Although modern feature extractors can capture fine-grained spatial relationships, they cannot capture global dependencies across the entire image or object, making them insufficient for capturing domain variations. To handle these limitations, we incorporate two domain discriminators into the feature extractor pipeline. Each discriminator takes the output of a specific layer in the network and predicts the probability of belonging to the source or target domain respectively. During training, we use these discriminators to update the weights of the subsequent layers in the network, encouraging them to extract features that are specifically aligned with the source or target distributions.

### Source and Target Classifiers
Once we have obtained a compact feature representation, we can use it to classify objects in both the source and target domains. Most traditional DA methods train a single classifier on the combined dataset of source and target data, using regularization techniques to reduce interference due to overlaps between domains. However, this assumption violates the assumption of independence of classifiers and introduces biases into the learned representation. In fact, if the source and target distributions are highly overlapping, there could be cases where a sample belongs to both domains simultaneously, leading to poor performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose introducing an auxiliary classifier called Domain Separation Network (DSN) that encourages consistent predictions by penalizing the mismatches between predicted and true domain membership probabilities.

During training, we alternate between optimizing the parameters of the main classifier and updating the weights of the DSN. The DSN takes the intermediate representations produced by the feature extractor and outputs the estimated domain assignment probabilities. We maximize the log-likelihood of the joint distribution of the predicted assignments and the actual labels, while keeping the predicted and true domain assignment probabilities close. By doing so, the DSN promotes consistency among multiple classifiers within each domain, improving the overall accuracy of the domain classifier. The updated weights are propagated down to the main classifier via backpropagation.

### Consistency Constraints
As mentioned earlier, consistency constraints enforce a common understanding of what each individual classifier represents within its own domain. Consistency constraints arise naturally in scenarios where there exist multiple distinct local classifiers that attempt to solve subproblems independently, but fail to share a unified view of the world. Similarly, our method introduces multiple independent classifiers within each domain, and we would ideally like them to all agree on the correct class label for the same sample of interest. One approach to enforce this consistency is to insert a gradient reversal layer after the last hidden layer of each domain classifier, which forces the opposite output sign (i.e., positive instead of negative for the source domain). Intuitively, this constraint assumes that if the input appears in the source domain, the desired output signal is likely to be positive, whereas if it appears in the target domain, the desired output signal is likely to be negative. By enforcing this consistency constraint, we force the model to maintain a common interpretation of the same activation map throughout the whole architecture, avoiding spurious correlations between domain features and incorrect decisions about the target domain.

Finally, we combine these components into a unified framework, referred to as Heterogeneous Adversarial Transfer Learning (HAETL), which includes feature extraction, source and target discriminators, DSN, and consistency constraints. The output of the combination is a scalar score indicating the confidence of the classifier's decision about the input. We can further fine-tune this score using other supervision signals such as pixel-wise or instance-level annotations, but this step is usually unnecessary for practical applications. The complete workflow of HAETL is summarized in the following figure:


### SHAETL vs. HAETL
Besides being lighter and more modular than HAETL, SHAETL also has advantages in terms of speed and memory usage. As explained above, sharing a single backbone reduces the amount of memory required per domain classifier, which saves GPU memory and accelerates the training process. Furthermore, since we are only considering two domains at once, it is possible to trade off some expressivity for reduced complexity and computational cost. Overall, we believe that the benefits of SHAETL outweigh its drawbacks, making it a useful tool for practitioners interested in fast and efficient domain adaptation.
