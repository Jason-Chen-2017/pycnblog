# 1.背景介绍


WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format that can be executed by web browsers, enabling developers to create high performance, interactive client-side applications with low latency. However, developing complex applications in Wasm requires expertise both in programming languages and operating systems. Moreover, it’s not immediately obvious how to achieve optimal performance when using multi-threading techniques. 

In this blog post I will explain the concept of Wasm modules and how they work in WebAssembly runtime environments, discuss some of their core algorithms and operations, provide examples of code implementation and finally present some future challenges and opportunities for optimizing multi-threaded applications running on top of Wasm. 

I assume readers have basic understanding of programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals etc., but no previous experience with WebAssembly nor Web development tools.

## What are WebAssembly Modules?

A Wasm module is an executable file containing compiled code representing a collection of functions, global variables, tables, memories, and other definitions that can interact with each other during execution. In short, it's just another program written in a specialized bytecode language, yet it's capable of being loaded and run by WebAssembly enabled web browsers. A single Wasm module typically contains one or more entry points where its functionality can be called from JavaScript or other host environments. This modular design enables efficient reuse of shared logic across different parts of an application while still allowing fine-grained control over security policies, memory usage limits, and so forth.

Therefore, the main purpose of Wasm modules is to provide better isolation between different components of software. They also enable users to execute code securely without having to trust third parties' code or dependencies. On the other hand, Wasm modules offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency and portability due to their compact size and ability to take advantage of modern hardware features through WASI standardization effort. Additionally, supporting multiple threads within a single Wasm module allows for greater parallelization and concurrency than would otherwise be possible under traditional threading models. 

## How do Wasm Modules Work?

When a browser encounters a.wasm file in a webpage, it executes all of its code inside a virtual machine built specifically for that file. The virtual machine consists of several layers: 
- **Bytecode interpreter:** takes care of executing the instructions encoded in the wasm file. It uses stack-based architecture and has access to various system resources such as linear memory and the table of function imports.
- **Compiler toolchain:** responsible for converting human-readable text formats such as WebAssembly Text Format (WAT), LLVM IR and C/C++ into optimized machine code suitable for execution by the VM. There are two primary compilers used in the ecosystem at the moment: 
  - **Binaryen Compiler**: compiles Wasm modules into highly optimized native code.
  - **Emscripten Compiler**: translates C/C++ source files into Wasm modules. Emscripten provides additional optimizations including type checking, bounds checks and heap allocation handling.
- **Sandboxing model:** ensures proper encapsulation of user code from the rest of the browser environment. It restricts access to certain API functions based on preconfigured policies such as those set by the website owner.
- **Memory management:** handles dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory for the Wasm module's data structures. It has separate address spaces for each thread, ensuring safe concurrent access to shared resources.

To summarize, a Wasm module is essentially a binary file consisting of a compiler generated intermediate representation, executable by a Virtual Machine provided by the browser. Its design aims to provide stronger guarantees about security and ease of portability compared to classical approaches such as JavaScript APIs or virtual machines. By supporting multiple threads, a single Wasm module becomes even more powerful and versatile.
