## Introduction
Tokenomics is the study of how digital tokens are created and managed in a system. It covers several aspects such as issuance, distribution, management, development, and use of tokens. In this article we will be looking at the evolution of different crypto-currencies from the early days to today's Ethereum-based crypto-currency markets with special focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is not an easy topic but it is important for all developers and researchers to understand what drives the creation, management and use of these token systems. Let's get started! 

## History and Background
In the earliest days of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Dogecoin, there was no formal token system. Only users were able to create their own wallets where they had free reign to send and receive coins. Even though some people thought that this model might change over time, Bitcoin was still relatively successful when compared to other altcoins in its day. However, soon after the release of Bitcoin Cash, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a new type of currency called Bitcoin SV that was based on Bitcoin's code but removed features that he deemed unfairly centralized and depended heavily on his control. Then came Ethereum which introduced smart contracts into the blockchain technology, allowing developers to create applications that interact with the underlying network. Today's most popular currency on the market is Ethereum but there have been many smaller and experimental projects using other technologies such as Cardano, Polkadot, EOS and Solana among others. 

All these projects have a common element - they rely on a decentralized network where transactions can be made without a third party intermediary like banks or exchanges. Each project has its own tokenomics approach and implementations which differ slightly between them. So let us take a look at each one separately to see if we can find any similarities or differences. 

### Bitcoin
Bitcoin was launched by a guy named <NAME> who had a background in computer science. He developed a program that allows individuals to exchange bitcoins for goods and services online securely. Bitcoins were originally created through mining, i.e., solving complex mathematical problems to earn rewards for mining hardware. Over time, miners started getting paid more and more and eventually became rich because they could buy things or sell them back to other miners for a profit. Eventually, they accumulated enough coin to be worth it and decided to start paying out dividends to their holders. In order to ensure that the value of bitcoin held by individual users remains constant, Satoshi set up a hard money policy whereby every ten years someone would need to give away some of their bitcoins as collateral. These payments ensured that the price of bitcoin remained stable even if the supply increased sharply due to high inflation. Since then, bitcoin has become increasingly used by various businesses, governments, and individuals around the world.

#### Issuance and Distribution
The way bitcoin is issued is quite simple. When you purchase bitcoin directly from someone else (a merchant), they act as the issuer and issue your bitcoin to you. If you don't want to share your private key with anyone (for privacy reasons) you can also generate a new address and request payment via lightning network or another anonymous payment gateway. 

Bitcoins are distributed fairly quickly according to current circulating supply. The initial block reward (the amount of BTC given out per block) is just 50 BTC. After the first year, each subsequent block receives a bonus of approximately half of the previous block's reward, until it reaches about 7.5 BTC per block. Additionally, the total number of bitcoins mined increases roughly linearly with time since there is currently a fixed amount of hashing power being contributed by miners. Thus, the longer a miner keeps mining, the larger portion of the hashpower he contributes, leading to faster issuance of bitcoins. At present, the block size limit is around 1 MB and the confirmation time is usually less than five minutes. Thus, a transaction typically takes place within tens of seconds. 

Therefore, the main challenge for bitcoin is to keep the issuance rate sufficiently high while ensuring that the network remains secure and resistant to attacks. One solution to increase the issuance rate is to implement Proof of Work (PoW). PoW involves solving a computationally intensive puzzle known as "mining" in order to obtain newly minted bitcoins. Mining requires dedicated hardware equipment and consumes vast amounts of energy. To make matters worse, the last few years have seen an explosion in mining farms across the globe, making it very expensive to maintain reliable hardware infrastructure. Another alternative is to adopt a layer two solution like Lightning Network, which provides fast and cheap micropayments between users without requiring a trusted third party.

#### Management and Development
As mentioned earlier, bitcoin has received numerous updates over the years to improve its functionality and security. Some of the recent developments include Segregated Witness (SegWit), Schnorr Signatures, Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs, and Multi-signature Wallets. All of these advancements aim to enhance user experience, reduce fees, and protect the network against attacks. For example, SegWit reduces transaction sizes by reducing the number of fields required in blocks and compressing signatures. SPV proofs allow lightweight clients to verify transactions without downloading the entire blockchain. Multi-signature Wallets provide greater security by enabling multiple parties to approve a transaction before it is executed. Overall, bitcoin has emerged as a reliable platform for transacting digitally, although there are always challenging technical challenges that need to be addressed in future releases. 

#### Use Cases and Adoption
Bitcoin is widely used in different sectors including finance, gaming, banking, entertainment, commerce, and utility. Its rapid adoption has caused a significant impact on economics and society. By 2019, it was estimated that bitcoin accounted for $7.7 trillion of global trade volumes. Also, it is expected that bitcoin will play a major role in the next generation of financial services and the internet of things, further expanding its usage and growth potential. Moreover, bitcoin has already become the primary currency of interest in many jurisdictions around the world, such as Europe and Asia. Therefore, it is essential for everyone interested in this area to dive deep and learn more about it. 

### Ethereum
Ethereum is a platform for developing and running smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs stored on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and run deterministically once deployed to the chain. They enable developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) that can execute arbitrary business logic without relying on central authorities. Developers write smart contracts in languages like Solidity and JavaScript, compile them, and deploy them to the Ethereum network. Once a contract is deployed, it executes autonomously, without human intervention. Contracts can store data, process transactions, and access external APIs. Unlike traditional programming models where program execution depends on inputs provided by humans, smart contracts can automatically execute actions as long as certain conditions are met. Ethereum has played a crucial role in building the internet of things, providing a foundation for decentralized finance and the metaverse. 

#### Issuance and Distribution
When a developer deploys a new smart contract to the Ethereum network, an ether balance is automatically allocated to the contract creator. There is also a gas fee associated with deploying contracts, which is paid in ether. The remaining ether balance is distributed proportionately between all accounts that have interacted with the contract. The allocation algorithm ensures fairness and efficiency in allocating ether. Additionally, every transaction on the Ethereum network costs a small fee denominated in ether. Most transactions on the network cost around 0.00075 ether, but some operations may require a higher fee depending on the volume of transactions and contract complexity. Finally, there is a minimum threshold of ether needed to cover the gas costs and transaction fees.

It is difficult to estimate exactly how much ether exists in the system at any point in time, since the amount of ether generated varies daily and depends on both the demand for the currency and the economic activity of the network. Nevertheless, it is likely that during the course of the following decades, the supply of ether will reach levels that are comparable to those achieved by Bitcoin in its early years. As a result, the rise of Ethereum and related projects, like ERC20 tokens and DeFi platforms, demonstrates the exponential growth of adoption of blockchain technologies. Within the next decade, we expect the majority of global transactional capacity to be concentrated in the form of Ethereum-based Dapps and wallets.

#### Management and Development
Smart contract platforms like Ethereum offer various advantages over traditional programming environments. Traditional programming requires testing and debugging before deployment, which slows down the iteration cycle. Additionally, changes to the codebase require redeployment, causing delays and downtime. Smart contracts eliminate these issues by running deterministically and executing fully autonomously. Furthermore, the lack of human intervention means that bugs and vulnerabilities cannot easily go unnoticed. Finally, developers do not have to worry about backing up their code or managing servers, reducing risk and overhead.

One of the biggest challenges facing Ethereum is scalability. The current design does not lend itself well to processing large volumes of transactions or storing large amounts of data. Although ETH prices have risen significantly recently, the true scalability bottleneck lies in processing speed rather than storage. Adding more computational power to the network should help to alleviate this problem, but it will take a considerable investment of capital and energy. 

Another concern is regulatory compliance. Many countries around the world are tightening regulations surrounding blockchain technologies. Blockchain technologies involve highly sensitive information and must undergo rigorous scrutiny and approvals by government institutions. Developing compliant smart contracts is therefore critical for achieving widespread adoption and success. Despite these concerns, Ethereum has achieved widespread adoption globally and continues to gain momentum as the leading platform for developing decentralized applications.
