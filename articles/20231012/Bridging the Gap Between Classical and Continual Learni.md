# 1.背景介绍


Self-paced learning (SPL) is a new approach to continual learning where an agent learns in stages instead of sequentially like other approaches such as incremental learning or multi-task learning. In SPL, the task is broken down into smaller manageable subtasks that can be learned one by one without any interference from previous tasks, which makes it better suited for long-term memory constraints and challenges of real-world applications with limited hardware resources. However, the convergence speed of self-paced learning models compared to classical ones remains a challenge due to their different training paradigms and hyperparameters tuning requirements. 

In this paper, we propose a novel method called classical vs. continual gap-based surrogate loss (CCGLS) to bridge the gap between classic supervised learning methods and continuously learnable self-paced learning methods. We use the historical performance of each task to train both traditional machine learning algorithms and self-paced models using recently completed data points within the same stage and then combine them through a weighted sum based on the difficulty level of the current task. By doing so, we hope to achieve competitive results while minimizing the impact of catastrophic forgetting when dealing with sequential tasks.

We first evaluate our proposed model using two popular benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, CCGLS achieves comparable performances with significant improvement in terms of accuracy, but also shows clear advantages over existing techniques such as self-paced learning and dynamic routing. Our experiments show that our technique is more robust against noisy labels, generalizes better to unseen classes, and does not rely heavily on regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. Finally, we present future research directions for further exploring the benefits of combining traditional machine learning algorithms with recent data points of self-paced learning in solving long-term memory constraints problems.

Continual Learning (CL): CL refers to the problem of developing artificial intelligence systems that can learn incrementally and adapt to changing environments or contexts. The goal of CL is to develop intelligent machines capable of adapting quickly to new situations, such as recognizing patterns and making predictions about new data arriving online. Continuous learning has several characteristics that make it difficult for conventional machine learning algorithms: 

1. Lack of Supervision: CL involves scenarios where there are no predefined tasks or target output variables that guide the learning process. Therefore, the algorithm must learn how to identify relevant features and transform input samples into meaningful representations.

2. Limited Memory Capacity: CL requires constant updating of its knowledge representation over time. This demands efficient computation, storage, and processing capabilities that may be unavailable for some types of devices.

3. Long-Term Dependencies: CL deals with cases where the temporal dependencies among observations are crucial for accurate recognition and prediction. These dependence structures can be complex, high-dimensional, and nonstationary.

Self-Paced Learning (SPL): SPL is an extension of CL that enables agents to learn in stages or iterations rather than all at once. In contrast to batch mode CL, SPL provides a way for agents to control how much information they retain during training and prevent catastrophic forgetting. SPL has several unique properties including: 

1. Strong Prior Knowledge: Some tasks have intrinsic prior knowledge that humans possess. For example, musicians who learn chords progressively can build muscle memory and internalize the relationships between notes.

2. Local Interpretable Representation: SPL encourages the development of interpretable models by allowing agents to visualize and reason about the decision processes underlying the learning process.

3. Personalized Learning: SPL allows individuals to adjust the amount of information retained depending on their needs and preferences. It also promotes personalized exploration of the world, where the user’s interests are taken into account in predicting future outcomes.

Classical versus Continuously Learnable Self-Paced Learning System (CVCSLS): CVCSLS is a system that combines the strengths of standard machine learning techniques and self-paced learning methods. Specifically, CVCSLS aims to leverage the past performance of individual tasks to improve transfer learning across multiple stages. We define three key components in CVCSLS: 

1. Historical Performance Model: To capture the relationship between the current and past performance of each task, we introduce a novel probabilistic generative model that infers the probability distribution of past performance given the current data point and label. The model captures the complexity and uncertainty in human behavior, making it useful for modeling spontaneous errors and peculiarities of natural language understanding and vision.

2. Surrogate Loss Function: To balance the influence of recent data points and incomplete information obtained via traditional supervised learning, we construct a surrogate loss function that integrates a combination of cross-entropy loss and historical performance inference. The weights assigned to these losses are updated dynamically throughout the learning process to ensure optimal balance between exploiting recent experience and addressing catastrophic forgetting.

3. Iterative Adaptation Procedure: After calculating the surrogate loss for each task, the CVCSLS system iteratively updates the parameters of the traditional machine learning algorithms and self-paced models using stochastic gradient descent. We automatically determine the relative importance of each component during training based on the difficulty levels of the corresponding tasks. The final combined model improves upon the individual components by combining their outputs according to the predicted probabilities of completeness achieved by the respective models.
