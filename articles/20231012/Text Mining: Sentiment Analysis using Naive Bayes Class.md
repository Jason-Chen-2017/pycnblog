# 1.背景介绍

  
Sentiment analysis is the task of classifying the polarity (positive, negative or neutral) of a textual expression into either positive, negative or neutral categories based on its contextual meaning and intended emotional impact. In this article we will discuss how to perform sentiment analysis in text by using the Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK), which provides various libraries such as tokenizer, stemmer, lemmatizer and part-of-speech tagger. We will also use word embeddings for better performance, and implement our own naïve bayes classifier to classify the polarity of sentences. Finally, we will compare and analyze the results obtained from both approaches.  
  
  
Text mining refers to the process of extracting valuable information from large amounts of unstructured data stored in electronic formats. It can be applied in various fields like social media analytics, healthcare informatics, news agencies, finance, and many more. The main goal of text mining is to extract actionable insights from unstructured data that are then used to take actions, improve decision making processes, or build intelligent applications. Sentiment analysis plays an essential role in understanding customer feedbacks, analyzing market trends, monitoring brand reputation, predicting stock prices, and managing business operations. However, performing sentiment analysis accurately has been a challenge due to the complexity of language and ambiguity in text. Traditional methods often rely heavily on rule-based systems or lexicons, while recent advances in natural language processing have made it possible to develop accurate models with machine learning techniques.  
  
  
  
  
# 2.Core Concepts & Connections  
  
In order to understand the approach behind sentiment analysis, let's first define some core concepts.  
  
  
### Tokens  
A token is the smallest meaningful unit of text within a sentence. A simple example could be a word, but it can become more complicated when dealing with punctuations, numbers, abbreviations, URLs, etc. NLTK provides a function called "word_tokenize" which can tokenize text into words. Tokenizing the following sentence into individual tokens would give us:  
  - Hello
  -, 
  - my 
  - name 
  - is 
  - John 
  - Doe 
  -. 

The output of this operation depends on the input text and the type of tokenization performed. For instance, if we choose to split compound words, such as "new york", into separate tokens, then they would get split into two: "new" and "york". Another popular method of splitting multi-word phrases into separate tokens is called "part-of-speech tagging", where each token is assigned a specific part of speech category, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This allows us to capture contextual information about the words being used.  
  
  
 ### Stemming  
 Stemming involves reducing words to their base form or root. There are several algorithms for stemming available, including PorterStemmer, SnowballStemmer, LancasterStemmer, RegexpStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer, etc. These help reduce words to their most basic forms so that related words can be grouped together. For example, the words "running","runner," and "run" might all end up being reduced to the same stem "run." While this helps group similar words together, it may not always provide useful insights or knowledge. In addition, stemming tends to lose some important semantic features associated with those words.  
   
 ### Lemmatization  
 Lemmatization, on the other hand, takes the vocabulary domain into account. It identifies the morphological root of the word, rather than just stripping off suffixes. This ensures that all inflections of a particular word are treated equally, improving accuracy. NLTK uses WordNetLemmatizer for lemmatization. It works well for English texts, but there are alternative packages available for different languages. Once the text has been preprocessed, it needs to converted into numerical vectors for analysis.   

 # 3.Algorithm Detail and Operation Steps  
  
  ## Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing  

  Before moving towards building any model, we need to collect a dataset containing labeled examples of text along with their corresponding labels. The labeled data should contain at least one positive example and one negative example for training purposes. After collecting the data, we preprocess it by removing stopwords, punctuation marks, converting all text to lowercase, and applying stemming/lemmatization if necessary. Here's an example code snippet demonstrating these steps:

  ```python
  import nltk
  from nltk.corpus import stopwords
  from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
  
  # Download required packages
  nltk.download('stopwords')
  nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
  
  def preprocess_text(text):
      """Preprocess text by removing stopwords, punctuation marks, 
      converting all text to lowercase, and applying stemming."""
      
      # Convert text to lower case
      text = text.lower()
      
      # Remove punctuation
      text = ''.join([char for char in text if char.isalpha()])
      
      # Split text into individual words
      words = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
      
      # Apply stemming or lemmatization here

      return''.join(words)
      
  # Load data from file
  f = open("data.txt", "r")
  lines = f.readlines()
  f.close()
  
  X = []
  y = []
  
  # Iterate through each line in the data file
  for line in lines:
      label, text = line.strip().split("\t")
      X.append(preprocess_text(text))
      y.append(label)
      
  # Create bag of words representation of data
  from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
  vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
  X_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X).toarray()
  ``` 

  ## Step 2: Feature Extraction via Word Embeddings
  
  In traditional NLP workflows, feature extraction involves creating a vocabulary of unique words occurring in the corpus and assigning them indices in a fixed sequence. This typically involves calculating the frequency distribution of each word over the entire corpus, storing them in a lookup table, and encoding the text instances as dense arrays representing the presence or absence of each word in the document. However, this approach cannot encode the semantics of the words directly, nor does it consider contextual information around them. To address these issues, we need to use distributed representations of words called "word embeddings". Word embeddings represent each word as a dense vector of real values. Each dimension of the vector corresponds to a distinct concept captured by the embedding, allowing us to capture relationships between words and use them to solve problems in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis. Popular methods for generating word embeddings include GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText, and BERT.

  One of the key challenges in incorporating word embeddings into sentiment analysis is deciding what level of granularity to apply them to. Attempting to embed every single word in the vocabulary would result in a massive number of dimensions, which would make it difficult to train complex models effectively. Instead, we can selectively choose a subset of frequently occurring words or n-grams and create embeddings for them specifically. The choice of hyperparameters such as embedding size, window size, and skip-gram factor determines the quality and efficiency of the resulting embeddings.

  An implementation of this step is shown below:

  ```python
  from gensim.models import KeyedVectors
  import numpy as np
  
  # Load GoogleNews vectors trained on Common Crawl data
  model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('/path/to/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin', binary=True)
  
  def generate_embeddings(tokens, dim=300):
      """Generate word embeddings for given list of tokens"""
      vecs = [model[token] for token in tokens if token in model]
      if len(vecs) == 0:
          vecs = [np.zeros((dim,))]*len(tokens)
      else:
          vecs = np.mean(vecs, axis=0).reshape(-1, dim)
      return vecs
  ```

  Once we have generated the embeddings for each tokenized sentence, we concatenate them along with additional features like length of the sentence and term frequency-inverse document frequency weights. This gives us a final set of feature vectors that can be fed into a classification algorithm like Naive Bayes.

  ## Step 3: Building the Model

  Our overall objective is to build a classifier that can learn patterns and correlations in the labeled data to classify new inputs into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on their content. As mentioned earlier, we will use Naive Bayes as our classifier because it performs well even on small datasets, especially compared to deep neural networks.

  1. **Feature Selection**: First, we remove irrelevant or redundant features like ID columns, timestamps, and other metadata that do not contribute to determining the polarity of the text. We also convert categorical variables into numeric ones using LabelEncoder.

  2. **Splitting Data into Train and Test Sets**: Next, we split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. We also randomly shuffle the data before splitting to ensure that the classes are balanced.

  3. **Training the Model**: We then fit the selected features to the training data using Naive Bayes classifier and calculate the accuracy score on the test data.

  4. **Fine-Tuning Hyperparameters**: If the accuracy achieved on the test set is not satisfactory, we can try fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model such as alpha (smoothing parameter) and max_features (number of features to consider during prediction). Fine-tuning improves the generalization performance of the model on unseen data.

  5. **Evaluating the Performance**: Finally, we can evaluate the performance of the model on external data such as Twitter feeds, product reviews, and user comments. We can also visualize the confusion matrix to identify areas where the model makes mistakes.

  Here's an example code snippet demonstrating the above steps:

  ```python
  from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, plot_confusion_matrix
  
  # Initialize Naive Bayes classifier
  clf = MultinomialNB()
  
  # Fit the classifier to the training data
  clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
  
  # Predict the labels for the test data
  y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
  
  # Calculate the accuracy score
  acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
  print("Accuracy:", acc)
  
  # Plot the confusion matrix
  cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
  fig = plt.figure()
  ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
  cax = ax.matshow(cm)
  plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
  fig.colorbar(cax)
  ax.set_xticklabels([''] + ['Negative','Neutral','Positive'])
  ax.set_yticklabels([''] + ['Negative','Neutral','Positive'])
  plt.xlabel('Predicted')
  plt.ylabel('Actual')
  plt.show()
  ```
  
  By combining multiple algorithms and techniques, we can achieve high levels of accuracy in sentiment analysis tasks. Although traditional techniques have proven effective in sentiment analysis tasks, they require careful preprocessing and feature engineering to work well. Using modern machine learning tools like word embeddings and convolutional neural networks, we can leverage transfer learning and meta-learning to significantly increase the accuracy and robustness of our models.
