# 1.背景介绍


Operating Systems (OS) are a fundamental component in any computer system as they provide the operating environment for software applications and hardware devices to run smoothly. As such, it is crucial to have a deep understanding of how OS works internally. This paper presents an overview of concepts and principles underlying the design and implementation of modern operating systems. In particular, we focus on seven key elements that make up the foundation of most modern operating systems: processes, threads, memory management, file systems, I/O subsystems, scheduling, and communication mechanisms. We also look at some emerging trends that have impacted these areas over recent years, including cloud computing and mobile devices. With this review article, readers will gain an insight into the core components and key features of modern operating systems and its future directions with considerable knowledge gained during the past decade. 

This paper is intended as a reference manual for all developers who need to understand the inner workings of OSes. It provides a high-level overview of each area covered by introducing relevant background information and examples. The explanations provided should be helpful both for those who are just starting their journey into OS development and experienced ones looking for deeper insights. However, keep in mind that this is not a complete guide nor does it replace the detailed documentation available online or books written about specific OS architectures. Instead, this article serves as a quick introduction to get you started and can serve as a roadmap for further exploration. 


# 2. Core Concepts & Relationships
Modern operating systems consist of several essential components, called "core" services, which are responsible for running user programs, sharing resources among them, ensuring security, and managing hardware devices. These core services form the foundation for all other functions and interactions within the system. Here's a brief summary of the major concepts and relationships between them:

1. Processes - A process is an instance of a program executing on a computer. It consists of two parts: code and data. Code contains instructions executed by the processor, while data includes variables, files, and connections to other programs or libraries. Every time a new program runs, a new process is created. Processes are isolated units of execution that do not share memory with others. They communicate through standard input/output streams, pipes, sockets, or shared memory regions. Each process has its own set of registers, stack space, and priority level. Processes may contain multiple threads of execution, but commonly a single thread per process is used due to the overhead involved in context switching. 

2. Threads - A thread is a lightweight process that shares the same resources (e.g., address space, open files, etc.) as other threads in the same process. Unlike processes, threads typically execute concurrently within a single process, sharing common resources such as memory and CPU usage. A thread can create additional threads itself using various synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores, events). Threads may be more appropriate than processes for tasks that do not require large amounts of resource isolation or complex interprocess communication. 

3. Memory Management - Memory management refers to the process of allocating and freeing memory needed by processes and providing access to that memory efficiently. OS algorithms allocate and release physical memory from different segments based on demand, manage virtual memory mappings, and track usage patterns to optimize performance. There are several methods for implementing memory management, including paged memory, segmentation, and swapping. 

4. File Systems - File systems organize storage space on disk and allow users to store and retrieve data across different devices. The goal of a file system is to simplify the interface between application programs and the stored data, making it easier to create, delete, search, and manipulate files. Common file systems include Unix/Linux VFS, NTFS, HFS+, FAT32, and ext4. 

5. I/O Subsystems - An I/O subsystem handles communication between the device drivers and hardware devices connected to the system. Devices include hard drives, printers, scanners, modems, network interfaces, USB ports, and even remote servers. Various types of I/O operations occur throughout the lifetime of the system, including reading and writing files, transmitting and receiving network packets, accessing serial ports, and interacting with hardware sensors. OSes must handle these requests efficiently and effectively to maintain system responsiveness and avoid system crashes. 

6. Scheduling - Scheduling determines which process(es) get access to the CPU and what order they run in. Three main scheduling policies are First Come, First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and Round Robin (RR). FCFS selects the process that arrives first, SJN selects the one with the shortest expected runtime, RR alternates between ready processes using pre-determined quanta of time. 

7. Communication Mechanisms - Modern operating systems support many different types of communication protocols, including TCP/IP, UDP, IPX, Bluetooth, Serial Ports, and FireWire. Different protocols use different networking technologies underneath, but all rely heavily on low-level hardware interfaces such as ethernet, Wi-Fi, parallel port, USB, FireWire, etc. By abstracting away the details of the hardware, communication mechanisms enable higher-level programming models that hide the complexity of lower layers. For example, modern web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox use the HTTP protocol to fetch HTML pages, JavaScript code, and CSS stylesheets.

# 3. Core Algorithms & Operations
Now let us discuss some important core algorithms and operations implemented in modern operating systems. These algorithms help implement critical functionality such as process creation, memory allocation, file manipulation, scheduling, and synchronization. Let us go through each section and talk about the algorithmic details behind them.

1. Process Creation
Process creation involves creating a new process object along with the initial set of resources required by the program (i.e., code and data segment, open files, memory space, etc.). The kernel creates a new entry in a process table for the new process and assigns a unique process ID to it. The scheduler then chooses the next process to run according to its priority level and switches control to the newly created process. The steps involved in process creation depend on the chosen kernel architecture and related standards. Some popular approaches include fork(), exec() family of calls, POSIX spawnp(), Windows CreateProcess(). Additionally, there are third-party libraries like glib spawn_async() function that encapsulate these APIs in asynchronous callbacks.

2. Memory Allocation
Memory allocation involves assigning memory to various entities such as processes, threads, shared libraries, and devices. Memory allocation strategies vary depending on the size, type, and scope of the entity being allocated. Some popular techniques include slab caches, buddy memory allocation, memory pools, and virtual memory. Furthermore, different memory allocation policies apply when dealing with sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, and encryption keys. Security measures such as ASLR, stack randomization, heap hardening, and buffer overflow protection ensure that sensitive data remains secure in memory.

3. File Manipulation
File manipulations involve operations such as opening, closing, reading, writing, renaming, deleting, and searching files on disk. File systems implement efficient interfaces that map file names to logical blocks and vice versa, allowing applications to read and write individual bytes without worrying about the underlying structure of the disk. Additionally, file systems perform integrity checks and garbage collection periodically to ensure reliability and consistency of data.

4. Scheduler
Scheduling involves selecting the next process to run based on various criteria such as the process' priority, remaining processing time, and degree of interference from other processes. Schedulers can switch between active and idle states based on time slices assigned to each process, enabling fairness and better utilization of resources.

5. Synchronization
Synchronization mechanisms ensure safe access to shared resources by preventing race conditions and deadlocks. Mutexes, semaphores, events, and condition variables are the primary synchronization primitives used in modern operating systems. Mutexes are binary semaphores that only permit one owner at a time, whereas semaphores are countable resources that can be acquired by multiple threads simultaneously. Events represent asynchronous operations that can wake waiting threads when signaled, while condition variables block one or more threads until a certain condition is met.

6. Virtual Machines
Virtual machines are platforms that simulate the behavior of a real machine on behalf of software applications. Typical uses include developing, testing, debugging, and deploying applications on top of a host platform. To achieve good performance, virtual machines often run with lightweight hypervisors that isolate guest virtual machines from the host system. Examples of popular virtualization technologies include Xen, KVM, QEMU, VMware ESXi, Oracle VirtualBox, and Microsoft Hyper-V.

# 4. Embracing Cloud Computing and Mobile Devices
The advent of cloud computing and mobile devices has significantly transformed the way software architects think about building software systems. From virtualization technologies such as Docker, to serverless compute offerings like AWS Lambda, and mobile app ecosystems like React Native, software engineers have been empowered with powerful tools to build scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solutions. However, this shift has also revealed a number of challenges related to developing robust and efficient software for these new environments. Below, we list some key points to consider when designing software for these new environments:

1. Distributed Systems - The advent of distributed systems requires new ways of thinking about software design. Distributed systems span multiple nodes (physical or virtual machines), communicating via remote procedure calls (RPCs), event-driven messaging, and peer-to-peer networks. Software designed for traditional monolithic systems may not be able to handle these requirements without significant rewrites or modifications.

2. Resource Constraints - Software designed for cloud computing and mobile devices typically operate with limited resources such as bandwidth, storage capacity, processing power, and battery life. While existing practices like caching and batch processing can help mitigate some of these constraints, software still needs to consider how it responds to excessive resource consumption.

3. Latency Requirements - Applications built for latency-sensitive environments such as VR and AR require careful attention to timing and responsiveness. Microsecond response times may be necessary for interactive gameplay, while longer timeouts may be acceptable for nonessential operations like image uploads and downloads.

4. Scalability Issues - Cloud computing and mobile devices present unique scalability issues compared to traditional desktop computers. Users expect rapidly scaling out capabilities, but the technical landscape is diverse and complex. Software engineers must carefully balance scalability, fault tolerance, and operational costs to deliver great experiences to end users.

5. Energy Efficiency - Power-constrained devices such as mobile phones and IoT devices require specialized algorithms and techniques to minimize energy consumption and maximize battery life. At the same time, smart devices can generate a lot of heat, so software must continuously monitor and reduce temperature fluctuations.

Overall, modern operating systems have come a long way since the days of mainframe computers, but they continue to evolve and adapt to meet the demands of today's cloud-based and mobile-first world. Understanding the core ideas and principles that drive the design and implementation of modern operating systems is essential for anyone working with the technology in the field.
