# 1.背景介绍


Dynamically loading classes is a core feature of most modern programming languages such as Java and C++. In this article, we will learn how to dynamically load the class files from disk into memory in Java using ClassLoader API. We will also see some advanced techniques for managing multiple versions of same class file with dynamic loading.

This feature allows us to write more modular code that can be easily maintained over time by simply updating the version of library used in our application without affecting other parts of the system. It also helps in optimizing performance because it allows us to avoid unnecessary loading or initialization of unused classes during runtime.

In summary, the ability to dynamically load classes makes it easy to break down large systems into smaller modules, provide plug-in architecture, enable hot swapping of components, optimize resource usage, etc., while still maintaining high level of flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

## 2.1 Class Loader
ClassLoader is an abstract concept that represents the mechanism behind the loading and linking of class files in Java. The basic idea is to resolve symbolic references to class objects in byte code by loading them from the local machine's resources (such as the file system) into memory so that they can be used by the JVM. There are two types of class loaders - bootstrap loader and user defined loader. Bootstrap loader loads essential classes like java.*, javax.* and org.* which are required for running a Java program. User defined loader loads additional classes provided either through command line arguments, system properties or other means. All loaded classes are placed in the heap space where they remain until explicitly unloaded.

Java uses the `java.lang.ClassLoader` interface to represent both bootstrap and user defined class loaders. This interface provides methods for finding, loading, linking and initializing classes. A typical sequence of operations when loading a class involves:

1. Finding the requested class
2. Loading the binary representation of the class from the appropriate location
3. Linking the class
4. Initializing static variables and constants declared in the class

Once all these steps have been completed successfully, the class object is ready to use. If any error occurs during this process, the corresponding exception would be thrown. Additionally, there are several ways to specify the locations where Java should search for class files on the classpath. These include:

1. Using CLASSPATH environment variable
2. Using -classpath option with javac compiler
3. Setting java.class.path system property
4. Passing explicit paths to the ClassLoader constructors

## 2.2 Bytecode Verifier
Bytecode verifier checks whether the bytecode generated by the compiler is valid according to the Java Virtual Machine specification. It ensures that the instructions executed by the virtual machine match the operands expected by each instruction. An invalid bytecode may cause various exceptions or errors when being executed by the JVM. Tools such as javap and jad can help in analyzing and debugging the bytecode.


## 2.3 Java Native Interface(JNI)
The Java Native Interface is a technology that enables Java programs to interact with native libraries written in other languages, such as C/C++, Python, etc. JNI exposes a set of functions for creating and manipulating Java objects and calling their methods via native code calls. The Java Native Interface is used mainly to integrate Java applications with external applications developed in different languages.

## 2.4 Javassist
Javassist is a powerful but complex tool that enables developers to modify the behavior of existing classes at runtime based on their needs. It is especially useful when dealing with legacy systems that cannot be rewritten due to technical limitations or security concerns. With Javassist, developers can add new fields, methods, interfaces, annotations, and construct new subclasses of existing classes at run-time. Moreover, Javassist provides several utility classes for working with Java bytecode, such as class pools, class transformers, and field-editing facilities.

## 3.1 Loading Class Files
To load a class, the following steps need to be followed:

1. Create a `ClassLoarder` instance to find and load the class files from the specified location(s).
2. Invoke the `loadClass()` method of the `ClassLoader` instance passing the fully qualified name of the class to be loaded. 
3. Verify if the requested class has already been loaded before, return the cached copy if available. Otherwise create a new `Class` instance and cache it for future reference.
4. Load the binary representation of the class from the class file bytes returned by the `ClassLoader`.
5. Convert the class bytes into executable format known as the **bytecode**.
6. Check if the class passes verification tests performed by the **bytecode verifier** or not. Throw an exception if the class fails verification.
7. Execute the **static initializer** code block of the class.

## 3.2 Linking and Initialization of Classes
Linking refers to resolving symbolic references within the class file. When the JVM first encounters a class definition, it must perform certain tasks to prepare the class for execution. For example, the linker resolves symbolic references to its superclasses and implemented interfaces. After successful linking, the JVM moves on to executing the **static initializer** blocks of the class. During this step, the JVM initializes static variables and constant values declared in the class. Finally, the constructor of the main class is invoked. Once all these activities have been performed successfully, the class is considered initialized and ready for use.

## 3.3 Managing Multiple Versions of Same Class File with Dynamic Loading
Multiple versions of the same class file may exist on the system since software releases often involve bug fixes and improvements. To manage these multiple versions, we can use dynamic loading along with versioning scheme such as MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD. Revision number is optional. Here are the general steps for managing multiple versions of same class file with dynamic loading:

1. Use custom naming convention to uniquely identify each release version of the class.
2. Define a mapping between the unique names and the actual path to the class file on the file system.
3. Parse the version string obtained from the `Manifest.mf` file of the jar file and compare it with the current version of the class. If the versions do not match, try to load the class again with the updated mapping. 
4. Implement caching mechanisms to store previously loaded classes and avoid redundant loading of the same class repeatedly.
