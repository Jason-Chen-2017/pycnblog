# 1.背景介绍


Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of deep neural network that can learn complex data distributions without the need for labeled examples or any prior assumptions about the distribution. The key idea behind VAE is to introduce an auxiliary random variable z as an additional input to the decoder to capture the latent space structure which allows better reconstruction. One advantage of using VAEs over regular autoencoders is that they provide probabilistic reconstructions where each pixel value can take on a real-valued probability distribution with mean and variance parameters that are not deterministically constrained by the encoder output alone. This property makes it possible to incorporate uncertainty into downstream tasks such as image segmentation or classification while still retaining the advantages of model interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, training VAEs requires automatic differentiation techniques that allow us to optimize the objective function directly through backpropagation, making them scalable and efficient. 

In medical imaging applications, VAEs have been widely used for various tasks including image synthesis, anomaly detection, denoising, and representation learning. They have also shown great promise in generating synthetic images from known ones or restoring missing parts of original images. However, there has been relatively less research on using VAEs in other medical domains beyond computer vision, highlighting the importance of further exploration in this area.

The purpose of this review article is to provide an overview of the current state of the art methods and applications of VAEs in medical imaging, including both theoretical and practical aspects. In addition, we hope to spark discussion and foster knowledge transfer among relevant communities. 


# 2. Core Concepts and Relationship
VAEs consist of two subnetworks, an encoding network and a decoding network. The encoding network takes raw input x and outputs a low-dimensional latent vector z, which captures important features of the input signal but does not contain any information specific to individual samples. On the other hand, the decoding network takes the latent vector z and produces the reconstructed input x'. Additionally, the decoder generates a probabilistic output y = p(x|z), where x denotes the reconstructed input sample and z represents the latent space variables learned by the model. By introducing the extra layer of randomness, the goal is to enable the decoder to generate more realistic images that reflect the variability in the underlying data distribution. As a result, the VAE models make use of Bayes' rule to combine the inference step (learning the posterior distribution q_φ(z|x)) and the generation step (sampling from the approximate posterior).


An extension of traditional VAEs called conditional VAEs uses additional inputs c to condition the generative process. For example, when working with medical imaging datasets, c may represent demographic attributes like age, gender, disease diagnosis etc., which can be fed into the generator alongside the latent code to produce specialized images. Another way to think of conditional VAEs is that they reduce the dimensionality of the latent space by exploiting redundancy between the inputs c and z during training.


Another concept related to VAEs is self-supervised pretraining. Self-supervised pretraining refers to the task of pre-training a neural network using unlabelled data only, which is achieved by adding a small amount of supervised loss in addition to the VAE loss. The intuition behind self-supervised pretraining is that although labeled data is expensive and time-consuming to obtain, it often contains valuable information that cannot be captured solely by the use of VAEs. Pretrained networks obtained via self-supervision can then serve as strong baselines for subsequent tasks such as finetuning on a target dataset.

Finally, one major issue with traditional VAEs is their dependence on the availability of labeled data. While some works propose semi-supervised VAEs that leverage unlabeled data during training to improve the overall performance, these approaches require careful design of the loss function and hyperparameters. Moreover, even simple modifications to the existing VAE framework may lead to performance degradation if too much emphasis is placed on fine-tuning on large unlabeled datasets. Therefore, recent work has focused on developing new strategies for handling the lack of labeled data within the context of medical imaging. These include augmenting VAE-based algorithms with weakly supervised labels generated from self-attention layers applied to the intermediate feature maps of the convolutional layers of the discriminator. Alternatively, improved labeling mechanisms based on curriculum learning could be employed to train on smaller amounts of labeled data at a time and gradually increase the difficulty level after each iteration.

Overall, VAEs offer promising avenues for addressing various medical imaging problems, especially those that involve high dimensional continuous data such as CT scans, MRI scans, and X-rays. Within the next few years, there will likely be many exciting developments in this area, particularly in terms of improving efficiency, reducing computational complexity, and improving robustness against adversarial attacks. To further advance the field, we must continue to engage with academia, industry, and clinicians to identify emerging trends, build consensus on best practices, and address critical challenges in medical imaging research.
