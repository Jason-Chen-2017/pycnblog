# 1.背景介绍


In this article I will introduce you to the role of product manager and how it plays a crucial role in shaping your technology company’s strategy, revenue growth, and customer experience. As a product manager at your organization, I will walk through several key concepts and principles that can help shape the direction of your business and make it more successful.

Before we start, let me clarify some terms: 

- “Product” refers to anything created by or for end users – websites, mobile apps, software products, etc.
- A “product manager” is someone who creates or owns products – including but not limited to web applications, mobile apps, APIs, enterprise solutions, digital products, etc.
- The primary goal of a product manager is to ensure that these products meet user needs, are properly engineered and optimized, and positively impact your bottom line. 
- You may be familiar with the term “product owner”, which refers to the person responsible for creating or owning the overall vision, roadmap, and scope of a product initiative. However, the difference between a product manager and a product owner is subtle and can get blurry when used interchangeably. Therefore, I use both terms throughout my article to differentiate them clearly.

Now, with those definitions out of the way, let’s dive into what actually makes a great product manager at your tech company!

# 2.Core Concepts & Principles

Here are three key concepts and principles that I believe make up the foundation of effective product management at any tech company:

1. User-Centered Design (UCD): UCD focuses on understanding the needs of customers and designing products that address their problems. This involves taking into account psychology, behavioral science, and human factors while planning and building products. 

2. Agile Development Methodology: An agile methodology emphasizes collaboration over project management and empowers teams to deliver high-quality results quickly. It promotes iterative development cycles that allow for continuous improvement. By breaking down big projects into smaller, achievable tasks, teams can ship features faster and generate feedback more frequently.

3. Customer Obsession: Building products that delight customers drives engagement and loyalty. A strong focus on customer acquisition and retention ensures that your products are relevant, useful, and valuable to your target audience. To achieve this level of obsession, companies must invest heavily in research, testing, and iteration.

Together, these core concepts and principles have a significant effect on product success at your tech company. They influence everything from feature prioritization to team communication and decision making. Let’s go deeper into each concept to understand its importance further.

## 2.1 User-Centered Design (UCD)

User-centered design (UCD), also known as market research and participatory design, aims to produce products that solve real world problems for people using them. While traditional approaches like wireframing and mockups seek to create visual representations of ideas, UCD is much more collaborative and requires active involvement of stakeholders from all parts of the organization.

There are five main steps to UCD:
1. Recruitment: Find and interview users early on in the process to gain insights about their pain points, goals, and expectations. 
2. Interviews: Spend time talking to potential customers to gain a better understanding of their problem statements and expectations. Conduct semi-structured interviews where users fill out paper questionnaires to gather information and collect feedback. Use surveys and probes to learn more about the current state of the industry and your target demographic. 
3. Competitive Analysis: Look at similar products or services to identify gaps or opportunities for your product to improve upon. Understand the strengths and weaknesses of competitors' products and analyze whether they offer additional benefits or features that could add value to your product. 
4. Personas: Create fictional characters representing different types of users and define common characteristics and behaviors. These personas should represent actual segments of your target demographic and provide insights into what motivates, challenges, and frustrates them. 
5. Prototyping: Create low-fidelity prototypes to test various design concepts and validate user flow assumptions. Iterate on the design based on user feedback until final polished product is ready for testing.

By following these steps, you can create products that delight users and address their unique needs, rather than just satisfying their wants. UCD is one of the most important techniques in shaping your technology company's strategy, revenue growth, and customer experience. Without effective UCD, your company risks missing critical markets or wasting resources on unnecessary features.

## 2.2 Agile Development Methodology

Agile development methodologies like Scrum and Kanban aim to break down complex projects into smaller, manageable pieces called user stories. Teams work in small batches and communicate regularly to share progress and stay aligned on priorities. Iterations typically last two weeks to four weeks and enable teams to adjust plans quickly if necessary.

Scrum has three roles: product owner, scrum master, and developer. The product owner leads the backlog and defines the product requirements. The scrum master helps the team to maintain focus and to resolve issues that arise during daily standup. Developers build the code according to the specifications provided by the product owner.

Kanban is even simpler and involves organizing cards based on status such as to do, doing, done, blocked, etc. Each card represents a task that needs to be completed. The workflow moves tasks through these columns from left to right, allowing developers to easily view what tasks need attention. Cards are moved backwards if needed and shifted forward when they are complete.

Both methods promote rapid delivery of working software, enabling organizations to respond more quickly to changing customer demands. They also increase transparency and alignment within the team, making it easier to troubleshoot and address any issues that arise. By following an agile approach, you can create products that are robust, scalable, and reliable.

## 2.3 Customer Obsession

The idea behind customer obsession is simple: consumers want the best possible experience regardless of whether they pay for it or not. Whether you're selling clothing, bank accounts, or food, customer obsession means being driven by curiosity and desire to know exactly why you made the decision to buy something. When you put customers first, you inspire them to become part of your brand, trust your brand, and take pride in providing exceptional service.

To establish customer obsession, you'll need to invest in every aspect of your product - from initial marketing campaigns to ongoing messaging. Here are six ways to effectively demonstrate customer obsession:

1. Brand Recognition: Demonstrate your brand's uniqueness and credibility by using logos, colors, and imagery that reflect your values and beliefs. Start conversations with influential individuals and communities to support your brand's presence across the industry. 

2. Value-Added Services: Offer added-value services that exceed your basic package, such as personalized training, technical assistance, or insurance coverage. Customers appreciate having access to expertise and guidance that goes beyond the basics. 

3. Coupon Discounts: Offer discounts on items that they might otherwise choose not to purchase, such as special deals or membership rewards. People seeking discount offers feel valued and supported, which encourages them to spend money on other things. 

4. Referral Programmes: Offer referrals to others who may find your product beneficial and recommend it to others. Customers are increasingly turning to friends and family for help, which builds confidence and encourages sharing. 

5. Reward Points System: Give customers credit for their hard work by offering reward points, coupons, or free samples. People who earn points keep coming back to redeem offers, giving them more reason to stick around. 

6. Social Media Promotions: Use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to spread the word about your product. Provide clear and concise copy that captures consumer interest and informs them of new features and functionality. Stories shared online contribute to higher engagement rates and awareness raising your company's image. 

These examples highlight just a few ways to showcase customer obsession within your product and encourage customers to treat you with respect. By developing products that delight customers, you can attract a larger portion of your customer base and win them over with positive reinforcement mechanisms like rewards programs and loyalty programs.
