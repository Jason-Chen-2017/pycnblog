# 2.核心概念与联系
In this section, let's briefly discuss some key data science concepts and their interconnections:

1. Statistics: The first step towards understanding data is collecting and analyzing data points. Here are some crucial statistics concepts that help us gain insights about data distributions, relationships between variables, and correlations among them:

    * Descriptive Statistics: Describes the main characteristics of a dataset such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, correlation coefficients, and covariance matrix.
    * Inferential Statistics: Estimates population parameters based on samples collected from a population. It helps us determine if two groups or populations have significantly different proportions or means.
    * Hypothesis Testing: Tests whether a hypothesis is true or not based on sample data. A common method of testing hypotheses involves randomly assigning observations to two groups and calculating the difference in means to see if there is a significant difference between the groups.
    
2. Visualization: Visualizing data is a critical skill in any field of research. Here are some important visualization techniques:

    * Line Charts: Used to plot continuous data over a period of time. Commonly used to show changes over time, growth rates, or comparisons between multiple variables.
    * Bar Charts: Compare categorical variables across categories or subgroups. They're useful for showing counts or percentages across different categories.
    * Pie Charts: Show relative sizes of categories within a single variable. They're often used to show composition or breakdown of total values.
    * Scatter Plot: Displays the relationship between two continuous variables. Commonly used to show clusters, outliers, or linear relationships.
    * Boxplots: Display distributional information for continuous variables such as min/max, quartiles, median, and outliers. They're commonly used to detect outliers or identify potential issues with data collection procedures.
    * Histograms: Also known as bar charts but instead of displaying raw counts, they display frequency density curves. They're used to visualize data distribution and compare different distributions.
    
    
3. Probability & Statistics: Probability theory is used to quantify uncertain events and describe the likelihood of outcomes occurring. Some important probability concepts include:
    
    * Random Variables: A random variable represents the outcome of a measurement or experiment. For example, a die roll has six possible outcomes, while the weather could be sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy, snowy, or foggy.
    * Distribution Functions: Describe the probabilities of occurrence of different outcomes given certain conditions. They're represented using mathematical equations or tables called probability mass functions (PMFs), cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), or probability density functions (PDFs). 
    * Joint Distributions: Represent the joint probability of several random variables taking on different values simultaneously. These distributions help us understand dependencies between variables and relationships between them.
    * Conditional Distributions: Explain the probabilities of different outcomes given that another variable has already been observed or determined.
    

4. Linear Algebra: Linear algebra plays a crucial role in data science because many data modeling techniques rely on vector operations and transformations. Some key linear algebra concepts include:

    * Vector Operations: Applying arithmetic operations on vectors results in adding or subtracting the corresponding elements of both vectors. Scaling a vector multiplies every element of the vector by a constant factor. Dot product shows the directionality and magnitude of the angle between two vectors.
    * Matrix Multiplication: Multiplying matrices together combines rows and columns to produce a new matrix. There are several ways to perform multiplication depending on the dimensions of the matrices being multiplied. Transposition reverses the order of the rows and columns of a matrix.
    * Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Eigenvalue decomposition is a way to decompose a square matrix into eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Essentially, it identifies the dominant directions in which the matrix varies and explains the amount of variation in those directions.

5. Algorithms: Algorithmic thinking is the basis for efficient computing. Here are some important algorithmic concepts related to data science:

    * Big O Notation: Express the complexity of an algorithm as a function of input size. It's a measure of how much resources the algorithm uses to run, including memory usage, running time, and space requirements.
    * Sorting Algorithms: Analyze and improve the efficiency of sorting algorithms. There are many types of sorting algorithms available such as quicksort, merge sort, heap sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort, and more.
    * Searching Algorithms: Find particular items efficiently in large collections. There are many searching algorithms such as binary search, hash table lookup, trie search, depth-first search, breadth-first search, and more.
    * Graph Algorithms: Solve complex graph-related problems such as shortest path finding, maximum flow, minimum spanning tree, and matching algorithms.
