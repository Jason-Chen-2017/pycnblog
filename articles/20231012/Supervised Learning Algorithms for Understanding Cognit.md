# 1.背景介绍


Cognitive disorder (CD) is the widespread development of mental and behavioral impairments that affect one or more of the four domains including language, communication, reasoning, and decision-making abilities [1]. One of the most common symptoms of cognitive disorders are severe depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder (BDI). Despite being highly treatable, patients with CD face significant challenges in managing their condition. Research shows that multimodal neuroimaging data can provide valuable insights into these conditions by identifying patterns in brain activity, tissue changes, and behaviors. However, many researchers still struggle to understand how traditional supervised learning algorithms can effectively leverage such information for the diagnosis and management of cognitively impaired individuals. In this article, we aim to introduce a comprehensive review of different supervised learning algorithms applied to understanding cognitive disorders from both theoretical as well as practical perspectives based on extensive literature reviews. Moreover, we present several case studies where our algorithms have been used for the diagnosis and management of cognitive disorders. Finally, we suggest future directions for advancing the field of cognitive disorder detection using multimodal neuroimaging data and emphasize open issues for further research. Overall, this article aims at providing a holistic overview of current state-of-the-art techniques for predictive modeling and management of cognitive disorders via multimodal neuroimaging data. It will also serve as a starting point for researchers interested in applying machine learning to analyze multimodal neuroimaging data for treating and managing cognitive disorders.
# 2.核心概念与联系
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that involves training a model by feeding it labeled examples, which contain input variables and output variables. The goal is to learn a mapping function between inputs and outputs so that the model accurately produces the desired output given new input values. These models can be classified into two types: classification and regression. 

In the context of cognitive disorder analysis, we consider the problem of binary classification, where each sample represents either a patient with a specific cognitive disorder or without any cognitive disorder. We also assume that there exists some prior knowledge about the underlying structure of healthy human brains and cognitive functions involved in normal aging and disease progression. Therefore, we focus only on the features related to cognitive functions and ignore other physiological and biochemical factors commonly associated with cognition. Within the next few sections, we discuss several key concepts, mathematical formulas, and popular supervised learning algorithms that can be used to analyse multimodal neuroimaging data for detecting and managing cognitive disorders.

## k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a nonparametric method for classification and regression. It is a lazy learner, meaning it does not build a separate model for prediction; rather, it stores all of the training data and labels during the training process. During testing time, it compares a test instance to all stored instances and selects the K closest ones. Based on the majority vote among the selected neighbors, the classifier assigns the label to the test instance. Although simple and intuitive, KNN has become one of the most popular supervised learning methods due to its ability to handle large datasets and high dimensional feature spaces. Its computational complexity is O(n*log n), where n is the number of training samples. To improve performance, various variants of KNN have been proposed, such as weighted KNN, distance weighting, and epsilon-neighborhoods.

 
The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm works as follows: 

1. Calculate the Euclidean distance between the query image and all available images in the database.
2. Sort the distances in ascending order and select the top K nearest images.
3. Compute the average response value of the K nearest images for each target variable.
4. Return the predicted label for the query image as the mode of the computed responses. 

### Pseudocode 

```
for i = 1 to m do
    calculate distance between Xi and each xj 
    add the index of j and the corresponding distance to a list of sorted distances
    
sort the list of sorted distances in increasing order of distances
select the first k entries from the sorted list
compute the average of the target variable values for the k selected images
return the mode of the computed targets over the selected images
```

The pseudocode above describes the basic operation of the KNN algorithm for binary classification problems with continuous target variables. Note that in practice, additional steps may need to be taken to address class imbalance, missing values, categorical variables, etc., but the overall algorithm remains similar. Here's a Python implementation of the algorithm using scikit-learn library: 

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
knn_clf = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = knn_clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
```

Here `X_train` and `X_test` are matrices containing pixel intensities for multiple images belonging to two classes (`class_A` and `class_B`), while `y_train` and `y_test` are vectors indicating whether each image belongs to class A or B respectively. We train the KNN classifier on the training set using the `fit()` method, then use it to make predictions on the test set using the `predict()` method. We evaluate the accuracy of the resulting predictions using the `accuracy_score()` function from scikit-learn's `metrics` module.  

## Linear Regression 

Linear Regression is another supervised learning technique for regression tasks, where the task is to find a linear relationship between input variables and the target variable. It assumes that the input variables are linearly independent and normally distributed. The hypothesis function used by Linear Regression is defined as: 

$$h_{\theta}(x) = \theta_{0} + \theta_{1} x_{1} +... + \theta_{p} x_{p}$$ 

where $\theta$ representes the parameters to be learned, $x$ represents the input vector, and $p$ represents the number of input variables. The objective function used by Linear Regression to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values is defined as:

$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\widehat{y}_{i} - y_{i})^{2}$$ 

where $\widehat{y}_{i}$ is the predicted value for the $i$-th example and $y_{i}$ is the true value. The optimization procedure used by Linear Regression is gradient descent, which computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters, updates them iteratively until convergence, and returns the optimal solution. 

### Pseudocode 

```
repeat until convergence {
   compute gradients of J wrt theta 
   update theta according to alpha * gradients
}
```

The pseudocode above illustrates the basic idea behind Linear Regression. We start by initializing the weights $\theta$ randomly and repeat the following operations until convergence:

1. Compute the gradients of the cost function $J(\theta)$ with respect to the parameters $\theta$, which correspond to partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to individual parameters.
2. Update the parameters $\theta$ according to the gradient direction and step size chosen. This usually involves computing a small step in the opposite direction of the gradient and moving towards the minimum of the loss function.

Finally, once converged, we can use the learned parameters $\theta$ to make predictions on new data points. Here's a Python implementation of Linear Regression using scikit-learn library:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
linreg_clf = LinearRegression()
linreg_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = linreg_clf.predict(X_test)
r2_score = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('R^2 score:', r2_score)
```

Here again `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test` are numpy arrays representing the input data matrix, column vector of target variables for training and testing sets, respectively. We fit the Linear Regression model on the training data using the `fit()` method, then use it to make predictions on the test set using the `predict()` method. Finally, we measure the quality of the model using the coefficient of determination ($R^{2}$ score) provided by scikit-learn's `r2_score()` function. 

## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a special case of Linear Regression where the target variable is assumed to be binary. It models the probability of the occurrence of an event by fitting a logistic curve to the output of a linear model. The hypothesis function used by Logistic Regression is defined as: 

$$h_{\theta}(x) = g(\theta^{T}x)$$

where $g$ is the sigmoid function, $\theta^{T}$ denotes the transpose of $\theta$, and $x$ is the input vector. The sigmoid function takes any real value and maps it onto the interval $(0,1)$, making it useful for transforming a linear combination of features into a probability between zero and one. The objective function used by Logistic Regression to minimize the logarithmic loss between the predicted probabilities and the true values is defined as:

$$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m[y^{(i)}log(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)})log(1-h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}))]$$ 

where $y$ is the true binary outcome (either 0 or 1), $h_{\theta}(x)$ is the predicted probability, and $m$ is the number of examples. The optimization procedure used by Logistic Regression is gradient descent, just like in Linear Regression, except that instead of computing gradients of the parameters directly, we approximate them using iterative approximation techniques such as stochastic gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent. For simplicity, we'll simply refer readers to existing resources on logistic regression for more details.
