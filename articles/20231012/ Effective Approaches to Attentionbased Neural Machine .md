# 1.背景介绍


Attention mechanism has been a fundamental ingredient in neural machine translation (NMT) for many years due to its ability of capturing dependencies between source and target sentences better than other techniques such as convolutional or recurrent networks. However, existing attention mechanisms suffer from several drawbacks that have not been fully resolved. In this paper, we propose two new types of attention mechanisms to address these shortcomings: “global” and “local” attentions. We then present an effective approach called “multihead” attention, which enables the model to focus on different parts of input at different times, leading to significant improvements over standard attention. Finally, we demonstrate our proposed approaches using the WMT17 English-German dataset and achieve state-of-the-art results with respect to both BLEU score and token accuracy. Overall, these contributions help advance NMT by addressing important issues in current attention mechanisms, opening up exciting research opportunities, and providing insights into improving the quality of MT systems.

2.核心概念与联系
In this section, we will briefly review some key concepts related to attention based models and their connections to traditional sequence-to-sequence models.

Sequence-to-sequence models (seq2seq) are widely used for natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition, text-to-speech, machine translation etc. The basic idea behind seq2seq is to encode source sentences into vectors through an encoder network, and decode them into output sequences via another decoder network. In order to make predictions about target words, they rely on hidden representations generated by the encoder during training time. During inference, the decoder generates one word at a time, conditioned on previously generated words and the corresponding hidden states from the encoder. 

Traditional attention-based models are designed to capture long-range dependencies between source and target sentences more efficiently than the conventional seq2seq framework. These models use an additional attention layer that takes in previous predicted target words and outputs weights indicating how much each source word should be weighted during decoding. By doing so, it can capture contextual information from longer distances while still being efficient enough to handle large vocabulary sizes.

However, attention-based models also share some common characteristics with traditional seq2seq models. Both architectures consist of an encoder and a decoder, where the former encodes the input sentence into fixed length vectors, whereas the latter generates output sequences one word at a time, conditioned on previous predicted words and the corresponding hidden states from the encoder. Additionally, both models use bidirectional RNNs or CNNs as their encoders/decoders respectively, which allows them to capture local and global dependencies within the input sentence. 

Another important feature shared by both attention-based and seq2seq models is that they do not explicitly predict what type of relation exists between source and target words. Instead, they implicitly infer this relationship from their interactions with the entire sequence of encoded inputs. This contrasts with the classical seq2seq setup where the output depends on individual tokens and relationships between them. 

3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
To improve the performance of attention-based models, several modifications have been introduced over the years. First, the "global" attention was proposed to take into account all source words rather than just those most relevant to the next prediction. Second, a technique called "local" attention was developed that captures the interactions among nearby words instead of just relying on global ones. Third, multihead attention was introduced that makes use of multiple attention heads instead of a single one, allowing the model to attend to different aspects of the input simultaneously. Lastly, pre-trained embeddings were explored and adopted as a way of initializing the model's parameters without requiring any labeled data.

The following sections provide detailed explanations of the above mentioned modifications and algorithms involved in implementing these ideas. Let us now proceed to explain the steps involved in building a simple attention-based NMT system on the example of English-German translation.

3.1 Global Attention
Global attention refers to the fact that the model learns to pay more attention to the entire source sentence when generating each target word. It does so by computing a weighting vector for each source word, which reflects its importance relative to all others in the input sentence. The weighting vector is then multiplied elementwise with the hidden representation produced by the encoder to obtain the context vector, which represents the salience of each word given the entire sentence. Intuitively, we want to learn which words contribute most significantly to the overall meaning of the target sentence, hence focusing on the entire source sentence.

We compute the weighting vector w_i for each i-th position in the source sentence S_t using a softmax function:

    w_i = exp(e_{i,t}) / sum_j exp(e_{j,t})
    
where e_{i,t} is a learned parameter representing the energy of the i-th source word under the t-th target word. Since we need to consider all positions j in the source sentence, this requires a separate set of e_{j,t}'s for each target word t, making the attention computation expensive. To avoid this issue, we can use a scaled dot-product attention mechanism, which computes the similarity between the query Q_t (which corresponds to the t-th target word), and the keys K_i' (which correspond to all positions in the source sentence except i). The similarity measure used here is typically a scaled version of the dot product, commonly referred to as cosine similarity:
    
    sim_ij = softmax(\frac{QK_i^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})
   
where d_k is the dimensionality of the query/key vectors. Here, we assume k=d_k and sqrt denotes the square root operation. The attention distribution across all sources can be obtained using a weighted average:

    c_t = \sum_i w_i S_i 
    
where w_i is the attention weight assigned to the i-th position in the source sentence.

This attention mechanism achieves significant improvements over traditional attention mechanisms because it gives greater flexibility to the model to assign higher weights to specific portions of the input sentence, while still taking advantage of similarities between words.

3.2 Local Attention
Local attention refers to the fact that the model only considers neighboring words around a particular position in the source sentence when generating each target word. This is done by computing two attention distributions for each position in the source sentence, corresponding to the neighbors on either side of the current position. These distributions are computed separately for each target word, leading to independent sets of attention scores for each target position. The final context vector is then computed by combining these scores according to the alignment method chosen, such as concatenation or dot-product. 

Specifically, let $\hat{Q}_i$ and $K_i'$ represent the query and key vectors for the ith position in the source sentence. We first compute the leftward attention distribution a_l(i):

    a_l(i) = softmax(\frac{\hat{Q}_i\cdot K_l'^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})
    
Here, $K_l'$ is the stack of key vectors corresponding to the leftmost n neighboring positions, where n is a hyperparameter determining the size of the neighborhood. Similarly, we can compute the rightward attention distribution a_r(i):
    
    a_r(i) = softmax(\frac{\hat{Q}_i\cdot K_r'^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})
    
Note that we don't need to include the ith position itself since we're only interested in its neighbors. Then, we combine the distributions using a combination operator ($\oplus$) like concatenation or dot-product:
    
    c_t = (\sum_i w_{il}S_i) \oplus (\sum_i w_{ir}S_i)
    
Here, w_{il} and w_{ir} are the attention weights assigned to the leftward and rightward neighbor positions, respectively. This attention mechanism helps the model focus on the central word while avoiding ambiguity caused by too few or too many relevant words from surrounding context.

3.3 Multi-Head Attention
Multi-head attention consists of dividing the attention calculation into multiple parallel sub-networks, known as heads. Each head operates independently on a subset of the features to capture different aspects of the input sentence. For instance, we may split the hidden dimensions of the encoder into h sub-vectors of equal size, and perform attention calculations on each sub-vector separately using a distinct projection matrix P_h. Alternatively, we could apply separate linear transformations to each feature dimension x_i to generate k_i sub-features for each head, enabling each head to operate on different scales of the input.

Once we have computed attention distributions for each head, we concatenate them along the channel dimension to obtain the final context vector. Specifically, we obtain the attention vector c_t as follows:
    
    c_t = concat[A_1; A_2;... ; A_h]
    
where A_h is the concatenated attention vectors for the hth head. Concatenation is performed over the feature dimension to create a single tensor of size (n_heads*d_v) for each position in the source sentence. Note that we can add positional encodings to each position in the source sentence before applying attention to ensure that the model accounts for the temporal aspect of the inputs.

Overall, multi-head attention enables the model to take advantage of different aspects of the input sentence by learning attention distributions from different perspectives. This improves the expressiveness of the model and leads to improved performance on complex tasks like machine translation.

3.4 Pre-trained Embeddings
Pre-trained embeddings are usually initialized randomly or with word-level statistics and can greatly impact the performance of the model. In general, larger embedding matrices lead to faster convergence but may cause vanishing gradients and decrease in stability, particularly in deep models. Likewise, smaller embedding matrices increase computational costs but can potentially bias the direction of optimization towards rare or unseen words. To mitigate this problem, we can explore methods of initializing the embedding matrix with various pre-trained word vectors, such as GloVe, fastText, or Word2Vec. We can fine-tune the remaining layers of the model using backpropagation after setting the embedding layer to non-trainable, thus freezing the initial embeddings and tuning the rest of the model solely on the task at hand.

3.5 Putting It All Together
Finally, we put everything together and build a small attention-based neural machine translator. Given an input sentence S_t in the source language, we pass it through an encoder network E_t to produce an encoding vector e_t. Next, we feed e_t and a start symbol <s> to the decoder D_t, which produces the first target word y_t. At every subsequent step, we sample a probability distribution p(y_t|e_t,Y_t<t) to select the next word, where Y_t<t is the prefix of previously generated words up to index t. We use teacher forcing to update the input to the decoder at test time, but train the decoder to maximize the expected log likelihood of the sampled words given the true labels. Once we finish decoding, we evaluate the resulting translations T_t against the reference translations T^{ref}_t to calculate metrics such as BLEU score and token accuracy. 

In summary, the main components of an attention-based neural machine translator include an encoder and a decoder, each made up of a stack of RNN/CNN cells. The encoder processes the input sentence S_t and produces an encoding vector e_t that captures the overall context of the input sentence. The decoder uses a conditional probability distribution p(y_t|e_t,Y_t<t) to select the next target word and updates the state of the decoder based on the last generated word and the encoder output. Finally, we optimize the loss function to minimize the negative log likelihood of the selected words given the true labels and the context provided by the encoder.
