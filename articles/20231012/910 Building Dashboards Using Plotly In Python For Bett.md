# 1.背景介绍


Dashboards are a popular tool used by businesses to consolidate and present key business metrics in an easy-to-understand format. However, building effective dashboards can be challenging for both technical professionals and non-technical users who may not have the necessary skills or knowledge to create them. 

In this article, we will learn how to build dashboards using plotly library in python that provide advanced features such as interactive plots, data filtering capabilities, real-time updates, and more. We will also explore several use cases of creating dashboards with different visualizations and their corresponding functionality. Finally, we will discuss the advantages of building dashboards using plotly over traditional tools and methods. This is just the beginning! Our goal is to educate readers on what they need to know to make the most out of these powerful analytics tools.

2.Core Concepts & Connections
Before diving into the process of building dashboards using plotly library in python, let's first understand some basic concepts and connections between various components within it: 

1) Data Visualization: A graphical representation of data that provides insights into trends, patterns, and relationships among variables. The main purpose of visualization is to help users quickly understand complex datasets through graphs, charts, and diagrams. There are many types of data visualizations including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, maps, and heatmaps. 

2) Interactive Plots: These allow users to interact with the data by panning and zooming around the graph, hovering over specific points to reveal additional information, selecting regions to highlight subsets of data, and so on. They enable quick exploration of large amounts of data without the need for pagination or separate interfaces. 

3) Filters: These allow users to filter the data based on specific criteria, allowing them to focus on specific aspects of interest. Filter controls usually appear above the chart and allow users to specify multiple conditions to apply at once. 

4) Real-Time Updates: This feature allows users to see updated results immediately when new data becomes available, enabling greater transparency and interaction with changing data streams. It works by constantly refreshing the data in the background and updating the chart accordingly. 

5) Customization: This refers to the ability to customize the look and feel of the chart and adjust its layout according to individual needs. Some customization options include adding annotations, highlighting certain areas of the chart, formatting axis labels, and so on. 

6) Exporting Charts: Users can export the chart to various file formats such as PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF, and Excel, which can then be shared or printed out as needed. 

7) Deployment: Once built, dashboards must be deployed so other users can access them from anywhere. They can be hosted locally on company servers or cloud platforms like AWS or Azure. Depending on the audience and requirements, there are various deployment strategies such as sharing via email, posting online, or integrating with third-party applications.

3.Building Dashboards Using Plotly In Python - Technical Details And Use Cases
Now, let's move onto learning about how to build dashboards using the plotly library in Python. We will start with installing plotly package and importing required libraries. Then we will proceed to exploring different kinds of charts and their respective functionalities in plotly. Let’s dive in!

3.1 Installing Plotly Package And Importing Libraries
First, you'll need to install the latest version of plotly library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: 

```python
pip install plotly==4.14.3
```

Next, import the necessary modules and packages for our analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import dash
from dash import html
from dash import dcc
```

The `pandas` module will be used for loading and manipulating data sets, while `plotly.express` will be used to create various types of charts and graphs. `dash` module will be used for building web-based dashboards. `html`, `dcc` are two submodules within the `dash` module that we'll be using later.

3.2 Exploring Different Types Of Charts And Their Functionalities In Plotly
Plotly offers numerous types of charts and graphs that can be easily created and customized using the provided functions. Here are some commonly used ones:

1) Line Chart: A line chart is used to display changes over time in a single variable. It shows the development of a value against time, either linearly or in logarithmic scale. To create a line chart, you can use the function `px.line()` as follows:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # load dataset
fig = px.line(df, x='Date', y='Sales') # create line chart
fig.show() # show plot
```

2) Bar Chart: A bar chart is used to compare categorical data across categories. It displays each category stacked vertically along a horizontal axis. To create a bar chart, you can use the function `px.bar()` as follows:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # load dataset
fig = px.bar(df, x='Category', y='Value', color='Group', barmode='group') # create bar chart
fig.update_layout(title={'text': 'Bar Chart'}) # add title
fig.show() # show plot
```

3) Scatter Plot: A scatter plot is useful for displaying the relationship between two variables. Each point represents one observation made on two independent variables. To create a scatter plot, you can use the function `px.scatter()` as follows:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # load dataset
fig = px.scatter(df, x='X Variable', y='Y Variable', 
                 size='Size Column', color='Color Column', opacity=0.5) # create scatter plot
fig.show() # show plot
```

4) Histogram: A histogram is a graph showing the distribution of numerical data. It shows the frequency of occurrence of values by groupings. To create a histogram, you can use the function `px.histogram()` as follows:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # load dataset
fig = px.histogram(df, x="Age", nbins=20, marginal="box") # create histogram
fig.update_xaxes(title="Age Group") # update x-axis label
fig.update_yaxes(title="# of People") # update y-axis label
fig.show() # show plot
```

These are only a few examples of chart types that can be easily created and customized using the plotly library. Explore the documentation for more detailed usage instructions and parameters.

3.3 Creating Interactive Dashboards With Plotly Library
Interactive dashboards allow users to interactively manipulate data and view relevant insights. They require specialized software and expertise to design, develop, and deploy. Dash library allows developers to create reactive and responsive web applications in Python with ease. It uses JavaScript frameworks such as ReactJS and VueJS to render dynamic user interfaces. We can combine these libraries with plotly to build highly customizable and interactive dashboards.

Here's an example of a simple interactive dashboard using dash and plotly:

```python
app = dash.Dash(__name__) # initialize app

# load data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# define app layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    # dropdown menu for selecting data series
    dcc.Dropdown(
        id='series-dropdown',
        options=[{'label': col, 'value': col} for col in df.columns], 
        value=['Sales'],
        multi=True
    ),
    
    # select date range for filtering data
    html.Label(['Start Date:', dcc.DatePickerSingle(id='start-date')]),
    html.Label(['End Date:', dcc.DatePickerSingle(id='end-date')]),
    
    # plotly figure for plotting selected data series
    dcc.Graph(id='graph'),
    
    # callback function for updating figure
    dcc.Interval(
        id='interval-component',
        interval=1*1000, # in milliseconds
        n_intervals=0
    )
])

@app.callback(
    Output('graph', 'figure'), 
    Input('series-dropdown', 'value'), 
    State('start-date', 'date'), 
    State('end-date', 'date'))
def update_chart(selected_cols, start_date, end_date):
    filtered_df = df[(df['Date'] >= start_date) & (df['Date'] <= end_date)] if start_date else df
    fig = px.line(filtered_df[selected_cols], x='Date', y=selected_cols, markers=True)
    return fig

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True) # run app
```

This dashboard has three input components - dropdown menu for selecting data series, date picker inputs for selecting date range, and plotly figure for plotting selected data series. Whenever the user selects a new option from the dropdown menu or changes the date range, the plotly figure will automatically update. Callback function `update_chart()` takes care of this behavior. Finally, we call `run_server()` method to launch the dashboard.
