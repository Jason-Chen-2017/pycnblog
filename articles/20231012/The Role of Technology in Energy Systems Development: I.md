# 1.背景介绍


Energy systems development is one of the most complex, critical, and time-consuming aspects of a modern society. It involves designing, building, installing, testing, maintaining, and regulating energy systems to meet user demands with low costs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. To enable efficient and effective operation of energy systems, technology plays a significant role in many fields such as energy management, power generation, transportation, water supply, and waste management. However, little research has been conducted on how different technologies contribute towards meeting these goals or developing new technologies that can be used for energy systems development. In this paper, we propose an approach that addresses this gap by examining successful projects and transformative agendas involving various technologies used in energy systems development. We argue that there are several dimensions involved in technological development that can impact energy system performance and outcomes. 

To achieve this goal, we have selected six categories - mobility, distribution, storage, renewables, data analytics, and intelligent control/automation - based on their roles in improving energy efficiency and increasing life cycle costs respectively. We also examined the implementation status of each category over the years across various countries and regions to identify emerging trends in technology development.

Based on our analysis, we draw five key observations:

1. Mobility Technologies: Over the last decade, smart cars and bikes have significantly reduced fuel consumption through improved electricity management techniques like adaptive cruise control (ACC) and automated lane departure detection. Similarly, wireless charging infrastructure using micro-grids and electric vehicles has become more prevalent in urban areas due to cost reductions and convenience. These technologies offer promising benefits, but they need further research into how these devices can interact with other technologies within the same ecosystem to optimize energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

2. Distribution Technologies: Distributed solar photovoltaic (SPV), battery storage, and hydrogen production have all shown promise for addressing challenges associated with limited availability of high quality solar energy. Nevertheless, these technologies still face multiple technical hurdles before they can be widely deployed. Among them, current implementations often fail to efficiently convert clean energy into usable electricity or hydrogren, leading to congestions and wastage of resources. Additionally, distributed energy resource coordination using grid models is yet to be fully integrated into existing distribution networks and will require advanced modeling tools and network optimization algorithms to address scalability issues. Overall, it is essential to integrate new distribution technologies into power grids and coordinate them effectively for increased flexibility and reliability.

3. Storage Technologies: Storage technologies play a crucial role in mitigating electrical grid failures caused by blackouts and frequent power outages. Modern thermal and chemical storage technologies continue to improve efficiency and decrease energy costs, but integration between these technologies and traditional renewable sources remains incomplete. Examples include utilizing helium-based thermal storage for wind power production and reusing oil tankers for hydroelectricity generation. Moreover, integration of ultra-high temperature lithium metal batteries with other storage technologies to increase capacity and efficiency would help to address challenges associated with natural disasters and climate change.

4. Renewables Technologies: Renewables including solar, wind, and wave provide opportunities for significant cost reductions compared to fossil fuels, especially during off-peak times. They also bring about cleaner air, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and higher electricity prices. However, it is important to balance these benefits with environmental concerns, such as acid rain, ozone depletion, land use changes, pollution from heavy metals, noise pollution, and biomass burning. Currently, no single renewable technology dominates the market, which makes it difficult to make informed decision when investing in energy systems development.

5. Data Analytics Techniques: Electricity consumption data collection, processing, and analysis are critical components of any smart energy system. Many studies suggest that cloud computing platforms, machine learning algorithms, and big data analytics methods can enhance the accuracy and completeness of electricity usage information, thus enabling better prediction and control of electrical loads. However, long-term economic implications must be considered as some data analytics approaches may not be suitable for public utility deployment. Additionally, companies working in utilities have a responsibility to develop policies and practices related to data security, privacy, ethics, and governance to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and reliability. Therefore, collaboration between industry and government is needed to establish best practices and guidelines.

In summary, technological progress in energy systems development requires exploration of different dimensions such as mobility, distribution, storage, renewables, data analytics, and intelligent control/automation to create new innovations that can benefit both the consumers and businesses involved in the sector. We hope that our research will inspire future research and contribute to greater understanding of technology contributions towards achieving energy efficiency and ecological goals.
