# 1.背景介绍


Contextual Embeddings (CE) has emerged as a promising approach to achieve cross-modal knowledge transfer between vision and language understanding systems. In this article we will briefly describe the motivation behind CE, its core concepts and algorithms, practical implementation details, and unanswered questions that require further research efforts. We also hope to inspire developers to start exploring more advanced applications of contextual embeddings within their own projects. This is an open discussion space for any interested readers who are keen to learn about this new field of research!

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into our everyday life with applications such as assistants, autonomous vehicles, robotics, etc., understanding how AI systems can understand human languages and interact with computer graphics is becoming critical. Researchers have explored various methods to enable machines to process visual information by generating text descriptions or performing actions based on recognizing patterns from images. However, it is challenging to bridge the gap between these two modalities due to different forms of data and the lack of explicit common representations. To address this problem, various approaches have been proposed to use multimodal representation learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNN). These approaches learn shared representations across both the visual and linguistic inputs which are then fed into downstream tasks such as image caption generation, action recognition, etc. 

However, they typically do not combine multiple sources of information together effectively, resulting in suboptimal performance. As a result, most works fall short of achieving high accuracy while retaining enough interpretability to be useful. Therefore, there exists a need for joint modeling between visual features and language using more sophisticated models like multi-modal transformers. The authors of “Contextual Embeddings” propose a novel approach called Multi-Modal Contextual Attention Network (MMCAN), which uses separate encoders for each modality and learns complementary attention mechanisms for each pair of modalities to extract features that represent the input content better.

In summary, recent advances in contextual embeddings have demonstrated their effectiveness in cross-modal inference tasks where the input contains multiple modalities like images and texts. They provide a flexible solution to integrate visual and textual information, making them competitive with other multimodal deep learning techniques. However, there still remains significant challenges in optimally capturing complex relationships between modalities and leveraging learned features for efficient processing and reasoning over large amounts of data. Therefore, further research into optimization techniques and enhanced architectures are needed to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art approaches. Within this scope, we aim to create a vibrant community of researchers and practitioners to explore this exciting yet challenging topic and contribute towards building a more powerful and accurate AI system. 

2.核心概念与联系
Before delving deeper into the technical details of MMCAN model, let’s first define some important terms and concepts used in this work:

1. Modality: Modalities refer to distinct categories of sensory signals that feed into an AI system, including speech, vision, motion, touch, etc. For example, given an image, text and audio, we can think of all three as separate modalities because they capture different aspects of the same input data. Similarly, when dealing with medical imaging, we may consider X-rays, CT scans, and mammograms as three separate modalities since they each carry unique characteristics. When working with a task involving multiple modalities, we call it Multimodal Data (MDD).

2. Representation Learning: Representation learning refers to the process of mapping raw data points to low-dimensional vectors that encode meaningful features of the underlying data. For instance, when working with natural language processing (NLP), we map words, sentences, paragraphs, etc. to vectors representing semantic meaning that are used for sentiment analysis, question answering, entity linking, etc. Similarly, when working with visual data, CNNs or RNNs can be used to generate feature maps that preserve spatial structure and relevant features of the input data.

3. Cross-modal Retrieval: Cross-modal retrieval involves finding similar instances of one modality in relation to another. It allows us to identify relevant instances or regions of interest from one modality that match those present in another modality. One way to perform cross-modal retrieval is to retrieve k nearest neighbors (KNN) between corresponding pairs of visual and language features obtained through their respective encoders. Another popular method is to employ a similarity function based on cosine distance between feature vectors obtained from different modalities, followed by filtering out redundant results based on threshold values. While KNN or similarity functions only focus on matching individual examples, CMR takes into account the whole dataset and considers the relationship between instances.

4. Self-attention Mechanism: Self-attention mechanism captures the interplay between different parts of the input data and applies a weighted average of the inputs to obtain a unified representation. It is widely used in NLP and machine translation domains. MMCan employs self-attention mechanisms at multiple levels, ranging from global to local level, to capture the interactions between the modalities better. Specifically, MCCAN consists of four types of attention modules - content-based, location-based, cross-modality attention, and layer-wise interaction attention, to attend to different parts of the input at each stage of decoding. 

5. Interaction Module: Interaction module aims to build a holistic representation of the entire input by combining the outputs of different attention layers. Each type of attention generates a set of output vectors that interact among themselves to form the final output vector. A fusion strategy such as concatenation is applied to merge these outputs before passing it to the next layer of decoder. Finally, an optional fully connected network can be added to project the output vector to appropriate dimensions depending on the application.

6. Mixed-modal Transformer Decoder: An encoder-decoder architecture incorporates parallel branches for encoding and decoding. It processes different modalities independently but fuses their representations before being passed onto the subsequent stages of decoding. Mixed-modal transformer architecture is commonly used for solving problems involving multiple modalities. Mixed-modal transformer decoders share components such as embedding layers, position encoding, and hidden states between different modality-specific heads to optimize training speed and memory usage.

7. Task-Specific Fusion Strategy: In multi-task learning, we train the model on multiple related tasks simultaneously using a single model. In contrast to cross-modal retrieval where we want to find similar items based on their feature representations, task-specific fusion strategies focus on identifying specific objectives that should be fulfilled during training. A common strategy is to concatenate multiple targets associated with each modality to improve generalization capability of the model.

We now move on to discuss the main contribution of MCCAN and explain its key ideas.

The Key Idea(s):
1. Enhance cross-modality interactions by introducing additional attention mechanisms.
2. Employ a mixed-modal transformer decoder to handle multiple modalities separately.
3. Improve computational efficiency by sharing weights between modalities and enabling parameter sharing within the decoder.
