1、Introduction to Time Series Forecasting

   Time series forecasting is the process of predicting future values based on past observed values. It is an essential part of many applications in various industrors such as finance, energy, transportation, retail industry, healthcare, e-commerce, etc., where a precise estimation of trends and patterns can help businesses make better decisions or optimize their operationss. 

   The concept of time series is closely tied with regression analysis because both of these fields deal with relationships between variables over time. In the context of time series forecasting, we assume that there exists a pattern in the historical data and try to predict the future outcome based on what has happened before. 

   There are two main types of time series data: univariate and multivariate. Univariate time series contain one variable while multivariate time series contain multiple variables that depend on each other. Each observation of a time series data consists of a timestamp followed by a set of features or measurements taken at that point in time. 

   There are several strategies for analyzing time series data depending on the type and size of dataset being analyzed. Some popular statistical methods used for time series analysis include auto-correlation functions (ACF), partial autocorrelation functions (PACF), moving averages, exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA), seasonal decomposition, lagged correlation analysis, and linear regression analysis. 

2、Key Terminology

   Before delving deeper into technical details, let's first define some core terms:

   1. Level/Trend Component: This refers to the overall increasing or decreasing slope of the time series data. It represents the long-term direction of the time series.
   2. Cycle Component: This component captures any cyclical behavior present in the time series data. It helps explain the oscillatory nature of the time series data. 
   3. Seasonality Component: This component accounts for any variations in the data across seasons or periods of time. For example, daily data might exhibit seasonal fluctuations due to changes in weather conditions.
   4. Noise Component: Anything outside of the above components is considered noise. It reflects measurement errors, structural breaks, non-linear effects, etc.

   Once you have a rough idea about what components make up the level, trend, cycle, seasonality, and noise parts of the time series data, let's go deeper into mathematical details:

    1. Level component – This is simply the mean value of the entire time series data over time.
    2. Trend component – This describes the increasing or decreasing slope of the data over time. 
    3. Cycle component – This captures any periodic oscillations in the data over time.
    4. Seasonality component – This accounts for any variations in the data across seasons or periods of time.
    5. Noise component – This includes anything outside of the above four components, which may represent measurement errors, structural breaks, non-linear effects, etc.

   Let's say we have a time series y(t), consisting of observations at times t=0, …, n-1, where n is the total number of observations. The levels, trends, cycles, and seasonalities of the series can be calculated as follows:

     1. Level = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y_i
     2. Trend = \beta_0 + \beta_1\times\left(\frac{t_i}{max\{t_i\}}\right)+\epsilon,\quad \epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma_\epsilon^2)\text{(slope of the line)}
     3. Cycle = \alpha_0+\alpha_1 cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\times \frac{t_i}{max\{t_i\}}+ \phi\right) +\epsilon,\quad \epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma_\epsilon^2)\text{(amplitude of the waveform)}
     4. Seasonality = \gamma_0+\gamma_1 sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{T_m}\times\frac{t_i}{max\{t_i\}}\right) +\epsilon,\quad \epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma_\epsilon^2)\text{(frequency of the waves)}
     
   Where $\beta_0$ is the intercept term, $\beta_1$ is the gradient term, $t_i$ is the index of the observation, $T$ is the periodicity of the cyclical component, $T_m$ is the length of the seasonal cycle, $\alpha_0$, $\alpha_1$, and $\phi$ are the amplitude, frequency, and phase parameters of the cyclical component, and $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ are the amplitude and frequency terms of the seasonal component. The subscript i denotes individual observations and the superscript max{} indicates taking the maximum of all timestamps as the denominator for calculating the normalized time.

   To calculate the predicted values of the time series, we need to estimate the coefficients of the level, trend, cycle, and seasonality components based on the available training data, and then plug those estimates back into our formula for each prediction point. 

   However, since there are several different methods available for time series forecasting, we won't go into depth regarding each method in detail. Instead, we'll highlight the salient points of each approach along with a brief explanation of its strengths and weaknesses.
