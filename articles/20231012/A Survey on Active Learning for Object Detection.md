# 1.背景介绍


With the development of deep learning and object detection techniques, a lot of works have been done in this field. However, as with other complex fields such as natural language processing (NLP), machine translation (MT) or speech recognition (SR), active learning has always played an important role in improving performance of models. 

Active learning is a type of machine learning where human annotators are involved to help select informative examples that can be used to train machines more effectively. In object detection, there exist several active learning methods such as self-training, query-by-committee, margin sampling, discriminative instance selection, etc., which are widely applied in practice.

In recent years, researchers have proposed various variants of active learning algorithms for object detection tasks, including prototype selection based active learning, multi-task labeling based active learning, etc. In this survey paper, we will briefly discuss some prominent approaches that have achieved impressive results in different domains like image classification, natural language processing, and medical imaging analysis. The goal of our review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of active learning for object detection, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach and providing insights into future directions for improvement.

## 2.1 Active Learning（主动学习）
Active learning is a type of machine learning where human annotators are involved to help select informative examples that can be used to train machines more effectively. The main objective behind active learning is to enable machines to learn from limited annotated data by continually asking for annotations until a good model is learned. 

The most common ways of implementing active learning include:

1. Random sampling：Randomly selecting unlabeled samples from the dataset for annotation.

2. Query-by-committee：Selecting instances using committee-based aggregation strategies such as Majority Vote (MV), Bayesian Committee Machine (BCM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), etc.

3. Uncertainty Sampling：Using uncertainty measures to guide the annotation process. For example, high confidence predictions are selected first while uncertain ones are prioritized. 

4. Margin Sampling：This algorithm finds the instances that are farthest away from decision boundaries predicted by the model. These instances are then labeled according to their relevance to the task at hand. 

5. Discriminative Instance Selection：This method selects instances based on how well they separate different classes of objects. This idea was popularized by Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA). 

6. Cost-sensitive Learning：Cost-sensitive algorithms assign higher importance to certain categories of misclassifications compared to others. This makes it easier to overcome biases towards certain classes during training. 


## 2.2 Self-Training（自我训练）
Self-training is an active learning technique where the training set is augmented with new labels generated by querying the classifier for its prediction on previously unseen images. This strategy requires minimal manual intervention but may not always lead to better generalization performance than fully supervised training when the size of the labeled dataset is small or insufficient. 

Some key aspects of self-training include:

1. Easy implementation: Self-training can be implemented without relying on any additional resources beyond the labeled dataset itself, making it feasible even for small datasets. 

2. Efficient use of compute resources: Even though requiring further computation than traditional active learning methods, self-training allows us to leverage large computational resources to accelerate training speed and improve model performance. 

3. Flexible adaptation: As opposed to many active learning methods that require predetermined budgets or preselected strategies, self-training provides more flexibility to adjust the amount of added annotations per iteration or the specific class being queried depending on the current state of the model. 

## 2.3 Prototype Selection Based Active Learning (PSAAL)
Prototype selection based active learning (PSAAL) is a variation of the self-training technique where a fixed number of prototypes (representative examples) are randomly sampled from the labeled dataset and used to generate new pseudo-labels. These prototypes are defined based on visual features rather than pixel values, allowing PSAAL to handle varying illumination conditions and deformations better than standard self-training. 

One way to implement PSAAL involves the following steps:

1. Sample prototypes randomly from the labeled dataset. 
2. Use these prototypes to create new pseudo-labels for the remaining unlabeled samples. 
3. Train a binary classifier on these new pseudo-labels to distinguish between similar instances.
4. Update the original labeled dataset by adding the newly obtained labels if they meet a threshold of accuracy. 
Finally, repeat step 3 and 4 until convergence. 

To mitigate the effect of noise introduced by the random sampling of prototypes, one possibility is to also apply some sort of regularization to the classifier, e.g., L2 regularization or dropout layers, before updating the labeled dataset. Additionally, another option is to increase the diversity of the prototypes through k-means clustering, which helps avoid overfitting and achieve better generalization performance.  

## 2.4 Multi-Task Labeling Based Active Learning (MTLBA)
Multi-task labeling based active learning (MTLBA) is a hybrid active learning framework combining multiple active learning tasks together. It uses domain-specific classifiers trained independently for different tasks, where each task focuses on a particular aspect of the problem space. Each task receives a subset of labeled data from the entire pool of available data, so that all tasks contribute equally to the final solution. 

To implement MTLBA, follow the following steps:

1. Define a list of individual active learning problems, i.e., tasks, that need to be solved jointly.
2. Preprocess the labeled data for each task by applying appropriate transformations and filtering out irrelevant information.
3. Initialize empty label pools for each task.
4. Select a batch of unlabeled data and use a meta-learner to combine the outputs of the individual learners to make a final decision on whether to annotate the sample or leave it unlabelled. 
5. Depending on the outcome of the decision, add the corresponding labels to the respective label pools.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.

In order to balance the contributions of each task, we can either weight them differently or give equal weight to all tasks. Also, since each task operates on independent subsets of the labeled data, the overlap among them can be minimized and encouraged. Finally, MTLBA may require specialized hyperparameters tailored to each individual task, which can become cumbersome to tune manually.  

## 2.5 Transfer Learning based Active Learning
Transfer learning is a powerful technique that enables a model to reuse knowledge learned on a related task to perform well on a target task. One potential application of transfer learning in active learning is to incorporate prior knowledge about what sorts of examples might be helpful for solving a particular task, thus enabling us to focus on those regions of the feature space that contain relevant information for solving the task at hand. 

One possible way to implement transfer learning in active learning is as follows:

1. Divide the dataset into two parts: a source domain D_S containing the labeled data that contains useful information, and a target domain D_T containing the unlabeled data that needs to be explored. 
2. Apply suitable pre-processing steps to both domains, such as normalization, resizing, and data augmentation. 
3. Train a model F_D on D_S using standard supervised learning techniques. 
4. Freeze the weights of the network except for the last layer(s) and replace them with new weights initialized with the weights of the trained model F_D, thus obtaining a frozen feature extractor. 
5. Add a few extra layers to the top of the feature extractor to form a new predictor G. 
6. Train G on D_T by optimizing the cross entropy loss between the predictions made by G and the true labels associated with the samples. 
7. During inference time, feed a test sample x into the feature extractor F_x and pass it through the fine-tuned predictor G to obtain a predicted label y. 
8. Use the predicted label y instead of the ground truth l to update the distribution over the source domain D_S and recompute the corresponding probabilities p_{F|S}(y|l). 
9. Repeat steps 7-8 until convergence. 

One advantage of transfer learning is that it can help to alleviate the issue of memorization bias, i.e., the tendency of a model to remember patterns learned from the training set rather than generalizing them to new inputs. Another benefit is that it may allow us to scale up the problem to larger domains where previous models may not have performed well due to lack of sufficient labeled data.
