# 1.背景介绍


Large-scale multilingual machine translation (LMMT) systems typically consist of a sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model with attention mechanisms and multi-lingual embeddings as the encoder and decoder modules. However, translating between different languages can lead to many ambiguities that must be addressed in order to produce accurate translations. One way to handle these issues is through phrase-based or alignment-based approaches which identify the most relevant phrases from both source and target language documents and use them as input to the LM system. 

The problem with these phrase-based and alignment-based methods is that they require human intervention and may not always work well due to variations in word choice and syntax between languages. Therefore, researchers have been looking for better solutions that are capable of automatically extracting and aligning high-quality phrases across languages without relying on manual annotation. The need for such techniques has motivated us to explore new algorithms that can learn representations for individual words in multiple languages simultaneously. In this paper we present our approach called Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings (XLWE), which generates cross-lingual embeddings for each word in a given sentence using a shared contextual embedding layer. These embeddings capture both morphological and syntactic information about words and enable more robust translations than other phrase based or alignment-based methods when applied over large corpora. We evaluate XLWE on two tasks: cross-lingual sentiment analysis and cross-lingual named entity recognition. Our experiments show that XLWE significantly improves performance over strong baselines on all datasets, including non-English ones. Additionally, we demonstrate how XLWE can effectively combine with conventional seq2seq models while still achieving significant improvements. Overall, this work provides a novel technique for improving multilingual machine translation and demonstrates its effectiveness on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. 

2.Core Concepts & Connections
We begin by providing an overview of the core concepts and connections involved in XLWE. The figure below shows the main components of XLWE architecture.





1. Source Language Input Sentence: This represents the original English sentence being translated into another language.

2. Target Language Output Sentence: This is the expected output after translation.

3. Common Context Layer: This module captures the global information about the entire source sentence, independent of any specific position within it. It takes in both source and target sentences at once and outputs a common hidden representation that is used by downstream layers.

4. Word Embedding Module: This module converts each word in the source sentence into a dense vector representation using pre-trained fastText embeddings. Each word is also associated with its corresponding subword units, if applicable, in the target language.

5. Shared Encoder Decoder Layers: Using these representations, we train a standard Seq2Seq model with attention mechanism using backpropagation through time (BPTT).

6. Loss Function and Optimizer: Finally, we calculate the loss function and apply gradient descent optimizer during training. During evaluation, we simply use the trained model to translate new sentences.


3.Core Algorithm Principles and Details
In this section, we provide details of the key principles and insights behind the XLWE algorithm. Here are some important points to keep in mind:

1. Aligned Phrases: To ensure that similar phrases are aligned, we leverage existing parallel corpora for each pair of languages. By matching words and phrases between the two languages, we ensure that the extracted features correspond to their correct positions in both source and target sentences.

2. Unsupervised Features: Since there is no gold label data available, we rely heavily on unsupervised learning techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction to extract meaningful features from the parallel corpus. Specifically, we represent each word in the source sentence using its aggregated contextual embedding learned by a shared contextual layer followed by a linear transformation. Similarly, we represent each word in the target sentence by aggregating its constituent subword units if necessary.

3. Cross-Lingual Representations: Once the feature extraction process is complete, we can proceed to generate cross-lingual embeddings for each word in the given sentence. We first concatenate the source and target embeddings alongside the shared contextual embeddings before applying final transformations. This ensures that the generated embeddings capture both language-specific and linguistic information about words and help improve accuracy.

4. Effective Combination: As mentioned earlier, XLWE allows us to integrate with traditional seq2seq models and achieve significant improvements over strong baseline models even when only few additional parameters are added. At inference time, we can pass a combined set of source and target word embeddings to the seq2seq model to get better results. We further discuss this aspect in detail later in Section 6.

For example, let's consider the following hypothesis: "While spending time at home helps you relax and feel better, traveling abroad can offer a unique perspective." To find the relationship between these two statements in Chinese and English, we might follow these steps:

1. Extract Parallel Corpus Data: We would collect bilingual text data sets for Chinese and English from various sources, such as web crawlers and publicly available resources. Then we manually align the same terms and phrases to create parallel corpora. For instance, we could count the frequency of each word or n-gram pattern in both languages and match up those that occur frequently.

2. Feature Extraction: Based on the parallel corpus data, we extract unsupervised features such as word frequencies and contextual embeddings for each word in both languages. For Chinese, we could cluster similar characters together to obtain word embeddings and aggregate their vectors. For English, we could apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the word embeddings obtained from FastText embeddings.

3. Generate Cross-Lingual Embeddings: Next, we compute the cross-lingual embeddings for each word in the hypothesis statement by concatenating the source and target embeddings alongside the shared contextual embeddings. We then transform the resulting vector using a linear projection matrix to obtain the desired dimensionality for the LSTM model.

4. Train/Evaluate Model: Finally, we can feed the resulting tensor of embeddings to an LSTM-based machine translation model and train/evaluate it using the standard BPTT optimization methodology. While performing inference, we can pass a concatenation of the source and target embeddings to the model and expect improved performance compared to baseline models. 


4.Experimental Results and Analysis
Now, let's move on to discuss the experimental results and analyze the effectiveness of XLWE on several NLP tasks. Let’s start by comparing the performance of XLWE with strong baselines on three tasks: cross-lingual sentiment analysis, cross-lingual named entity recognition, and machine translation.
