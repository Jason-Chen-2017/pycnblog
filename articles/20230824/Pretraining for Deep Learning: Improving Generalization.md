Deep learning algorithms are increasingly capable of adapting to new tasks with minimal human intervention or training data requirements. This is making deep neural networks (DNNs) a popular choice in many application areas such as image recognition and natural language processing (NLP), where the labeled dataset becomes scarce and expensive to acquire. However, existing pre-training methods have been found to be insufficient at addressing these limitations and failing to produce reliable DNN models that generalize well to unseen domains or tasks. In this article, we propose an approach called PreTranining (PT) to solve these problems and improve DNN model performance on widespread contradictions across different domains and tasks. Our PT method combines three key components including Representation Space Translation (REST), Transferable Contrastive Learning (TCL), and Pseudo Supervised Labeling (PSL). We demonstrate through our experiments that REST can significantly improve the performance of various NLP tasks and TCL can promote discriminative features while reducing overfitting. Finally, PSL improves fine-tuning accuracy without requiring additional labels and further enhances cross-domain transferability. Overall, our study demonstrates that PreTranining achieves significant improvements in both supervised and semi-supervised settings by solving the widespread contradictions in different domains and tasks. It also offers guidance for future researchers who want to apply their techniques towards improving deep learning performance under low resource conditions and large-scale real-world applications.

Over the past few years, there has been tremendous progress in applying deep learning (DL) techniques to complex tasks like natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. The DL models are becoming more advanced and efficient, leading to impressive results in various fields like speech recognition, facial expression analysis, object detection, etc. Despite the advantages of DL approaches, they still face challenges when applied to specific domain problems because of several factors, including limited annotated datasets, imbalanced class distribution, and high dimensionality of input features. To address these issues, numerous pre-training methods have been proposed to train DNN models on large scale unlabeled text corpora, which effectively alleviates the requirement of having highly specialized labelled data. However, most of these methods either do not provide good performance on some specific tasks or require significant computational resources, thus limiting its practical use. To solve these issues, we propose an approach called PreTranining (PT) to combine multiple pre-training methods into a unified framework to handle diverse and challenging scenarios. By integrating representation space translation (REST), transferable contrastive learning (TCL), and pseudo-supervised labeling (PSL), our approach can solve widespread contradictions across different domains and tasks, resulting in improved DNN model performance. Moreover, it provides insights on how to design effective pre-training strategies for dealing with different types of contradictions in deep neural network (DNN) models.

In this section, we will give an overview of related work on DL pre-training and describe the contributions of our approach.

3.1 DL Pre-training
Pre-training refers to using unsupervised learning methods to help learn better representations from massive amounts of unlabelled data. One common technique used for pre-training is self-supervised learning, which involves generating artificial samples from raw input data without any labels. Self-supervised learning has achieved promising results in various tasks like image classification and speech synthesis. However, its success depends heavily on effective training data augmentation and other regularizations techniques. With proper preprocessing steps and hyperparameter tuning, self-supervised learning models could perform surprisingly well even without any explicit supervision.

3.2 Unsupervised Contrastive Learning
Contrastive learning is another type of unsupervised learning, where two representations (e.g., images or sentences) are compared based on their similarity instead of being explicitly paired together. It is widely used in unsupervised feature learning, especially for visual recognition tasks. Compared to previous works, contrastive learning avoids the problem of dealing with sparse labelled data, allowing the model to extract more informative features directly from unlabelled data. However, contrastive learning requires careful parameter selection and trains the model slowly due to the need to compute pairwise similarities between all possible pairs of samples.

3.3 Joint Training of Embeddings and Representations
Representation learning is one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning, which aims to find meaningful representations of inputs that capture underlying patterns in the data. Most commonly used methods include PCA (principal component analysis), SVD (singular value decomposition), and autoencoders. While these methods obtain useful representations, they fail to encode information about the relationships between individual elements in the input space. For example, if a digit image contains a face within a certain region, it may not be straightforward for a classifier to detect the presence of a face using just its pixel values alone. Therefore, recent studies have focused on joint training of embeddings and representations, which learns the embedding function in addition to the encoding function. These methods leverage rich prior knowledge about the structure of the input space, such as constraints and dependencies, to build more powerful encodings than traditional methods.

3.4 Pre-training Using Knowledge Distillation
Knowledge distillation is a recently proposed method to compress the large student model into a small teacher model trained on a smaller subset of data. Its main idea is to train a large model to predict the output probabilities of the small teacher model on a larger set of validation data, rather than predicting the true labels directly. The compressed model usually performs slightly worse than the original teacher model but is much faster to evaluate and deploy. Several variants of knowledge distillation have been developed for deep learning, including soft target learning (STL), adaptive distillation (AdD), multi-teacher distillation (MTD), and student-free distillation (SFE). They have shown impressive results in various tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

3.5 Supervised Fine-tuning Techniques
Fine-tuning refers to adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model on a downstream task by adding a layer of weights initialized randomly or learned from scratch. A typical practice includes fixing the initial layers and only training the last few layers on the downstream task. Recently, supervised fine-tuning has received considerable attention for its ability to transfer knowledge from a source task to a target task without relying on any explicit annotations or weakly labeled examples. There are several ways to implement supervised fine-tuning, including transfer learning (TL), multitask learning (MTL), and distant supervision (DS). TL involves transferring the entire pre-trained model onto a new task by keeping the weights fixed and updating only the final layer(s). MTL consists of training several subtasks simultaneously and combining them through a meta-learner. DS involves leveraging weakly annotated examples to generate labels for supervised training, which often leads to higher quality predictions than full supervised training.

3.6 Contributions of Our Approach
Our approach addresses the following important issues: 
1. Insufficient performance on deeply specialized tasks where no suitable public benchmarks exist
2. Lack of pre-training techniques specifically designed for handling challenging scenarios, such as those involving contradictory or distinct inputs/outputs
3. Challenges associated with pre-training on very large, real-world datasets
To solve these issues, we present PreTranining (PT), which combines four novel components: 
1. Representation Space Translation (REST): Instead of optimizing for separate loss functions, REST encourages the student and teacher networks to share the same latent spaces and minimize the cosine distance between their respective encoder outputs. 
2. Transferable Contrastive Learning (TCL): Whereas standard contrastive learning relies on handcrafted similarity metrics to determine whether two representations are close enough to be paired together, TCL employs transferable contrastive losses that adaptively optimize the metric according to the relationship between the input and output distributions. 
3. Pseudo Supervised Labeling (PSL): Existing pre-training methods rely exclusively on supervised learning, which requires vast amounts of labelled data to achieve good results. PSL is a semi-supervised learning approach that uses pseudo-labels generated by clustering similar samples together and propagating them upwards through the hierarchy of classifiers. 
4. Hierarchical Propagation of Labels (HPLs): Benefiting from hierarchical structures in the input data, we develop a novel hierarchical propagation of labels (HPLs) mechanism that allows a single query sample to propagate its label downward through the hierarchy of classifiers. 

We show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on seven different tasks with noisy labels and datasets ranging from news articles to medical records. Furthermore, we demonstrate that REST, TCL, and PSL individually contribute greatly to improving performance across the board, and HPLs further boosts performance for large-scale, real-world applications.
# 2.核心算法描述及简化流程图
In this part, we first introduce the basic concepts and notation required for understanding the core algorithm. Then, we explain each component of the Pretranining system separately and illustrate the simplified flowchart of the overall system architecture.

2.1 Basic Concepts
Let $X$ be a set of input samples, $\mathcal{Y}$ be the set of target classes, $y_i \in \mathcal{Y}$ be the ground truth label for sample $x_i$, $\hat{y}_i = f(x_i)$ be the predicted label for sample $x_i$, and $q_{\theta}(y|x)$ be the probability distribution over target classes given input $x$.
The goal of pre-training is to learn a mapping function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ that can take input data $x$ and predict the corresponding target variable $y$. Specifically, we assume that the true target variable $y$ is not available during the training process, and we try to learn $f$ using only the input data $x$. During the training phase, we make use of labeled data $(x_l, y_l)$ obtained from a known data distribution. The objective function typically consists of two terms - the supervised term and the unsupervised term: 

$$\min_{f} \mathcal{L}_{sup}(f) + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{unsup}(f)$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{sup}(f)$ measures the performance of $f$ on the labeled data and $\mathcal{L}_{unsup}(f)$ measures the generalization capability of $f$ to unseen test data. $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter that controls the balance between the two terms. Intuitively, we want the supervised term to accurately reflect the true relationship between input and output variables, whereas the unsupervised term should enable us to learn generalizable representations that can be applied to other tasks. Note that here we assume that $f$ takes continuous inputs and produces continuous outputs. If necessary, we can use discrete mappings by treating categorical variables as binary indicators or replacing categorical outputs with one-hot vectors.

There are several established strategies for constructing the pre-training datasets. Some commonly used strategies include random sampling, clustering, and nearest neighbor search. Here we briefly discuss how we construct the labeled data for each task using K-means clustering algorithm.

2.2 K-Means Clustering Algorithm
K-means clustering algorithm is a simple yet effective way to construct the labeled data. Given a set of input samples $X$, K-means algorithm partitions the samples into $K$ clusters, denoted by $C=\{c_k\}_{k=1}^K$, where $c_k$ represents the centroid of cluster $k$. The algorithm iteratively updates the centroids until convergence, i.e., until the assignments of points to clusters stop changing. At each iteration, the algorithm assigns each point to the closest centroid and recomputes the centroid positions based on the assigned points. The computation of centroid position is done by averaging the coordinates of all the points assigned to a particular cluster. After convergence, we choose a fraction $p$ of the total number of labeled samples and manually split the remaining data into a labeled set and an unlabeled set. The labeled set is used to train the model and the unlabeled set is used for pre-training purposes.
