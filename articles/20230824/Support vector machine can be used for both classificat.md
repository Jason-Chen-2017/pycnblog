# 1.简介
  
：Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with applications in pattern recognition, image processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing. They work by finding a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in high-dimensional space that best separate the data into different classes. SVMs have several advantages over other classification methods: 

1. Higher accuracy

2. Better interpretability

3. Flexibility in handling complex datasets and non-linear relationships

4. Robustness against noisy training data

5. Scalability

6. Efficiency in large datasets

In this article, we will discuss how SVM works specifically for binary classification problems and show you how they can be applied for both classification and regression tasks. 

Let's begin!

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled examples, which contain input variables (also known as features or predictors) and their corresponding output variable. During the training process, the model learns to map inputs to outputs based on the provided training data. Once trained, the model can make predictions on new, unseen data based on its learned patterns. 

The goal of supervised learning is to build an accurate model that generalizes well to new, unseen data. There are three main types of supervised learning algorithms:

1. Classification - Predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

2. Regression - Predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., sales price).

3. Clustering - Grouping similar data instances together without any prior knowledge of what groupings exist.


## Binary Classification
Binary classification refers to a task in supervised learning where there are only two possible outcomes for each example, such as “spam” or "not spam". It involves classifying the examples into one of these categories.

To perform binary classification using SVM, we need to use a **linear** kernel function. Linear kernels involve mapping the original feature space directly to the target space via a linear transformation. This means that the algorithm finds a line that separates the positive and negative samples in the feature space. Mathematically, the equation for a hyperplane separating the positive and negative samples is given by:

$$w^T x + b = 0 \text{ if } y = 1 $$

where $w$ is the normal vector to the hyperplane, $x$ is a sample from the dataset, $y$ is either $+1$ (positive class) or $-1$ (negative class), and $b$ is the bias term. 

This formulation assumes that all the features are linearly independent and satisfy some conditions. However, in practice, nonlinear transformations may still work reasonably well depending on the structure of the data and the problem at hand. Nonlinear transformations can also capture complex relationships within the data, making it easier to find non-linear boundaries in the feature space.

Once we choose our kernel function and train the SVM model, the algorithm scans through every sample in the training set, computing the distance from the hyperplane. Based on the sign of this distance, it assigns a label (+1 or -1) to each sample. We can adjust the threshold value ($\rho$) used for deciding whether a sample belongs to the positive or negative class, so that the balance between false positives and false negatives is balanced appropriately.

We can evaluate the performance of a classifier by measuring its ability to correctly classify samples belonging to each class. One common metric is called precision and recall. Precision measures the fraction of true positive results returned by the classifier, while recall measures the fraction of actual positives found by the classifier. Intuitively, precision tells us how confident the classifier is in its predictions, while recall tells us how complete the list of relevant items was retrieved. F1 score combines these two metrics into a single measure of performance. 

Here are some guidelines for evaluating binary classifiers:

1. Accuracy - Measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction (i.e., correctly identifies both positive and negative cases). Commonly used as a baseline comparison against other metrics.

2. Area under curve (AUC) - Calculates the probability that a randomly chosen positive instance receives a higher predicted probability than a randomly chosen negative instance. A perfect classifier would have an AUC equal to 1. Can help identify the most informative features and discriminate between important groups of rare events.

3. Confusion matrix - Displays the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives resulting from a test run of the classifier on a holdout set. Provides a clear picture of how well the classifier is performing across all classes.

4. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve - Drawn from the true positive rate versus false positive rate, plots the tradeoff between sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (false positive rate) for different decision thresholds. The ideal classifier lies somewhere on the ROC curve, which represents the minimum distance from the diagonal line representing random guessing. Can help optimize the choice of the appropriate decision threshold for a particular application scenario.

## SVM Parameters
There are many parameters involved in training an SVM model, but here are some commonly used ones:

1. C - Regularization parameter that controls the tradeoff between misclassification errors and fitting the training data. A small C value causes strong regularization, while a large C value performs L2 regularization, leading to sparsity in the solution.

2. Kernel Function - Determines the shape of the decision boundary and is usually chosen automatically by the algorithm during training. Three popular options include:

   * Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) - A widely used kernel function that maps the input data into a high dimensional space by applying a radial basis function (RBF) transform to the dot product of the input and weight vectors. This allows for smooth non-linear separation between classes.
   
   * Polynomial - Maps the input data into an infinite dimension by taking polynomial powers of the input and then projecting back onto a finite subspace using the weights. Allows for flexible separation of complex data sets.
   
     PolyKernel(x,y)=(gamma*x'*y'+coef0)^degree
     
   * Sigmoidal - Maps the input data into a high dimensional space by squashing it with the sigmoid function before projection back onto a finite subspace using the weights. Performs better than the polynomial kernel in situations where there is a mix of continuous and discrete attributes. 
   
     SigmoidKernel(x,y)=tanh(gamma*(x'*y'+coef0))
    
    Note: Tanh is defined as follows:

    tanh(z) = { sinh(z) } / { cosh(z) }
              = { e^{z} - e^{-z} } / { e^{z} + e^{-z} }

Other important parameters include gamma, coef0, degree, and epsilon, which control the complexity of the kernel function and allow for additional flexibility in the decision boundary. Each combination of these values has its own unique properties and requires experimentation to determine the optimal configuration for a given dataset.
