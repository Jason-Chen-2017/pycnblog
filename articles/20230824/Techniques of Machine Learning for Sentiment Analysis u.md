Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of text expresses positive or negative sentiment based on its tone and content. It’s used in various applications such as social media monitoring, market research, customer feedback analysis, brand reputation management, news article analysis, product review analysis etc. The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine how people feel about different topics or products based on their reviews, opinions, comments, tweets etc. 

In this article, we will learn seven techniques of machine learning for sentiment analysis using Python programming language along with code examples. These techniques include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Ensemble Methods. We will use these techniques to analyze movie reviews dataset from IMDb website.


# 2.前提条件
Before starting our tutorial, let's make sure that you have following requirements installed on your system:

1. Python Programming Language - You can download it from here if not already installed on your system. 

2. Scikit-learn library - This is a powerful and useful python library which provides efficient implementations of many popular machine learning algorithms. You can install it by typing `pip install scikit-learn` command in terminal/command prompt.

3. NLTK Library - Natural Language Toolkit is another essential library required for performing natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization etc. You can install it by typing `pip install nltk` command in terminal/command prompt.

4. Movie Reviews Dataset from IMDb Website - You need to get access to this dataset before proceeding further. If you don't have an account there, create one first. Once logged in click on "Download" button next to "Latest Release". Extract all files in any directory.

5. Jupyter Notebook - Not mandatory but highly recommended as most of the data preprocessing and visualization steps require working with multiple datasets simultaneously within a single notebook. Install Anaconda distribution from official site and launch Jupyter notebook application.

Once above pre-requisites are met, we can start writing our tutorial. Let's dive into each technique step by step.

# 3.数据集简介
The IMDb movie reviews dataset consists of user reviews of movies released between 1995 to present day. Each review includes the title, year of release, genre, rating, review text, and other metadata. There are total of 50,000 movie reviews in this dataset, ranging from mostly positive to mostly negative.

Let's explore the structure of this dataset using pandas library in Python. Firstly, import the necessary libraries and load the CSV file containing movie review data into a DataFrame object. Then, display few rows of data using head() method. Finally, print some basic information about the dataset using info() method. Here's the complete code:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('movie_reviews.csv')

print(data.head()) # displays top five rows

print(data.info()) # prints general information about the dataframe
```

Output:

```python

# 4.Naive Bayes
The Naïve Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic approach for classification problems. It assumes that all features are independent of each other given the class variable and calculates the probability of each feature being present or absent. Given a new input, the model assigns it to the class for which the posterior probability is highest. Mathematically, naïve Bayes classifier is represented by the formula below:

	P(C|X) = P(X|C)*P(C)/P(X)
	
Here X represents the set of attributes for the instance and C represents the class label. P(C) is the prior probability of the class, P(X) is the marginal likelihood of the attribute values given the presence or absence of classes, while P(X|C) is the conditional likelihood of the attributes given the specific class. 

We can implement the Naïve Bayes algorithm in Python using scikit-learn library. The first step is to split the dataset into training and testing sets. Then, train the Gaussian Naïve Bayes model using fit() function. Next, predict the output for test set instances using predict() function. Calculate accuracy score using metrics module.
