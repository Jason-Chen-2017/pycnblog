Dynamic programming (DP) is a powerful technique used in various fields such as computer science, mathematics, finance and economics to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems and solving those one at a time until the final solution can be obtained. In this article we will talk about dynamic programming techniques and how they are applied for some common examples using Python programming language. 

In DP, the state of the problem is represented by variables that change according to an input, usually called "dp". We define a function f(i), where i represents the index of the current element or variable, which determines its value based on previous states. The goal of DP algorithms is to find the optimal solution that maximizes/minimizes the objective function f() while keeping track of all intermediate solutions during the computation process.

Let's start with some basic definitions:

1. Subset sum problem: Given a set S={1, 2,..., n} and a target number t, determine if there exists a subset whose sum equals to t.
2. Optimal subset sum problem: Find the maximum possible sum that can be obtained from any subset of a given set {1, 2,..., n}. 
3. Coin Change Problem: Determine the minimum number of coins required to make up a given amount of money.
4. Knapsack problem: Given two integer arrays val[] and wt[], where each val[i] denotes the value of item i and wt[i] denotes its weight, determine the maximum total value that can be carried in a knapsack having capacity W.

Let's now look at the core concepts and apply these techniques to the above mentioned problems step by step. We will use Python to implement the code. Before starting, let's import necessary libraries.

```python
import numpy as np

def print_arr(arr):
    """Printing the array."""
    for row in arr:
        print(" ".join([str(num).center(5," ") for num in row]))
        
```
The `print_arr()` function prints the matrix easily with centered columns. Now let's get started!<|im_sep|>
2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
A simple approach to solve a dynamic programming problem is to divide it into smaller parts and recursively compute their optimal values until the entire problem has been solved. To do so, we need to keep track of different solutions during the recursive computations and then combine them to obtain the overall optimal solution. Here are some fundamental terms you should know before diving deeper:

1. State Variables: A list of variables that represent the state of the system at every point in time. Each variable can have multiple dimensions depending on the size of the problem. For example, in the coin change problem, we might want to maintain both the remaining amount and the number of coins needed separately for each coin type. 

2. Decision Variables: These are variables that depend upon the choice made by the agent at a particular stage. They may involve taking actions, selecting items, etc., and affect the future decisions. For instance, in the subset sum problem, our decision variable is whether to include a certain element in the subset or not. 

3. Base Case: This is the simplest version of the problem that can be directly computed without considering any other information. It serves as a stopping criterion for the recursion. If no more elements can be added to the subset, then we know that including the last element would result in a higher value than excluding it. 

4. Recursive Formula: Once we have defined our base case and identified the decision variables, we can write a recurrence relation that depends only on the previous state variables and results in computing the next state variable. This formula allows us to efficiently calculate all the intermediate solutions required to arrive at the final answer.

5. Optimal Solution: Since the DP algorithm involves finding the best possible solution among many possibilities, we must also identify the criteria for choosing between alternative solutions. One popular criterion is known as the optimality gap, which measures the difference between the optimal solution found and the actual solution.

6. Overlapping Subproblems: Most of the time, the same subproblems appear repeatedly over several stages of the DP algorithm. Therefore, we can optimize the computational effort involved by memoizing the results of previously calculated subproblems. Memoization means storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. 

Now that we understand the basics, let's move on to implementing DP algorithms.<|im_sep|>
