Emotional labels are a popular form of AI-generated content in the field of image and video synthesis. However, most emotional labels generated by current models often lack clarity and coherence to capture human emotions accurately. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Preserved Local Style (PLS) that incorporates local semantics from text into semantically meaningful emotional labels for generating high quality images and videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PLS by comparing it against baseline methods and achieving significant improvements on several metrics including perceptual similarity, identity preservation, style transferability, and diversity. Moreover, we show that our method can evolve into an interactive system that allows users to dynamically control the contextual information of generated emotional labels to evoke diverse emotional expressions. 

In this article, we will first introduce background concepts and terms related to emotional label generation. Then we will explain the core algorithm and operations of PLS and demonstrate its implementation using Python codes. Finally, we will discuss potential future work and challenges associated with PLS, such as further exploring multimodal integration techniques or adapting the model to other modalities like speech and music. The article concludes with some common questions and answers about PLS.

## 2.1 Emotional Label Generation
Emotional labels are a type of artistic creativity used in various fields including film, television, advertising, and graphic design. They represent the emotions expressed in an image or video scene by associating descriptive words with corresponding emotions. There are different approaches for generating emotional labels, including handcrafted systems based on psychology and cultural studies, machine learning algorithms, and social media influencers. Most recent advancements have focused on developing computer vision models that learn to generate rich and detailed emotional labels that correspond to complex visual scenes.

## 2.2 Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), also known as CNN, are a class of deep neural network architectures widely used in computer vision tasks. These networks are specifically designed to recognize patterns within visual data. Each layer of a CNN consists of multiple filters that identify specific features within the input image. By passing an image through these layers, the network learns abstract representations of the underlying object, which enable classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Commonly used convolutional layers include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## 2.3 Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model, usually trained on large datasets like ImageNet, is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset. This process involves freezing certain weights in the base model, while updating only the last few layers of the network with the new task at hand. The goal is to take advantage of the learned representations from the larger training set and adapt them to the small validation set or test set. One use case of transfer learning is domain adaptation, where a model trained on one dataset may not generalize well to another dataset because they have different domains. Transfer learning has been applied successfully to many computer vision tasks, ranging from object recognition to natural language processing. For example, VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet are examples of state-of-the-art image classifiers that have achieved good results using transfer learning. Other applications of transfer learning include audio classification, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.

## 2.4 Visual Representation Learning
A common problem in computer vision is how to encode visual information into numerical features that can be processed by machines. The two main ways of encoding visual information are feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Feature extraction extracts low-level visual features directly from raw pixel values, whereas dimensionality reduction reduces the number of dimensions without losing any important information. Popular dimensionality reduction techniques include principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and locally linear embedding (LLE). Despite their popularity, there remains a need for better understanding of the inner workings of these methods and why they perform well on particular types of visual data.

## 2.5 Word Embeddings
Word embeddings are dense vectors representing individual words or phrases in vector space. The key idea behind word embeddings is to map each unique word to a unique point in a high-dimensional vector space. Vectors for similar words should be close together, indicating that they have shared meaning. Word embeddings have been shown to improve various NLP tasks like sentence representation learning, named entity recognition, and analogy completion.
