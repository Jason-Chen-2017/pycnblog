# 1.简介
  

Interactive light displays are fun and innovative ways to showcase a company’s brand or products through digital means. However, building an interactive display from scratch can be time-consuming and expensive, especially if you don’t have the technical skills required to build it yourself. 

In this article, I will demonstrate how easy it is to create an interactive light display using Python and APIs such as Twitter bots and Twilio. By following these steps, anyone can build their own interactive light displays for personal use or showcase their product or service online without needing any prior programming knowledge.

Let's get started!

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology 
Before we start creating our light display, let’s first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to light displays:

1. **Light strip:** A group of individually controlled LEDs (light emitting diodes) that are linked together in a line or array to produce a visual effect on a surface. 

2. **LED:** An electronic component used to produce light by firing electromagnetic radiation. It consists of three main parts - a semiconductor coating that enables electron transfer; an anode surrounded by a p-type region, which converts electricity into positive charges; and a cathode surrounded by an n-type region, which converts negative charges back into electricity. 

3. **RGB Color Model:** The RGB color model describes the way colors are perceived by human eyes. Each primary color is represented by one primary chromaticity (red, green, blue), while other colors can be formed by combining two primary colors. In order to produce vivid colors like red, yellow, white, etc., lights are usually tuned to specific combinations of primary colors in specific ratios. This makes each pixel in an image contain its own set of values for Red, Green and Blue (RGB).

4. **Twitter bot:** A software application that uses social media platforms such as Twitter to send automated messages or post updates to users. They communicate with users via text messages, tweets, and direct messages (DMs).

5. **Twilio API:** A cloud-based communication platform that allows developers to integrate voice, messaging, and video functionality into their applications. We will use the Twilio API to send SMS messages to the user.


# 3.Technical Details

Now let’s move on to discuss the core algorithm and operation details of our light display.

## Algorithm Overview
1. Start by collecting data from the environment where your light display should be shown. This could involve taking pictures or videos of objects or scenes around you or monitoring real-time weather conditions. 
2. Store the collected data locally or upload them to a server so they can be accessed later.
3. Use OpenCV library to process the images and extract information such as object coordinates or motion vectors.
4. Connect to a twitter account and tweet out the captured image along with relevant information extracted from step 3. You can also add hashtags or mentions based on the context of the image.
5. Once the image has been tweeted, connect to Twilio API to send an SMS message to your phone number containing the URL of the tweeted image.
6. Now all you need to do is wait for someone to tweet back with a reply containing “like” or “love”. When they do, turn on the corresponding LED(s) to represent the sentiment expressed in the reply. For example, when someone likes your tweet, turn on the top row of LEDs in your display. If someone says “I love your work”, turn on all LEDs at once to brighten up the entire light display. Repeat this process for every new tweet received until you manually shut down the light display.

## Steps

1. Create a Twitter Account: Go to https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup and sign up for a free developer account.

2. Install Required Libraries: Make sure you have installed the necessary libraries before proceeding further. These include:

    a. pandas
    b. cv2
    c. requests
    d. twilio

3. Setup Your Environment: Set up your working environment, including creating directories and setting up virtual environments.

```python
import pandas as pd
import cv2
import requests
from twilio.rest import Client

# Create a directory called 'images' to store your images
os.makedirs('images')
```

4. Collect Data: Gather data about what you want your light display to represent. This could involve taking pictures of various objects or scenarios around you, capturing videos of those scenarios, or accessing live streaming feeds from cameras or sensors within the environment. Save these files either locally or upload them to a remote server for access later.

5. Extract Information: Using CV2, extract information about objects or situations present in the picture or video frames. You may need to adjust parameters depending on your hardware configuration. Here's an example code snippet to detect faces and track motion vectors:

```python
# Initialize tracker
tracker = cv2.TrackerCSRT_create() # options: cv2.TrackerBoosting_create(),...

# Open camera device
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) # 0 represents default webcam

while True:
    _, frame = cap.read()
    
    # Detect face and draw rectangle
    ret, bbox = detector.detectAndCompute(frame, None)
    if ret:
        x, y, w, h = [int(v) for v in bbox]
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (x,y), (x+w, y+h), (0,255,0), 2)
        
        # Track object
        ok, bbox = tracker.update(frame)
        if ok:
            x, y, w, h = [int(v) for v in bbox]
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (x,y), (x+w, y+h), (0,255,255), 2)
        
    else:
        print("No Face Detected")
        
     # Display Frame
    cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)
    
    # Exit loop if q key is pressed
    k = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if k == ord('q'):
        break
    
# Release resources
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
cap.release()
```

6. Send Tweets: Authenticate your Twitter credentials and use the "requests" library to make POST requests to the Twitter API to send images as tweets. Add relevant metadata such as location tags or hashtags to improve engagement and searchability of your content.

```python
# Authenticate Twitter credentials
auth = OAuth1Session(consumer_key, consumer_secret,
                    access_token, access_token_secret)

# Tweet Image Function
def tweet_image(img):
    
    # Get filename of uploaded file
    fn = os.path.basename(img)
    
    # Upload file to twitter
    url = 'https://upload.twitter.com/1.1/media/upload.json'
    params = {'command': 'INIT', 'total_bytes': str(os.stat(fn).st_size)}
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"}
    r = auth.post(url, params=params, headers=headers, data=open(fn,'rb'))
    media_id = json.loads(r.text)['media_id']
    
    # Append additional fields to request body
    payload = {'status': '@username #tag1 #tag2',
              'media_ids': [str(media_id)]}
    
    # Finalize tweet and update status
    url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json'
    r = auth.post(url, data=payload)
    return r

# Example usage
```

7. Receive Replies: Use the Twilio API to receive SMS messages sent to your phone number. Parse incoming messages for keywords such as "like" or "love" to trigger appropriate actions within the light display. Depending on the complexity of your light display, you may need to implement more sophisticated logic to interpret multiple inputs or sentiments.

```python
# Define function to handle incoming SMS
def sms_handler(request):
    message_body = request.values['Body'].lower().strip()
    if 'like' in message_body:
        print("User Liked!")
        # Turn on appropriate LED(s) here
    elif 'love' in message_body:
        print("User Loves Us All!")
        # Turn on ALL LEDS HERE
    return ""

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET','POST'])
def home():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        response = sms_handler(request)
        resp = MessagingResponse()
        msg = resp.message(response)
        return str(resp)
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```


8. Run Your Code: Finally, run your code to monitor the provided input sources and automatically respond to incoming messages with appropriate actions. You can schedule regular execution using a task scheduler or cron job to ensure continuous monitoring.
