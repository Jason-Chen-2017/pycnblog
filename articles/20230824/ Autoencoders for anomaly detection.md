Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual patterns or behaviors that are not part of the normal operating conditions. Anomalies can be innocent events such as typos or deviations from expected behavioral patterns, or malicious activities such as intrusions or attacks on a network system. The goal of anomaly detection is to detect and isolate anomalous examples while identifying their underlying reason(s). Traditional methods include clustering-based approaches that group similar data points together based on their similarity measure, and statistical analysis techniques like hypothesis testing and regression analysis. However, these techniques often require expert knowledge or subjective judgment, which can limit their accuracy and scalability. Therefore, deep learning models have emerged as new alternatives with promising performance over traditional algorithms. In this paper, we will focus on using deep autoencoders (AE) for anomaly detection, which are deep neural networks that learn efficient representations of input data by compressing it into a lower dimensional space without loss of information. AE were shown to perform well in image recognition tasks but have yet to demonstrate their efficacy in other domains such as time series and natural language processing. To address this gap, we propose a novel algorithm called AMT (Autoencoder Monitoring Tool), which automatically discovers and classifies anomalies in real-time streaming data streams by monitoring the reconstruction error of the learned representation during training. This allows us to continuously monitor incoming data streams and adaptively adjust the hyperparameters of our model to reduce false positives and false negatives caused by noise. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art techniques and show that AMT outperforms them in terms of both precision and recall, particularly when dealing with noisy streaming data. Overall, our work demonstrates how AE could be leveraged for anomaly detection in various contexts and highlights potential advantages of our proposed method compared to existing ones.
# 2.Autoencoders
In general, autoencoders are neural networks designed to learn efficient representations of input data by compressing it into a lower dimensional space while minimizing the reconstruction error between the original input and its corresponding output. They consist of two parts: an encoder function that learns to encode the input into a low-dimensional latent space, and a decoder function that reconstructs the compressed input from the latent space. During training, the network tries to minimize the reconstruction error by updating the weights of both the encoder and decoder functions so that they produce outputs close to the inputs. For example, if the input consists of images, then the encoder might learn to represent each pixel location as a compact code that captures important features of the image. Similarly, the decoder might learn to recreate the original image from the compressed code. 

Autoencoders have been widely used in computer vision tasks where they achieved high accuracy levels by learning generic feature representations that capture salient characteristics of different objects in the dataset. Other applications of autoencoders include speech synthesis, natural language translation, and recommender systems where the latent space represents users' preferences or items' attributes. 

Recently, researchers have demonstrated their ability to train deeper, more complex architectures than traditional CNNs by applying techniques such as residual connections, skip connections, and dilated convolutions. These design choices result in improved robustness and flexibility of autoencoders in capturing complex relationships within datasets and enabling them to extract meaningful features. Moreover, self-supervised pretraining has shown promise in improving the quality of the learned representations further by encouraging the model to use all available data rather than relying solely on labeled examples.

However, there exists a fundamental problem with traditional autoencoders - they cannot effectively handle non-stationary, unlabeled data streams due to the requirement of fixed input size. Additionally, standard supervised learning algorithms typically do not leverage the temporal dependencies present in streaming data and hence may miss relevant anomalies arising from changes in dynamics. Finally, while some recent works have explored the use of attention mechanisms in AE, they still rely heavily on manually annotated data which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called AMT (Autoencoder Monitoring Tool) that uses automatic monitoring of the reconstruction error during training to continuously monitor incoming data streams and adjust the hyperparameters of the AE architecture dynamically. Our key insight is to establish a continuum between perfect reconstruction and complete failure of the AE's ability to reconstruct valid input data. Based on this idea, we develop a novel metric called Vulcano Score that measures the degree to which the AE's current reconstruction error exceeds its historical average, indicating the severity of any detected anomalies. Based on this score, we can trigger additional monitoring actions such as increasing the number of layers in the AE or reducing the learning rate to recover from the anomaly and continue providing accurate predictions. Finally, since our approach requires only partial access to the raw stream data, we show that it can scale up to process millions of samples per second and provide near real-time anomaly detection capabilities.
