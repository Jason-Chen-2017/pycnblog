Augmented reality (AR) is the use of virtual elements that interact with the real world in a natural and immersive way. It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to enrich our everyday lives by adding new and engaging ways of interacting with the physical world. One of the most common applications of AR is augmented reality headsets such as Google Cardboard or HTC Vive which allow users to explore virtual environments using their smartphones without needing additional hardware. However, creating these experiences can be challenging since it requires knowledge of computer graphics programming, object detection algorithms, and sensor fusion techniques. 

Vuforia is a development kit provided by Vuforia Inc., a leading provider of software solutions for mobile and wearable devices, including smart glasses and camera phones. The company offers both free and paid tiers for developers who want to create AR applications on their platforms. This article will demonstrate how to create an immersive augmented reality experience using Unity and Vuforia.

Augmented reality (AR): refers to the use of virtual elements that are integrated into the real environment. These elements add meaning to what is happening within the virtual environment, making them seem like they actually exist there. AR technology can also be classified according to the type of interaction between the user's device and the augmented reality scene:

1. Optical- see-through AR (OTAR): involves using visible light instead of IR light to project images onto the real world. Examples include Microsoft HoloLens, Apple iPhone X. 

2. Stereo- see-through AR (STTAR): uses two cameras to capture image data from different perspectives and stitches together the results. Examples include Samsung Gear VR, Google Daydream. 

3. Virtual reality (VR): simulates the presence of a virtual environment through various display technologies, allowing the user to fully immerse themselves in it. Examples include HTC Vive, Oculus Rift.

In this tutorial, we will focus on developing an immersive AR application using Unity and Vuforia. Here is an overview of the main components required for creating an AR app:

1. Device Camera: Used to capture video and images for processing by the computer. Common examples include those used in smartphone cameras and digital still cameras.

2. Image Processing Algorithms: Used to detect objects and features in the captured imagery. There are many libraries available for performing image processing tasks, such as OpenCV and TensorFlow.

3. Object Detection API: Provides tools and APIs for identifying specific types of objects or surfaces in the captured imagery. Examples include Azure Cognitive Services' Computer Vision API and Google's Cloud Vision API.

4. Sensor Fusion Techniques: Use multiple sensors to combine information about the user's motion, location, and orientation to provide accurate position estimates. Common methods include Kalman filtering and optical flow.

5. Marker Tracking System: Software component responsible for tracking a particular marker or target over time. These markers may be planar or nonplanar objects, such as QR codes or holograms.

6. Game Engine Integration: Integrates the rendered virtual content into the game engine, providing a seamless integration between the AR content and the surrounding gameplay.

Vuforia: Developed by Vuforia Inc., a leader in augmented reality software development, Vuforia provides SDKs and tools for building immersive and interactive mobile apps with AR capabilities. The platform includes several key features, including:

1. Platform Support: Includes support for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and other mobile operating systems.

Now let's go through each step involved in creating an immersive AR experience using Unity and Vuforia. We'll begin by setting up the development environment, installing any necessary packages or plugins, then getting started on coding. 

1. Setting Up Development Environment
The first thing you need to do before starting your immersive AR experience is set up your development environment. You should have access to a PC/Mac with at least 8GB RAM and an SSD hard drive, along with a stable internet connection. You will also need to download and install Unity Hub, the latest version of Unity, Visual Studio Code (or another code editor), and any other necessary developer tools depending on your preferred workflow. If you don't already have these installed, follow the links below to get started:

https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Once everything is installed, open Unity Hub and click "Add" to add a new Unity project. Choose a name for your project and select the version of Unity you downloaded. Click "Create Project".

2. Installing Required Packages and Plugins
Next, you need to install the Vuforia package and its dependencies. Go to Window > Package Manager in Unity and search for "Vuforia". Select the package and click the "+" button to add it to your project. You will also need to import some external assets for Unity, such as the Vuforia Unity extensions package. Follow the instructions below to complete the process:

2a. Install Vuforia Package
Go to Window > Package Manager again and search for "Vuforia Augmented Reality SDK for Unity". Select the package and click the "+" button to add it to your project.

2b. Import External Assets
Download the following.unitypackage files and import them into your project: https://github.com/VulcanTechnologies/HoloLensCameraStreamer/releases/latest/download/HoloLensCameraStreamer.unitypackage

https://developer.vuforia.com/vui/download/sdk?language=Unity&version=v7

Note: Make sure to rename the imported assets if necessary so they match the names expected by Vuforia scripts.

3. Getting Started Coding
To build an immersive AR experience, you will need to write a script that coordinates all the different components mentioned above. In this section, we will walk you through writing a simple example using a cube and a marker. 

3a. Creating the Cube
First, let's create a simple cube in Unity. Drag and drop a GameObject from the Hierarchy window into your scene and change its transform properties to fit inside a reasonable size sphere. Rename the GameObject to something descriptive, such as "Cube", and move it slightly away from the player so that it doesn't interfere with the marker placement. To ensure that the cube faces the camera properly, drag the Transform component and rotate it accordingly until it looks correct.

3b. Configuring Vuforia
Next, configure the Vuforia Engine. Open the Main Camera in the Hierarchy view and attach the Vuforia Behaviour Component to it. Then, navigate to File > Build Settings... and switch the platform to either Universal Windows Platform or Android. Finally, click Play to run the game in the emulator or on your device and grant permission for the app to access the camera.

3c. Adding Marker
To place a marker, we will use the VuMark Manager prefab included in the Vuforia SDK. Drop the VuMarkManager prefab into the Scene view and press play to initialize the manager. Switch back to the Editor view and double-click on the empty space where you want to place the marker. In the Inspector view, you should now see a panel named "VuMark Manager". Expand it and scroll down to the "Virtual World" dropdown menu. Underneath, choose "My First World". This will create a new marker ID that you can use to track the marker throughout the app.

Click outside of the Inspector view to dismiss it and return to the game view. Your marker should now appear in front of the player, but it won't work yet because we haven't implemented the marker tracking logic.

3d. Implementing Marker Tracking Logic
We will implement the marker tracking logic using the MarkHandler script. Right-click on the Cube GameObject and select "Add Component" followed by "New Script". Name the script file anything appropriate, such as "MarkHandler". Double-click on the script file to open it in your text editor of choice. Replace the default contents of the script with the following code:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Vuforia;

public class MarkHandler : MonoBehaviour, ITrackableEventHandler {

    private TrackableBehaviour mTrackableBehaviour;
    private bool mIsTracked = false;

    void Start() {
        // Register event handlers
        mTrackableBehaviour = GetComponent<TrackableBehaviour>();
        if (mTrackableBehaviour!= null) {
            mTrackableBehaviour.RegisterTrackableEventHandler(this);
        }
    }

    public void OnTrackableStateChanged(TrackableBehaviour.Status previousStatus, TrackableBehaviour.Status newStatus) {
        if (newStatus == TrackableBehaviour.Status.TRACKED ||
                newStatus == TrackableBehaviour.Status.EXTENDED_TRACKED) {
            Debug.Log("Tracker found");
            mIsTracked = true;
        } else if (previousStatus == TrackableBehaviour.Status.TRACKED ||
                    previousStatus == TrackableBehaviour.Status.EXTENDED_TRACKED) {
            Debug.Log("Tracker lost");
            mIsTracked = false;
        }
    }

    void Update() {
        if (mIsTracked && Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space)) {
            transform.Translate(Vector3.up * 0.1f);
            Debug.Log("Cube moved!");
        }
    }

}
```

Explanation of the code:

1. `ITrackableEventHandler` interface allows us to define custom event handling functions for the Vuforia Behaviour component.
2. When the script starts, we register ourselves as an event handler for the Vuforia Behaviour component attached to the Cube GameObject. 
3. Whenever the tracker state changes (i.e. whether the marker is being detected or not), the `OnTrackableStateChanged()` function gets called and updates the internal tracked flag accordingly.
4. Every frame, if the marker is currently being tracked (`mIsTracked` flag is true) and the Space bar is pressed, we translate the cube upwards by 0.1 meters. This triggers a debug message and moves the cube around the scene. Note that moving the cube is just one possible behavior when pressing the Spacebar - you could modify this to trigger other actions based on your requirements. 

You should now be able to place a marker and successfully move the cube around when pressing the Spacebar while the marker is detected. Congratulations! You've successfully created an immersive AR experience using Unity and Vuforia.
