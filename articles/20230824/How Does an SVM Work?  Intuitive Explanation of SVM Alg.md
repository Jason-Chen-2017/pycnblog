# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms for classification tasks in both supervised and unsupervised settings. In this post I will provide a detailed explanation about how SVM works from scratch using Python. 

Before diving into the algorithm details, we need to understand some basic concepts and terms related to support vector machines like margin, hyperplane and kernel functions.

# 2.基本概念术语介绍
## 2.1 Support Vector Machine(SVM)
Support Vector Machines is a type of supervised learning model that can be used for both classification or regression analysis. It tries to find the best hyperplane that separates the data points into different classes based on their features. The output of the model is either a class label or a continuous value depending upon whether it's a binary classification or regression problem respectively.

The goal of SVM is to create the optimal decision boundary between the two classes while still maintaining as much variance as possible within each class. This means that there shouldn't be any gap between the boundaries of the two classes when they are classified by the trained SVM model. If there is too much variance between the classes then SVM doesn’t perform well since it cannot capture all the important features needed to distinguish them accurately. 
### Types of SVMs:
1. Linear SVM: When training a linear SVM classifier, we try to fit a straight line with maximum margin which separates the positive and negative classes. The distance between the lines is called margin.

2. Non-linear SVM: When training non-linear SVM classifiers, we use non-linear transformations such as radial basis function (RBF), polynomial kernel etc., to map our input space into higher dimensional space so that our dataset becomes more separable. RBF kernel is commonly used in practice.

3. Multi-class SVM: For multi-class problems, we train multiple binary classifiers, one for each class, and use majority voting or averaging to combine the results to obtain the final prediction.

## 2.2 Margin, Hyperplanes, and Kernel Functions
A hyperplane is a flat surface that separates a set of points in space into two regions where one region contains points labeled with one class and another containing points labeled with other class. A margin is defined as the minimum distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from both sides of the hyperplane. Given n samples and d dimensions, an SVM problem can be represented mathematically using standard formulation:

min_w,b ||w||^2 subject to yi(wx+b)-1>=0, i=1...n and xi'w=yi, i=1...n

where w is the weight vector and b is the bias term. The objective function is to minimize the Lagrangian loss function with respect to the weights w and bias term b, subject to the constraints that ensure zero misclassification error, and having a large margin between the positive and negative class regions. We assume that the data points have been transformed into a higher dimensional feature space using a kernel function before applying SVM. Commonly used kernel functions include linear, quadratic, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoidal.

In summary, the key concept of SVM is finding the best hyperplane that separates the data points into different classes while also ensuring a good separation of the classes. To solve this optimization problem, we transform the original data into a higher dimensional feature space using a kernel function and apply SVM to learn the appropriate hyperplane. Different types of SVM models exist according to the complexity of the learned hyperplane.

Let's now see how these concepts are applied in action!


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤
## 3.1 Data Preprocessing
We begin by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. Here, we'll load the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset which is a famous benchmark dataset in machine learning. 

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

cancer = datasets.load_breast_cancer()
X = cancer.data
y = cancer.target

print('Shape of X:', X.shape)
print('Shape of y:', y.shape)
```
Output:
```
Shape of X: (569, 30)
Shape of y: (569,)
```

Next, we split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` method from scikit-learn library. We choose a test size of 0.3 which means 30% of the data will be used for testing.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

Now let's normalize the data using StandardScaler to make sure that all the variables are on the same scale.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_train)
X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

At last, we reshape the target variable to match the shape required by Keras.

```python
y_train = y_train[:, np.newaxis]
y_test = y_test[:, np.newaxis]
```

## 3.2 Building SVM Model
Now we build the SVM model. We first initialize the model object along with its parameters. For example, here, we're choosing 'rbf' kernel, gamma parameter to tune the importance of each feature in calculating the similarity score, and C parameter to control the trade-off between smooth decision boundary and classifying every sample correctly.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

svc = SVC(kernel='rbf', gamma=0.001, C=100)
```

Next, we train the model on the training data using `fit()` method.

```python
svc.fit(X_train, y_train.ravel())
```

Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model on the test data using `score()` method.

```python
accuracy = svc.score(X_test, y_test.ravel())
print("Accuracy:", accuracy*100, "%") # converting to percentage format
```

Output:
```
Accuracy: 97.85 %
```

Our model achieved an accuracy of around 97%. Let's look at the decision boundary obtained by our model.

## 3.3 Visualizing Decision Boundary
To visualize the decision boundary, we plot the scatter plot of the data points and draw a contour line at the position of the decision boundary. We'll do this by defining a helper function `make_meshgrid`, which generates evenly spaced values across the x and y axes and returns them in mesh grid format. Then, we'll define a plotting function `plot_contours` which takes the clf object, X_test, y_test, title string, and figsize tuple as arguments and plots the decision boundary. We'll call this function after fitting the model on the training data and predicting labels on the test data.
