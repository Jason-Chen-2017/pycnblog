# 1.简介
  

在自然语言处理(NLP)中，机器翻译、问答系统、聊天机器人等应用都离不开注意力机制（Attention）。近年来Transformer模型也逐渐成为主流NLP模型，其在很多任务上性能超过了目前最先进的模型。
Transformer模型引入了注意力机制，是一种全新的自然语言理解方式。本文首先从Transformer的基础模型到Encoder-Decoder模型再到带有注意力机制的Transformer模型进行详解。最后通过一个具体案例，分享如何将注意力机制融入到Transformer模型。

## 2.1. 序列到序列模型
Sequence to sequence (seq2seq) is a type of neural network architecture for mapping sequences of symbols into sequences of symbols, typically used for natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text summarization. The basic idea behind seq2seq models is to use a recurrent neural network (RNN), called an encoder, to encode a source sequence into a fixed-length context vector, which can be thought of as a summary of the entire sequence or its global properties. A second RNN called a decoder then uses this context vector along with a set of output symbols to generate a target sequence one symbol at a time. Seq2seq models are widely used today for a variety of applications including speech recognition, machine translation, and text summarization. Some popular examples include Google's Neural Machine Translation system, Facebook's chatbot framework, and NVIDIA's Tacotron model for voice synthesis. 

In this article we will focus on the attention mechanism that was introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need". It is applied specifically in the Transformer model architecture. We will also assume some familiarity with RNNs and how they work. If you need a refresher on these topics, I recommend the following resources:

## 2.2. Attention Mechanism
The attention mechanism enables the neural network to pay more attention to certain parts of the input when generating the output sequence. At each step of decoding, the model looks at all available information from the current position in the encoded sequence, selects which part to attend to next, and generates the next word in the output sequence accordingly. By focusing only on relevant parts of the input sequence, the attention mechanism improves performance and reduces the amount of needed memory compared to other models like LSTMs. This means it can process longer sequences than traditional RNNs. To achieve good results with the attention mechanism, the model needs to learn what parts of the input are most important at every step, instead of relying solely on the final state or hidden representation after encoding the whole sequence. Therefore, the transformer model incorporates both an attention layer and residual connections between layers.

The attention mechanism works as follows: The model first applies a linear transformation to the encoded representations, resulting in a matrix where each row represents a different position in the sequence. Each column corresponds to the same element in the embedding space. For instance, if we have 10 tokens in our vocabulary and a three-dimensional embedding space, each row might represent a position in the sequence, while each column contains the learned embeddings for those tokens.

We then apply a softmax function across each row, so that each element adds up to 1. The softmax weights each token based on its similarity to the current position in the sequence. In other words, elements close together get higher scores, indicating high importance. These scores are normalized using the dot product operation before being passed through the feedforward layer. Finally, we multiply each row by its corresponding weight, adding them up to obtain the context vector for that position.
