Multimodal machine translation refers to translating text from multiple sources simultaneously into one language. It is an important research area that focuses on the interaction between humans and machines through multimedia technologies such as images, videos, or speech. The traditional approaches in this area usually use statistical machine translation (SMT) models based on n-gram statistics of parallel texts but it is challenging for low resource languages like Chinese due to insufficient training data. 

Modern deep learning techniques have shown impressive performance in many natural language processing tasks including image captioning, question answering, sentiment analysis, etc., which provide rich information about the content of visual and acoustic signals. Therefore, we can leverage these techniques to extract features from multimodal signals and then train neural networks for multimodal machine translation. However, existing methods still suffer from the problem of bias due to their model architectures. To address this issue, we propose a novel modality invariant language representation framework called MILE, which captures the contextual dependencies across different modalities by jointly encoding all modalities and inferring latent representations independently. We also introduce a denoising autoencoder (DAE) model to learn more robust representations of each modality and combine them with the learned shared representation using a multimodal attention mechanism to produce the final translations. Finally, experiments show that our proposed method achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art baselines on several multimodal machine translation datasets, including MSCOCO, YouCookII, and Multi30k. 

In summary, this work proposes a new approach to translate multi-modal signals while capturing the contextual relationships among different modalities. Our key contribution is to develop a novel modality invariant language representation framework that learns shared representations without any explicit bias towards certain modalities. By combining these representations with a DAE model, we obtain better quality translations than previous methods while reducing computational complexity and improving accuracy.

The field of multimodal machine translation has been growing rapidly over the past few years thanks to advances in large-scale multimedia processing and modern deep learning algorithms. However, there are two significant challenges faced by the community at present: 

1. **Low-resource language problems**: As mentioned earlier, SMT models require high amounts of parallel corpus data for accurate translation, which is not available for low-resource languages like Chinese. Moreover, even if sufficient data exists, building a supervised SMT system requires a lot of human effort in creating high-quality training corpora.

2. **Model biases**: Existing SMT systems heavily rely on statistical techniques to align words or phrases in both source and target sentences, leading to unfair comparisons in terms of evaluation metrics. For instance, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BEU) score is often used to evaluate how well a model performs. However, relying solely on word alignments ignores the nuances and differences in phonology, syntax, and semantics of the languages being translated, leading to inflated scores, particularly for non-native speakers. 

To tackle these issues, various works have explored ways to encode multimodal contexts in a way that preserves their independence while retaining enough information to enable effective cross-modal inference. These methods include hierarchical discourse models, cross-lingual language models, and neural machine translation (NMT) models. Each of these methods suffers from some form of bias depending upon the choice of architecture or hyperparameters used during training. Furthermore, they do not capture the local structures within individual modality signals making them less suitable for long sequences or variable length input. This makes sense given the nature of audio and video signals where contextual interactions cannot be captured directly.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called Modality Invariant Language Embeddings (MILE), which addresses the above challenges by introducing a new paradigm of multimodal language representation. MILE builds on the idea of representing a sentence as a sequence of tokens embedded in a common space, yet maintains the ability to infer specific semantic properties of each modality independently. Specifically, we first tokenize each modality signal separately using its own tokenization algorithm, then we concatenate the resulting embeddings along with the original sentence embedding vector obtained from other modalities. Next, we apply an adaptive softmax layer to selectively project the concatenated vector back into a shared representation dimension, where we attempt to preserve the interdependencies between modalities. Afterwards, we employ a denoising autoencoder (DAE) model to learn more robust representations of each modality and combine them with the learned shared representation using a multimodal attention mechanism to produce the final translations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three popular multimodal machine translation benchmarks - MSCOCO, YouCook II, and Multi30k.
