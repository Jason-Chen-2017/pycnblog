In this article we will be looking at the problem of finding the maximum capacity that can be poured into a water jug or a set of water jugs without spilling any contents while maintaining a target level of pressure within given constraints. We will also discuss how to approach this problem by utilizing Dynamic Programming (DP). Finally, we will see some code examples and interpretations on various algorithms for solving the problem statement.
## Introduction
Water is a key element in our daily life; from drinking potable water to showering, bathing and washing hands. However, keeping these essentials clean requires constant attention to safety and sanitation measures to ensure proper disinfectant handling and hygiene. Nowadays, with an increasing number of water consumers who are conscious about their personal hygiene practices, there has been an increase in the demand for safe and effective methods for distributing water throughout a community or around a specific location.
The first method used was filling up large containers with freshwater from nearby rivers/streams, but as population grew larger and urban areas became more densely populated, it became difficult to store large volumes of water due to limited space available. To overcome such challenges, smaller portable water storage devices were introduced like water jugs. These devices allow users to hold small amounts of water, making them convenient for distribution and use during emergencies.

One of the most common problems faced when dealing with water jugs is ensuring that they do not overflow, which leads to contamination of human or animal bodies. In order to prevent this, manufacturers have developed ways to control the flow rate of water through the device so that it does not exceed its design capacity. Another important aspect is maintenance - if the water content inside the jug changes significantly due to improper storage conditions, then it becomes essential to replace it regularly. Therefore, it is vital for every user to keep track of the remaining capacity in their device(s) at all times. 

To solve this issue effectively, many researchers have proposed different approaches to optimally distribute water amongst multiple water jugs. One such algorithm is known as 'Greedy Algorithm' which involves choosing the container with the least amount of water still left after pouring water into another one. This approach may work well in certain scenarios where there is only one source of supply. But what happens when there are several sources of supply? How should we allocate water efficiently across all the containers while satisfying the target levels of pressures? This brings us to the main topic of this article - Dynamic Programming (DP), a powerful technique used to solve complex optimization problems.

In DP, we divide a problem into smaller sub-problems, each of which is relatively easier than the original problem. We then use the solutions to those sub-problems to find a solution to the original problem. The key idea behind DP is memoization - instead of recalculating the same sub-problem repeatedly, we simply remember the result once it's calculated and reuse it later. By doing so, we avoid redundant calculations, speed up the computation time, and make the algorithm more efficient.

Now let’s get started with a simple example to understand the concept better:
Suppose you want to fill two water jugs A and B until either both jugs are full or one jug gets completely filled before the other. Initially, neither jug has any water, and you have to pour x units of water between them until one of the jugs gets completely filled. You cannot pour more water than the total capacity of both jugs. What is the largest value of x that you can choose? And can you guarantee that you will always reach your goal state i.e., fill both jugs completely even if it takes a lot of iterations? Let’s break down the steps involved in solving this problem:

1. Initialize dp array with zeros initially. 

2. For each possible value of x (from 1 to half of the minimum capacity of both jugs), calculate the max_capacity obtained by pouring x units of water into jug A first. If the capacity exceeds the capacity of jug B, continue to the next iteration since we don't need to consider further values of x. Otherwise, update the dp[x] to include the updated value for both jugs. 

3. Repeat step 2 for x values starting from y = 1 to min(jugA.capacity, jugB.capacity). Use the previously computed results to improve efficiency.

4. After completing the above loop, return the maximum value present in the dp[] array.

This approach follows the basic logic of dynamic programming - breaking down a larger task into smaller subtasks and storing the intermediate results to avoid redundant computations. It uses memoization to store the intermediate states and thus reduces unnecessary computations leading to significant performance improvements. The overall runtime complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) and hence, it may take a long time to compute the final answer. Nevertheless, DP is a great tool to tackle complex optimization problems and provides a much faster way to obtain the optimal solution compared to brute force search techniques.
