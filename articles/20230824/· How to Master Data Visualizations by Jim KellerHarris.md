# 1.简介
  

Data visualization is the process of translating large amounts of data into graphs and charts that are easy for humans to understand and digest. Data visualizations are used in a variety of fields including business, scientific research, social sciences, engineering, and even entertainment. Whether it's weather forecasts or airplane traffic reports, data visualization helps users quickly identify patterns and trends within the data they're working with. The goal of this article is to provide an introduction to data visualization and how to use effective techniques to create compelling data visualizations. By the end of the article you should be comfortable designing your own data visualizations using various tools such as Tableau, Excel, Power BI, Python, D3.js, etc.

By the way, if you want a more hands-on approach on using these tools to make beautiful data visualizations without any hassle, then consider subscribing to our newsletter below. We'll send you free resources on different topics related to data visualization so you can get started on creating great graphics!


# 2.基本概念和术语
Before we dive deep into data visualization, let’s first cover some basic concepts and terminology:

2.1 Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data. It involves transforming raw data into visually appealing images, which help analysts extract meaningful insights from the data. Data visualization is often used in areas like business analytics, finance, marketing, scientific research, and healthcare. There are many types of data visualization, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heat maps, box plots, and geographic maps.


2.2 Types of Graphs
There are several categories of graph formats commonly used in data visualization: 

1) Categorical graph - A categorical graph presents relationships between two categorical variables, usually represented as bars stacked vertically or side by side. Examples include bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, box plots, and stem and leaf diagrams.
2) Quantitative graph - A quantitative graph presents relationships between two continuous variables, usually represented as lines connecting points. Examples include line graphs, scatter plots, heat maps, surface plots, contour plots, and radar charts. 
3) Ranked graph - A ranked graph shows the order of items based on a numerical value, usually represented as bars sorted by size or position. Examples include bubble charts and word clouds. 

Here is a sample chart type breakdown:

Categorical Bar Chart	Pie Chart	Histogram	Box Plot	Stem & Leaf Diagram
Quantitative Line Chart	Scatter Plot	Heat Map	Surface Plot	Contour Plot
Ranked Bubble Chart	Word Cloud	Radar Chart



Some common terms used in data visualization:

2.3 Metrics and Measures

A metric is a single quantity that describes something about a phenomenon being measured, while a measure is a set of metrics taken at different times or conditions over time. In other words, a metric is a specific characteristic or attribute, while a measure is the observed value(s) obtained for that characteristic during an experiment or survey. For example, sales revenue might be considered a metric while monthly sales figures would be considered measures.

2.4 Dimensions

Dimensions are characteristics that describe individual objects or events. They allow us to group similar objects together and analyze them collectively. For example, when analyzing customer behavior, we may have dimensions such as age, gender, location, and purchase amount.

2.5 Coordinate Systems and Axes

Coordinate systems define where each dimension lies along the x-axis (horizontal axis), y-axis (vertical axis), and z-axis (depth/3D axis). Each chart has one primary coordinate system and zero or more secondary axes. The placement of each axis and its associated labels can significantly affect the readability of the graph. Commonly used coordinates systems are Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, and spherical.

2.6 Scale and Range

The scale refers to the relationship between the values displayed on the chart and their corresponding physical measurement units. For instance, on a temperature graph, the vertical axis represents degrees Celsius but the scale could be Fahrenheit or Kelvin depending on the user preference. Similarly, horizontal scales also affect the range of values shown on the chart. For instance, the highest point in a bar chart typically corresponds to a maximum value while the lowest point corresponds to a minimum value.


Now that we have covered some key concepts and terminology, let’s start exploring data visualization through practical examples.
