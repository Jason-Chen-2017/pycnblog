# 1.简介
  

Customer segmentation is an essential task in marketing and sales analytics that involves dividing customers into different groups based on their characteristics, behaviors, preferences or needs. In this article, we will discuss the concept of customer segmentation and learn how to implement hierarchical clustering for customer segmentation model building. 

# 2.基本概念及术语说明
## 2.1 Concepts and Terminology
- **Customer:** A person who has placed an order, made a purchase, subscribed to a service, applied for a product etc.  
- **Segmentation**: The process of dividing customers into various groups based on certain attributes such as age, gender, location, income level, interests, behavioral patterns etc.   
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: A cluster analysis method used to group similar objects together into clusters. It is widely used in industry for market research, finance, social media analysis, e-commerce and many other fields where data is unstructured and complex. Here's how it works:
     - Step 1: Start with all the objects (customers) in separate clusters. 
     - Step 2: Calculate the similarity between each object and merge the most similar ones until there is only one large cluster containing all objects. 
     - Step 3: Repeat step 2 recursively until no more merging can be done. 
 
- **Dendrogram** : A tree diagram showing the separation between clusters formed by hierarchical clustering algorithm. Each leaf node represents a single object, while intermediate nodes represent clusters formed by merging pairs of sub-clusters.
 
- **Silhouette score** : An evaluation metric used to evaluate the quality of partitioning produced by hierarchical clustering algorithms. The higher the silhouette value, the better the clustering result.
 
 
## 2.2 Algorithmic Steps
The following steps are involved in implementing a customer segmentation model using hierarchical clustering algorithm:

1. Data Preprocessing: This includes handling missing values, removing outliers, scaling/normalization if required. 

2. Feature Engineering: Select relevant features from raw dataset. For example, selecting demographic variables like age, gender, income level etc. 

3. Distance Calculation: Measure the distance between every pair of objects (customers). There are several ways to calculate distances including Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance etc. We use Euclidean distance here.

4. Linkage Criteria: Determine which two clusters should be merged next based on some criteria. Common options include minimum distance, maximum variance, average linkage, complete linkage etc. We choose median linkage because it balances compactness and separation among clusters.

5. Dendogram Creation: Create dendogram using scipy library. Visualize the separation between clusters to determine appropriate number of clusters.

6. Cluster Assignment: Assign each object to its corresponding cluster based on proximity and centroid position.

7. Silhouette Score Analysis: Evaluate the quality of clustering result using silhouette scores.

8. Segmentation Results Interpretation: Based on the results obtained from above steps, interpret segments to identify key factors contributing towards segment membership.  

9. Tuning Parameters: Depending on dataset size and complexity, tuning parameters like number of clusters, linkage criteria, distance measure may improve performance of clustering algorithm.

# 3. CODE IMPLEMENTATION IN PYTHON USING SCIPY LIBRARY
Here is the Python code implementation of hierarchical clustering algorithm for customer segmentation using Scipy Library: 

``` python
import numpy as np
from scipy.cluster import hierarchy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0],[4, 2], [4, 4], [4, 0]])

# Compute distance matrix
distance_matrix = np.zeros((len(X), len(X)))

for i in range(len(X)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(X)):
        distance_matrix[i][j] = np.linalg.norm(X[i]-X[j])

print("Distance Matrix:\n", distance_matrix)

# Perform Hierarchical Clustering
Z = hierarchy.linkage(distance_matrix,'median')

dendrogram = hierarchy.dendrogram(Z)

plt.title('Dendrogram')
plt.xlabel('Customers')
plt.ylabel('Euclidean Distances')
plt.show()

# Extract Clusters
clusters = hierarchy.fcluster(Z, t=1.5, criterion='distance')
print("Clusters:\n", clusters)

# Plot Clusters
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']

for color, c in zip(colors, set(clusters)):
    idx = np.where(np.array(clusters)==c)[0]
    ax.scatter([X[i][0] for i in idx], [X[i][1] for i in idx], c=color, label='Cluster '+str(c))
    
ax.legend()
plt.title('Clusters after Hierarchical Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Income')
plt.show()
```

In this implementation, we have generated sample data X consisting of six customers with age and income information. We then calculated the distance between every pair of objects (customers) using Euclidean distance and stored them in distance_matrix. Next, we performed hierarchical clustering using Median linkage criteria and plotted dendrogram to visualize the separation between clusters. Finally, we extracted clusters using fcluster function with threshold parameter t=1.5 and displayed scatter plots for each cluster.
