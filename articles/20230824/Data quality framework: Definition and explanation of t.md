Data Quality Management (DQM) is a critical process that ensures accurate and reliable data for decision making processes and other essential applications such as analytics and decision support systems. It plays an important role in ensuring the validity, accuracy, reliability, completeness, timeliness, and consistency of data used by business and societal organizations. 

In recent years, DQM has become a critical component in enterprise data infrastructure. With the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Big Data technologies, new challenges have emerged around managing large volumes of diverse and complex data sources.

To meet these demands, numerous frameworks have been proposed over the last few decades to manage different aspects of data quality, including entity resolution, attribute matching, duplicate detection, and anomaly detection. However, each of these frameworks has its own set of techniques and algorithms and it can be difficult to choose the right combination of techniques to best handle specific scenarios.

Therefore, there is a need for a unified framework or methodology that provides guidance on identifying the most effective techniques based on various criteria and requirements. This article will provide a general overview of data quality management frameworks and methods along with a detailed discussion of their key components and functionality. We will also demonstrate how these components can be combined into a comprehensive strategy to ensure high-quality data for a wide range of scenarios. The focus will be on providing insights and practical guidelines rather than exhaustive theoretical derivations. By covering multiple real-world examples and concrete problems faced by industry leaders, we hope this article will serve as a useful resource for practitioners and researchers alike.

2. Framework components and functionality
Before discussing the individual components and functionalities of data quality frameworks, let’s first define what data quality means. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary definition, data quality means "the condition of being relevant, useful, correct, current, trustworthy, accurate, and complete." These qualities are typically associated with any type of data gathered from any source and include structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Therefore, the overall objective of DQM should be to maintain the quality of all types of data while addressing the unique needs of individual business units and users.

Here are some of the key components and functionality of data quality frameworks:

2.1 Entity Resolution: Entity resolution refers to the process of resolving entities across datasets using common identifiers, attributes, or relationships between them. This involves linking instances of data records with similar characteristics so that you can identify and merge duplicates, incorrect values, and inconsistent representations. The primary goal of entity resolution is to eliminate redundancy and improve data quality by harmonizing disparate sources. There are several approaches to entity resolution, including simple string matching, record linkage, deduplication, and fuzzy matching.

2.2 Attribute Matching: Attribute matching refers to the process of comparing two or more datasets to determine if they have identical sets of attributes at a given level of detail. This helps to address issues related to inconsistencies in terminologies, definitions, and formats. One way to accomplish this task is to develop custom rules or templates to match attributes automatically using machine learning or statistical algorithms. Another approach is to build an ontology or taxonomy of valid terms and use it to validate and normalize data.

2.3 Duplicate Detection: Duplicate detection refers to the identification of identical or near-identical data records within a dataset. This helps to avoid redundant information in downstream analysis and reporting and improves data integrity and consistency. Several approaches exist for detecting duplicates, including exact matching, clustering, nearest neighbor search, and de-duplication based on similarity thresholds.

2.4 Anomaly Detection: Anomaly detection refers to the identification of patterns that are statistically significantly different from typical behavior. These outliers could indicate errors, missing data, or changes in data distribution over time. Common approaches to anomaly detection include clustering, principal component analysis, multivariate statistics, and algorithmic models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

2.5 Data Governance: Data governance involves maintaining control over data usage and sharing across teams and stakeholders. It requires establishing policies, procedures, tools, and resources for collecting, storing, analyzing, and publishing data. Key features of data governance include access controls, security measures, data provenance tracking, and automated alerts and notifications.

2.6 Data Visualization: Data visualization helps to understand trends, patterns, and relationships in data. It enables businesses to quickly identify areas of concern and make strategic decisions based on evidence-based findings. Data visualization tools commonly used for DQM include tableau, QlikView, Power BI, Tableau Public, and Google Data Studio. 

2.7 Reporting and Analytics: Reporting and analytics enable organizations to gain valuable insights from data. They provide actionable intelligence and enable decision-makers to make better-informed business decisions. Business reports often require integration of data from multiple sources, transformation and aggregation of data, and interactive visualizations. Many modern BI platforms offer advanced analytical capabilities, including machine learning, natural language processing, and geospatial analytics.

Overall, the components and functionality described above form the foundation for a robust data quality management framework. In practice, however, many companies may rely on existing solutions, integrating them into a single platform or ecosystem that addresses different parts of the data lifecycle. Furthermore, these components and functions may vary depending on the industry context and the specific goals of the company. Therefore, understanding the core concepts behind the different data quality management frameworks will help companies to choose the one that works best for their organization.
