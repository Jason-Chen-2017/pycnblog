# 1.简介
  

在自然语言处理（NLP）任务中，用词向量表示法是一种重要的方法。Word embeddings就是指把文本中的每个单词映射到一个固定维度的向量空间，这个向量空间可以用来表征该词语的特征。为了更好的理解这些向量及其特性，本文将从Bert、ELMo等代表性的神经网络模型入手，深入分析它们背后的表示学习理论，并结合代码展示如何训练、使用和评价这些模型。

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
- Word embedding: Word embeddings are a type of word representation used in natural language processing where words or phrases are mapped to vectors of real numbers. These vectors capture semantic relationships between the words within the same context. For example, “bank” and “river” may be close together in some contexts but far apart in others. In this sense, they represent different meanings, even though they have similar spelling.
- Embedding layer: An embedding layer is part of a neural network that takes an input vector and produces an output vector with fewer dimensions than the original input. It learns the mapping from one space to another based on training data. The goal is for the network to learn important features of language by learning patterns and correlations across inputs. This leads to better performance on downstream tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.
- Contextual embeddings: Contextual embeddings use both local and global information about the sentence or text at hand to create representations of each word. They encode not only the meaning of the word itself but also its surrounding context and potentially include additional information such as syntactic dependencies. Some popular models using these techniques include BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa.
- Language model: A language model is a statistical model that estimates the probability of occurrence of each word in a given sequence of words. By feeding a large corpus of text into a language model, it can generate new sentences that resemble the style and vocabulary of the original dataset. Some popular language models using deep learning techniques include LSTMs, transformers, and convolutional networks.

# 3.Core Algorithms and Operations
## Preprocessing
The first step in any NLP task is to preprocess the raw text data to convert them into numerical form suitable for modeling. There are several steps involved in preprocessing text data, including tokenization, normalization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and padding/truncating sequences. Here's how we can implement these steps in Python: 

```python
import string
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer


def tokenize(text):
    # Convert to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Remove punctuation characters
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    text = text.translate(translator)

    # Tokenize into words
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    
    # Remove stopwords
    stops = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stops]
    
    return tokens


def stem(tokens):
    porter = PorterStemmer()
    stems = []
    for token in tokens:
        stems.append(porter.stem(token))
    return stems


def lemmatize(tokens):
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    lemmas = []
    for token in tokens:
        lemmas.append(lemmatizer.lemmatize(token))
    return lemmas
```

After applying these functions to our text data, we get cleaned, tokenized versions of the text data. 

## Training and Evaluating BERT
To train and evaluate a pre-trained version of BERT, we need to follow these steps: 

1. Load the pre-trained BERT model weights and define the layers we want to fine-tune. 
2. Create a tokenizer object that will convert our text data into tokens that match the expected format of the BERT model. 
3. Define a DataLoader object that batches our data into mini-batches and allows us to iterate over them during training. 
4. Instantiate a loss function and optimizer to minimize the loss while updating the weights of the chosen layers. 
5. Train the model on the loaded dataset for a specified number of epochs. During training, monitor the accuracy and other metrics to ensure that the model does not overfit the training data. 
6. Evaluate the trained model on a held-out test set to measure its generalization performance. 
7. Repeat steps 1-6 until you find the best performing model.

Here's an implementation of all these steps in PyTorch: 

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

class TextDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, labels=None, max_len=128):
        self.texts = texts
        self.labels = labels
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
        self.max_len = max_len
        
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        text = self.texts[idx]
        inputs = self.tokenizer(
            text,
            truncation=True,
            padding='max_length',
            max_length=self.max_len,
            return_tensors="pt"
        )
        
        if self.labels is None:
            return {
                "input_ids": inputs["input_ids"].squeeze(),
                "attention_mask": inputs["attention_mask"].squeeze()
            }
        else:
            label = self.labels[idx]
            return {
                "input_ids": inputs["input_ids"].squeeze(),
                "attention_mask": inputs["attention_mask"].squeeze(),

```

In this code snippet, we load a pre-trained version of BERT (`bert-base-uncased`) and finetune the last classification layer for binary sentiment analysis (using a single `Positive` vs `Negative` label). We then create two DataLoaders - one for training and one for testing - and use cross-entropy loss and AdamW optimizer to train the model for three epochs. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the trained model on the test set and repeat this process until we find the best performing model.
