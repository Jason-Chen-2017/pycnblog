Automation refers to technology that eliminates or replaces some repetitive or time-consuming tasks by substituting them with machines that can do these tasks quickly and accurately. Over the years, several industries have benefited from this advancement in efficiency, such as transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, and education. However, the scope of automation has also expanded beyond just the replacement of manual labor with machines. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been shown to achieve significant advantages over humans in a wide range of tasks including language understanding, speech recognition, image processing, natural language generation, and decision-making. Therefore, it is not surprising that companies are exploring the use of AI for all aspects of their operations and business processes. One way to move towards full automation is through continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools, which help teams integrate new features into an application more frequently, detect errors early, and release updates promptly. Another option is using AI-powered assistants like Alexa or Google Home, who can provide personalized assistance and guidance even without being asked explicitly. Despite the benefits of fully automated systems, there are many challenges ahead to enable true full automation of businesses across various domains. This article focuses on one particular challenge — how far away from truly ‘full’ automation could we get? How long would it take before we complete our transition to a world without any human intervention? Let us dive deeper into the answer to this question. 

In order to explore whether or not we could truly automate everything, let us first break down what exactly constitutes 'automation'. According to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), automation consists of the following four core principles:

1. Procedural Automation: The ability to perform a task automatically, usually via computer programs, without human input except possibly a small amount of data entry. Examples include robotic process automation (RPA) software used in manufacturing and transportation; self-driving cars; autonomous vehicles; and digital assistants. 

2. Perceptual Automation: The capability of a machine to recognize patterns, objects, sounds, smells, and other sensory information and respond accordingly. Examples include virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Siri; smart cameras and video recorders; and security systems. 

3. Cognitive Automation: The capacity of a machine to mimic certain behaviors, emotions, and mental states. These behaviors may involve reasoning, planning, problem solving, learning, memory, and perception. Examples include chatbots, personal assistants, and conversational agents. 

4. Mental Simulation: A machine that exhibits traits similar to those of a person, allowing individuals to interact more naturally with machines than they otherwise could. Examples include spoken dialogues between people and machines.

These principles cover different areas of automation such as programming, machine vision, conversational interfaces, and neurological simulation. Together, they define the basic elements required for successful automation.

While most organizations consider automation a matter of course, few actually measure its progress or implications holistically. Researchers at Georgia Tech conducted a survey amongst US consumers and found that while half of American adults said they wish their jobs were replaced by machines, only three percent thought so would be feasible within their lifetimes. Companies must continue to invest in building out robust AI infrastructure that enables advanced automation capabilities and continues to develop applications that offer useful and transformative services. Even if we achieve ultimate automation of everyday tasks, however, the rate at which we become proficient and productive will still be limited by both our current abilities and the speed at which new technologies arrive. As an industry, we must continually strive to improve our skills and capacities, leveraging technological advancements alongside industry best practices to meet customer needs and maintain competitive advantage. Without proper strategy and investment in fundamental automation fundamentals, though, the overall outcome could prove to be a lot less satisfying. Thus, it is crucial to closely monitor and understand the pace at which automation is evolving and the opportunities and risks associated with each aspect of the automating equation.
