In this blog post we will explore the differences between decision trees and support vector machines (SVM) when it comes to classification problems. We will also discuss when to use each algorithm for a specific task or dataset. 

Decision trees are widely used in machine learning for both regression and classification tasks. However, they may not be as effective compared to SVMs in terms of accuracy on complex datasets with many features and irregular distribution. Therefore, understanding their pros and cons can help us determine whether to choose one over the other depending on our requirements.

Support Vector Machines (SVM), on the other hand, have been around since the early days of machine learning research. They work well even on high-dimensional data sets, making them ideal for applications such as image recognition, text analysis, and natural language processing. In addition, SVMs offer more interpretable results than decision trees because they break down feature interactions into simpler linear decision boundaries that correspond to the hyperplane separating different classes. 

So why do some people prefer using decision trees over SVMs? Well, there are several reasons:

1. **Speed**: Decision trees can handle large amounts of data quickly due to its top-down approach where each branch is determined before moving further down the tree. This makes them very efficient compared to SVMs, which use kernel functions to transform input variables into higher dimensional spaces so that they can fit better. Additionally, decision trees are often faster to train than SVMs, especially if we have limited computational resources. 

2. **Interpretability**: Decision trees provide clear and transparent explanations of how predictions were made based on the attributes we chose during training. While SVMs provide coefficients that indicate how important each attribute was in determining the class assignment, they lack any visual representation like what decision boundary they form. Furthermore, decision trees can capture non-linear relationships within the data while still being able to classify new samples accurately.

3. **Handling Irregular Data Sets:** Decision trees are less prone to overfitting issues than SVMs. Since each node in the tree is only responsible for predicting one outcome, we need fewer nodes to get accurate predictions. Also, decision trees don’t require scaling or normalization of data before fitting, allowing them to handle irregularly distributed data effectively. On the contrary, SVMs are sensitive to variations in scale and require careful preprocessing steps to normalize the data before fitting. 

4. **Feature Selection:** In decision trees, we can prune branches or selectively split nodes according to the importance of individual attributes by analyzing the information gain. This helps reduce overfitting and improve the overall performance of the model. Similarly, SVMs can perform feature selection automatically through the use of regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 norms.

5. **Nonparametric Models:** Despite their popularity, decision trees have limitations when dealing with non-linear relationships or highly imbalanced datasets. As mentioned earlier, decision trees are binary classifiers that output either 0 or 1 whereas SVMs can handle multiple classes and outputs continuous values corresponding to the confidence level in each class. Nonetheless, decision trees may still be useful in certain scenarios where we want to make probabilistic predictions about the class probabilities.  

Overall, decision trees and SVMs have their own strengths and weaknesses that depend on the type of problem we are trying to solve and the size and complexity of the dataset. In conclusion, choosing the right algorithm depends on various factors including domain knowledge, computational resources available, preferences of the user, and required level of interpretability and flexibility. Deciding between the two algorithms should not come at the expense of accuracy but rather, tradeoffs that reflect the relative merits of each methodology.  


# 2. Decision Tree Algorithm 
## Introduction to Decision Trees
A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like structure to represent an object mapping from inputs to outputs. It starts with a root node that represents the whole population or sample. Each child node splits the population based on a categorical or numerical attribute, leading to a subtree that defines its own rules. These recursive partitionings continue until each leaf node belongs to one of the possible outcomes. The final prediction is obtained by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node that matches the given test observation. Among other things, decision trees are capable of handling both categorical and numerical data types, multi-class classification, and missing data imputation.

The idea behind decision trees is to create a series of simple questions designed to ask a subset of the most relevant attributes of the data, which lead to the predicted result. At each step of the process, the algorithm selects the attribute that appears most informative, splits the data into groups, creates subsets for each group, and evaluates the effectiveness of each subset based on the target variable. Once all observations have been evaluated, the algorithm chooses the "best" attribute and threshold to split the data and moves on to the next layer of the tree. The final classification is made by following the path taken through the tree. 



The above illustration shows a simplified version of a decision tree for a binary classification problem. The root node asks if today's weather is sunny or cloudy, then branches off into three subtrees representing the groups of users who meet those criteria. For each group, the algorithm continues to ask simple questions to narrow down the membership, until finally deciding on a single predicted category for that group. The blue arrows denote positive classification, and red arrows negative classification.

## How Do Decision Trees Work?
In general, decision trees work by recursively partitioning the data into smaller and smaller subsets, testing each subset to see which attribute and value gives the highest accuracy in classifying the observations. The process stops when all observations belong to the same class or when a predetermined stopping criterion has been met, typically by reaching a minimum node size or depth limit. The final set of decisions is represented by the sequence of questions asked along the way, known as a decision path.

There are several approaches to construct decision trees, such as ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) and C4.5, which build a tree top-down by selecting the attribute that maximizes information gain, CART (Classification And Regression Tree), which partitions the data into regions based on the mean value of each predictor variable, CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector), which constructs a hierarchy of nested models based on feature interaction effects, and PSM (Passive-Aggressive Model) which adjusts the weights of misclassified examples during training.

Once constructed, decision trees can easily be interpreted and displayed graphically using various visualization methods, such as dot plots, box plots, or rule lists. In fact, decision trees can be considered a versatile tool for exploratory data analysis, enabling analysts to identify patterns and trends in the underlying data without relying on statistical tests or hypothesis-driven modeling techniques.

However, decision trees suffer from several drawbacks, mainly related to overfitting and noise. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. To combat overfitting, decision trees use regularization techniques such as pruning or bagging, which shrink the decision tree by removing branches that do not contribute significantly to the accuracy of the model. Other strategies include increasing the number of attributes selected for splitting, setting a maximum tree depth, or reducing the fraction of the data included in each split. Finally, decision trees can also be biased towards predicting the majority class, which can be addressed by using more advanced techniques such as cost-sensitive learning or adapting the sampling strategy.
