Netflix Movie recommender system is a personalized recommendation engine that predicts which movies users might like based on their past behavior and preferences. It is widely used by millions of people across different industries such as streaming services, e-commerce platforms, social media sites, and news organizations. The goal of the project is to provide relevant movie recommendations for individual users who have already consumed some content in order to improve engagement and retention rates while enhancing user experience and satisfaction levels. 

In this paper we will discuss how Netflix recommends movies to its customers using collaborative filtering algorithm, specifically the matrix factorization technique. We will also explore various techniques like bias correction and item recommendation exploration to address shortcomings of traditional collaborative filtering algorithms. Finally, we will evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed approach compared with other popular recommendation systems.

## Matrix Factorization Technique
The Matrix Factorization (MF) technique is commonly used in Collaborative Filtering (CF) models for recommending items to users. In MF, we represent each user and item as vectors of latent factors, where each element represents the strength of a particular factor associated with both user and item. These latent factors are estimated from the training data through optimization methods. Then, given a new user or an unseen item, we can make predictions about what those factors would be if they had been known beforehand. This allows us to recommend new items that users may not have liked previously but could potentially be interesting due to similar interests between them. The basic idea behind matrix factorization is to decompose the rating matrix R into two matrices: X and Y, where X[i] corresponds to the vector representation of user i and Y[j] corresponds to the vector representation of item j. We optimize the loss function over these two matrices so that the predicted ratings r_ij can be accurately recovered from the dot product of X[i] and Y[j].

We assume that there exist two low rank matrices A and B such that X = A*B^T. We use SVD to factorize the input matrix into three smaller matrices U, Sigma, Vt. Since A and B share same dimensions as number of features, the rank of A and B depends on the size of the dataset. Larger values of k correspond to larger subspaces learned by the model and can lead to more accurate representations. But it also leads to higher computational cost during training and prediction time.

## Explicit vs Implicit Feedback
There are several types of feedback available in CF applications. Some examples include explicit feedback where users express their preferences for certain items directly, implicit feedback where users implicitly rate or endorse specific items without providing any direct feedback, and contextual feedback where users provide additional information related to the items being recommended. Depending on the type of feedback available, CF approaches may vary accordingly. Traditional CF algorithms work only with explicit feedback as they require users to provide numerical ratings for each item that indicates their preference level towards the corresponding item. However, recent advances in deep learning based recommendation systems have shown promise in dealing with sparse and high dimensional datasets with implicit feedback as well. Contextual feedback is typically incorporated into the recommendation system either as side information or feature embeddings to capture more fine grained interactions between users and items. Here, we focus primarily on explicit feedback scenario since it is commonplace in most applications.

## Item Recommendation Exploration
Item recommendation exploration refers to an approach where instead of just recommending the top-k most popular items to every user, we find diverse and unexpected recommendations by exploring the preferences of previous users and integrating them into the current recommendation process. One example of such an approach is EASE, developed at Microsoft Research Asia, where the algorithm generates recommendations based on the weighted sum of preferences obtained from multiple distinct models trained on historical interaction data. Another approach called ReCoRD explores relationships between items to create cohesive groups that users find familiar despite being separated in space. Both of these techniques aim to help users discover new and unexpected items beyond their initial set of recommendations.
