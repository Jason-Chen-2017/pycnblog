# 2.基本概念术语说明
## Augmented Reality(增强现实)
In augmented reality (AR), virtual objects, images, or even sounds are overlaid on top of the real world. Users see and interact with both the real and virtual world as if it were one unified whole. The goal is to provide a compelling way to interact with complex systems, environments, and applications without requiring specialized hardware or expensive external sensors.

增强现实（AR）是指在真实世界之上叠加虚拟物体、图像甚至声音的一种技术。用户既可以看到真实世界，也可以与虚拟世界进行交互。目的是提供一种让复杂系统、环境和应用程序感知融合、无缝协作的方式。而不需要特定的硬件或昂贵外设。

## Augmented Reality App(增强现实应用)
An augmented reality application is any mobile app that uses technologies such as camera tracking, location detection, computer vision algorithms, and OpenGL rendering to overlay virtual content onto a user's view of the real world. AR apps often have a wide range of use cases including entertainment, education, healthcare, manufacturing, productivity, and transportation. Some examples include Snapchat filters, Lyft self-driving cars, and Gboard keyboard extensions.

增强现实应用是指采用相机追踪、地理定位、计算机视觉算法和OpenGL渲染技术的移动应用。它能够将虚拟内容叠加到真实世界的用户视野中，并对其进行交互。主要用于娱乐、教育、医疗、制造、生产力和运输领域。其中有些应用如Snapchat滤镜、Lyft自动驾驶汽车等，还有一些产品如Gboard键盘扩展。

## SceneKit(SceneKit)
SceneKit is Apple’s built-in graphics and rendering engine for building virtual reality and AR applications. It includes powerful APIs for rendering scenes from various sources, such as obj-cassets, SCNAssets catalog files, and glTF models. Developers can create 3D models and animations programmatically or through prebuilt assets provided by Apple. SceneKit also supports physics simulation and sound effects.

SceneKit 是苹果自带的构建虚拟现实和增强现实应用的图形渲染引擎。它提供了丰富的API接口来渲染各种来源的场景，比如Objective-C资产文件、SCNAssets目录文件、glTF模型等。通过程序化创建、或者Apple提供的预建模型动画，开发者可以轻松创造出精美的三维效果。SceneKit还支持物理模拟和声音效果。

## ARKit(ARKit)
ARKit is Apple’s platform for developing augmented reality apps on iOS devices. It offers advanced scene understanding capabilities for tracking movement, recognizing objects, and generating anchor points for placing virtual content. ARKit works seamlessly on different types of devices ranging from iPhone SE to iPad Pro, and has been optimized for performance across multiple device configurations.

ARKit 是苹果针对iOS设备上的增强现实应用的平台。它提供了高级的场景理解能力，用来跟踪移动、识别对象、生成锚点放置虚拟内容。不同型号的设备之间都能流畅运行，性能也得到了优化。

## Camera Tracking(相机追踪)
Camera tracking refers to the process of determining the position of an object in relation to the camera lens in an AR app. This enables us to place virtual content directly in front of the real world to enhance realism and make it feel like part of the environment rather than floating in midair. There are two main types of camera tracking: World tracking and Localized AR.

相机追踪是指确定相机镜头下某物体的位置，这是AR应用中非常重要的一个过程。它使得我们能够直接将虚拟内容放在真实环境中，给予其真实感并赋予其一种像是真实世界的一部分的感觉。相机追踪有两种主要类型：全景追踪和本地化AR。

### World Tracking(全景追踪)
World tracking is used for tracking the motion and orientation of the real-world around us, allowing us to place virtual content anywhere within the field of view of our camera. World tracking involves taking multiple videos with each frame showing a slightly different perspective depending on where the camera is pointing at. This allows for highly detailed and immersive visual experiences, but comes at a significant cost in terms of battery usage and accuracy.

全景追踪（World Tracking）是指跟踪我们周围的真实世界的运动和姿态变化，使得我们可以在摄像头视野范围内任意位置放置虚拟内容。全景追踪需要使用多个视频帧，每一帧都显示一个略微不同的视角，这使得AR应用呈现出高度细腻的视觉体验，但同时也会消耗较多的电量和准确度。

### Localized AR(本地化AR)
Localized AR is similar to world tracking in that it leverages motion tracking to determine the location of an object relative to the camera, but instead of looking at a general sense of the real-world, localized AR only looks towards a specific point of interest. This allows for higher precision and faster reaction times, but also requires specialized hardware or additional resources to achieve accurate results. Examples of localized AR include Apple Maps navigation and Airbnb booking apps.

本地化AR类似于全景追踪，利用运动跟踪功能来确定对象相对于摄像头的位置。但是与全景追踪不同，它仅仅查看某一特定地标而不是整张真实世界，这使得精准定位更快捷。此外，还需要一些特殊的硬件或资源才能获得较高的精度。本地化AR的典型例子如苹果Maps导航和Airbnb预订应用。

## Object Recognition(对象识别)
Object recognition is the process of identifying and classifying physical objects in the real-world in order to interact with them. One approach to object recognition is using feature matching techniques, which compare detected features between the real-world and virtual content to identify what was being seen. Other approaches involve detecting specific patterns or textures that distinguish different objects from each other, making it possible to recognize their purposes and behaviors.

对象识别是指识别并分类真实世界中的物体。其中一种方法是基于特征匹配技术，这种方法通过比较检测到的特征来识别真实世界中出现的是什么。其他的方法则依赖于识别特定的模式或纹理来区分不同对象的用途和行为。

## Environment Understanding(环境理解)
Environment understanding refers to the ability to understand the physical characteristics of the space surrounding an AR app’s user, enabling us to simulate natural interaction with the real world while still maintaining the appearance of immersion. This includes understanding the type of floor coverings, walls, and obstacles present, as well as the directional lighting conditions and texture of surfaces.

环境理解是指了解用户周边空间的物理特征，以便在保持沉浸感的情况下模拟自然交互。这里包括了解地板、墙壁和障碍物的类型、光照条件及表面的纹理。

## Image Processing(图像处理)
Image processing is the technique of applying mathematical operations to digital photographs or video frames in order to extract useful information. It is used extensively in AR apps for analyzing the quality and depth of the virtual content, enhancing its appearance and creating feedback loops between the real and virtual worlds. Some key areas of image processing include geometric analysis, color analysis, shape detection, and segmentation.

图像处理（Image Processing）是指将数字图片或视频序列的数学运算结果作为输出。在AR应用中，图像处理被广泛用于分析虚拟内容的质量和深度，并增强它的真实感，并且产生了真实世界与虚拟世界之间的反馈闭环。图像处理的关键点包括几何分析、颜色分析、形状检测与分割等。

## Light Estimation(光估计)
Light estimation is the process of estimating the ambient illumination level of an area around an AR app’s user based on the camera feed. By knowing this level, we can adjust the brightness, contrast, and colors of our virtual content accordingly, providing a more engaging and immersive user experience. Light estimation involves capturing photos and measuring the intensity of each pixel, which is then processed to estimate the overall ambient illumination level. Different algorithms exist for different levels of complexity and accuracy.

光估计（Light Estimation）是指通过摄像头获取图像后，分析图片的环境光照明情况，从而确定目标区域的环境光强度。通过获取的环境光照明信息，我们可以调整虚拟内容的亮度、对比度和色彩，从而为用户提供更具吸引力且沉浸感的体验。光估计（Light Estimation）涉及拍照、计算各像素强度值，再对数据进行处理，获取环境光照明信息。存在多种不同的算法，其复杂程度和精度由需求决定。

## Feature Point Detection(特征点检测)
Feature point detection refers to the process of identifying distinctive regions in an image or video sequence that represent important features, typically corners or edges. These points are used to track movements and orientations of the real-world objects placed in the virtual content, leading to a more natural and responsive interface. A wide variety of algorithms exists for detecting features, ranging from simple edge detectors to deep neural networks.

特征点检测（Feature Point Detection）是指在一组图像或视频序列中识别出显著的特征区域，通常为角点或边缘。特征点检测的作用是跟踪物体移动和朝向，从而实现更自然及即时的互动。目前已有的很多算法均可用于检测特征点，如简单边缘检测器到深层神经网络等。
