# 1.简介
  

Multi-task learning (MTL) has been proved to be a powerful tool for solving complex problems with multiple objectives or tasks simultaneously and jointly. The core idea of MTL is that the learner should learn to predict several related but independent tasks in an efficient way using shared features learned from different tasks to address all tasks together at once. However, how can we design our network architecture to optimize partial label correlation matrices? In this article, we will analyze the theoretical foundation behind multi-task learning based on partially labeled data, which includes some basic concepts and terminology, followed by detailed explanations of our proposed approach and its mathematics, implementation, evaluation results, and future directions. 

# 2.相关术语
Multi-task learning: A machine learning technique that trains one model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously without sharing any information between them.

Partial label correlation matrix (PLCM): A matrix that measures the degree of association among pairs of tasks when only a subset of labels are available for each task pair. Specifically, the PLCM quantifies the dependence between two tasks when certain conditions hold such as common input space and shared output space.

Correlation coefficient: An index that measures the linear relationship between variables, often used in regression analysis. Here, we use it to measure the strength and direction of the dependency between two tasks.

Conditional probability distribution: A mathematical expression that defines the likelihood of an event given previous events, usually represented by P(A|B). We represent the conditional probabilities between two tasks as follows:

   - P(Y_i=y_i|X_j=x_j) for i = j, where Y_i denotes the label of task i and X_j denotes the input of task j
   - P(Y_i=y_i|X_j!=x_j), where i!= j, conditioned on the other inputs being fixed

Mutual information: Another statistical measure that captures the degree of mutual dependence between two random variables. It is calculated using entropy values and joint distributions.

Entropy value: The uncertainty in a variable's outcome expressed in bits, defined as H(p)=-∑pi*log(pi) over all possible outcomes p. Entropy values range from 0 to log2(n), where n is the number of outcomes. Lower entropy indicates more certainty, while higher entropy indicates less certainty. For example, if there are two equally likely outcomes, then their entropy value is equal to log2(2). If both outcomes have equal probability, their entropy is maximized.

Joint distribution: A table showing the frequency of occurrences of combinations of outcomes for two or more random variables. Used to calculate conditional probability distributions and mutual information.

# 3.核心算法原理
In Multi-Task learning, we want to train a single model to solve multiple tasks simultaneously. The crucial challenge here is that not all tasks share the same input and output space, making it difficult to combine these tasks into a unified representation. One approach to handle this problem is Partial label correlation matrix optimization (PLCO), a framework that optimizes the partial label correlation matrices instead of optimizing a global objective function. 

The general goal of PLCO is to find the set of optimal weights for the network parameters so that the predicted outputs of each task match the target outputs accurately under the constraints of correlated partial targets. To achieve this, we formulate an optimization problem that involves finding the weights w that maximize the accuracy of predictions for unlabeled examples x and corresponding ground truth y. Our approach exploits the fact that, in most cases, the partial label correlation matrix is sparse because most labels are missing for some tasks. Therefore, we can factorize the loss function into three parts depending on whether we have full labeling or incomplete labeling, and apply different optimization methods accordingly. 

The first part of the loss function calculates the cross-entropy error term for each task separately, taking into account the mismatched partial targets. This term depends on the softmax activation of the last layer of the network and uses the categorical cross-entropy loss function. The second part of the loss function consists of regularization terms that penalize large weight values to avoid overfitting and improve the stability of training. These terms include L2 norm of weights and dropout regularization. Finally, we add a penalty term to discourage co-adaptation of tasks through cross-talk effects.

To optimize the PLCM, we use an iterative algorithm called Gradient Descent with Lazy Evaluation (GDL-LE). GDL-LE updates the network weights sequentially, considering only the current task and its dependencies on previous tasks. When calculating the gradient, we take into account the impact of adding new units, updating old ones, and modifying existing connections. By storing previously computed gradients, GDL-LE avoids redundant computations and improves performance significantly. Additionally, we also introduce lazy evaluation to reduce memory usage and make computation faster, especially when dealing with large networks and small mini-batches.

# 4.具体算法实现
## 4.1.数据集准备
We start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset. In this demo, we use the UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains binary classification labels for 30 breast cancer patients across 9 attributes. Each attribute represents a biomarker used to diagnose breast cancer, including ten real-valued features and an indicator variable indicating whether the patient had metastatic cance or not.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

bc = datasets.load_breast_cancer()
x, y = bc.data, bc.target
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
num_tasks = 3 # Number of tasks to consider
num_classes = 2 # Number of classes per task
input_dim = len(x[0]) # Input dimensionality of each task
output_dim = num_tasks * num_classes # Output dimensionality for multitask learning
batch_size = 32 # Batch size for stochastic gradient descent
epochs = 100 # Maximum number of epochs to run training for
learning_rate = 0.01 # Learning rate for stochastic gradient descent
```

## 4.2.网络结构设计
Next, we define the neural network architecture for the multitask learning task. We use a simple fully connected neural network with ReLU activation functions applied after hidden layers. We initialize the weights randomly using truncated normal distribution and bias vectors initialized to zeros.

```python
class MTNet(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MTNet, self).__init__()

        self.fc1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.fc2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.fc3 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, x):
        h = self.fc1(x)
        h = self.fc2(h)
        return self.fc3(h)
```

## 4.3.损失函数设计
Then, we implement the cost function and regularization terms for the multitask learning task. The cost function computes the average cross-entropy loss for all tasks, incorporating the partial label correlation matrix along with the standard cross-entropy errors. The regularization terms prevent overfitting and improve the stability of training.

```python
def get_loss_function():
    
    def plcm_cost(logits, y_true, task_ids):
        
        """Calculate the cross-entropy loss for individual tasks"""
        
        batch_size, total_num_classes = logits.shape[:2]
        y_true = tf.cast(tf.one_hot(tf.squeeze(y_true[:, task_ids]), depth=total_num_classes // num_tasks, axis=-1), dtype=tf.float32)

        ce_loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_true, logits=logits)
        ce_loss = tf.reduce_mean(ce_loss, name='cross_entropy_loss_' + '_'.join([str(tid) for tid in task_ids]))

        return ce_loss

    def loss_fn(model, x, y_true):
        
        """Calculate the overall loss for the entire multitask learning model"""
        
        logits = model(x)
        task_ids = [0]
        prev_task_id = task_ids[-1]
        
        for i in range(1, num_tasks):
            curr_task_id = i
            
            if i == num_tasks - 1 or abs(curr_task_id - prev_task_id) >= 2:
                ce_loss = plcm_cost(logits[:, :num_classes], y_true[:, :num_classes], task_ids)
                l2_loss = sum([tf.nn.l2_loss(w) for w in model.weights]) / len(model.weights)
                
                tf.summary.scalar('cross_entropy_loss', ce_loss)
                tf.summary.scalar('l2_loss', l2_loss)
                return ce_loss + 1e-4 * l2_loss
            
            else:
                prev_task_id = curr_task_id
                task_ids += [curr_task_id]
                ce_loss = plcm_cost(logits[:, curr_task_id * num_classes:(curr_task_id+1) * num_classes], 
                                     y_true[:, curr_task_id * num_classes:(curr_task_id+1) * num_classes], [prev_task_id])

                l2_loss = sum([tf.nn.l2_loss(w) for w in model.weights[:-4]]) / len(model.weights[:-4])
                
                tf.summary.scalar('cross_entropy_loss_' + str(curr_task_id), ce_loss)
                tf.summary.scalar('l2_loss_' + str(curr_task_id), l2_loss)
                    
                logits[:, :(curr_task_id) * num_classes] -= tf.stop_gradient((1/len(task_ids))*(logits[:, :(curr_task_id) * num_classes] * tf.expand_dims(plcm[curr_task_id][:, :, prev_task_id], axis=0)))
                logits[:, curr_task_id * num_classes:(curr_task_id+1) * num_classes] *= tf.expand_dims(plcm[curr_task_id][:, :, prev_task_id], axis=0)
        
        ce_loss = plcm_cost(logits[:, :-num_classes], y_true[:, :-num_classes], list(range(num_tasks)))
        l2_loss = sum([tf.nn.l2_loss(w) for w in model.weights[:-4]]) / len(model.weights[:-4])
                
        tf.summary.scalar('cross_entropy_loss_' + 'full_label', ce_loss)
        tf.summary.scalar('l2_loss_' + 'full_label', l2_loss)
            
        return ce_loss + 1e-4 * l2_loss
    
    return loss_fn
```

## 4.4.训练模型
Finally, we define the optimizer and compile the model before training it on the dataset. During training, we monitor the cross-entropy losses for all tasks and evaluate the performance on the validation set. We print out the progress every few steps and save checkpoints whenever the validation accuracy reaches a new high score. Once training is complete, we load the best checkpoint and compute the final test accuracy.

```python
mtnet = MTNet()

optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(lr=learning_rate)

@tf.function
def train_step(x_batch, y_batch):
    
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        loss_value = loss_fn(mtnet, x_batch, y_batch)
        
    grads = tape.gradient(loss_value, mtnet.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, mtnet.trainable_variables))
    return loss_value

best_val_acc = float('-inf')
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer, model=mtnet)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    
    loss_tracker = []
    step = 0
    
    for x_batch, y_batch in zip(dataset['x_train'], dataset['y_train']):
    
        loss_value = train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
        loss_tracker.append(loss_value)
        step += 1
        
        if step % 50 == 0:
        
            mean_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_tracker).numpy().tolist()
            print("Epoch {}, Step {}, Loss {}".format(epoch, step, mean_loss))
            writer.add_scalar('Loss/train', mean_loss, epoch * len(dataset['x_train']) + step)
            writer.flush()
            loss_tracker = []
        
    val_accuracy = evaluate(dataset['x_val'], dataset['y_val'])
    
    if val_accuracy > best_val_acc:
        best_val_acc = val_accuracy
        checkpoint.save('./checkpoints/mtnet/'+'multitask.ckpt')
    
writer.close()

checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint('./checkpoints/mtnet'))
print("\nTest Accuracy:", evaluate(dataset['x_test'], dataset['y_test']))
```
