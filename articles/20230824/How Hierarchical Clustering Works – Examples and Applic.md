# 1.简介
  

Hierarchical clustering is a popular technique for finding clusters in data sets. In this article we will understand how hierarchical clustering works step by step and also see some examples of its use cases along with common questions asked around it. Finally, we will conclude our discussion with an overview of the current state-of-the-art research progress and future directions to be explored. 

# 2.Background Introduction
In computer science, hierarchical clustering refers to a set of algorithms that groups similar objects into groups based on their relationships or distance between them. It is often used to discover structures in complex datasets. The main goal of hierarchical clustering is to group the items together into meaningful groups, where each group contains only members that are very similar to each other.

The two most commonly used methods for hierarchical clustering are Agglomerative (bottom up) and Divisive (top down). These two approaches differ in the order in which they merge or split the cluster hierarchy. In agglomerative clustering, all the elements start as individual clusters and pairs of clusters are merged iteratively until there is only one big cluster containing all the original points. In divisive clustering, initially every object forms its own cluster and then clusters are gradually divided into smaller subclusters, eventually producing a tree-like structure with all leaf nodes being individual items.

Hierarchical clustering can have different ways of measuring similarity or dissimilarity among the items. Three commonly used measures are Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Chebyshev distance. Other notable distances include Mahalanobis distance, Minkowski distance, Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, etc.

Finally, hierarchical clustering has applications across many fields such as image analysis, text mining, bioinformatics, social network analysis, market segmentation, and gene expression profiling.

# 3.Basic Concepts and Terminology
We need to understand several concepts before moving forward with the algorithm:

1. Dendogram: A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram showing the relationship between the different levels of clusters formed during hierarchical clustering. Each branch represents the merging of two clusters at a particular level of separation.

2. Distance Matrix: A distance matrix shows the pairwise distance between each item in the dataset. It is usually computed using one of the standard distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or Chebyshev. 

3. Linkage Criteria: Different linkage criteria define how the clusters should be linked or merged during the hierarchical clustering process. There are four basic types of linkage criteria:

   * Single linkage: This criterion selects the pair of closest items from any two clusters and links them together to form a new cluster.
   * Complete linkage: This criterion selects the pair of farthest items from any two clusters and links them together to form a new cluster.
   * Group average linkage: This criterion takes the average of all the items in both clusters and calculates the distance between the resulting centroids.
   * Centroid linkage: This criterion finds the center of mass of both clusters and uses it to calculate the distance between the two centroids.
   
# 4.Core Algorithm and Operations
Now let's look at how exactly the core hierarchical clustering algorithm works and what operations it performs:

1. Initially, each item becomes its own separate cluster.

2. Pairwise comparisons are made between each pair of clusters to find the smallest distance between their respective items. 

3. Two clusters are merged by combining their respective items according to the selected linkage method.

4. Steps 2 through 3 are repeated until no more clusters can be combined without increasing the overall intra-cluster variance. At this point, the final grouping of items is known as the "dendrogram".

5. To get the actual list of clusters, extract each successively larger cluster from the bottom of the dendrogram and assign it a unique ID number.

6. To determine if two items belong to the same cluster, compare their corresponding IDs. If they share the same ID, they belong to the same cluster. Otherwise, they do not.

Here is a visual representation of the steps involved:


# 5.Examples & Use Cases
Let us now discuss some examples and use cases of hierarchical clustering:

1. Image Segmentation: One application of hierarchical clustering is image segmentation, where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions that are homogeneously colored and well-defined. For example, consider an image of a carpet, which consists of tiled textures that may or may not resemble a solid color. We could use hierarchical clustering to segment the image into distinct regions, perhaps separating out the tiles and the background.

2. Text Mining: Another important application of hierarchical clustering involves analyzing large collections of documents. Some of these documents might describe the same topic or theme but written in varying formats and styles. Hierarchical clustering can help organize the documents into coherent groups that are related to each other.

3. Market Segmentation: With the advent of Big Data technologies, market segmentation has become an important problem in various industries like finance, retail, healthcare, and transportation. Hierarchical clustering can be applied to identify similar customers who purchase goods and services from the same industry sector. By categorizing customers based on their purchasing behavior, businesses can target marketing campaigns accordingly.

4. Gene Expression Profiling: Similarly, in biology, hierarchical clustering can be used to identify different cell populations based on their transcriptome profiles. Assuming that we have sequenced millions of cells, we can group them into clusters based on their gene expression patterns. By identifying similar gene expression profiles within each cluster, we can identify putative disease risk factors or regulatory networks underlying the cellular processes responsible for the phenotype observed.

# 6.Unsolved Issues and Future Directions
As with any machine learning algorithm, there exist numerous challenges associated with applying hierarchical clustering to real-world problems. Here are some unsolved issues and future directions:

1. Time Complexity: The time complexity of hierarchical clustering depends heavily on the size of the input data, the choice of linkage method, and the quality of the initial clustering. Typically, hierarchical clustering algorithms take O(N^3) time complexity, where N is the number of items in the dataset. However, significant improvements have been made recently thanks to advancements in parallel processing techniques, particularly GPU acceleration.

2. Overfitting: When performing hierarchical clustering, it is possible to create overly fine-grained clusters that contain only few items. This leads to poor performance when making predictions on new, unseen instances because the model does not adapt well to the new data distribution. Therefore, it is essential to apply regularization techniques such as cross-validation or cost-sensitive learning to address this issue. 

3. Interpretability: Despite recent advances in deep learning models, it remains challenging to interpret the results of hierarchical clustering due to its non-linear nature. Nonetheless, there exists some interpretable clustering models such as DBSCAN and Mean Shift that provide simplified representations of the clusters while still preserving the original features of the data.
