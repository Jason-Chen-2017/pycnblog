# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. In this article we will implement the SVM model using Python programming language. Before going deep into the topic let’s first understand what SVM is? What are its basic concepts? Do you have any questions before moving forward with the tutorial? 

# Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. It is a type of supervised learning that can be used for both classification or regression problems. The goal of the algorithm is to find the hyperplane that separates the data points effectively so that new observations get classified correctly. In other words, it helps to classify the input data based on their features by finding the best hyperplane or decision boundary. 

The key idea behind SVM is the use of margin. A hyperplane is defined as the set of all possible linear combinations of some variables plus a constant term. This means that we want to maximize the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data point. By doing this, we ensure that our classification function will generalize well on unseen data.

So, what makes up an effective hyperplane in SVM? Let's break down the components of SVM:

1. Data Points
These are the instances that need to be classified. They represent the raw data which contains multiple attributes like gender, age, income, etc. 

2. Hyperplane 
A hyperplane is defined as the set of all possible linear combinations of some variables plus a constant term. There may exist many such hyperplanes depending on how complex the dataset is. We try to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the different classes of data points. In other words, the hyperplane should give us the maximum number of correct classifications possible.

3. Margin 
Margin represents the minimum distance between two data points when they are classified incorrectly. The larger the margin value, the more difficult it becomes to misclassify the data points. If there exists no clear distinction between the two classes, then there won't be any margins available and hence there would not be any hyperplane to separate them. Hence, SVM tries to maximize the margin between these two classes.

4. Loss Function
We use a loss function to measure the performance of the SVM classifier. This function takes into account the misclassification error between the predicted labels and true labels and penalizes the classifier if it is performing poorly. Common loss functions include hinge loss, squared hinge loss, and epsilon-insensitive loss.

5. Regularization Parameter C
This parameter controls the tradeoff between trying to fit the training data exactly and allowing the algorithm to avoid overfitting the data. When C is large, the penalty term is small and the algorithm prefers a simpler solution that fits the data closely. On the other hand, a smaller C value corresponds to a more complex solution that may overfit the data.

Now that we have understood the basics about SVM, let's proceed to building the SVM model using Python programming language.


# 2.Python Environment Setup
Before installing any libraries or packages, make sure your system has Python installed along with pip package manager. If you don't have Python installed please follow the steps given below to install it on Windows/Mac OS X/Linux platforms. 

For Mac users - 
1. Open terminal
2. Type 'brew install python'

For Linux users - 
1. Open terminal
2. Type'sudo apt-get install python'

For Windows users - 
1. Download the latest version of Python from the official website https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to download the executable file (.exe). Double click on the downloaded.exe file and run the installation wizard. Follow the instructions provided by the installer.

Once you have successfully installed Python on your system, open command prompt(Windows)/terminal(Mac/Linux) and verify the version of Python installed using the following commands - 

```
python --version
```

This should display the current version of Python installed on your system. Now, lets create a virtual environment using virtualenv tool. Virtualenv allows us to isolate the dependencies required for different projects. Create a new directory where you want to store your project files and navigate inside it using the command line. Use the following command to create a new virtual environment named venv - 

```
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment using the following command - 

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Windows systems activate the virtual environment using the following command - 

```
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

You can see that your command prompt now starts with the name of your virtual environment, indicating that you are working inside it. To deactivate the virtual environment simply enter `deactivate` at the command prompt. You can also add the above activation step to your shell startup script to automatically activate the virtual environment whenever you start a new session.
