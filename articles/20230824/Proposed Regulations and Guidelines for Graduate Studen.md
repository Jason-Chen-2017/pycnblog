# 1.简介
  

The National Science University (NSU), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Indiana University Bloomington (IUB), Purdue University, Brown University, University of California Irvine (UCI) have recently adopted a set of policies to guide graduate students applying for their PhD programmes in computer science and information technology. These policies are designed to provide better admission criteria and fairness for all applicants while still allowing some flexibility for individual schools or programs. The aim is to ensure that every student who applies receives the highest quality education possible, regardless of their background or educational pathway. 

This article provides an overview of these guidelines, which will be useful for both international students seeking employment in top-tier research institutions and local candidates looking to advance their careers as software developers or engineers. It also includes detailed instructions on how to apply for a PhD in CSIT at any of the above mentioned universities.

# 2.背景介绍
Computer science and information technology (CSIT) has emerged as one of the most significant fields in modern society. However, despite its importance, it can be challenging to get into this field as a freshman or sophomore without solid academic experience. Therefore, many college/university students choose to pursue a masters degree before entering the workforce. Many times, they spend years trying to obtain a high grade point average with little success. Despite this, there are few resources available to help students prepare well for their first steps towards graduate study. Hence, there is a need for more comprehensive guidance on how to make the best out of their time during the application process.

With increasing competition in various industries such as finance, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, etc., tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple are continuously investing in AI technologies and creating job roles requiring extensive knowledge of computer science and mathematics. As a result, there is an urgent need to bridge the gap between undergraduate education and professional development. Consequently, several national and international governmental agencies, organizations, and universities are working together to develop new measures and policies to improve the graduate student’s chances of getting into the world of research and industry. One such policy from NSU has been adopted by this year's graduate application cycle, where students must submit a CV, essay(s), and transcripts along with their applications. Additionally, students are required to complete two exams: a standardized test and an individual interview. Overall, these measures ensure that students receive the most valuable assistance from the school, not only in terms of grades but also in terms of supplementary courses, financial aid, and job placement opportunities.

In general, the purpose of providing clear, easy-to-understand guidelines for each stage of the graduate application process is to promote transparency, consistency, and fairness across different faculties within NSU, CAS, IUB, UCI, and other institutions. Moreover, the articles provided below should serve as a helpful resource for graduate students interested in obtaining a CSIT PhD at NSU or another institution. We hope that these guides would prove to be beneficial to students throughout their journey to fulfill their dream of being a researcher or developer.

First, let us understand the basic concepts and terminologies involved in the graduate application process. 

## Application Process Overview 
The NSU graduate student application process involves three major stages:

1. **Selection Stage**: This involves reviewing multiple documents submitted by the candidate including his/her resume, cover letter, transcript, GPA report, and statements of accomplishments related to previous education. 

2. **Interview:** The next step is conducting a written examination or online interview to determine whether the candidate is suitable for the position he/she applied for.

3. **Admissions Decision:** Based on the results of the selection and interviews, the decision is made about admitting the candidate or rejecting him/her.


## Terms & Concepts 
Before we dive deeper into the details of the graduate application process, it is essential to define certain key terms and concepts used frequently in graduate admissions processes. 

### Undergraduate Education

Undergraduate education refers to the initial phase of a student’s education when they are just starting their academic career. It typically covers subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and English.

### Master's Degree / Doctorate Degree

Master’s degrees are usually obtained after completing a bachelor’s degree, whereas doctorate degrees generally require completion of four to five years of postdoctoral training. Both types of degrees may offer specialized training in specific areas of interest, such as biology, engineering, or economics. They are often recognized by employers as capable professionals who possess skills and expertise in their respective fields.

### GPA Score

GPA scores represent the numerical rating given to a student’s academic performance based on a weighted scale system. Each subject earned a corresponding score ranging from 0.0 to 4.0, and the final GPA score is calculated as the average of all scores. For example, if you have a Math GPA of 3.7 and a Biology GPA of 3.9, your overall GPA score would be (3.7 + 3.9)/2 = 3.85. GPAs vary depending on factors such as the number of credits taken, course difficulty level, and workload placed on the student.

### Transcript

A transcript lists all the courses, grades, and credits received by the candidate through their undergraduate education. Some universities require students to take certification examinations prior to submitting their transcripts.

### Personal Statement

Personal statements highlight the candidate’s relevant experiences, qualifications, and objectives. An effective personal statement increases the likelihood of successful interactions between the recruiters and the potential hires. It should include information about the candidate’s education, work experience, research projects, achievements, activities, goals, aspirations, and future ambitions. It is important to make sure the personal statement concise, informative, and truthful so that the prospective employer does not waste their time evaluating irrelevant information.

### Research Statement

Research statements describe the candidate’s research interests and publications. It is crucial to present a thorough account of the candidate’s contributions to the scientific community, even if they have not yet published any papers. The statement should clearly state the candidate’s research methodology, results, and findings, and explain why the work matters to the field.

### Essays

Essays are non-graded assignments typically devoted to showcase a candidate’s understanding of a particular topic, ability to articulate ideas, communicate thoughts effectively, and demonstrate problem-solving abilities. Examples of commonly asked essays include “Why did you decide to pursue a master's degree?” or “What are your hopes and dreams in life”. Every university requires students to write essays on a range of topics, some of which require careful writing skills.

### Admissions Requirements

There are numerous admission requirements that each university or department imposes on graduating students. Some common ones include: minimum cumulative GPA, lowest annual cost of living, acceptable debt levels, acceptance criteria for scholarships and fellowships, citizenship requirement, residency requirement, and language requirement. Different universities may also have different sets of policies regarding the use of computers and internet usage, passing of certifications, and teaching assistant responsibilities.
