# 1.简介
  

Hierarchical clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique that involves cluster analysis of data points into groups. It works by recursively partitioning the data set into smaller subsets based on their similarity or distance from each other until each subset contains only one type of data point. Each level in the hierarchy represents a coarse-grained grouping while larger clusters are formed at higher levels. In this article, we will discuss the general framework and key concepts behind hierarchical clustering as well as provide an overview of its main algorithms including Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, Centroid Linkage and Ward’s method. We also discuss how these methods can be applied to different types of datasets such as continuous numerical data, categorical data, textual data and image data. Finally, we highlight some limitations of hierarchical clustering and potential improvements for future research. 

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the details of hierarchical clustering, it is important to understand certain basic concepts and terminology related to it.

2.1 Data Point
A data point is simply an observation or measurement made on a particular variable or feature. For example, in a dataset consisting of customer reviews, each review is considered as a single data point representing the features like product quality, sentiment value, price range etc. 

2.2 Distance Metrics
Distance measures quantify the difference between two data points and help in identifying similarities or differences between them. There are several common distance metrics used in hierarchical clustering such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, cosine similarity, Pearson correlation coefficient, Jaccard index and so on. These distance metrics measure the closeness or dissimilarity between two vectors in high dimensional space.

2.3 Dendrogram
Dendrograms represent the nested structure of the clusters produced by hierarchical clustering algorithms. At every step, the dendrogram partitions the data points into separate regions based on their distances from each other, indicating the similarity or dissimilarity between them. The height of the leaf nodes indicates the size of each group. By following the branches of the dendrogram, we can recover the original hierarchical clustering tree.

2.4 Partitioning Process
The partitioning process refers to the recursive division of the data set into subsets using various distance metrics such as minimum distance, maximum distance, average distance, centroid distance, median distance and so on. As the algorithm proceeds, the number of subsets increases until each subset contains only one type of data point. This is where the term “hierarchical” comes into play since the underlying assumptions of hierarchical clustering are derived from the natural hierarchy of the real world entities (e.g., species).

2.5 Linkage Criteria
Linkage criteria determine how the new cluster should be generated when merging two subsets. The most commonly used linkage criteria include Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, Centroid Linkage and Ward's method. 

2.6 Aggregation Methods
Aggregation methods specify the way in which new clusters are formed after performing the partitioning process. There are four major aggregation methods used in hierarchical clustering – flat, weighted, centrally located and u-shaped. Flat clustering means that all data points belong to the same cluster irrespective of their proximity; weighted clustering assigns weights to each data point based on its proximity to neighboring clusters and recalculates the centroid of the cluster accordingly; central location clustering allocates each data point to the nearest existing cluster and forms a new cluster with the remaining outliers. U-shaped clustering uses shapes to form new clusters, with convex subregions being assigned to more dense clusters than concave regions.

2.7 Limitations
The primary limitation of hierarchical clustering is its sensitivity to noise and outlier detection. This occurs because small clusters may not have significant support and hence, their members may be removed during the partitioning process. Additionally, the relative positioning of objects within the hierarchy affects their clustering patterns and hence, the resulting solutions may vary depending on the context in which they are used. 

2.8 Future Research Directions
There are several directions where further research could take place in order to improve the performance of hierarchical clustering techniques. Some of these areas include the handling of missing values, selecting appropriate distance metrics, reducing bias due to initialization strategies, determining the optimal number of clusters and dealing with large datasets. Overall, there is no clear winner among the many available clustering techniques but hierarchical clustering remains a popular choice among domain experts due to its ability to handle complex data structures without requiring expertise in the underlying statistical model.
