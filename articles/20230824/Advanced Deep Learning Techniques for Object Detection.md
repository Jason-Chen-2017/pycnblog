# 1.简介
  

Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task that aims to locate and identify objects in images or videos. There are many deep learning based object detectors available nowadays such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) and Faster RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network). In this article we will go over some advanced techniques used in these state of the art models along with some common issues faced during training and testing. We also look at alternative architectures like MobileNetV2 and ResNet and see how they can help improve accuracy and speed of inference. Finally we discuss limitations and potential future directions for object detection research. 

In this blog post, I assume readers have basic knowledge about convolutional neural networks and object detection. If you need a refresher on these topics please refer to my other articles:


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the technical details let's first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to object detection. 

1. **Bounding Box**: A bounding box is a rectangular box around an object in an image, where each pixel inside the box belongs to the object class labelled within it. It has four attributes:

   * xmin: The x coordinate of the top left corner of the box
   * xmax: The x coordinate of the bottom right corner of the box
   * ymin: The y coordinate of the top left corner of the box
   * ymax: The y coordinate of the bottom right corner of the box

    This box is defined relative to the original image size and not scaled down or up by any factor.

2. **Anchor boxes** : Anchor boxes are pre-defined regions within an image that represent different scales and aspect ratios of an object. These anchor boxes serve as reference points for predicting the offset values needed to regress the predicted object localization back to the original input image scale. Each anchor box has six attributes:
   
   * cx: The center x coordinate of the anchor box
   * cy: The center y coordinate of the anchor box
   * w: The width of the anchor box
   * h: The height of the anchor box
   * angle: Angle between vertical axis and length of anchor box width
   
3. **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** : Non-maximum suppression is an algorithm used to filter out overlapping bounding boxes from multiple detections of same object. It selects only one of them depending on their confidence scores and the size of overlap area.

4. **Focal Loss** : Focal loss function is another way of addressing the problem of imbalance in dataset which occurs when there are too few examples of certain classes compared to others. The idea behind focal loss is to give more importance to well-classified examples while putting less weight on hard negatives. 

# 3. Core Algorithm Details and Operations
Now that we have understood some basics, let's dive deeper into the core algorithms used in object detection. 

## 3.1 Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
The feature pyramid network was introduced in paper "Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection" by Lin et al., 2017. Its key contribution is to create features at multiple spatial resolutions starting from high-level cues extracted from the low-level layers of the CNN architecture. They show significant improvements over previous approaches in terms of both accuracy and speed while maintaining computational efficiency.
