Statistical machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the use of statistical techniques to make predictions or decisions based on data sets. The goal is to build algorithms that can learn from the past data and predict future outcomes accurately. In this article, we will discuss the main types of statistical machine learning algorithms such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning along with their applications in industry. We also provide an overview of various concepts related to statistics and probability theory which are required for understanding statistical machine learning algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate how these algorithms can be implemented using Python programming language by applying them to real-world problems like image classification, text sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of popular statistical machine learning algorithms including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), k-means clustering, and neural networks. It is intended to serve as a useful guide for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts who want to understand the underlying principles behind these algorithms and apply them to solve complex real-world problems. 

The content of this paper is organized into five sections. Section 2 explains basic concepts and terminologies used in statistical machine learning. Section 3 introduces four fundamental types of statistical machine learning algorithms namely, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Each algorithm is discussed in detail with its mathematical formulation and implementation using Python code examples. Section 4 covers practical aspects related to each algorithm such as hyperparameter tuning, regularization, feature scaling, and bias-variance tradeoff. Section 5 concludes with summary, outlook, and references.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
## 2.1 Probability Theory and Statistics Basics
Probability theory and statistics describe the likelihood of certain events occurring. Let's take an example of rolling two dice where each die has six faces labeled 1 through 6. The possible combinations of numbers rolled are {2,3,4,5,6} x {1,2,3,4,5,6}. There are three ways to get exactly three points when rolling two dice: 

1. Roll both dice and add up the values. Three points are obtained if the sum equals 7 or 11; zero points otherwise. 
2. Roll one die twice and then another die once. Add the values together. If either of the first two dice rolls adds up to 7 or greater, then you have three points. Otherwise, no points are earned. 
3. Throw both dice in the air at the same time until they land facing upwards. Count the number of times it takes to reach three consecutive ones, and multiply by three. For instance, if there are five consecutive ones after throwing the dice, then there are 15 total ones thrown. Divide by two since there are two frontal sides facing upwards. Therefore, taking this approach gives us eighteen points. 

Probability is defined as the likelihood of an event occurring. That means, given any possible set of experiments or observations, the probability of an event occurring is proportional to the frequency of occurrence of that event within those observations. In other words, probability quantifies the uncertainity associated with making a prediction about the future outcome of a trial.

In probability theory, we define two essential elements - variables and probabilities. Variables represent some unknown quantity that may take different values according to a sample space. For example, let X denote the outcome of a coin flip where heads = 1 and tails = 0. Then, P(X=1) represents the probability of getting head when flipping a coin.

Similarly, we can define the probability of an event E given a particular value of variable X. That is, P(E|X). Using conditional probability, we can calculate the probability of all possible outcomes of our experiment assuming the variable X takes on specific values. Continuing with the previous example, we might ask what is the probability of getting exactly three points when rolling two dice? Assuming that the values of the first die are independent of the second die, we can write:

P({3}|D_1, D_2) = \frac{C(\{3\}, \{D_1+D_2\})}{C(\{D_1, D_2\})} * P(D_1, D_2)

where C() is the combination function which calculates the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. Here, D_1 and D_2 represent the results of two independent coin flips respectively. By counting the number of combinations of two dice whose combined result is equal to three, we can obtain the numerator. The denominator comes from considering all possible combinations of two dice. Finally, we need to normalize the counts by multiplying with the joint probability of both dice being chosen. When we do not know the exact distribution of dice outcomes, but instead assume they are independent of each other, we say they are conditionally independent given the other.

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that uses mathematical methods to analyze and interpret data. Its primary purpose is to gather, organize, summarize, and present information from a wide range of sources, such as surveys, studies, and experimental data. In general, statistics involves collecting and analyzing data to draw meaningful insights. The following list describes commonly used terms in statistics:
* Data: A collection of facts or measurements made on a subject, object, or process. 
* Variable: An attribute that can take on multiple distinct values across a dataset.
* Outcome: The final result of an observation or experiment. 
* Observation: One individual piece of data collected from a study or survey. 
* Population: The complete set of individuals or units being studied. 
* Sample: A subset of the population selected randomly for testing or analysis purposes. 
* Parameter: A numerical value representing a characteristic of the population that cannot be estimated directly from observed data. 
* Statistic: A numerical value derived from data that summarizes important features of the data. 
* Model: A representation of reality that consists of parameters and assumptions. 
* Null hypothesis: An assumption that the effect being tested is null, i.e., there is no difference between groups under consideration. 
* Alternative hypothesis: An alternative hypothesis that the effect being tested is not null, i.e., there is a significant difference between groups under consideration. 
* Treatment group: The control group or group that receives a treatment that is being compared to the untreated group. 
* Control group: The group of interest without receiving any intervention. 
* Hypothesis test: A methodology for determining whether the difference between two populations is statistically significant or due to chance alone. 
* Type I error: The probability of rejecting a false positive hypothesis when it is true. 
* Type II error: The probability of accepting a false negative hypothesis when it is false.

## 2.2 Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Supervised learning refers to training models using labeled data, meaning that the target variable is already known. In contrast, unsupervised learning relies on unlabeled data, often called "outliers". The goal of supervised learning is to identify patterns in the data that can help predict outcomes. On the other hand, unsupervised learning aims to find patterns in the data without prior knowledge of the target variable. Commonly used unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and dimensionality reduction. Clustering algorithms group similar data points together while PCA identifies correlations among variables. Similarities between data points in high dimensional spaces can be difficult to visualize, so dimensionality reduction algorithms can be helpful in visualizing clusters and identifying relationships. Another application of unsupervised learning is anomaly detection, where we want to identify unexpected events or abnormal behaviors that deviate significantly from normal behavior. 

In addition to traditional supervised and unsupervised learning, there exist several other forms of machine learning, such as reinforcement learning and deep learning. Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment and learning to optimize a reward signal over time. Deep learning combines ideas from neural network science with statistical modeling techniques to create increasingly accurate models of complex datasets. These algorithms leverage large amounts of labeled and unlabeled data, as well as computational power, to improve performance.
