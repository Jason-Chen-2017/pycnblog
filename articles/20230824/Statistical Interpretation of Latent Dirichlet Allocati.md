# 1.简介
  

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling algorithm used for text analysis in natural language processing applications such as document classification, clustering, or sentiment analysis. LDA is based on the probabilistic model of topic-word distributions that enables it to discover hidden patterns in large corpora of documents by unsupervised learning from the data itself without any supervision. This paper will review LDA’s fundamental concepts and algorithms, along with its main issues and shortcomings, including limitations, extensions, and applications. We hope this article can provide a comprehensive overview and guide for practitioners to better understand LDA and make more informed decisions when using it for their own projects.

# 2.LDA核心概念及术语
## 2.1主题模型
In natural language processing, latent variable models are those where there is uncertainty about some underlying variables that influence observed variables. These models possess interpretable factors known as “topics” which describe the structure of the underlying probability distribution over words. The word distributions under different topics may be related but not identical; each topic captures a separate semantic component or idea. Thus, the overall understanding of the corpus can be summarized into a set of interrelated topics. 

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), an extension of probabilistic latent semantic indexing (pLSI), is one of the most widely used topic modeling techniques in natural language processing. It assumes a bag-of-words representation of texts, i.e., each document is represented as a vector of word counts. The objective of LDA is to infer a topic hierarchy by grouping similar words together into “topics,” while simultaneously identifying the most important words within each topic. The key challenge of LDA is to avoid overfitting to the training data and discovering incorrect patterns due to sparsity. To achieve these goals, LDA uses an iterative Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate the joint probabilities of the various components of the model given the data. The final result is a set of topics that characterize the input data with high precision and recall.


## 2.2参数估计
The LDA model consists of two sets of parameters:

1. Document-topic proportions $\theta$, which represent how much of each topic each document contains.
2. Word-topic proportions $\beta$ which represents how much of each word in each topic appears in the vocabulary of all documents. 

Both sets of parameters are estimated through an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm that alternates between performing maximum likelihood updates and marginal inference. Given a set of observations $D = \{d_i\}_{i=1}^N$ generated from some unknown true model, we use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability of our current model parameters given the observed data:

$$ P(\theta,\beta|D) \propto P(D|\theta,\beta)\times P(\theta,\beta) $$

This formula allows us to easily obtain estimates for both sets of parameters, since they factorize over each other. The first term reflects our prior beliefs about the likely generative process that generates the data and assigns probabilities to possible parameter values. The second term gives us our updated information about the likelihood of observing the data given our current model parameters. EM then repeatedly applies these update rules until convergence, resulting in a set of parameters that maximizes the log-likelihood of the observed data under the model. 


## 2.3主题分布与词分布
For a fixed value of $n$ (the number of tokens in the document), we define the conditional probability of document $d_j$ belonging to topic $k$ as follows:

$$ p(z_{dj} = k | d_j ) = \frac{\gamma_{dk}}{\sum_{\ell=1}^{K}\gamma_{\ell,d}}\frac{n_k}{\sum_{l=1}^{V} n_\ell } $$

where $\gamma_{dk}$ and $\gamma_{\ell,d}$ are hyperparameters that specify the strength of the prior belief that document $d_j$ belongs to topic $k$ versus topic $\ell$. $\gamma_{dk}$ represents the probability of selecting a particular topic among all K possible topics in a new document. $\gamma_{\ell,d}$ specifies the probability of choosing a specific topic after observing all previous words in the same document. Finally, $n_k$ and $n_\ell$ give the expected count of tokens assigned to topic $k$ and $\ell$ respectively. In practice, we usually assume that these hyperparameters are uniformly distributed across all documents and topics.

Similarly, we can define the conditional probability of token $w_i$ appearing in topic $k$ as follows:

$$ p(w_{ij} | z_{dj}=k) = \frac{\beta_{kw_i}}{\sum_{\ell=1}^{K}\beta_{\ell w_i}}\frac{n_{ik}}{\sum_{l=1}^{V} n_{il}} $$

where $\beta_{kw_i}$ and $\beta_{\ell w_i}$ are also hyperparameters that control the strength of priors on word types. $\beta_{kw_i}$ determines the probability of assigning a particular word type to a specific topic, whereas $\beta_{\ell w_i}$ controls the probability of using a different topic if a particular word type has already been selected for another topic. Again, we assume that these hyperparameters are shared across all documents and topics. 


## 2.4标准化常数（Normalization Constants）
To ensure that the above equations are well-defined, we need to add normalization constants to the denominator terms so that the total probability over all topics and words sum up to 1. Specifically, let $\alpha_d$ denote the proportion of the length of the document $d$ that goes towards allocating topics, and let $\lambda_{di}$ denote the weight attributed to document $d_i$ during MCMC inference. Then, we have the following expressions:

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{K}\gamma_{dk} = \alpha_d $$

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{M}\sum_{j=1}^{V}n_{ij} = N $$

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{K}\gamma_{\ell,d} = 1-\alpha_d $$

$$ \sum_{l=1}^{K}\beta_{\ell w_i} = 1 $$

Here, $M$ stands for the number of documents, $N$ stands for the total number of tokens in the dataset, $V$ stands for the size of the vocabulary.

## 3.LDA的训练与推断过程
### 3.1训练阶段
During the training phase, LDA attempts to maximize the likelihood function over the entire corpus, given the assumed generative process. The goal is to find good values of the document-topic proportions $\theta_d$ and word-topic proportions $\beta_{dw}$. At each iteration, we sample a subset of $D$ documents at random and perform the E-step followed by the M-step, updating the model parameters accordingly.

The E-step involves computing the responsibilities $\gamma_{dk}$ for each token $(w_{ij},z_{dj})$ in the corpus given the current model parameters, i.e., the likelihood of generating each observation given the model parameters multiplied by its probability under the model. The responsibility is defined as:

$$ r_{ij}(z_{dj}=k) = \frac{q_{ik}(\theta_d,\beta_{dw}|z_{dj}=k)\times p(w_{ij}|z_{dj}=k)}{p(z_{dj}=k|\theta_d,\beta_{dw})} $$

where $q_{ik}(\theta_d,\beta_{dw}|z_{dj}=k)$ is the conditional probability of selecting topic $k$ for document $d_j$ and setting $w_{ij}$ to be the $i$-th occurrence in that document given that topic was chosen ($z_{dj}=k$) according to the current model parameters. If $r_{ij}(z_{dj}=k)=0$, this means that token $w_{ij}$ cannot occur in topic $k$ given the current model parameters. Similarly, if $r_{ij}(z_{dj}=k)=1$, this indicates that $w_{ij}$ should always be assigned to topic $k$ regardless of the presence of other higher-probability topics.

Next, we normalize the responsibilities across all topics for each token to get the normalized weights $\eta_{ij}(z_{dj})$:

$$ \eta_{ij}(z_{dj}) = \frac{r_{ij}(z_{dj}=k)}{\sum_{l=1}^{K}r_{ij}(z_{dj}=l)} $$

Note that we only consider nonzero entries of $\eta_{ij}(z_{dj})$ because those correspond to valid assignments of topics to tokens. For example, if the model decides that token $w_{ij}$ should never appear in topic $k$, we don't assign it any probability mass and therefore leave $\eta_{ij}(z_{dj})$ equal to zero. 

Finally, we randomly select a subset of $D$ documents to update the model parameters. We use these weighted samples to estimate the expected values of the document-topic proportions $\bar{\theta}_d$ and word-topic proportions $\bar{\beta}_{dw}$, using a weighted average:

$$ \bar{\theta}_d = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{D}m_{dj}\theta_d}{\sum_{j=1}^{D}m_{dj}} $$

where $m_{dj}$ is the number of times document $d_j$ appears in the sampled mini-batch:

$$ m_{dj} = \sum_{i:z_{ij}=d_j}\eta_{ij}(z_{ij}) $$

Similarly, we estimate $\bar{\beta}_{dw}$ using:

$$ \bar{\beta}_{dw} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{D}\sum_{i:z_{ij}=d_j}\eta_{ij}(z_{ij})\beta_{dw,w_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{D}\sum_{i:z_{ij}=d_j}\eta_{ij}(z_{ij})} $$

Again, note that we only consider nonzero entries of $\bar{\beta}_{dw}$ corresponding to tokens that were assigned nonzero probability mass. Also, notice that we use the weighted average instead of the simple mean.

Once we finish updating the model parameters, we repeat the process of sampling documents, performing the E-step and M-step, until convergence. Note that we continue updating the model even after reaching convergence, since subsequent iterations might improve the accuracy of the estimation. However, we do stop updating once we reach a certain number of epochs or convergence criteria are met.

### 3.2推断阶段
After training, we want to apply the trained LDA model to new, unseen documents. Since the model was trained on a corpus of documents, we must apply it to new documents with the same collection-dependent properties. That is, the preprocessing steps applied to the original corpus must also be applied to the new documents before applying LDA. Once preprocessed, we can apply LDA using the same E-step and M-step procedure described earlier, starting from scratch. 

However, since we are dealing with new documents, the first step is to initialize the document-topic proportions $\theta_d$ and word-topic proportions $\beta_{dw}$ using the estimated values obtained from the training stage. Next, we run the E-step and M-step using this initial guess of the parameters, obtaining new values for $\theta_d$ and $\beta_{dw}$. We take the argmax of these values over all possible topic assignments to obtain the predicted topic distribution for the new document. Depending on the application, we could choose to discard some of the predicted topics or aggregate them into broader categories depending on their relative probabilities.
