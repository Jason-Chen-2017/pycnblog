## 3.1 数据集（Dataset）
A dataset is an organized collection of data that can be used for training, testing or validation purposes. The dataset can include features, labels, images, text, audio, video, etc., depending on the type of problem being solved. A common example of a dataset is the MNIST digit classification dataset which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) with corresponding labels. There are many different types of datasets available, including image datasets, text datasets, speech recognition datasets, financial time series datasets, social media datasets, and more.

## 3.2 特征（Features）
In machine learning, features are the input variables used to describe or characterize the entities we want to classify or predict. In supervised learning, they are also called input variables, target variable(s), output variable(s), independent variable(s), covariates, regressors, and explanatory variable(s). Features represent qualitative information about the entity, while the label represents the class or value to be predicted. For instance, consider the following feature matrix:

| Sepal length | Sepal width | Petal length | Petal width | Species |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4          | 0.2          | Iris-setosa |
| 4.9          | 3           | 1.4          | 0.2          | Iris-setosa |
| 4.7          | 3.2         | 1.3          | 0.2          | Iris-setosa |
| 4.6          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.2          | Iris-setosa |
|...          |...         |...          |...          |...      |

Each row of the above table represents an iris flower, and each column corresponds to a particular feature - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, species.

## 3.3 标记（Labels）
The goal of any supervised learning task is to learn a function that maps inputs (i.e., features) to outputs (i.e., labels). In practice, most tasks require us to train a model using labeled data, where the desired output (label) is provided alongside the input features. When applying machine learning models to real-world problems, it's important to have accurate and reliable labeling strategies.

## 3.4 模型（Models）
A model is a representation of how the data relates to the output variable by mapping inputs to outputs through some learned parameters or weights. Machine learning models typically involve optimizing a cost function based on the observed data and estimated parameters, so that the model accurately approximates the underlying relationship between the input and output variables. Common machine learning models include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), neural networks, and others.

## 3.5 训练（Training）
In machine learning, training refers to the process of feeding a model new data and adjusting its internal parameters to minimize the error between predictions made by the model and true values. During training, the model learns from the provided training data to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. This process is repeated until convergence, at which point the trained model can be applied to make predictions on new, unlabeled data.

## 3.6 测试（Testing）
After completing training, the next step is to evaluate the performance of the model on test data. Test data is data that was not used during training, but rather reserved for evaluating the final accuracy of the model once deployed in production. The evaluation may take several forms, including measuring metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, PR curve, and confusion matrices. Depending on the size and nature of the test set, techniques like cross-validation can be used to estimate the performance of the model under various conditions.
