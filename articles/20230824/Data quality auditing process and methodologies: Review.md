Data Quality Auditing is the process of evaluating and verifying data integrity to ensure that it meets specified standards or acceptable criteria for its intended use. Data quality auditing helps organizations achieve compliance with data governance policies by detecting and fixing issues in their data. 

Auditing involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, or omissions in data to improve the accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, or usefulness of data sets. The ultimate goal is to reduce or eliminate data risks such as misunderstandings, conflicts of interest, or fraudulent activity.

In this article, we will discuss the main principles and procedures involved in data quality auditing along with popularly used data quality auditing techniques. We also provide sample code snippets using different programming languages to illustrate how these technologies can be applied to real-world datasets. At last, we will outline future trends and challenges associated with data quality auditing and suggest areas where more research and development are needed to develop cutting-edge technologies.

The purpose of this article is to help technical professionals gain a better understanding of data quality auditing processes and technologies by providing an overview on key concepts, algorithms, and methods used in the industry. By reading this article, you should have a good grasp over fundamental principles, best practices, and tools for performing effective data quality audits. 

# 2. Basic Concepts, Terminology, and Methods
## Types of Audits
There are three types of data quality audits typically performed in an organization: 

1. Internal audit: An internal audit reviews all the data held within an organization's IT systems, databases, and file repositories. It ensures proper data flow between systems and identifies any discrepancies or inconsistencies within them. This type of audit is often referred to as "data sourcing audit".

2. External audit: An external audit involves reviewing data provided by outside vendors or contractors who may not have access to your company’s sensitive data. External audits assess whether the data has been properly secured before being shared externally, and identify potential security breaches or data breaches if they exist.

3. Compliance audit: A compliance audit involves verifying that an organization complies with established data protection laws or regulations. Compliance audits focus on monitoring data security measures adopted throughout the organization, looking at policies, procedures, and controls implemented to protect data from unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction.

Each type of audit requires specific resources, which may include analysts, developers, testers, and other experts familiar with the relevant data sources and processes. In addition, each type of audit may require additional resources such as third party certification bodies or government agencies to verify the audit findings.


## Common Terms and Definitions 
Before diving into specific auditing methods, let us define some common terms and definitions related to data quality auditing:


1. Data source: Refers to the original source(s) of the data collected, for example, financial statements or customer records.

2. Data store: Location where data is stored, usually either a physical database or system repository.

3. Sensitive data: Any piece of information that could potentially cause harm to an individual or organization, such as personal health records, credit card numbers, social security numbers, or personnel information.

4. Metadata: Information about the data itself, such as descriptions, formats, structure, schema, encoding, encryption keys, etc.

5. Data cleaning: Process of removing or modifying incorrect, incomplete, duplicate, or irrelevant data points so that it meets a desired standard or format.

6. Data validation: Verifying that the data adheres to certain formatting requirements or business rules, ensuring that data remains accurate, consistent, and up-to-date.

7. Data enrichment: Combining multiple data sources to create new data points or attributes, improving the overall quality of the dataset.

8. DQ application: Software tool or service that performs automated data quality checks or analyses on data stores to identify and fix data quality issues.

9. Rule-based auditing: Using pre-defined sets of rules or guidelines to evaluate data quality. For example, a set of 50 rules for validating Social Security Numbers (SSN).

10. Manual review: Conducting an initial analysis of data quality through subject matter experts manually reviewing the data to identify any data quality problems.

11. Machine learning auditing: Utilizing statistical modeling techniques to automatically analyze and categorize data quality issues, without requiring human intervention.

12. Profiler: Tool that extracts metadata from data sources and generates reports on data statistics, patterns, correlations, dependencies, outliers, etc., allowing users to understand the underlying distribution of data values and identify patterns and anomalies.

13. Profiling techniques: Techniques used for profiling data, such as frequency analysis, chi-square tests, correlation analysis, clustering, and profile likelihood models.
