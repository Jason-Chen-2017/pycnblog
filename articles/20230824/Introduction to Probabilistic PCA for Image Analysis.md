# 1.简介
  

Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is a popular and powerful technique in data analysis, pattern recognition, image processing, and machine learning that has received increasing attention over the past few years due to its robustness, flexibility, and ability to handle high-dimensional datasets. PPCA is based on an assumption of random noise in the observed data and aims at extracting meaningful features from them. It can be used as a pre-processing step before applying more complex algorithms such as linear or nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques or clustering models. 

In this article, we will discuss probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA), which is one variant of PPCA that uses variational Bayesian inference instead of MLE to estimate the parameters. We will first provide some background information about how PPCA works with mathematical formulas and explanations of key concepts involved. Then we will demonstrate PPCA's implementation using Python code snippets and finally highlight future directions and challenges in the field of PPCA.

# 2.概述
Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a widely used algorithm in applied mathematics and statistics for analyzing high-dimensional data. The main idea behind PPCA is to represent the original observations in a low-dimensional space while keeping as much of the underlying structure as possible by assuming that each observation is generated by a stochastic process with additive noise. This allows us to recover useful patterns even when there are considerable amounts of missing or corrupted data. Another advantage of PPCA compared to other methods for dimensionality reduction is that it provides uncertainty estimates along with the eigenvectors and eigenvalues obtained during the estimation procedure. These uncertainties can help to understand the reliability of the results and make better decisions in various applications where uncertainty quantification is essential.

The basic idea behind probabilistic PCA is similar to standard PCA, but rather than optimizing a single set of model parameters, we optimize the posterior distributions of these parameters under the presence of unknown latent variables. In practice, we assume that the noise present in our dataset follows a certain probability distribution, known as the noise model, which is typically assumed to be normal or Gaussian in most cases. We then define a prior distribution over these noise variables and use variational inference to learn the optimal values of the parameters given the available data. Finally, we obtain posterior distributions over both the low-dimensional subspace and the variance of the noise model, which we can interpret as confidence intervals for each eigenvector and eigenvector coefficient.

We will now give an overview of the math behind probabilistic PCA. To do so, let's consider the following two-dimensional example:


Here, $n$ represents the number of samples, and $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the input vector corresponding to the $i$-th sample. Our goal is to find a low-dimensional representation of these inputs that retains as much of their structure as possible while also capturing any relevant patterns in the data. One way to approach this problem is through probabilistic PCA. 

Let's write down some basic notation and definitions. Let $\mathbf{S} = \{\mathbf{z}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ denote the $n$ independent components of a new, unobserved variable $Z$, and let $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ denote the matrix of fixed effects estimated using standard PCA. Thus, we have the following likelihood function:

$$
p(\mathbf{z}_i|\mathbf{y}_i,\theta)=N(\mathbf{z}_i|\boldsymbol{\mu},\sigma^2\mathbf{I})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^p|\sigma^2|}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^p((\mathbf{z}_i-\boldsymbol{\mu})_j)^2/\sigma^2\right).
$$

Where $\theta=(\boldsymbol{\mu},\sigma^2)$ are the parameters of interest. Note that here we assume that $\mathbf{z}_i$ is normally distributed around a mean parameter $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, with a variance parameter $\sigma^2$. We further assume that all the rows of $\mathbf{Y}$ are i.i.d., i.e., they come from the same distribution with the same covariance matrix $\Sigma$, and that $\Sigma^{-1}$ exists. 

Now, we want to find a lower-dimensional representation of $\mathbf{Y}$. One option is to directly compute the expected value of $\mathbf{z}_i$:

$$
q(\mathbf{z}_i)=E_{\mathbf{y}_i}[\mathbf{z}_i].
$$

However, this is not tractable because it involves integrating out the hidden variables $\mathbf{y}_i$. Instead, we can use Bayes' rule to factorize the joint distribution between $\mathbf{z}_i$ and $\mathbf{y}_i$, which gives rise to the following expression for the posterior distribution:

$$
q(\mathbf{z}_i|\mathbf{y}_i)=\frac{p(\mathbf{z}_i|\mathbf{y}_i)\cdot p(\mathbf{y}_i)}{p(\mathbf{y}_i)}.
$$

We call $q(\mathbf{z}_i|\mathbf{y}_i)$ the approximation to the true posterior $p(\mathbf{z}_i|\mathbf{y}_i)$, since we cannot exactly calculate it. The term $p(\mathbf{y}_i)$ is usually referred to as the marginal likelihood and plays no role in computing the posterior. Therefore, the task of finding the exact posterior is often intractable, making the inference problem ill-posed. However, we still need to find an efficient approximate solution to the optimization problem defined above.

One common approach is to use Monte Carlo sampling methods, such as the Gibbs sampler or Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, to simulate Markov chains conditioned on the current state of the chain. Starting from some initial guess for the parameters, we generate a sequence of states $\mathbf{z}_i^{(t)}$ by iteratively updating them according to the following conditional distributions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\mathbf{z}_i^{(t+1)}\sim q(\mathbf{z}_i^{(t)}|\mathbf{z}_-i^{(t)},\mathbf{y}_i^{(t)})\\[1em]
&\mathbf{y}_i^{(t+1)}\sim N(\mathbf{y}_i^{(t)}+\boldsymbol{\Phi}(\mathbf{z}_i^{(t+1)}-\mathbf{z}_i^{(t)}),\Sigma).
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mathbf{z}_-i^{(t)}$ refers to the remaining elements of $\mathbf{z}^{(t)}$ after removing $\mathbf{z}_i^{(t)}$. Here, we fix the effect of the previous iterations on the means and variances of the $i$-th row of $\mathbf{Y}$.

Once we have simulated enough sequences of states, we can take the average of each element of the resulting arrays to get approximations to the mean and covariance matrices of $q(\mathbf{z}_i|\mathbf{y}_i)$. Specifically, we have:

$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_i=q(\mathbf{z}_i|\mathbf{y}_i)|_{\mathbf{y}^{(T)}}.\tag{1}
$$

and

$$
\hat{\Sigma}_i=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^TQ(\mathbf{z}_i|\mathbf{y}_i, \theta^{(t)})Q(\mathbf{z}_i|\mathbf{y}_i, \theta^{(t)})^\top.\tag{2}
$$

Note that here we assume that the noise precision $\tau$ is constant across all dimensions, i.e., $\tau=\text{diag}(\sigma^2_1,\dots,\sigma^2_p)$. If this were not the case, we would need to modify equation $(2)$ accordingly. Also note that we only keep track of the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix since we assume that the off-diagonal terms are zero.

Finally, we can use these approximate posterior means and covariances to construct a low-dimensional representation of $\mathbf{Y}$ using the principal components analysis (PCA) method:

$$
\hat{\Phi}=\hat{\Sigma}^{-1/2}\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}},\quad 
Z=\hat{\Phi}\mathbf{Y}.\tag{3}
$$

This transforms the original data into a low-dimensional space where the new variables correspond to the first $m$ principal components found by standard PCA. The variance of each principal component is also provided in terms of the associated uncertainty in the regression coefficients.

Overall, PPCA provides an alternative viewpoint to PCA by considering the underlying generative process that generated the observed data. It assumes that the data was generated by an unknown deterministic mapping $\mathbf{f}$ that depends on some fixed effects $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$. By modeling this mapping as a random noise process plus a deterministic dependence, PPCA enables us to extract meaningful features from the data without relying on any assumptions regarding the functional form of the mapping itself. Moreover, PPCA provides uncertainty estimates for the extracted features, allowing us to assess the reliability of the results.
