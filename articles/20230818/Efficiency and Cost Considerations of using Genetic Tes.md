传统的核酸检测方法是由人进行体外排毒、摘取样品、放入试剂盒并投射到标本上的过程，在整个过程中，人工的手续繁琐、检验时间长且易受偶然错误影响；而人体内的免疫系统在对抗病毒时会产生免疫应答，因此基因测序技术（如RNA-seq）的应用已经成为病原微生物的一种新型诊断方法。基因测序方法能够快速、高效地提供病原微生物所需的组分信息，进而辅助微生物的早期筛查。但基因测序方法的安全性、准确性仍然存在一定的不确定性，同时，其费用也比较高昂。

基于这些挑战，近年来许多研究人员开始寻求利用基因测序技术更有效、便捷地进行医学肿瘤或其它复杂病原微生物的定向发现和鉴别。然而，由于基因测序技术的复杂性、稀缺性、样本量庞大等原因，应用于临床诊断中的效果可能会受到一些限制。本文将探讨传统核酸检测、基因测序技术及其在医学诊断中的应用，并将阐述通过引入基因组编辑技术和循环重组（CRISPR）疫苗的方式可以提升基因测序技术在临床诊断中的效率与成本考虑。

# 4.1 Introduction

The rapid development of high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has led to a renewed interest in biotechnology in general as well as healthcare in particular due to its promise of unprecedented resolution and accuracy in diagnosing diseases caused by viruses or other bacteria. Despite these advantages, the use of HTS for medical diagnoses still poses some technical challenges such as sample preparation, data analysis, interpretation, and cost reduction. In this article, we will discuss several factors that contribute to the complexities involved with utilizing genome sequencing for medical purposes, including sample collection, experimental design, analyzing results, interpreting findings, and implementing effective strategies to enhance the quality and efficacy of tests. We will also introduce various bioinformatics methods and tools that can be used to analyze and interpret the resulting genetic test results. Finally, we will explore how improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of tests through the implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing may assist in further enhancing their value as a tool for disease detection and diagnosis.

In summary, our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview on current and emerging techniques related to genomics research and its potential utility in addressing the challenges of today’s medical diagnoses. We hope this review provides valuable information that will guide future researchers to address critical issues associated with genomics innovations in medicine and beyond.
