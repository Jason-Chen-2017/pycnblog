Fleet management refers to the process of planning, coordinating, and controlling a vehicle fleet for efficient operation. It involves selecting, installing, maintaining, and disposing of vehicles in such a way that they are operational and economical while maximizing utilization of resources. Intelligent traffic optimization (ITO) is an increasingly popular approach in optimizing fleet operations by taking into account real-time factors, traffic conditions, and expected demands. This paper presents two ITO approaches based on deep learning and supervised learning algorithms, which utilize high-dimensional historical trajectories and associated contextual data to optimize fleet allocation and dispatching strategies. Moreover, we propose a hybrid fleet model framework, consisting of a centralized controller and distributed decision making units (DMDUs), each responsible for managing its own set of vehicles, together with shared resource sharing among DMDUs. By integrating these models, the proposed fleet management system can achieve significant improvement in operating efficiency compared to traditional fixed-route fleet management systems.

In this work, we aim at developing an effective solution for improving fleet management efficiency using advanced ITO techniques combined with a hybrid fleet model architecture. Specifically, we focus on addressing three core challenges including vehicle assignment, fleet control, and multi-modal transportation. To address the first challenge, we develop a novel deep neural network-based algorithm called “contextual rebalancing”. We use historical trajectories from various sources, including GPS traces, social media data, and weather information, as well as predicted demand patterns across different geographical regions, to predict future vehicle movements and allocate them efficiently based on similarity between predicted demand and actual demand. To address the second challenge, we develop a flexible fleet control strategy based on reinforcement learning and Q-learning algorithm. In particular, our model uses multiple sensors to collect real-time data from all drivers, and learns to assign vehicles dynamically to minimize the distance travelled by each driver. Finally, to address the third challenge, we introduce a new paradigm of multi-modal transportation whereby fleets are able to simultaneously share roads with other modes of transportation, such as buses or trains. Our unified fleet management system combines the above approaches with a variety of enhanced features to provide highly accurate predictions and optimal vehicle assignments during peak periods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methodology in reducing fuel consumption, delay, and accident rates while improving driver satisfaction and driving experience.

Our work provides a comprehensive solution for improving fleet management efficiency by combining advanced ITO techniques with a hybrid fleet model architecture, enabling scalable deployment across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, it demonstrates the potential benefits of applying machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to improve both quality and economic outcomes related to fleet management.

## 3.1 Contextual Rebalancing
The contextual rebalancing algorithm takes into consideration both past and present traffic conditions and makes dynamic allocations of vehicles based on past demand patterns. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Collect Historical Trajectories from Various Sources
We collect historical trajectories from various sources, including GPS traces, social media data, and weather information. These sources contain valuable information about past traffic conditions, vehicle usage behavior, and driver behavior. 

2. Predict Demand Patterns Across Different Geographical Regions
Based on past trajectories and available data, we predict the demand pattern across different geographical regions. For example, we may use machine learning algorithms like clustering or regression to identify similar routes and predict the probability of each vehicle type being present at those locations.

3. Calculate Cost of Transporting Vehicles
Given the current traffic conditions and the predicted demand pattern, we calculate the cost of transporting each vehicle. For example, we may consider the average speed, energy consumed, or carbon footprint of each vehicle type and estimate the total cost of transporting each vehicle based on that information.

4. Allocate Vehicle Routes Efficiently Based on Similarity Between Predictions and Actual Demands
Using the predicted demand pattern and calculated costs, we selectively allocate vehicles to minimize overall travel time while achieving maximum utilization of resources. We do this by calculating the similarity between the predicted demand and actual demand at each location. If the prediction is very close to the actual demand, we assign the vehicle to that location. Otherwise, we adjust the allocation accordingly based on the difference between predicted and actual demand. 

## 3.2 Flexible Fleet Control Strategy
The flexibility provided by a flexible fleet control strategy depends on several factors, including the number of vehicles, capacity constraints, and anticipated traffic growth. In contrast to static allocation methods, flexibly allocating vehicles to reduce idle times and increase driver satisfaction requires continually updating the allocation based on evolving traffic conditions. We explore this problem using a reinforcement learning and Q-learning algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Observe Driver Behavior
Each DMDU monitors the behavior of its assigned vehicles to observe the driver's preferences and intentions. The observations could be made using any suitable sensor, such as radar, camera, or lidar.

2. Estimate Rewards
To guide the DMDU towards better performance, we estimate the reward function that determines the contribution of each action to the cumulative reward. The reward function can take into account factors such as the reduction in travel time due to improved routing, reduced fuel consumption, decreased injuries, or increased satisfaction levels.

3. Train Agent
We train the DMDU agent using Q-learning algorithm to maximize the accumulated discounted rewards over long term. During training, we update the Q-values of each state-action pair based on the observed rewards received after taking a particular action in response to the observation.

4. Update Allocation Strategies
Once the DMDU agent is trained and ready for testing, it begins to interact with the rest of the fleet using its local map and policies learned so far. It updates its allocation policy based on its interactions with the rest of the fleet, ensuring that the overall travel time is minimized while still meeting service level objectives.


## 3.3 Multi-Modal Transportation Using Hybrid Fleet Management System
A key feature of our proposed hybrid fleet management system is the ability to integrate multiple modalities of transportation, such as public transit, bus, and bike. One important aspect of this integration is the joint optimization of the fleet management processes for the whole fleet. As explained earlier, traditional fleet management relies heavily on fixed routes, which means that every driver needs to follow the same route. However, with our hybrid fleet management system, each driver can opt to take a mix of public transit, bus, and bike trips depending on his/her needs and comfort levels. This modularity enables greater flexibility and convenience for users while also balancing safety, efficiency, and user experience. 

For example, when a user arrives at home, he/she can decide to walk to the nearest city center instead of taking the bus to get to work. This choice helps balance user convenience, safety, and mobility costs. On the other hand, if the user needs to get to work in a rush, he/she might opt to take the bus rather than pay for private transportation. This feature enables us to meet varying demands and ensure the highest level of service possible while minimizing idle time and operating expenses.

In summary, our proposed hybrid fleet management system combines the strengths of both fixed-route and intelligent ITO approaches by leveraging the richness of contextual data and adaptive decision making within a distributed decision making unit (DMDU). By working cooperatively with the rest of the fleet, the hybrid fleet management system delivers highly accurate predictions and optimal vehicle assignments during peak periods.
