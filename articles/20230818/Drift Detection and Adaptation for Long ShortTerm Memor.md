# 1.简介
  

Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are known for their ability to capture long dependencies in time series data with minimal overfitting or underfitting. However, these models may struggle when applied to new domains or when new patterns arise in the input stream. This paper aims at addressing this problem by developing a drift detection algorithm based on gradient boosted regression trees (GBRTs), which is capable of detecting changes in the input distribution that could lead to degradation of performance in LSTM models due to absence of sufficient training examples. The approach also includes an adaptation strategy that enables continuous learning in the LSTM model while maintaining its stability through online feature selection using GBRTs as a feedback mechanism. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively reduce false alarms caused by drifts, leading to improved accuracy of LSTM predictions even during periods of high variance in the input distribution.

Drift detection algorithms have been widely used in machine learning applications such as anomaly detection, fraud detection, and intrusion detection. There has been some work recently that explores approaches based on unsupervised clustering techniques such as self-organizing maps (SOM). SOM is effective in capturing local patterns but it may not be able to identify global structure or periodicities in the input distribution. Other works address the issue of adapting deep neural networks to handle drifts by leveraging ensemble methods like stacking or averaging.

However, most existing approaches rely either on rule-based heuristics or on expensive labeled dataset collection process to monitor for drifts in real-time systems. In contrast, we propose here a lightweight solution to drift detection and adaptation for LSTM models that does not require significant resources such as labeled datasets or dedicated hardware. Our method uses a relatively simple yet powerful technique called gradient boosted regression trees (GBRTs) to construct a surrogate model for the LSTM output distribution. We use GBRTs because they are easy to train, fast to evaluate, versatile enough to represent non-linear relationships between features, and robust against noisy inputs. Moreover, our method provides a way to incorporate temporal context into the analysis and automatically select relevant features for online adaptation without retraining the entire network from scratch. Finally, we show how our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
# 3.方法概述
Our proposed approach consists of two components:
1. **Drift detection component:** Given a sequence of past observations y<sub>i</sub>, we compute the expected log likelihood ratio E(y_t|x) - E(y_{t-1}|x) where x denotes the current observation vector, t represents the timestep, and |.| indicates a concatenation operation. We then fit a decision tree classifier on pairs of consecutive values of E(y_t|x) - E(y_{t-1}|x) obtained after shifting each value up by one time step, representing transitions between normal states and abnormal ones. If there exists a clear separation between normal and abnormal transitions within the decision tree leaf nodes, we conclude that the input distribution has changed significantly and label it as an abnormal pattern.

2. **Adaptation component**: Once the system has detected a change in the input distribution, we proceed to online adaptation of the LSTM model. Specifically, given a set of recent observations X = {x<sub>k</sub>}<sub>1:t</sub>, we compute the conditional probability p(x|z=abnormal), where z denotes whether the current sample belongs to the normal or abnormal class determined by our drift detector. We train a GBRT on these samples and obtain a surrogate model G that approximates the joint probability p(X,z). Based on the prediction error of G, we gradually increase the importance of specific features in the input space by applying a progressive decrease in their weights, until the overall classification error stops improving. We repeat this procedure every m steps until the LSTM model achieves satisfactory performance. To prevent the effect of rare events that may appear only occasionally in the input distribution, we can apply smoothing techniques like exponential moving average (EMA) to estimate the probabilities p(x|z=abnormal) and enforce continuity constraints among them. Alternatively, we can also consider using clustering techniques to group similar observations together and learn a separate weight for each cluster instead of individual samples. 
# 4.具体操作步骤
We will now go through each component of the proposed framework in more detail. Let us assume that we have a trained LSTM model LSTML and an input sequence Y = {Y<sub>i</sub>}<sub>1:T</sub>, where T is the length of the sequence. 

## Drift Detection Component
### Input Representation
To simplify the task of building a drift detection model, we start by transforming the raw input sequences Y into a fixed size representation X. For example, if Y is a multivariate timeseries, we might extract features like mean, median, minimum, maximum, quantiles, etc., computed over multiple windows of equal length. Another option would be to use a learned feature extraction module that takes as input the whole sequence Y and outputs a fixed size representation X.

### Expected Log Likelihood Ratio Estimation
Next, we need to estimate the expected log likelihood ratios between adjacent timesteps of the transformed sequence X. The basic idea is to predict the next observation as a linear combination of previous observations, conditioned on all the previous observations up to that point. Intuitively, this should capture the relationship between the current and past observations in the original sequence. 

Using the predicted values, we shift the estimates one step forward in time, so that E(y_t|x) corresponds to the log likelihood ratio between the true observation at time t and the estimated observation at time t+1. These shifted estimates correspond to the potential transitions between normal and abnormal modes of behavior based on sudden jumps in observed variables. By comparing these estimates across different points in time, we can identify regions of the input sequence that exhibit large changes in behavior compared to what was previously seen. 

One commonly used metric to measure the similarity between two distributions is Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL divergence). As a baseline comparison, we can simply compare the same window of the input sequence obtained at different times, since any transition in the underlying data should propagate throughout the full duration of the sequence.

For a particular region of the input sequence, we build a binary decision tree classifier to distinguish normal from abnormal mode of behavior based on the difference between the expected log likelihood ratios obtained above. A well-balanced decision tree usually results in low bias and high precision, indicating good sensitivity and specificity respectively. 

Once the classifier is trained, we can query it to classify the current input distribution as normal or abnormal based on the difference between the last few expected log likelihood ratios. We report the location of any detected abnormal regions alongside their sizes and severity scores derived from the corresponding KL divergences.

## Adaptation Component
If the input sequence contains an abnormal pattern, our adaptive strategy involves updating the importance of specific features in the LSTM model using gradient boosting regression trees. Here's how it works:

Firstly, we gather a set of recent observations X = {x<sub>k</sub>}<sub>1:t</sub>. We compute the posterior probability P(z=abnormal|X) using the LSTM model, i.e., p(z=abnormal|X,theta), where theta denotes the parameters of the model. Since we want to learn online and in a piecemeal fashion, we do not want to wait until the end of the sequence before updating the model, hence we update the model every m steps depending on the actual performance of the LSTM model. Therefore, once we detect an abnormal pattern, we immediately start collecting recent observations to train the model and adjust its weights dynamically.

Secondly, we train a gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) on the collected observations using the negative binomial loss function. Each node in the tree represents a subset of the features in X, and the target variable z is encoded as a categorical variable that takes on either zero or one. At each node, we calculate the negative binomial loss of the left child minus the sum of losses of the right children weighted by the fraction of observations assigned to each branch. The goal is to minimize the total loss, and the splits are chosen greedily according to the negative binomial loss reduction relative to the parent node. We stop splitting once the total loss is small enough.

The resulting tree defines a probabilistic mapping between the input X and the output variable z. We can use this map to infer the contribution of each feature to the classification outcome p(z=1|X) directly, which we can use as a signal for selecting the most informative features for further online updates. Specifically, we first prune the branches of the tree that contribute less than a certain threshold to the final decision. Then, we sort the remaining branches based on their contribution score and iteratively assign a decreasing weight to each selected feature until the desired level of stability is reached. We can tune the pruning threshold and the number of iterations using cross-validation techniques. 

Finally, we modify the parameters of the LSTM model using a backpropagation scheme. Starting from the initial parameter values, we perform one step of gradient descent for each feature affected by the adaptation. The modified parameters are used to initialize the next iteration of online adaptation.
