Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most important areas in Artificial Intelligence, with applications ranging from information retrieval to sentiment analysis to speech recognition to chatbots. A well-designed NLP pipeline can significantly improve the efficiency of a company’s AI systems by extracting valuable insights from unstructured text data. This article will be divided into three parts, each covering a different aspect of building an end-to-end NLP pipeline using popular open-source libraries such as NLTK or spaCy. We will start our discussion on tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, which are fundamental techniques used for natural language processing tasks. 

Tokenization refers to splitting a given text document into smaller components called tokens based on certain rules or patterns present within the text. These tokens can then be further processed using various NLP algorithms like part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing etc. The goal of tokenization is to extract relevant terms from the input text so that they can be fed to subsequent NLP algorithms efficiently. In this section we will discuss how tokenization works in practice. 

Stemming is another technique used for reducing words to their base or root form, which helps in reducing the dimensionality of the vocabulary while keeping the meaning of the sentence intact. For example, if we want to find the meaning of “running”, "run", "ran" and "runner" are all similar but have slight differences in their suffixes. However, stemmers try to convert these variants to a common standardized representation, thus leading to better search results. 

Lemmatization is yet another type of word reduction technique wherein inflectional forms of a word are converted to its base/dictionary form. It takes into account morphological and syntactic characteristics of the word, thus producing more accurate results than stemming.

We will now go through some basic examples of how these techniques work using Python and several open-source libraries such as NLTK and spaCy. Then, we will apply them to real-world scenarios to see the benefits of combining multiple techniques together to create a comprehensive NLP pipeline. At the end, we will also explore potential issues and challenges that arise due to limited dataset size, low performance of individual models, and sparsity of training data availability.

# 2.Basic Concepts & Terminology
## 2.1 Introduction to Tokens
Tokens refer to the smallest meaningful units in Natural Language Processing. They could be individual words, phrases, or even sentences depending upon the application. During tokenization, the entire document is broken down into small chunks, known as tokens, which represent the minimum unit of interest for downstream tasks. Tokens typically consist of alphabets and sometimes special characters such as hyphen (-), dot (.), comma (,) etc. Each token has a unique index number assigned to it. The first token in a document is usually denoted as '1'. Here's an example of two tokens extracted from a sample sentence - "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

1. Quick
2. Brown

In general, tokens depend upon the use case and task at hand, but there are generally four main categories of tokens: 

1. Words: Represent actual words and constitute the majority of tokens encountered in English language. 
2. Punctuation marks: Consist of non-alphabetic characters used for breaking up sentences, expressing thoughts, making lists, emphasizing points etc. 
3. Whitespace: Represents the spaces between words and punctuation marks. 
4. Numbers: Consist of numeric digits.

It is important to note that some languages may have specific classes of tokens. For example, Chinese character sequences can be represented using BPE (Byte Pair Encoding). Additionally, tokens do not necessarily need to correspond to valid words in the language being considered. Often, irrelevant or misspelled words can still be included in the same document. Thus, it is essential to preprocess the raw text data before tokenization to ensure that only informative content is retained. 

## 2.2 What is Stemming?
Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its base or root form. It involves removing affixes from words to reduce them to their core essence. This makes searching easier, especially when dealing with complex conjugations of verbs. Let's take a look at an example. Consider the following words:

1. running -> run   
2. deer -> deer  
3. laughing -> laugh   
 
These variations are related because the suffix 'ing' is removed from verb 'laugh', resulting in a new word 'laugh'. Similarly, other suffixes such as 'ed','s', 'd', 'n', 't' are often removed during stemming. However, there are exceptions to this rule, where the original word may actually mean something different after stemming. Therefore, choosing the correct approach depends on the intended purpose of the algorithm.

One advantage of stemming is that it produces consistent results across different contexts. For instance, "running" and "runner" both map to "run". Another advantage is that it reduces noise and enhances the quality of the data. There are many different stemming algorithms available, including Snowball stemmer, Porter stemmer, and Lancaster stemmer.

Now let us move onto lemmatization.<|im_sep|>
