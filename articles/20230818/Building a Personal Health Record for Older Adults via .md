The purpose of this project is to develop an online application that can provide personal health record management services to older adults. In order to achieve the goal, we need to design and implement several key features based on user needs and requirements. This article provides an overview of the development process followed by each feature implementation in detail. 

## Target Users 
Older adults who are experiencing health problems, especially those related to chronic diseases or physical illness.

## Problem Statement 
Chronic disease and physical illnesses are becoming more common in aging population as they result from lack of exercise and healthy eating habits. Older adults face many challenges when it comes to managing their medical records effectively due to the difficulty in accessing them and making sense of data overload. Therefore, there is a need for a mobile-friendly web-based application that enables users to access their personal health information quickly and easily with minimal interference. The main focus should be to optimize data accessibility so that users can manage their medical history efficiently and conveniently.

## Proposed Solution 
To address the above mentioned issues, we propose building a personal health record (PHR) system using a web-based application which would enable users to track and manage their medical histories more easily than traditional methods such as paper records. The proposed solution includes four core components: 

1. Patient Management System: This component will allow patients to register themselves onto the system with basic details like name, age, gender, contact numbers etc. It will also capture demographic information about the patient’s family members and social contacts. 
2. Medical Records Management System: Within the PHR, we intend to build a platform where patients can view, search, filter, edit, and delete their prescription, lab reports, hospitalization notes, medication schedules, immunization records and any other relevant documents without requiring paperwork. We will integrate advanced technologies like AI algorithms and natural language processing tools to assist doctors in providing effective diagnosis and treatment plans.
3. Appointment Scheduling Module: This module will allow users to schedule appointments with their doctor. It will help improve communication between patients and physicians while also allowing them to stay up-to-date on all their upcoming appointments and reminders. 
4. Feedback & Rating Module: Finally, we plan to incorporate a feedback and rating mechanism into the system where users can submit anonymous feedback and ratings to improve quality of care provided to them. We expect this to enhance overall satisfaction levels of patients and ultimately contribute towards improving the lives of these elders.

We believe that implementing a well-designed PHR system with advanced technology integration will significantly reduce the burden on older adults to maintain accurate and timely medical records. Moreover, it will provide valuable insights to improve patient care and increase efficiency through better utilization of resources. Additionally, we aim at ensuring that our product is easy to use, intuitive, and accessible to all end-users, including individuals with disabilities and mobility impairments.

## 2.1 概念和术语
Personal Health Record(PHR): A system used by individuals to keep track of their health conditions, diagnoses, procedures, drug orders, hospitalizations, visits, immunizations, hospital admissions, treatment plans, prescriptions, laboratory results, microbiology tests, radiological examinations, etc., usually in digital format. PHRs typically include both structured and unstructured data, depending upon the size and complexity of the individual's healthcare history. They can be stored digitally or electronically on computer systems or portable devices and accessed anywhere over the internet, enabling users to retrieve and analyze medical data on demand. Examples of popular PHRs are MyFitnessPal, Apple Health App, Google Fit and Nutritionix.
Web-Based Application(WBA): A software program developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks such as ReactJS, AngularJS, Vue.js, etc., that runs on a web server and can be accessed through a web browser. WBAs can be designed specifically for specific functions, tasks, or workflows and can provide enhanced performance compared to desktop applications. Popular examples of WBAs include Salesforce, Zoho Books, Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox, Uber Eats, LinkedIn, etc.
