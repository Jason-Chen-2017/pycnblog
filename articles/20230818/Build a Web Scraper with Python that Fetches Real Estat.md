Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using software tools instead of manual clicking and copying actions. It allows developers to access large amounts of data without having to manually enter it or search for specific information online. There are several python libraries available for web scraping including Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Scrapy, etc., which makes building scrappers easier than ever before. In this article, we will use BeautifulSoup library in Python to build a simple real estate price scraper program that fetches prices of properties listed on Zillow.com website. The code can be easily modified to fetch other property prices as well. 

This article assumes readers have some experience in programming, HTML/CSS, and general knowledge of web scraping techniques. We will not go into too much detail about those concepts but rather focus on how to use BeautifulSoup library to extract data from HTML pages.

Zillow.com is one of the most popular real estate websites globally with over 9 million listings and offers users an array of features such as comparing rental prices, buying tips, and listing reviews. This enables potential investors to make educated decisions when making purchases and gives them a clear idea of what they could potentially pay for their investment. Thus, there is a great need for data-driven strategies to help people find the best deal based on current market conditions.  

In summary, we want to show you how easy it is to build a basic web scraper with Python by using BeautifulSoup library to extract data from HTML pages. By following these steps, you should be able to build your own personalized program to fetch real estate pricing data from different sources like Zillow.com.

Let's get started!
# 2.Basic Concepts
Before diving into the coding part, let’s first understand the basic concepts and terms used while working with web scrapers:

1) HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is the protocol used for transmitting data between a web browser and a server on the internet. It defines the format of messages sent across the network and rules for communicating between servers and clients.

2) URL: A URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It specifies where a resource is located on the Internet. When we type a URL in our browser address bar, the computer sends a request to the server specified in the URL via HTTP.

3) Domain Name System (DNS): DNS is responsible for translating domain names like www.example.com to IP addresses like 172.16.58.3. DNS helps us locate the physical location of resources on the Internet. 

4) IP Address: An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to the internet. It acts like a physical address and identifies the device uniquely among all devices.

5) Server: A server is a computing machine that provides services to multiple computers on the Internet. It holds the files and programs required to serve its client requests. 

6) Client: A client is any user who wants to access a service provided by a server. Examples include browsers, email applications, social media platforms, and even mobile apps.

7) HTML: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create webpages. It includes tags for formatting text, images, links, videos, tables, etc. 

8) DOM: Document Object Model (DOM) refers to a programming interface used by web browsers to represent and interact with the content, structure, and semantics of a document. It consists of a tree-like structure composed of nodes representing elements of an HTML page.

9) CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to define the presentation of a webpage. It includes styles for fonts, colors, backgrounds, borders, layout, animations, etc.

10) JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data interchange format inspired by the object literal notation of JavaScript. It is commonly used for exchanging data between web applications and APIs.


Now that we know the basics, let’s dive into the code implementation.
