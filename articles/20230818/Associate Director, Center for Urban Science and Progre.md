# 2.核心术语、概念及定义
## 2.1 Space
Space refers to any natural or manmade environment that can be occupied by living organisms or objects, including buildings, vehicles, and equipment. In urban planning, space includes all types of built environments, from rural households to highways, parks, and recreation areas.

## 2.2 Built Environment
A built environment consists of physical features such as structures, materials, and landscapes that make up a particular space or portion thereof. These include walls, roofs, floors, ceilings, and furniture. A built environment typically has several functions, including providing infrastructure services, connecting people and goods, and enhancing the quality of life for residents. Buildings also affect the health and safety of occupants and surrounding area.

## 2.3 Green Building Practices
Green building practices involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions through energy conservation, optimizing building performance, minimizing water usage, avoiding excessive ventilation, and installing insulation technologies such as heat transfer elements.

## 2.4 Air Pollution
Air pollution refers to gases, particles, or clouds that enter an air stream and negatively affect human health and the environment. There are two main sources of air pollution: sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is found naturally in industrial facilities; and particulates, which are released during vehicular exhaust or combustion processes. Each type of pollutant has different effects on human health and the environment, depending on the location, amount, and frequency of occurrence.

## 2.5 Transportation Modes
Transportation modes refer to the means used to move humans and/or goods from one place to another. There are various types of transportation modes, including automobiles, bikes, scooters, trucks, ships, and walkers. Each mode has its own set of benefits and drawbacks, which must be taken into account when making decisions regarding transportation systems.

## 2.6 Housing Equity
Housing equity refers to ensuring that housing opportunities are distributed fairly and equitably among different segments of the population. Housing markets often provide affordable housing options but may result in disparities between the wealthiest and poorest residents. Therefore, policies that increase housing availability and fairness should be implemented.
