Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently been gaining significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence due to its ability to learn complex policies directly from raw visual or textual inputs. The state-of-the-art algorithms have achieved impressive results across various real-world applications including playing Atari games such as Pong, Seaquest, Space Invaders etc., solving robotic control tasks like manipulating objects and performing dexterous actions in real environments, and mastering chess and shogi games by self-play. In this article we will discuss DRL algorithms applied for human level control, namely, playing flappy bird game using DQN algorithm, training an agent to play chess and shogi against itself using AlphaZero algorithm, teaching machines to read and comprehend text using multi-task learning approach, designing medical diagnoses using deep reinforcement learning technique, and developing agents capable of planning better decisions using deep reinforcement learning techniques. We also showcase some sample code snippets demonstrating how these algorithms can be implemented and trained on different types of data sets. Finally, we conclude with some future research directions and challenges in AI/ML domain related to the use of DRL techniques for human level control. 

# 2.核心概念和术语
Before discussing each of the above mentioned problems and solutions, let's first clarify few core concepts used throughout the article and their significance. 

1. Markov Decision Process(MDP): A Markov decision process is a mathematical model used to describe a sequential decision making problem where the environment transitions between states and actions are probabilistically determined, i.e., next state and reward depend only on current state and action but not on previous states or actions.

2. Reinforcement Learning(RL): Reinforcement learning is one of the most fundamental paradigms of machine learning and deals with the interaction between an agent and its environment, where it learns to select actions based on the outcome of its interactions with the environment. It involves three components - Agent, Environment, and Policy. An agent interacts with its environment and receives feedback after taking actions. Based on the received feedback, the agent updates its policy which specifies what action to take in the next step. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in terms of the type of input data provided to the model. Supervised learning requires labeled examples while reinforcement learning relies on unstructured data generated by the environment.

3. Q-Learning: Q-learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm developed in 1992 by Watkins, Barto, and Rubinstein at ATARI Inc. Its key idea is to train an agent to find the best action for any given state by estimating the value function V(s), which describes the long-term expected return when starting from that state and taking optimal actions thereafter. Essentially, Q-learning explores the environment by taking actions that lead to high rewards, and updates its estimation of the value function accordingly.

4. Double Q-Learning: Double Q-Learning is a variant of standard Q-learning algorithm that reduces overestimation bias. In standard Q-learning, when selecting the maximum action among all possible actions, the maximum action is taken according to the estimated values obtained using the Q-network. However, if two different actions have same maximal value, then the second action may not necessarily be optimal. To avoid this scenario, double Q-learning uses two separate Q-networks, referred to as Q-network and target network. During training, both networks update themselves iteratively, so that the weights in both networks get updated simultaneously. By doing so, it avoids overestimating the returns caused by the same action selected by different Q-values, thus reducing overestimation bias. 

5. Experience Replay: Experience replay is a technique used to improve the stability and convergence of RL algorithms. It involves storing past experience tuples in a replay memory buffer, and randomly sampling batches of experiences from the buffer during learning iterations to prevent catastrophic forgetting. 

6. Neural Network: A neural network is a set of interconnected processing units designed to accept input data, transform them into output, and adjust internal parameters based on the error signal. There are several types of neural networks, including feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformer networks.

7. Gym: Gym provides a common interface for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It allows developers to test their algorithms on a wide range of simulated environments without worrying about implementation details. One popular benchmark task is OpenAI Gym’s FlappyBird environment, which tests the performance of an agent trained using DQN algorithm on a modified version of the classic arcade game Flappy Bird.
