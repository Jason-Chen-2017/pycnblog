Data governance, also known as data stewardship or data management, is a set of processes and procedures to ensure that an organization's data assets are well-managed throughout their lifecycle. Data governance covers several critical aspects such as security, quality, privacy, and access control. 

Data governance is an essential aspect of any successful data strategy in organizations that manage large amounts of valuable data. Data governance ensures that the right data is managed at all stages of its lifecycle, from acquisition through use by users, to disposal after it has been decommissioned. This involves ensuring data retention policies and protocols, managing metadata for better discovery, maintaining documentation and traceability, and monitoring and enforcing compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

In this article, we will cover what data governance is, how it works, and why it is so important. We will go into detail about each step involved in data governance including:

1. Planning and designing data structures: The first step towards building a strong foundation for good data governance starts with planning and designing clear data structures. Good data structures define which types of information need to be collected, where it needs to be stored, and how it can be accessed. 

2. Providing reliable sources of data: Another crucial component of data governance is providing reliable sources of data. Sources should not only provide accurate data but also be trusted and available. This involves following best practices around data quality and integrity, using controlled vocabularies and standards, and making sure data providers are ethical and responsible actors.

3. Applying data protection laws: Many countries have strict data protection laws and policies that must be followed. Complying with these laws requires detailed knowledge and understanding of the risks associated with handling sensitive personal data. In addition to adhering to industry-standard encryption techniques, organizations must protect sensitive data through regularly scheduled audits, education, and training on data protection principles.

4. Conducting regular reviews and audits: Regular reviews and audits ensure that data usage and management meets the needs of the business and comply with relevant legislation and policy guidelines. Reviewing and auditing data provides visibility into data activities and allows stakeholders to make sound strategic decisions based on timely and consistent results.

As you read along, keep an eye out for key terms you may encounter (e.g., "audit" or "encryption"). When googling these terms, try searching for them within the context of data governance to find more resources and ideas about how they work. Finally, remember to always seek input from subject matter experts and engage with your colleagues in order to create a collaborative approach to tackle data governance effectively.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving deep into data governance, let’s briefly review some basic concepts and terminology used in data governance. 

## 2.1 Definition
Data governance refers to the oversight, management, and stewardship of enterprise data. It applies across multiple industries and geographies, helping organizations develop a comprehensive plan for collecting, storing, analyzing, and sharing data. Key features of data governance include:

1. Enhancing data value: Data governance plays a vital role in increasing data value by supporting continuous improvement of data infrastructure, processes, and systems. 

2. Ensuring data coherence: Data governance helps maintain consistency and cohesion between different data streams and applications, preventing unintended interdependencies and errors that could lead to poor data outcomes. 

3. Improving operational efficiency: Data governance promotes efficient use of data resources by enabling data integration, automation, and decision support capabilities. 

4. Optimizing data costs: Data governance helps minimize or avoid unnecessary expenses related to data storage and maintenance, thereby reducing overall cost savings and improving customer experience. 

Data governance includes five core components: 
**Plan:** Developing a high-level plan for data governance to identify key priorities and strategies.  
**Policy:** Defining organizational standards and guidelines for data governance that guide individual team members and enable cross-team collaboration.   
**Process:** Implementing established workflows, procedures, and tools to streamline and optimize data management tasks.     
**Technology:** Empowering data scientists, analysts, engineers, and other IT professionals with technology platforms, tools, and services to enhance data processing, analysis, visualization, and reporting capabilities.    
**People:** Building a robust data governance community that supports and encourages ongoing communication and collaboration amongst stakeholders and leaders. 


## 2.2 Key Terms

**Data:** A collection of facts or values organized in a structured format suitable for computer processing. Data can come from many sources, such as databases, transaction records, scientific instruments, sensors, etc. Examples of common data elements include names, addresses, phone numbers, email messages, purchase orders, stock prices, and medical records.  

**Dataset:** A set of related data that share some characteristic, usually defined by a unique identifier. For example, a dataset might contain sales transactions made during one year. Each row of the dataset represents a single piece of data, like a specific sale or customer.  

**Data asset:** Any item of data that has intrinsic value beyond just being a piece of information. Assets typically represent tangible products or services created or consumed by an entity, like vehicles, property, software licenses, human capital, revenue, profit, interest rates, employment opportunities, insurance payments, or social media profiles. Asset types include databases, reports, dashboards, models, algorithms, forms, APIs, templates, mobile apps, and web applications. 

**Business process:** An organized sequence of steps performed by an entity to achieve a particular outcome, such as selling a product to a customer or delivering goods to a customer. Business processes can involve multiple people working together to accomplish complex tasks, requiring shared understanding and coordination. 

**Metadata:** Data about data. Metadata describes the characteristics of data assets, such as who created it, when it was last updated, and what purpose it serves. Common examples of metadata include titles, descriptions, ownership details, keywords, tags, and labels.

**Sensitive data:** Personal data that falls under certain legal definitions, such as healthcare records, financial information, national identity cards, and criminal records. Identifying, classifying, securing, and protecting sensitive data requires careful attention to safeguarding confidentiality, integrity, availability, and transparency.

**Data lake:** A central repository of structured and unstructured data that stores copies of both current and historical data sets. Data lakes provide a centralized location for raw and transformed data to improve data quality, speed up analytics, and enable easier access to data for various teams and roles. 

**Data warehouse:** A physical database designed to store massive volumes of data, used for ad hoc querying, analysis, and reporting purposes. Data warehouses collect and organize data across multiple sources and integrate it into a single system to support decision-making and insights. 

**Data pipeline:** A series of automated processes that moves data from one point to another without manual intervention, such as ETL (extract, transform, load) pipelines or ELT (extract, load, transform). Pipelines allow for easy movement of data and increased scalability and agility of data processing. 

**API:** Application Programming Interface. An interface that defines a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. APIs act as the bridge between internal and external systems, enabling data exchange between them. Common examples of APIs include RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, SOAP APIs, and RPC APIs. 

**Vendor lock-in:** Referring to the practice of relying too much on a single vendor or supplier, often resulting in sub-par performance or limited options in the future. Vendor lock-in increases complexity, leads to fragmentation of solutions, and creates dependency risk. To mitigate vendor lock-in, organizations should consider integrating third-party services instead of relying solely on one provider.
