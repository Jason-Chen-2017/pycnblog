Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification or regression analysis. In this post we will introduce the basic concepts behind support vector machines including how they work and what makes them different from other machine learning algorithms. We will also explore the main steps involved in applying an SVM using scikit-learn library in python and learn about its parameters and techniques for optimizing performance. Finally, we will compare multiple SVM implementations using various libraries such as libsvm and sci-kit learn and determine which one is best suited for our problem at hand.

## 2.1 Support Vector Machines(SVMs)简介
Support vector machines are a set of supervised learning methods used for both classification and regression tasks. They are especially useful when dealing with complex datasets that have overlapping points or outliers. An SVM constructs a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes in higher dimensional space so that it can separate data into distinct classes while maximizing the margin between the two classes. It does this by finding the largest possible distance between any point within each class and the hyperplane, hence minimizing the impact of irrelevant features on the decision boundary.

An SVM model consists of a set of support vectors and a hyperplane that separates them. These support vectors play a crucial role in determining the position of the hyperplane. If you add new training examples to your dataset, it's important not to include any misclassified examples since these could cause your SVM model to collapse. Therefore, it's essential to use appropriate kernel functions to project the input data into a higher dimension where linear separation becomes impossible. Kernel functions help us convert non-linearly separable data into a linearly separable form. Some commonly used kernels are linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), sigmoidal, and precomputed kernel.

## 2.2 Linear Separability and Non-Linear Transformations
One of the key challenges faced during training of SVM models is that the data may be too complex to find a straight line that perfectly separates the data into classes. This leads to difficulties in finding the right weights for the decision boundary because the data is highly nonlinear and cannot be separated easily using a single straight line. To solve this issue, we need to apply some non-linear transformations before feeding the data into our SVM model. One common technique is to use the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. RBF kernel takes the dot product of the input data with a Gaussian function centered around each support vector. As a result, the transformed data is now smooth and separable using only a few support vectors. However, choosing the correct values of gamma and C is critical for good performance of SVMs. Gamma controls the width of the Gaussian function and C controls the tradeoff between misclassification error and slack variables. Hyperparameters like gamma and C can be optimized using cross validation.

## 2.3 Choosing Appropriate Regularization Parameter
Regularization is a process of adding a penalty term to the cost function during training of an SVM model to avoid overfitting the model to the training data. When the regularization parameter C is small, the SVM tries to fit the training data exactly, resulting in high bias and low variance. On the other hand, if C is large, then the model tries to generalize well to unseen data but might suffer from high variance. Thus, selecting an appropriate value for C is critical for achieving good performance of an SVM model. 

A popular approach to choose an optimal C value is called cross validation. Cross validation involves splitting the dataset into two parts - a training set and a test set. The objective is to select the best hyperparameter values based on the performance of the model on the test set. Common approaches to optimize C include grid search and randomized search. Grid search involves trying all possible combinations of C values and picking the one with the highest accuracy on the test set. Randomized search randomly selects a subset of possible C values and evaluates their performance on the test set.
