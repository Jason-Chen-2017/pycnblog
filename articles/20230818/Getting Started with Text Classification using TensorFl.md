Text classification is a task of categorizing text into predefined categories or topics. It can be used in various applications such as sentiment analysis, spam filtering, document indexing, topic modeling, etc. In this article we will use the popular machine learning libraries scikit-learn and TensorFlow to perform text classification on a movie review dataset. We will also discuss about its working principles and implement it from scratch step by step. 

The goal of our tutorial is to provide an overview of how to classify texts using deep learning techniques. The approach used here should not only help beginners get started but also experts understand the underlying concepts involved. I hope you enjoy reading the article!

Before starting with the actual implementation, let's first understand some fundamental terms and concepts related to text classification: 

1. **Text**: A sequence of characters that represent a piece of natural language information (text) like a sentence, paragraph, or email message.

2. **Classification problem**: Given a set of training examples where each example has a corresponding label, the goal of text classification is to train a model to predict the labels for new unseen instances based on their features(i.e., text). There are two types of classification problems - binary classification and multi-class classification.

    * Binary classification: For a given input instance, the target variable takes either one of two possible values (usually called positive/negative), which is usually indicated by assigning a value of either 0 or 1. For example, spam filtering can be considered as a binary classification problem. 
    * Multi-class classification: In this case, the target variable can take more than two possible values. For example, given a news headline, we may want to categorize it into one of several categories such as politics, sports, entertainment, etc. 

3. **Feature extraction**: Converting raw text data into numerical feature vectors is known as feature extraction. Feature extraction involves selecting specific features that are useful for classification and discarding irrelevant ones. Some common feature extraction techniques include bag-of-words, n-grams, TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc. These techniques can be implemented using various libraries in Python such as NLTK, Gensim, etc.

4. **Training and testing datasets**: During the training process, the labeled training data is split into a training dataset and a validation dataset. The validation dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model during training. After the model is fully trained, we test it on the held-out test dataset.

5. **Cross-validation**: Cross-validation is a technique used to avoid overfitting in the training phase. It consists of splitting the training dataset into multiple subsets, performing the training process on different subsets, and evaluating the model's performance on the remaining subset. This helps ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

6. **Metrics**: Metrics are used to measure the performance of a classifier. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, PR curve, confusion matrix, etc. Each metric is designed to address certain challenges associated with text classification such as imbalanced class distribution, noisy labels, overlapping classes, etc.

7. **Regularization**: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in the neural network models. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function that makes it harder for the model to fit the training data. Some commonly used regularization methods include L1, L2, dropout, batch normalization, etc.

8. **Oversampling**: Oversampling refers to increasing the number of minority samples in the dataset. One way to do this is to randomly duplicate existing minority samples. Another method is to generate synthetic minority samples by generating random perturbations of existing minority samples.

9. **Under-sampling**: Under-sampling refers to reducing the number of majority samples in the dataset. One simple method is to remove the majority samples without replacement. However, other sampling strategies exist such as clustering, Tomek Links, near Miss, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), etc.
