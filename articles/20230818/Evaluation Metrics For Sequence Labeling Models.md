序列标注（Sequence labeling）任务旨在从一段文本中抽取出每个词汇或符号的标签信息，其中标签通常采用标记或者分类的方式表示，如“名词”、“动词”等等。根据序列标注模型对序列进行预测的准确性，可以给出其预测质量的评价指标。目前最常用的评估标准是F1-score。然而，不同的序列标注任务可能存在不同的评估标准。本文将介绍一些常用序列标注任务的评估标准，并分析它们各自的优缺点，给出了相应模型的选择建议。



# 2.Terminology and Notation
序列标注任务一般涉及以下几个方面：输入序列X，输出序列Y和对应的标签序列Z，即模型需要考虑如何将输入序列映射到输出序列。

1. Input sequence: X = x1, x2,..., xn (n is the length of input sequence) 
2. Output sequence: Y = y1, y2,..., ym (m is the length of output sequence) 
3. Label sequence: Z = z1, z2,..., zm (m is the same as m in output sequence) 


# 3. Core Algorithm Principle & Details
## 3.1 Definition of F1 Score for Sequence Labeling Task
The formula for computing the F1 score for sequence labeling task is given by: 

$$
\begin{align*} 
&precision=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(TP_i)}{{\sum_{i=1}^{m}TP_i+FP_i}} \\ 
&\text { recall }=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(TP_i)}{{\sum_{i=1}^{m}TP_i+FN_i}} \\ 
&\text { F1-score }={\frac{2*precision*recall}{precision+recall}}
\end{align*}
$$

where $TP_i$ means true positive at position i, $FP_i$ means false positive at position i, and $FN_i$ means false negative at position i. In general, the precision measures how well the model can identify all relevant instances among the retrieved instances; while the recall measures how well it retrieves all relevant instances. The F1-score combines both metrics into a single measure that balances their importance according to their ability to detect relevant and retrieve irrelevant instances.

For example, if we have the following data set:

```
    X        |   Y           |    Z  
----------------------------------------
 The quick brown fox | Quick Brown Fox|      
                    |                |     
                    | Ju        ... |    
```

If our model predicts "Quick Brown Fox" instead of "Ju", then this prediction would be considered a false positive because the predicted tag doesn't match with any actual tag in the correct span. On the other hand, if our model misses the word "brown" entirely or incorrectly tags it as an instance of "quick," then these predictions would be counted as false negatives, since they don't meet the desired level of accuracy.

Using this metric allows us to evaluate models' performance on various tasks such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, etc., which require identifying and classifying specific spans of text.

## 3.2 Defining Other Common Evaluation Metrics
### 3.2.1 Accuracy vs Precision/Recall Tradeoff
Accuracy is one way to quantify the overall quality of a classification model's predictions, but its limitations make it less useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets where some classes are much more frequent than others. Instead, we may want to consider other evaluation metrics like precision and recall, which give us information about how well the model identifies each individual class within its assigned labels. We also need to keep in mind that there isn't always a perfect trade-off between precision and recall, especially when the number of samples in each category is small compared to the total dataset size. 

One approach to address this issue is to use a combination of precision and recall as a measure of the model's overall performance across all categories. This is known as micro-averaging, meaning we calculate the average over all categories together rather than calculating them separately and then averaging their results. Another option is macro-averaging, which calculates the metrics for each category individually and then takes the mean of those values. These approaches can help avoid the problem of using metrics that favor low-frequency classes too heavily, resulting in biased evaluations. Here's the equation for calculating macro-average precision and recall:

$$
\begin{align*} 
\text{macro-average precision} &= \frac{\sum_{\text{category i}\in C} P_i}{\text{# categories}} \\ 
\text{macro-average recall} &= \frac{\sum_{\text{category i}\in C} R_i}{\text{# categories}} \\ 
P_i &= \frac{\sum_{\forall j}\delta(\hat{y}_{ij}=1)\delta(z_j=i)}{\sum_{\forall j}\delta(\hat{y}_{ij}=1)}\\
R_i &= \frac{\sum_{\forall j}\delta(\hat{y}_{ij}=1)\delta(z_j=i)}{\sum_{\forall j}\delta(z_j=i)}
\end{align*}
$$

In this case $\hat{y}_{ij}$ refers to the predicted label for sample $i$ at position $j$, while $z_j$ corresponds to the actual label for sample $i$. The symbol $\delta$ represents the Kronecker delta function, which evaluates to 1 only when the two conditions inside the parentheses are simultaneously satisfied. Finally, $\text{# categories}$ denotes the total number of unique categories present in the dataset.

This type of evaluation metric addresses several issues with traditional accuracy-based metrics. It gives us better insights into how well the model performs under different scenarios, including cases where some classes are highly imbalanced. However, calculating micro- and macro-averaged precision and recall requires keeping track of multiple scores per category, which can be computationally intensive. Therefore, it might not be suitable for very large datasets or where the runtime requirements are high.

### 3.2.2 Balanced Error Rate (BERTScore)
BERTScore is another common metric used for evaluating sequence labeling models. Unlike traditional metrics that rely solely on the accuracy of the model's predictions, BERTScore considers both the proportion of errors and their positions relative to the ground truth annotations. Specifically, it computes three separate scores for each pair of sequences:

1. Precision: How many of the annotated tokens do we correctly predict? 
2. Recall: Of the tokens we should have predicted, what fraction did we actually predict? 
3. F1-score: A weighted average of precision and recall that takes into account the balance between the cost of missing important tokens versus incorrect ones. 

These metrics are computed for every possible alignment between the predicted and gold standard labels based on edit distance or dynamic programming. The best alignment is chosen as the optimal solution, and the final BERTScore is the average of these three metrics calculated for all pairs of aligned subsequences.

BERTScore has been shown to perform well across numerous NLP tasks, particularly those related to natural language inference and textual entailment. However, it does require access to pre-trained contextual embeddings for generating candidate hypotheses, which can add computational overhead and limit its scalability to long sequences. Moreover, it cannot directly handle multi-class problems without additional preprocessing steps, which makes it less straightforward to apply to unstructured data sets. Nonetheless, it remains an effective tool for measuring the quality of models' predictions when applied to relatively simple sequence labeling tasks.
