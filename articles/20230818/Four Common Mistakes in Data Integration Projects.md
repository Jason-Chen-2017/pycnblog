Data integration refers to the process of bringing data from multiple sources together into a single cohesive and meaningful source for decision-making or analysis purposes. It is important because it allows organizations to draw on diverse datasets that contain valuable information for improving business outcomes, processes, and customer experiences. However, with great power comes great responsibility, as data integration projects can sometimes become complex, error-prone, and expensive, leading to long lead times and poor decision making accuracy. Therefore, it’s essential to take precautions and make sure you have the right tools and techniques in place before embarking on any project. In this article we will discuss four common mistakes that can occur when conducting data integration projects:

1. Lack of Data Quality Assurance (QA)
2. Poor Data Mapping/Transformation
3. Irrelevant Data Extraction
4. Loss of Fidelity between Source Systems
This article assumes readers are familiar with data integration concepts such as ETL, ELT, OLTP vs OLAP databases, transactional vs analytical processing, and data quality assurance (QA). If not, please consult external resources or contact our team for further assistance.
## 2.Basic Concepts and Terms
### 2.1 Data Integration Terminology
**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** This refers to the traditional three-step process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a consistent format, and loading it into the target system. There are many different approaches to implementing ETL systems, including SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), Apache Airflow, and Snowflake Data Transfer Tools (DTT).

**ELT (Extract, Load, Transform):** The opposite approach to ETL is known as Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT). Here, instead of integrating data directly within the database, data is extracted from one or more sources using Extract tools, stored in an intermediary store like Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage, transformed using Transformation tools, and finally loaded into the target database using a Loader tool.

**OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):** A relational database management system used to manage transactions that involve real-time access to data. Examples include Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

**OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):** Another type of database designed specifically for analytic queries over large volumes of structured or unstructured data. These databases are optimized for fast response time and high throughput, which makes them ideal for use cases where businesses need to analyze and report on massive amounts of data quickly. Examples include Hadoop-based Big Data warehouses like Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, and Alibaba Cloud Databricks.

**Transaction:** Transactions represent individual changes made to data, usually represented as insertions, deletions, or updates. Each transaction is associated with a unique identifier called a transaction ID (TID).

**Attribute:** Attributes describe specific characteristics of data elements, such as age, name, address, and salary. They define the structure of each record in a table or document.

**Dimensionality:** Dimensionality refers to how many dimensions or attributes a dataset has. A dataset with few dimensions or attributes is said to be sparse; a dataset with many dimensions or attributes is said to be dense. Sparse datasets are easier to work with but require more storage space, while dense datasets are less prone to slow performance due to their larger size.

**Granularity:** Granularity refers to the level of detail contained in the data. For example, annual financial reports may contain data at the month-level granularity, whereas sales records might be collected weekly or daily. 

**Primary Key:** Primary keys are columns or groups of columns that uniquely identify each row in a table. They enable efficient indexing and querying of tables, and provide the foundation for data integrity. While there can be several primary keys per table, they should also form a logical set of attributes that identify each instance of an entity.
