Flappy bird is a mobile game developed by Bejeweled interactive Entertainment. It was released on Google Play and Apple Store in October 2012, with over ten million downloads worldwide. The objective of the game is to maneuver a prey character through flight using wings that are attached to their backs. In this article, we will learn how to implement a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent called "Q-learning" algorithm for playing Flappy Bird game. DRL algorithms have been widely used in many fields such as gaming, robotics, finance etc., which can achieve state-of-the-art performance. We will use Python programming language and PyTorch library for implementing our solution.
The key components of a DRL algorithm for Flappy Bird include:

1. Environment - A virtual environment where the agent interacts with the game. This includes the bird's position, velocity, angle, score, and actions taken by the player or AI controller. 

2. Agent - An AI controller capable of taking actions based on its perception of the current state and reward received from the environment.

3. Experience Replay Buffer - A memory buffer that stores previous experiences of the agent interacting with the environment. These past experiences can be used to improve the agent's policy function by replaying them multiple times during training.

4. Policy Function - A mathematical function that takes a state vector as input and returns an action selected by the agent. The goal of the policy function is to learn the optimal sequence of actions given different states.

5. Q-function - A mathematical function that estimates the expected return of taking an action in a particular state. The main idea behind Q-learning is to update the Q-value function iteratively, so that it represents the best possible value of being in each state and taking each action. 

To train our agent, we first need to define the environment and then set up our Q-function model and policy network. During training, we use experience replay buffer to sample previous experiences and perform gradient descent updates on the weights of the model parameters to maximize future rewards. Finally, we evaluate the trained agent by playing against it and recording its performance metrics like success rate, average score etc. Our final solution should also be able to run smoothly on modern CPUs and GPUs and provide realistic results within a reasonable time frame.

In order to create a successful DRL agent for Flappy Bird game, we will follow these steps:

1. Understand the Flappy Bird environment
2. Implement a Q-learning algorithm 
3. Train the agent to play the Flappy Bird game
4. Evaluate the agent's performance 

Let’s dive deeper into each step and explain further:

## Step 1: Understanding the Flappy Bird environment

Before jumping into implementation details, let's understand the physical characteristics of the Flappy Bird environment. Here is what we know about the bird's movement in the environment:

### Physical Characteristics 
* There are two types of obstacles in the game: pipe and floor tiles
* The bird moves horizontally across the screen, making one full rotation around its body
* Each half-rotation brings the bird closer to the ground before hitting the ground again
* After reaching the top of the screen, the bird falls downwards until it hits either a pipe or another obstacle
* When a bird passes through the pipe tile, it increases its fitness score, and hence, reduces the chances of falling off the edge of the screen

Here's how the bird appears when it reaches the bottom of the screen:



We can observe several interesting features of the flappy bird environment:

#### Obstacle Dynamics

Obstacles move vertically at a constant speed along the y-axis. Once they reach the end of the screen, they disappear and new ones replace them. Pipe tiles move horizontally at a random speed between approximately 60 and 80 pixels per second, and are separated from other objects by a gap of approx. 100 pixels.

#### Reward Mechanism

The bird receives positive reward for passing through pipes, and negative reward for losing a life due to colliding with obstacles or going beyond the bounds of the screen. Loose lifes eventually result in death.

## Step 2: Implementing the Q-learning Algorithm

Now, we'll discuss how to design the neural networks required for our agent to learn how to navigate the flappy bird environment. Specifically, we will focus on understanding the basic concepts involved in building a Deep Q Network architecture, including loss functions, optimization techniques, and exploration strategies.

### Neural Networks Architecture

Our agent uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCN), built upon Keras and TensorFlow frameworks respectively. 

CNN layers extract relevant information from visual inputs and pass them through feature maps, while FCN layers take advantage of non-linear combinations of the extracted features and make predictions. The following diagram shows a simplified version of the architecture for our agent:


### Loss Functions and Optimization Techniques

Our agent learns from its experience in the environment by updating its policy function Q(S,A). At each iteration, the agent samples a batch of N experiences from the experience replay buffer, represented by tuples containing S, A, R, S'. The batch is used to compute the target values, Y, i.e., the maximum Q value attainable starting from next state S' using the learned policy function.

The loss function used for learning is the mean squared error between predicted targets and actual outcomes. Since Q(S',A') is not known, we cannot directly optimize for it. Instead, we approximate it using the Q-target estimate, computed recursively using the same policy network.

One approach for computing the Q-target is to use the bellman equation:

Q_target = R + gamma * max_{a} Q(S',a)

where, S' is the next state after performing action A' to get to state S, R is the reward obtained by arriving at state S, gamma is the discount factor, and max_{a} Q(S',a) denotes the highest Q-value achievable by any action in state S'.

After calculating the Q-targets for all the batches sampled from the experience replay buffer, we apply gradients descent to adjust the weights of the policy network using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent with momentum. Momentum helps accelerate the convergence process and avoid oscillations.

Finally, we use an epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration during training, meaning that some percentage of episodes starts by exploring randomly instead of exploiting the learned policies. Epsilon decreases linearly throughout the course of training, allowing us to explore more deeply later in the process.

Overall, the use of CNNs and FCNs allows our agent to efficiently capture the spatial relationships and dependencies between various elements of the game environment. By leveraging the power of modern deep learning libraries, we can build complex models that can solve complex problems with ease.
