Business Intelligence (BI) is the process of extracting valuable insights from large amounts of data and analyzing it in order to make strategic decisions. In recent years, several technologies have emerged that allow businesses to analyze their data using software tools such as Excel, which has become one of the most popular data analysis tools used by organizations around the world. 

However, despite its popularity among analysts, many companies still struggle with implementing BI successfully due to the complexity of setting up a robust environment for managing the end-to-end BI project. This article will discuss how to use Excel as an advanced BI tool and provide guidance on best practices and challenges faced by businesses while implementing this technology.

## Business Intelligence(BI) Definition
Business Intelligence refers to the application of statistical techniques, computer programming skills, database management, and expertise in business intelligence to support decision making across multiple business areas. It involves gathering, organizing, and analyzing various types of information from different sources to gain new insights about the organization’s operations, customers, products or services. The goal is to transform raw data into useful information that can be used to improve performance, enhance customer experience, drive sales, reduce costs, or identify market opportunities.

## Data Analysis Tools
Data Analysis Tools are essential tools used during the entire data analysis process, including data collection, storage, cleaning, transformation, exploration, modeling, visualization, reporting, and sharing. Popular tools include Microsoft Excel, Tableau, SAS Studio, Oracle Analytics Cloud, etc. These tools help users extract meaningful insights from complex datasets through data manipulation, filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregation, merging, and joining operations.

## OLAP Cube
OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing, which is a type of analytical processing used to retrieve and analyze multi-dimensional databases quickly and accurately. OLAP cubes enable users to perform complex calculations over massive volumes of data, enabling them to find patterns and trends within their data sets without being restricted by time constraints or space limitations. They also enable users to create reports and dashboards based on these calculated results. Commonly used OLAP cube technologies include IBM Cognos TM1, SAP BW/4HANA, Oracle Essbase, Microsoft Power BI Desktop, etc.

 ## ETL Process
The Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process involves ingesting data from multiple sources, applying transformations, and loading them into a target system for further analysis. During ETL, data is extracted from different systems, transformed into consistent format, and loaded into a centralized data repository. With the right ETL architecture, organizations can easily integrate disparate data sources, normalize inconsistent data structures, and eliminate duplicate records.

 ## Data Warehouse Architecture
A data warehouse architecture consists of separate physical or virtual servers hosting a relational database (RDBMS) storing enterprise data. The RDBMS stores structured and unstructured data from diverse sources, including transactional data from point-of-sale systems, CRM systems, e-commerce platforms, and other applications. The warehouse design must ensure high availability, scalability, security, and manageability to prevent data loss or corruption. 

Common data warehousing architectures include star schema, snowflake schema, and hybrid schema. Star schemas consist of a fact table and associated dimension tables that represent the dimensions of the data. Snowflake schemas consist of independent fact tables linked together via common dimension tables. Hybrid schemas combine both approaches to accommodate different needs depending on the size and complexity of the data.

## Basic Operations on Excel Sheets
### Sorting
In order to sort a worksheet in Excel, you simply need to select the cells containing the values you want to sort, click on the top header row where the arrows are located next to each column title, and then choose the sorting option you prefer. For example, if you wish to sort the rows in descending order based on a specific column, you would click on the down arrow corresponding to that column's header. Similarly, if you want to sort the rows in ascending order, you would choose the appropriate arrow.

### Filtering
To filter out certain data points from your dataset, you can apply filters on columns or rows. Filters can be applied automatically when you import data into Excel, or manually by selecting the drop-down menu on the top left corner of any column or row, and clicking on the "Filter" button. You can then specify what criteria should be included or excluded in the filtered view.

For example, let's say you want to display only the data points that belong to a specific category. To do so, you would add a filter below the relevant column header, and click on the dropdown arrow to access the filtering options. There, you would select the filter criteria and enter the value or range of values you want to filter. Once set, the data points outside the specified range will not be displayed on the sheet.

Similarly, you can add filters on rows instead of columns to get more detailed views of the data.

### Merging Cells
You can merge cells in Excel to group related data together. Simply select the cells you want to merge and either press Shift+Ctrl+Right Arrow to merge horizontally or Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow to merge vertically. Once merged, all selected cells will show the same content.

If you want to split a merged cell back into individual cells, you can double-click on the merged cell and drag it away until all desired subcells are separated again.

### Calculating Formulas
In Excel, formulas are powerful ways to manipulate data and automate repetitive tasks. Excel provides various functions and operators that can be combined into mathematical expressions and formatted as text strings. You can insert a formula anywhere you like by typing "=" followed by your expression, pressing Enter, and then dragging the cursor to position where you want the result to appear. Alternatively, you can highlight the desired cell or range of cells, and click on the Insert function button on the ribbon to insert the formula at the current selection.

Some examples of commonly used formulas include simple arithmetic calculations, conditional formatting, lookups, date/time operations, and arrays.

Formulas are especially important when working with large datasets, since they allow users to efficiently compute summary statistics, pivot tables, and aggregate data across different dimensions.

## Data Modeling
Data modeling is the process of creating logical models of real-world entities and relationships between them. It serves two primary purposes - to optimize data retrieval, consistency, and maintenance, and to simplify data analysis and reporting. Common data modelers include ERWin, Modelio, Visio, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and IBM Cognos TM1.

Here are some basic principles of data modeling:

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) shows the entities involved in a business activity and the relationships between them. Each entity is represented as a rectangle, labeled with its attributes and properties. The relationship between entities is shown with diamond-shaped lines, indicating the nature of the relationship (e.g., parent-child, composite).

Entity Relationship Diagrams are widely used in data modeling because they clearly define the entities and their relationships, allowing users to identify data dependencies, data integrity issues, and gaps in the data model.

### Dimensional Model
A dimensional model is a data model that separates business processes and aggregates data according to standardized dimensions, such as date, product, geography, and customer. A dimensional model defines a hierarchy of business objects organized along these dimensions, ensuring that data is stored in efficient and accurate formats.

Dimensional models are widely used in marketing, finance, retail, and healthcare industries, as well as scientific research, banking, insurance, and public sector organizations. The benefits of a dimensional model include improved efficiency, accuracy, maintainability, and interoperability.

### Attribute-Value Model
An attribute-value model represents entities as tuples of attribute-value pairs, similar to traditional databases. Attributes describe the characteristics of the entity, while values provide concrete details. The advantage of an attribute-value model is that it simplifies querying and improves data quality by providing a single source of truth for data discovery.

Attribute-value models are often used in data mining and knowledge discovery settings, where accurate data extraction is critical. Examples of companies that use attribute-value models include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Adobe, Netflix, and Google Search.

## Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of converting complex data sets into graphs, charts, or maps that visually convey trends, patterns, and relationships. Common data visualization tools include Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, QlikView, Google Charts, and Apple iTunes Connect.

Here are some basics of data visualization:

### Types of Graphs
There are three main types of graphs used for data visualization: bar graph, scatter plot, and line graph. Bar graphs are used to compare categories or quantitative variables, displaying the height of bars proportional to the variable value. Scatter plots are used to show the relationship between two continuous variables, typically plotted against each other. Line graphs are ideal for visualizing changes over time or sequences of events.

Each type of graph has its own strengths and weaknesses, but the choice depends on the context and purpose of the visualization. If there are multiple categorical variables to compare, a bar chart may be better suited than a scatter plot. On the other hand, if tracking the progression of a metric over time is crucial, a line graph may be more suitable.

### Pie Charts
Pie charts are another effective way to visualize categorical data. They depict relative sizes of segments within a whole. They are particularly helpful for comparing small percentages, such as those found in survey responses or marketing campaigns.

Pie charts should never be confused with pie slices, which are concentric rings surrounding a center point and indicate numerical values. Pie charts are also poor choices for showing precise counts or ratios, as they obscure the underlying distribution of data. Instead, consider using bar charts or donut charts for these scenarios.

### Maps
Maps are commonly used to visually represent spatial relationships between locations and measurements. By overlaying map layers onto a background, location data can be analyzed in real-time. Popular mapping tools include Google Maps, Leaflet, and D3.js.

Maps can be overwhelming and confusing, especially for large datasets or when zoomed out too far. Therefore, it's recommended to keep map scales relatively small or limit the number of locations being mapped. Other factors to consider include screen resolution, color blindness, and legibility.

Overall, data visualization offers powerful ways to communicate complex data with non-technical stakeholders, allowing them to gain insights and take action. However, it requires careful planning and attention to detail, and careful consideration of the intended audience.
