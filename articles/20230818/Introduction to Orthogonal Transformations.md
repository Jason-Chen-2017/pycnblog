Orthogonal transformations are a type of linear transformation that do not change the direction of a vector or point while changing its length and shape under some constraints. 

The main purpose of orthogonal transformations is to transform one coordinate system into another so that two-dimensional data can be easily plotted on top of each other in different ways without any distortion. This results in enhanced visualization capabilities for complex datasets. The most commonly used orthogonal transformations include rotation, scaling, shearing, and projections. However, there are several other types of orthogonal transformations like reflection, skewing, and deformation which are also useful when working with complex data.

In this article we will cover the basics of orthogonal transformations and discuss their applications in various fields such as computer graphics, image processing, machine learning, and signal processing. We will explain how to apply these transformations using popular libraries such as OpenCV, scikit-image, and NumPy. Moreover, we will explore additional topics related to orthogonal transformations such as pseudoinverses, generalized eigenvector problems, and Nyström approximation algorithms. Finally, we will conclude with an overview of future directions for research in orthogonal transformations and potential use cases.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the details of orthogonal transformations let's first understand some basic concepts and terminology.

## Coordinate Systems
A coordinate system is a set of axes and origin points at the center of reference. In a cartesian system, the x-axis runs from left to right, the y-axis runs from bottom to top, and the z-axis runs vertically through the plane formed by the three axis. A polar system represents angles instead of lengths along the Cartesian axes and uses an imaginary circle centered at the origin where the angle is measured from the positive x-axis towards the positive y-axis. 

## Vectors and Points
Vectors and points in Euclidean space are both treated as geometric entities that have magnitude (length) and direction. In 2D and 3D spaces, vectors are usually represented as arrows or lines connecting a starting point to an end point. Points can be represented using circles or squares in 2D and cubes in 3D. Common operations performed on vectors include addition, subtraction, multiplication, dot product, cross product, and normalization. Similarly, common operations performed on points include translation, rotation, scaling, and projection.

## Matrix Operations
Matrices are mathematical constructs used to represent linear transformations between different dimensions. They consist of elements arranged in rows and columns and allow us to perform arithmetic operations between them. Multiplying a matrix and a column vector gives the result of applying the linear transformation to all elements in the vector. There are many standard operations performed on matrices including transposition, determinant calculation, inverse calculation, eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition, SVD factorization, etc.

## Rotation
Rotation is the process of rotating an object around a specific axis by a specified angle. It creates a new vector orthogonal to the original vector but maintains its length. The formula for performing rotation using the rotation matrix $R$ is:

$$\begin{bmatrix}x' \\ y'\end{bmatrix}= R \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y\end{bmatrix}$$

where $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$ is the input vector and $(x', y')$ is the output rotated vector. The formulas for calculating the rotation matrix depend on the dimensionality of the problem, i.e., 2D or 3D rotation. For example, the following expressions give the rotation matrix for 2D rotation in counterclockwise direction:

$$R=\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\theta)&-\sin(\theta)\\\sin(\theta)&\cos(\theta)\end{pmatrix},\;\;\;where,\;\;\; -\pi<\theta<\pi$$

Similarly, the following expression gives the rotation matrix for 3D rotation about the X, Y, and Z axes respectively:

$$R_x = \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&\cos(x)&-\sin(x)\\0&\sin(x)&\cos(x)\end{pmatrix};\;\;R_y = \begin{pmatrix}\cos(y)&0&\sin(y)\\0&1&0\\-\sin(y)&0&\cos(y)\end{pmatrix};\;\;R_z = \begin{pmatrix}\cos(z)&-\sin(z)&0\\\sin(z)&\cos(z)&0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}$$

Note that it may not always be possible to find a unique solution to the equation for finding the inverse rotation matrix. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate solver depending on the properties of the problem. One widely used approach for solving these equations numerically is the singular value decomposition (SVD). 

Here is an implementation of the above rotation algorithm using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

def rotate(img, angle):
    # convert image to grayscale if necessary
    if len(img.shape) > 2:
        img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    height, width = img.shape[:2]
    cx, cy = width // 2, height // 2

    M = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((cx, cy), angle, 1.0)
    rotated = cv2.warpAffine(img, M, (width, height))
    
    return rotated
```

This function takes an image `img` and applies a counterclockwise rotation of `angle` degrees to it using the built-in `cv2.getRotationMatrix2D()` function from OpenCV library. The resulting rotated image is obtained by calling the `cv2.warpAffine()` function passing in the calculated rotation matrix and the size of the original image. Note that since images typically come in RGB format, they need to be converted to grayscale before applying the rotation. If you don't want to deal with color information, you can remove the `cv2.cvtColor()` call inside the function body.
