## 1.1 Deep Learning简介
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach for solving complex problems in many applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, autonomous driving, and recommendation systems. 

In this article, we will cover basic principles of deep learning using TensorFlow, an open-source software library used for building machine learning models. We assume readers have some familiarity with deep learning concepts and terminology. If you need a refresher, please consult online resources or use Google search.


## 1.2 Prerequisites
This article assumes the reader knows:

* Basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus.
* Familiarity with machine learning terms such as training set, hypothesis function, cost function, gradient descent algorithm, and error metric.
* Knowledge of Python programming.

If any of these assumptions are not met, it may be useful to review previous articles or other sources before proceeding with this one. Additionally, if you are familiar with PyTorch instead of TensorFlow, feel free to substitute relevant sections with PyTorch equivalents.

# 2. Core Concepts and Terminology
We can think about deep learning algorithms at different levels of abstraction. At the highest level, they involve deep neural networks, which consist of multiple hidden layers connected by non-linear activation functions like ReLU or sigmoid. Each layer learns features of the input data that contribute towards making accurate predictions on new inputs. 

At the next lower level, we have convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which apply filters over the input data to extract specific features from images. These features can then be fed into fully connected layers for classification or regression tasks.

The lowest level is recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which process sequences of data such as text or audio. They often incorporate long-term dependencies between elements in the sequence, making them particularly effective at modeling sequential data.

To train our models effectively, we typically split our dataset into three parts:

* Training set - This consists of a portion of the overall dataset used to adjust the model parameters during training.
* Validation set - This consists of another portion of the dataset used to evaluate how well the model is performing while training.
* Test set - The final part of the dataset reserved for testing the trained model's performance on unseen data.

These sets should be randomly drawn from the original dataset, ensuring that each example is equally represented in both the training and validation sets. During training, the model’s ability to generalize to new examples is measured against the validation set. Once the model achieves satisfactory performance on the validation set, it is tested on the test set to measure its true accuracy.

During training, the goal is to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual value. There are various types of loss functions, including mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks and cross entropy loss for classification tasks. By iteratively updating the weights of the network using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the model minimizes the loss function and improves its ability to predict on new inputs.

There are also several techniques commonly used to prevent overfitting: regularization methods such as L1/L2 regularization and dropout, early stopping based on a validation set, and data augmentation to increase the size of the training set without actually adding more data. Finally, hyperparameter tuning helps improve the performance of the model by selecting optimal values for certain parameters such as the number of layers, neurons per layer, and learning rate. 

# 3. Implementation Example: Logistic Regression
Before diving deeper into the details of deep learning algorithms, let's consider a simple implementation of logistic regression using TensorFlow. Here's what we'll do step by step:

1. Import necessary libraries
2. Load and preprocess the data
3. Define the model architecture
4. Train the model on the training data
5. Evaluate the model on the test data
