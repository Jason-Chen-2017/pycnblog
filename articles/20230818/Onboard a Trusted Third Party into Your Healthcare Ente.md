Healthcare industry is growing rapidly with the help of AI and other technologies. As more companies move towards digital transformation, they need to be mindful about security vulnerabilities as well. However, it is becoming increasingly challenging for healthcare organizations to maintain compliance in real-time across all systems, devices, networks, and interfaces. The best way to achieve this goal is by onboarding a trusted third party (TTP) into their enterprise ecosystem. TTPs can provide specialized expertise such as cybersecurity professionals, information technology specialists, or regulatory compliance experts who will ensure that the organization stays compliant with relevant laws and policies throughout its lifecycle. This article provides an overview of TTP services offered by major vendors such as McAfee, IBM X-Force, and Symantec to address these concerns while also helping you make informed decisions when selecting your TTP vendor.
# 2.基本概念术语
Trusted Third Party: A trusted third party (TTP) refers to any external entity that plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of data. They may include system administrators, network engineers, or contractors involved in supporting critical applications within an organization’s environment. To increase security and compliance, organizations often hire TTPs to oversee all aspects of IT operations, including endpoint protection, intrusion detection/prevention, application hardening, log management, and vulnerability scanning. Many different types of TTPs exist, each providing different roles and skills based on the size, type, and complexity of an organization’s needs.
Vulnerability Management Platform: A VMP (vulnerability management platform) is an essential component of TTPs that helps them continuously monitor for and respond to newly discovered threats, both internal and external. These platforms are designed to identify, prioritize, track, remediate, and report vulnerabilities to stakeholders at appropriate times. VMPs typically integrate various threat intelligence sources, allow for automation of response actions, and support monitoring and analysis of multiple environments, from laptops to servers to mobile phones. Some examples of popular VMP solutions include Nessus, Sophos Central, Qualys, and Tenable.
Centralized Identity and Access Management (CIAM): CIAM software allows for centralization and control over user access across all systems and applications used by an organization. It ensures secure authentication procedures, authorizes users, controls access levels, manages credentials, and keeps logs of all activities performed by authorized personnel. Examples of commonly used CIAM tools include Okta, Microsoft Azure Active Directory, OneLogin, and CyberArk.
Access Control Lists (ACLs): An ACL defines which users have access to specific resources, folders, files, etc., depending on their assigned permissions. When using TTPs, organizations should carefully consider how to design and implement ACLs so that only necessary employees or systems have access to sensitive data.
Threat Intelligence Platform: A threat intelligence platform aggregates and analyzes large volumes of data, such as email traffic, IoT sensor readings, social media activity, DNS queries, and WHOIS records, to detect and analyze patterns that can indicate potential threats or attacks against an organization’s infrastructure. Threat Intel platforms help organizations detect breaches, malicious insider activities, and suspicious network behavior. Popular TI platforms include AbuseIPDB, Cisco AMP for Endpoints, Malware Domain List, PhishTank, ShadowServer, and TwitterSniper.
SOC Monitoring Solution: A SOC (security operations center) monitoring solution combines data collected from different sources, including endpoints, network traffic, cloud logs, and log aggregators, to identify possible risks and anomalies that could pose a significant risk to an organization's assets and operations. This can involve collecting, analyzing, correlating, and visualizing diverse sets of data in real-time, identifying trends and patterns, and responding to emerging issues quickly and effectively. Examples of common SOC monitoring tools include Splunk, Sumo Logic, Graylog, and QRadar.
Endpoint Protection Software: Endpoint protection software scans the operating system and applications running on end-user devices, detects malware, exploits, viruses, and worms, and blocks them before they enter the device’s memory. This approach helps prevent unauthorized access, protect against ransomware, and reduces the likelihood of data loss or damage due to viruses and other security threats. Common examples of endpoint protection software include Windows Defender, Avast, ESET NOD32, McAfee Web Gateway, and SentinelOne.
Log Management Solutions: Log management solutions collect and store server and network events in real time, making them available for analysis through search tools or dashboards. They can be used to detect attacks, intrusions, compromised accounts, and security misconfigurations. Some popular log management solutions include Graylog, Elasticsearch + Kibana, RockNSM, and Loggly.
Incident Response Plan: Incident response plans detail what steps should be taken to recover from a breach, compromise, or cyberattack. They cover preparations, coordination, execution, reporting, recovery, and post-incident review. Organizations should create an incident response plan that includes the following key components: actionable tasks, escalation processes, notification channels, and training materials.

Onboarding a Trusted Third Party into Your Healthcare Enterprise to Increase Security and Compliance requires several core algorithms and techniques. Here are some high-level steps you can follow:

1. Choose a Vendor: Research the top three TTP vendors based on their experience in the field and capabilities, along with their prices and ratings. Select the one most suitable for your organization and budget. Then complete a detailed evaluation of the TTP service offered by the selected vendor.

2. Integrate TTP Services: Once you select a TTP vendor, integrate their respective products into your existing operational tools, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and log management tools. Ensure that these tools work seamlessly together to provide a comprehensive view of security events across all devices, networks, and applications.

3. Design a Compliance Strategy: Determine your organization’s strategy for maintaining compliance with applicable law and policy requirements. This might involve reviewing new regulations, evaluating new industry standards, and developing policies and procedures for ongoing enforcement. Make sure to establish clear guidelines for accessing and sharing security reports and alerts generated by the TTP services.

4. Train TTP Team: Recruit, train, and equip the TTP team according to their required skill set, including technical knowledge, cybersecurity expertise, and legal education. Also, ensure that the team follows established protocols for conducting regular assessments, performance reviews, and salary adjustments. Set up regular check-ins and communication between security officers and staff to discuss current status and progress.

5. Implement Continuous Monitoring: Keep a close eye on all security events, especially those related to your business operations and data. Continuously update your monitoring tools, configure alert thresholds, and leverage additional tools like log correlation and forensics to help identify the root cause of any identified threats.

6. Identify Potential Points of Failure: Conduct a thorough inventory of all systems, devices, networks, and applications used by your organization. Look for areas where potential points of failure, such as weak passwords, outdated antivirus software, or open ports, may present a risk to your company’s security. Proactively patch these vulnerabilities to reduce risk and improve overall security.
# 4.具体代码实例和解释说明
Here's an example code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to interact with various parts of the TTP services offered by Symantec:

```python
import requests
from xml.etree import ElementTree

API_KEY = "your_api_key" # Replace with actual API key provided by TTP vendor
THREAT_ID = "threat_id" # Replace with ID of desired threat

def get_report(threat_id):
    url = f"https://webgateway.symantec.com/SymantecWebGateway/WSGateway?api=ReportingService&service=getThreatReport&apiKey={API_KEY}&format=XML&threatId={threat_id}"
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/xml',
        }
    response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code!= 200:
        raise Exception(f"Request failed: {response.text}")

    return ElementTree.fromstring(response.content)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    tree = get_report(THREAT_ID)
    print(ElementTree.tostring(tree))
```

In this example code, we use the `requests` library to send HTTP GET requests to the Symantec Web Gateway to retrieve a threat report given a specified `threat_id`. We then parse the XML content returned by the gateway using the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module. Finally, we output the resulting XML element tree as a string. 

You can modify this code to suit your own needs by changing the values of the `API_KEY`, `THREAT_ID`, and request URL parameters. Note that the exact syntax may vary depending on the programming language and web framework being used.
