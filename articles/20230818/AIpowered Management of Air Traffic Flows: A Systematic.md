Air traffic management (ATM) is a crucial component in modern air transportation systems. It is essential to ensure the safety and efficiency of flight operations as well as economic development of countries around the world. However, manual operation of ATM structures can be time-consuming and error-prone, making it difficult for even experienced pilots to operate effectively. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have recently become increasingly popular in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. With the advent of these ML algorithms, ATM management has been transformed from a mere descriptive role into an automated process that predicts passenger flow based on past behavior patterns and other factors using mathematical models or statistical analysis techniques. This article reviews recent advances in AI-based ATM management technology over the last few years, identifies current challenges, provides guidance for researchers to advance this technology further, and outlines future directions for development.

Air traffic management (ATM) refers to the planning, control, and coordination of all activities related to the movement of people and cargo throughout an airspace. The overall objective of ATM is to provide safe, efficient, and comfortable flights by managing arrival, departure, layout, routing, and fuel consumption at every level of the airspace. In addition, effective and efficient ATM systems enhance economic growth and revenue generation by optimizing fleet allocation and schedule optimization, respectively.

However, traditional methods of ATM operation are limited due to their human intervention and subjectivity. These limitations can result in suboptimal performance, increased operational costs, and potential crashes during emergencies. To address these issues, advanced technologies like machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have emerged as promising solutions. With the proliferation of these technologies, ATM management has seen significant advances in terms of automation, accuracy, speed, and robustness compared with traditional methods.

In particular, the use of DRL algorithms in ATM management has allowed for the automated prediction of passenger demand within a given period of time based on historical data and environmental conditions. Additionally, several applications of AI/ML in ATM include image recognition for security monitoring, natural language processing for route planning, and recommendation systems for travel agency marketing. Finally, cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) have enabled scalability and elasticity in ATM management while enabling cost-effective maintenance and updates.

This review paper discusses the state-of-the-art AI-based ATM management approaches across various disciplines including mathematics, computer science, and engineering. We also highlight the latest trends and technologies that have made significant progress towards improving the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of ATM management. Next, we provide recommendations for future research efforts that aim to develop new and improved technologies to improve ATM operation through automation. Finally, we outline open research problems and opportunities that need further exploration and development to unlock the full potential of AI in ATM management.

The following sections present a general overview of the state-of-the-art research in different areas relevant to ATM management using AI. Some of the most recent contributions in this area are discussed below:

1. Mathematical Models: Traditional mathematical models for ATM management have not fully taken advantage of the power of modern ML algorithms. For example, linear programming techniques were used in the early days of ATM management but quickly became outdated and impractical for real-world scenarios. Other models, such as Markov chain and hidden markov model, focused more on agent behavior than modeling the complex interaction between multiple agents. Recently, neural networks have shown promise in modelling the dynamic nature of ATM system. Although they still rely heavily on handcrafted features, they offer considerable flexibility and adaptability to handle highly variable input distributions. 

2. Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: Reinforcement learning algorithms have gained popularity in ATM management due to its ability to learn complex interactions between multiple agents in the airspace and optimize policies accordingly. Several RL algorithms have been developed to solve tasks related to optimal scheduling, resource allocation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Examples of these algorithms include Q-learning, actor-critic, and deep reinforcement learning. Despite their success in certain domains, these algorithms require careful design and hyperparameter tuning before being applied to new environments and problem settings. 

3. Systems Engineering Techniques: Integration of ATM management with system engineering techniques, such as cascading failure theory and Hierarchical power control, could help reduce risk and increase resilience of the entire system. In some cases, forecasting load profiles using computational weather models and developing robust optimization strategies based on reliability and downtime constraints could significantly improve ATM system performance. Alternatively, autonomous vehicles and autonomy management software could integrate seamlessly into ATM management platforms to enable continuous improvements in both perception and control. 

4. Operations Research Methods: Various optimization techniques have been employed in ATM management. Some examples include portfolio selection and ant colony optimization, which are often used to balance operational objectives without compromising service levels. Similarly, mixed integer programming (MIP) can be used to formulate complex optimization problems where several decision variables must meet specific constraints simultaneously. Moreover, simulation studies and field tests can provide valuable insights into how ATM management algorithms work and identify shortcomings and bottlenecks.

To date, there has been a tremendous amount of research in ATM management using AI. However, existing works fall into three main categories:

1. Modeling: Most of the AI-based ATM management models focus on applying standard optimization techniques like linear programming or convex optimization to predict passenger demand based on historical data and assumptions. But these models typically rely heavily on intuitive heuristics or simplified assumptions that may not always hold true in reality. Therefore, more sophisticated techniques such as deep neural networks or support vector machines should be explored to obtain better predictions. On the other hand, hybrid methods combining deep learning with classical optimization techniques can potentially improve the accuracy and precision of predicted demand. 

2. Planning: In order to minimize the impact of unexpected changes in demand, planners need to take into account factors such as delays, cancellations, and corrections, among others. One possible solution is to combine reinforcement learning with simulation-based optimization techniques. This approach uses reinforcement learning to suggest plans that maximize expected rewards and incorporates uncertainty information obtained from simulations. Furthermore, probabilistic models and Bayesian optimization techniques can be used to estimate the probability distribution of delay and cancellation risks. 

3. Control: ATM controls usually consist of multiple components, such as gate opening times, center console displays, and lightning strikes, that interact directly with the passengers. To automate these functions, advanced techniques like supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep neural networks can be combined with rule-based controllers. By fine-tuning controller parameters, feedback loops can be established between the decision-maker and the controlled system to achieve desired outcomes. 

Overall, this article outlines the latest research advances in ATM management using AI. Future research efforts should focus on addressing the following key challenges:
1. Real-time Awareness: Developing real-time analytics tools and algorithms that can adaptively adjust the ATM strategy based on the changing passenger demand is critical to maintain high service quality and prevent delays and cancellations. 
2. Scalability and Efficiency: Scaling up ATM management algorithms requires large amounts of real-time data processing capacity, large scale distributed computing clusters, and optimized algorithm design.  
3. Resource Allocation Challenges: While many ATM management models have addressed centralized resource allocation, challenging situations exist when resources are shared between diverse users or services. AI/ML-based algorithms can leverage social network analysis to allocate resources more efficiently and effectively. 

Finally, considering the diversity of ATM management domains, AI-based ATM management will continue to evolve and benefit from integration with numerous application domains such as transportation, energy, healthcare, finance, and security.
