Keyphrase extraction is a challenging task in natural language processing, which aims to identify important keywords or phrases within a document. It plays an essential role for many text-based applications such as search engines, question answering systems, summarization, and knowledge graph construction. In this article, we will discuss the automatic keyphrase extraction method using deep learning techniques with topic modeling technique to extract meaningful phrases from documents. We will start by understanding the basic concepts of keyphrase extraction and its various approaches before moving towards our proposed approach. The core idea behind our approach is that it exploits the ability of neural networks to automatically learn patterns from unstructured data and generates high quality results. Finally, we present some code examples demonstrating how to use these techniques on real-world datasets. Our work has led to significant advancements in keyphrase extraction tasks and open up new opportunities for researchers and developers to build more powerful tools for advanced NLP tasks.

## 2.1 Keyphrase Extraction
Keyphrase extraction is a subtask of Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the goal is to extract relevant terms or phrases from a given document. These extracted phrases can be used for several purposes such as keyword indexing, information retrieval, entity disambiguation, sentiment analysis, and content representation. There are different methods available for keyphrase extraction like rule-based models, machine learning algorithms, and statistical techniques. However, most of these methods rely heavily on handcrafted features or rules, making them less accurate compared to automated approaches based on machine learning and deep learning techniques. 

The main objective of keyphrase extraction is to generate a list of keywords or phrases that represent the main ideas conveyed in the input document while ignoring irrelevant details or noises. The output of keyphrase extraction system should be a set of keywords or phrases, each representing one concept or idea that the reader might need to understand the document's message. Some commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of keyphrase extraction techniques include precision, recall, F1 score, and average precision. Precision refers to the percentage of relevant keyphrases identified correctly, whereas recall represents the percentage of all potentially relevant keyphrases that were captured. F1 score combines both precision and recall into one metric and calculates the harmonic mean of both scores. Average precision considers the ranking of the retrieved keyphrases along with their relevance labels and computes the area under the curve of the precision versus rank plot.

There are two types of keyphrase extraction: single-document and multi-document. Single-document keyphrase extraction focuses only on extracting keywords or phrases from one document at a time, while multi-document keyphrase extraction involves extracting keyphrases across multiple documents belonging to the same domain or subject. For example, in scientific papers, articles, and patents, authors usually provide a small paragraph or section describing the work done, and they also try to highlight what was accomplished during the study. Multi-document keyphrase extraction allows us to find keyphrases that appear in similar contexts in multiple documents, enabling better understanding of the overall problem space and creating more comprehensive summary.

## 2.2 Word Embeddings
Word embeddings are a type of word representation that converts words into vectors of real numbers that capture semantic relationships between words. They have been shown to improve the accuracy of many natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation. One common way to create word embeddings is through pre-trained models such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. Pre-trained word embeddings are typically trained on large corpora of texts and contain semantic relationships learned from those corpora. Word embedding models learn vector representations for words that capture syntactic and semantic relationships between words. By mapping related words closer together in vector space, word embeddings help capture contextual information about the meaning of words, thereby improving the performance of downstream NLP tasks.

In keyphrase extraction, word embeddings can be useful because they can encode the semantics and syntax of individual sentences in a document into a dense vector representation, which can then be processed by deep learning models to generate better results. Specifically, we can treat the collection of sentence embeddings obtained from pre-trained word embeddings as inputs to a neural network model that learns to extract valuable insights from the document. This notion is illustrated below:


## 2.3 Topic Modeling
Topic modeling is a statistical method that identifies topics in a corpus of documents based on the words co-occurring in them. Topics can be defined as groups of related words that occur frequently together in the corpus. Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) are popular choices for topic modeling. LDA is known for its interpretability and ability to handle large document collections effectively, but other models show promise as well. 

We propose to use a combination of deep learning and topic modeling to extract keyphrases from a document. We assume that each sentence in the document belongs to a certain topic according to the latent variables inferred by the topic modeling algorithm. Based on the probability distribution over the latent variables, we select the top n most probable sentence embeddings to form the final keyphrase candidates. To achieve this, we first train a neural network to predict the latent variables for each sentence in the document. Then, we apply the selected sentence embeddings to a bag-of-word style classifier that assigns each candidate keyphrase to a predefined category or label based on its similarity to the sentence embeddings. This enables us to prioritize keyphrases that are likely to contribute significantly to the overall understanding of the document's contents.

To further refine the keyphrase selection process, we incorporate a heuristic thresholding step that removes keyphrases with low confidence scores predicted by the classifier. This improves the quality of the generated keyphrases since we avoid selecting noise from the document. Additionally, we can augment the dataset by applying existing techniques such as backtranslation, synonym replacement, and paraphrasing to increase the diversity and coverage of the training data.

Overall, the use of deep learning and topic modeling techniques provides a promising alternative to traditional rule-based and statistical methods for keyphrase extraction.
