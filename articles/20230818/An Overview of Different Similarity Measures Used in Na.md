Natural language processing is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves analyzing and understanding human language for various applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, information retrieval, etc. There are many similarity measures used to compare two strings or texts in NLP domain, such as Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Similarity, Levenshtein Distance, Euclidean distance, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Spearman Rank-order Correlation, Kendall’s Tau-B Correlation, Manhattan Distance, Minkowski Distance, and so on. In this article, we will briefly introduce these similarity measures and discuss their mathematical formulas along with some code examples. Then we will evaluate the performance of each measure using common datasets available in literature. Finally, we will conclude by discussing future research directions for improving NLP applications based on these similarity measures. 

Similarity measures play an essential role in natural language processing where it helps to identify similarities between different documents or sentences or paragraphs. These measures can be categorized into three main groups:

1. Structural Similarity Measures: This group includes metrics like Levenshtein distance, Jaccard coefficient, and Cosine similarity which use only structure or syntax of text instead of semantic meaning. 

2. Vector Space Model Based Measures: These include methods such as Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman rank order correlation, Kendall's tau-b correlation, and cosine similarity which use vectors representing words or phrases in terms of their syntactic and semantic similarity rather than their positioning in text.

3. Probabilistic Approaches: The probabilistic approaches involve calculating probability distributions over sequences of words and comparing them to get similarity scores. These methods have been applied in tasks such as predicting whether two articles share the same topic or sentiment and detecting plagiarism. 

In this article, we will focus our attention towards vector space model based measures since they capture both syntactic and semantic relationships between words. We will start by introducing the basics of vector spaces and then proceed to discuss several similarity measures that belong to the second category. We will end up evaluating the effectiveness of these measures on real world datasets and present some potential improvements required for further advancements in NLP domains. Let's dive deep into it!
# 2.Vector Spaces
A vector space V(D) is a set of objects called elements or points together with a corresponding vector space metric that defines how to measure distances between those objects. A basis for the vector space is chosen from its subspaces, which are usually called subspaces of high dimensionality. The associated vector space metric is a function mapping pairs of elements to scalar values indicating their “distance” according to the space. The most commonly used bases are the standard basis of unit vectors and Gram matrix derived from co-occurrence counts or word embeddings.

Here is one way to understand the concept of vector space: Imagine you have three points - A, B, C. You could represent these points in a 2-dimensional plane by drawing lines connecting them. Each line would correspond to a unit vector parallel to one side of the plane. For example, if point A has a unit vector direction of [1, 1] and point B has a unit vector direction of [-1, -1], then the third point C must lie exactly halfway between A and B on the line perpendicular to AB. Therefore, the distance between any two points in a 2-dimensional plane would be defined by measuring the length of the segment joining them. If we were to generalize this idea to higher dimensions, we would need more basis vectors. However, by choosing suitable basis vectors, we could define a new coordinate system with units of measurement that better reflects the geometry of the data.

Therefore, given a sequence of n elements x = {x1, x2,...,xn} represented as column vectors in Rn, we want to find a linear combination w = wx1 + wy2 +... + wnxn that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the actual values yi and the predicted value wi*xi. One way to do this is to minimize the Frobenius norm ||y-Xw||^2, where X is the design matrix containing all possible combinations of the base vectors multiplied by weights alpha. This problem is known as ridge regression. By solving this equation, we obtain the optimal weights for regressing xi onto xi*. The resulting vector w maximizes the variance among the projections of xi* onto xi. 

We now turn to the case of natural language processing where there may not be a fixed number of features but rather a variable number of tokens or types in the input corpus. In this case, we can represent the document as a bag of words representation consisting of unique tuples (wi, ti), where wi is the weight assigned to token i, and ti represents the type of token i. To avoid redundancy, we can also normalize the weights to account for term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Thus, we can write the document representation as D = {(wi,ti)}_{i=1}^{|V|} where |V| is the vocabulary size, V = {v1, v2,..., vn}. We can learn a vector space V(D) using techniques such as principal component analysis or singular value decomposition (SVD). Once learned, we can project any query document q = {qi} into the same vector space using the same transformation matrix and compute the similarity score between q and other documents. As mentioned earlier, the choice of basis vectors plays an important role in defining the metric used for computing similarity scores. Therefore, we should select the right basis vectors carefully depending on the nature of the task at hand.
