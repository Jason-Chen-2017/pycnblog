Data augmentation is a technique in which we generate new training samples from the existing dataset to increase the size of the training set and improve the performance of machine learning models. It helps reduce overfitting by creating additional data that mimics real-world scenarios while keeping the original dataset intact. In this blog post, I will be discussing various techniques used in data augmentation for deep neural networks (DNNs), including image classification tasks. This includes methods such as rotation, flipping, scaling, shifting, blurring, cropping, adding noise, etc., along with their mathematical formulas and code implementation using Python libraries like Keras, TensorFlow, or OpenCV. With these techniques, we can create more robust DNNs and significantly improve model accuracy on complex datasets.

In this blog post, we will discuss some basic concepts involved in data augmentation techniques and then proceed towards implementing them using Python libraries like Keras and TensorFlow. We will also talk about different use cases where data augmentation can be helpful and explore its potential benefits. Finally, we will conclude our discussion by summarizing key points and identifying future directions for research in this area.

Before starting writing the technical content of the article, let’s first understand what exactly is data augmentation?
# What Is Data Augmentation?
Data augmentation is an artificial intelligence technique that involves generating multiple versions of input data by applying transformations to it to simulate variations in the underlying distribution of the data. These transformed images are added to the original dataset during training to ensure that the network has enough variety to learn from. 

For example, if a CNN is trained on MNIST dataset, each image in the dataset contains varying pixel values due to the difference between black and white pixels. Therefore, data augmentation techniques help us transform the raw image into many slightly modified forms, effectively increasing the number of images present in the dataset. By doing so, we can avoid overfitting by providing the network with sufficient amount of varied inputs. The same concept applies to other types of data such as audio recordings, text data, and videos.


Overall, data augmentation helps train ML models more accurately, reduces overfitting, and promotes generalization capabilities of the models across different domains and conditions. However, it should not be confused with regularization techniques which tend to penalize large weights instead of introducing noisy patterns into the dataset.

Now, let's dive deeper into the technical details of data augmentation techniques for DNNs applied to image classification tasks. Let’s start with defining some common terms that may be confusing:

## Types Of Data Augmentation Methods

The following are the categories of data augmentation techniques:

1. Rotation
2. Flipping
3. Scaling
4. Shifting
5. Blurring
6. Cropping
7. Adding Noise
8. Color jittering 
9. Geometric transformation

Each method has different characteristics and applications depending on the context. For instance, rotation and shift have been shown to be particularly effective for object detection and segmentation tasks respectively. Similarly, flipping, scaling, color jittering, geometric transformation, and adding noise can all add variance to the input images without changing the actual objects being detected.

## How To Implement Data Augmentation Techniques?

Implementing data augmentation techniques requires considerable effort and expertise in handling complex computer vision tasks like convolutional neural networks. Luckily, there are several python libraries available that make it easier for developers to implement these techniques. Some of the commonly used libraries include Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. Here's how you can get started with implementing data augmentation techniques for your image classification task using Keras library. 

First, import necessary libraries and load the training data. You'll need to split the data into training and validation sets before performing any data augmentation operations. Then apply the desired data augmentation techniques to the training set and store the augmented images in a separate directory. Once this process is complete, you can train your CNN on both the original and augmented data simultaneously.

Here's an example code snippet that shows how to perform data augmentation using Keras library:


```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
        rescale=1./255, # Rescale pixel values to [0,1] range
        shear_range=0.2, # Shear angle factor
        zoom_range=0.2, # Zoom range factor
        horizontal_flip=True, # Horizontal flip option
        vertical_flip=False) # Vertical flip option
        
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

training_set = train_datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/training',
                                            target_size=(img_rows, img_cols),
                                            batch_size=batch_size,
                                            class_mode='categorical')

validation_set = test_datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/validation',
                                                target_size=(img_rows, img_cols),
                                                batch_size=batch_size,
                                                class_mode='categorical')

model.fit_generator(
        training_set,
        steps_per_epoch=len(training_set),
        epochs=epochs,
        validation_data=validation_set,
        validation_steps=len(validation_set))
```

Note that in the above code snippet, we have imported `ImageDataGenerator` class from Keras' preprocessing module. We've initialized two instances of this class - one for training data augmentation and another for testing / validation data augmentation. Both classes provide various options like brightness adjustment, contrast change, saturation change, hue change, and rotating the image randomly within certain degrees. Additionally, we've specified the parameters such as `target_size`, `batch_size`, and `class_mode`. Finally, we've called the fit function of the model instance which takes two generators - one for training and the other for validation data. The generator produces batches of augmented data and feeds them to the model for training and validation purposes.
