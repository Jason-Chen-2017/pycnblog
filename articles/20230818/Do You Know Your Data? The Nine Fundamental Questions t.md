Data preparation is the most important step in data analysis and modeling. Without a clear understanding of your data and how it should be used, you may not achieve accurate results or even mislead your model into false conclusions. As a result, it’s essential that every analyst understands their responsibilities as an AI expert by answering these nine fundamental questions: 

1. What is my dataset about? 
2. How do I want to use this information? 
3. Is there anything missing from the dataset? 
4. Can I interpret any parts of the dataset using machine learning algorithms? 
5. Does the dataset have any errors or inconsistencies? 
6. Should I transform or filter out certain columns or rows? 
7. How can I ensure that all data points are relevant to the problem at hand? 
8. What preprocessing techniques need to be applied before training models? 
9. How can I split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets? 

By knowing these answers, an AI expert will be able to prepare their datasets more efficiently and accurately, leading to higher accuracy and effectiveness in analyzing and solving problems. In this article, we will go over each question and provide resources on additional reading to further explore them. We hope this provides a solid foundation for anyone looking to become a better data analyst. 

# 2.Background Introduction
As mentioned earlier, data preparation is crucial in data analytics. It involves several steps such as identifying the purpose and intended uses of the data, checking for any missing values, handling inconsistent data, cleaning unnecessary noise, and optimizing data quality for downstream processing tasks such as machine learning. However, many experts believe that preparing data correctly can sometimes be daunting, especially if they lack the necessary skills or knowledge. This has led to a trend among data scientists to adopt “data science assistants” who specialize in automating some aspects of data preparation, but despite their importance, few actually have complete knowledge of what goes into data preparation or how to approach it. Furthermore, it’s not always easy to get direct feedback from real-world stakeholders when preparing data, making it challenging to verify whether the process is being done accurately or efficiently. 

In response to this challenge, we propose tackling two main goals:

1. Educate readers on core concepts, algorithms, and practical considerations related to data preparation. 

2. Provide resources and guidance on how to apply established best practices for effective data preparation while avoiding common pitfalls and challenges faced by data professionals.

To accomplish these goals, our article will cover:

- An overview of basic data types including numerical, categorical, ordinal, textual, temporal, spatial, and mixed data types.

- A brief introduction to statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, correlation, covariance, and regression analysis.

- Methods for dealing with missing values, including imputation methods such as filling with mean/mode, interpolation, deletion, and grouping.

- Techniques for encoding categorical variables such as one hot encoding, label encoding, hashing, and target encoding.

- Methods for scaling continuous features such as min-max normalization, standardization, robust scaling, and quantile transformation.

- Methods for reducing dimensionality through feature selection methods such as correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), recursive feature elimination (RFE), and feature importance ranking.

- Recommendations on how to handle imbalanced classes during classification tasks, such as weighting samples, resampling methods like oversampling and undersampling, and class weights adjustment.

- Guidance on how to partition a dataset into training, validation, and testing sets and evaluate their performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, confusion matrix, and area under the curve (AUC).
