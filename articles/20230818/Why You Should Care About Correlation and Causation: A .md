## 1.What is correlation?
In statistics, correlation refers to any statistical relationship between two variables. It measures how the values of one variable are changing in relation to those of another variable. The greater the absolute value of correlation coefficient, the stronger the linear relationship between the variables, indicating a positive or negative trend. Positive correlation indicates that as X increases, so does Y. Negative correlation indicates that as X increases, Y decreases. Zero correlation indicates no linear relationship between the variables.

For instance, if we measure the heights of individuals and their income levels, then there may be a positive correlation because taller people tend to earn more. If on the other hand, we measure the number of hours studied per week and grades obtained on an exam, then we would have a zero or negative correlation because students who study for longer do not necessarily get better grades. In summary, correlation can be thought of as a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.

## 2.What is causality?
Causality describes the flow of cause and effect among events and causes. When describing causality, it's important to consider both direct and indirect effects. Direct effects occur when one event happens directly (i.e., without intermediaries) while indirect effects occur through interaction with other factors (i.e., confounding). Thus, the goal of understanding causality is to determine whether one factor influences another by causing its own change. For example, obesity is often associated with poor health outcomes such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. However, the exact mechanism of this association remains unknown due to complex interdependencies between different risk factors. Therefore, identifying the precise mechanisms behind these associations could provide valuable insights into improving our health care systems. 

To establish causality, we need to identify three key components - cause, effect, and mediator - and understand how they interact with each other during various scenarios. These components include cause: the independent variable(s), which lead to the outcome; effect: the dependent variable, which changes as a result of the cause; and mediator: the third variable(s) whose presence or absence might affect the effect but has no bearing on the cause. There are multiple ways to quantify causality, including common factors analysis, conceptual graph models, regression analysis, and instrumental variables methods.

We will use the concept of correlation and causation together in order to explore what it means for two variables to be related, and why certain relationships may be spurious. By applying these concepts, we can better understand the role of correlation in our everyday lives, and develop tools and techniques that help us make better decisions based on data.

# 2. Examples
## Example 1: Gasoline price versus miles traveled
One way to look at correlation is to compare two variables against each other and see how closely they move together in patterns. Suppose you were given a dataset consisting of gasoline prices and corresponding miles driven annually. Here's one possible scatter plot visualization of this data:


From this chart, we can see that there seems to be a moderately strong positive correlation between the two variables. This suggests that as fuel prices increase, so does vehicle mileage, indicating that the higher the cost of fuel, the further drivers drive and consume less gasoline. Although this pattern may seem obvious, it's worth noting that correlation alone cannot always be used to draw meaningful conclusions about causality. We'll now turn to causality to explain why this pattern exists in the first place.

To start, let's assume that the only reason mileage increases is because of increased fuel costs. One way to test this hypothesis is to calculate the average percentage difference in mileage caused by a one percent increase in fuel prices. Intuitively, we expect that a one-percent increase in fuel prices should cause a roughly one-percent decrease in mileage. To find this, we divide the mean difference in mileage for all years where the price went up by 1% by the same amount, since that represents the expected change from a one-percent increase in fuel prices. Using this formula, we get an estimated percentage drop of 0.79%, meaning that increasing fuel prices actually leads to a small reduction in annual mileage.

However, notice that the previous estimate assumes that fuel prices rise at a constant rate. While this may be true in some cases, it doesn't always hold. Fuel prices might fall significantly after a crisis, leading to fluctuations in fuel costs over time. As a result, using simple average differences across all years won't give accurate results in practice.

A more reliable method for testing causality is to model the relationship between fuel prices and mileage using a regression equation. Regression analyses allow us to fit a curve to data points and extract information about the slope, intercept, and p-value of the line. Specifically, we can fit a polynomial regression of degree n (where n is typically much larger than 1) to the data and test the significance of the slope parameter. If the slope is significantly different from zero, we can conclude that fuel prices indeed influence mileage and that the relationship is likely non-linear. Alternatively, we can also check for autocorrelation within the residuals of the regression, which indicates that there might still be structure in the data that affects the predictions beyond just the current year.

Using a regression analysis, we can isolate the effect of fuel prices on mileage in a systematic manner and separate out the sources of error (i.e., omitted variables) that contribute to the variance in the prediction. This allows us to evaluate the robustness of the findings to potential confounders.
