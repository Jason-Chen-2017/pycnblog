# 1.简介
  

>Exploding Gradients are one of the most common issues with neural networks and deep learning models. The cause of exploding gradients is that large gradients can propagate through the network, resulting in unstable training or loss divergence. To avoid these problems, we need to carefully choose the hyperparameters of our model such as learning rate, batch size, regularization techniques like dropout, weight initialization schemes and etc. However, there is no simple solution for all cases. One possible approach to solve this problem is by using Gradient Clipping technique which clips the gradient values during backpropagation so they do not exceed a certain threshold. 

In this article, I will explain what Gradient Clipping is, how it works, when to use it and how to implement it using TensorFlow library. We will also discuss its pros and cons compared to other popular optimization methods such as Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam, etc.


# 2. Concepts and Terminology
Before understanding how Gradient Clipping works let's first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to it:

1. **Gradient:** In machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), the gradient is a vector field that points from a point A to a point B in a smooth function. It measures the slope of the curve at any point on the surface. 

2. **Gradient Descent:** Gradient descent is an algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. Its main idea is to update the parameters of a model in the opposite direction of the gradient based on the error between predicted output and true output. 

3. **Backpropagation:** Backpropagation is the process of calculating the gradient of each neuron in a neural network layer with respect to its inputs, weights and outputs. During the backward propagation phase, the errors of the previous layers are propagated backwards through the network until the input data is reached. Then, the chain rule is applied to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter of the network.

4. **Vanishing/Exploding Gradient:** Vanishing Gradient refers to the issue where the updates to the weights in a neural network layer become very small leading to slow convergence and poor performance. On the other hand, Exploding Gradient refers to the scenario where the updates to the weights becomes too large and results in numerical instability and failure of the training procedure.

5. **Batch Size:** Batch size represents the number of samples processed per iteration while training a Neural Network. A smaller batch size requires more memory but provides better generalization capabilities and speeds up the computation time. However, it may lead to slower convergence and higher variance of the estimated optimal parameters. 

6. **Learning Rate:** Learning rate determines the step size taken in the direction of the negative gradient during each iteration. Too high a learning rate can result in slow convergence, while too low a learning rate can cause the optimizer to oscillate across the minimum rather than converging efficiently.

7. **Weight Initialization:** Weight initialization refers to the process of initializing the weights of the neural network before training starts. It helps the model learn faster and improve the accuracy of predictions by ensuring that the initial values have appropriate ranges and distribution.

8. **Regularization Techniques:** Regularization techniques are used to reduce overfitting by adding additional constraints to the cost function of the model. They penalize the model if it learns complex relationships between features and labels instead of simple ones. Common regularization techniques include L2 regularization, Dropout, Early stopping, and others.

Now that you know about these terms, let's proceed further!



# 3. Algorithm Overview
The overall algorithm consists of two steps:

1. Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the network using backpropagation.

2. Clip the gradient to a maximum value specified by the user.

Let’s go through each step in detail now.


## Step 1: Computing the gradient using Backpropagation
During the forward pass, we compute the output y_hat of the current state of the network given a set of input x. Similarly, during the backward pass, we calculate the partial derivatives of the loss function w.r.t. every weight and bias term, giving us a vector of gradients dL/dw. Once computed, we multiply each element of dL/dw with the corresponding gradient obtained via backpropagation.

We then sum up all the weighted gradients for each individual weight and add them together to get the total gradient vector g = ∑wi∣dL/dwi∣.


### How does the clipping work?
Clipping involves scaling the gradient vector g to ensure that none of its components exceed a certain threshold, usually denoted by c. If a component gi of g exceeds c, then we replace it with ci*gi/|gi|. Here ci is the factor by which we want to scale the gradient component, typically chosen to be less than or equal to 1. This ensures that the impact of larger gradient components is reduced relative to those smaller. Note that setting ci=c effectively disables gradient clipping.

After computing the gradient, we apply the clipping operation to restrict the norm of the gradient vector. Specifically, we set gi = ci*gi/||g|| if ||g|| > c otherwise gi remains unchanged. Finally, we subtract γ(θ − θ_prev) * g / m, where γ is the learning rate, θ is the updated parameter vector after applying the gradient update, θ_prev is the previous parameter vector, m is the mini-batch size, from the newly computed gradient vector to obtain the final updated parameter vector. This gives rise to the well known "gradient descent" method. 



# 4. Code Implementation using Tensorflow
As mentioned earlier, implementing Gradient Clipping using TensorFlow library is straightforward. Let's take a look at an example implementation below:<|im_sep|>
