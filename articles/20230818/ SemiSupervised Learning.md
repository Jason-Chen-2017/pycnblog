Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a type of machine learning that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to learn better models. In general, SSL algorithms take advantage of the information in the labeled dataset by using it as guidance to train the model. However, they can also use some or all of the unlabeled data without any additional human annotation to improve their performance. The key idea behind semi-supervised learning is that there are two sources of training data available: labeled examples and unlabeled examples. Unlike supervised learning where the algorithm receives only labeled input, in SSL we have access to both labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. This allows us to leverage knowledge from both labeled and unlabeled datasets to make more accurate predictions. 

In this article, I will introduce you to various techniques used for semi-supervised learning with focus on classification problems. Before moving into the technical details, let’s understand the basic concept of semi-supervised learning briefly.

2.Semi-supervised learning terminology and concepts
Before starting our discussion about SSL, let’s first go through some essential terms and concepts related to it. Here are some definitions of these terms:

- Labeled data: Data that has been annotated with labels such as “spam” or “not spam”.
- Unlabeled data: Data that has not been explicitly labeled but contains valuable information that may be useful in building an accurate model.
- Label propagation: A process by which one instance’s label is propagated to its neighbors in order to reduce the amount of labeled data required for training. It involves exchanging the labels between similar instances during training iterations.
- Weakly supervised learning: In weakly supervised learning, the model is trained on small amounts of labeled data and unlabeled data. It can identify relevant patterns within the data without relying heavily on manual annotations provided by experts.

3.Semi-supervised learning algorithms and operations
Now that we have an understanding of what SSL is and how it works, we can move onto discussing different SSL algorithms that can be applied to different types of classification problems.

### Voting ensemble
The simplest form of semi-supervised learning is voting ensemble, which involves combining multiple weak classifiers to produce a strong classifier. Each individual classifier makes a prediction based on its own subset of features, and then the predicted class with the highest frequency among the classifiers is chosen as the final output. This technique can work well if the majority of the unlabeled samples belong to the same category as the most frequently occurring class predicted by the majority of the classifiers. 

Here's how the voting ensemble algorithm works: 

1. Train several binary classification models on subsets of the labeled and unlabeled data separately. For example, we can split the data into five folds, each containing approximately half the number of samples as the other parts. Then, we can train a logistic regression model on the first four folds and another logistic regression model on the fifth fold. We'll call these models A, B, C, D, and E respectively. 

2. During testing time, predict the class of each sample using each of the individual models and collect the votes for each class using a vote counter. Let's assume that the top three models predicted "spam" for a given sample, so the corresponding vote counters would look like this: 

    Model   | Spam  Not spam
    -------------|-------------
    A      |    7   2 
    B      |    9   1  
    C      |    5   3  

3. After counting the votes, choose the class with the maximum vote count as the final output. If there is a tie, randomly select the winning class. 

This simple algorithm provides good results when combined with other popular SSL techniques such as label propagation or density estimation. However, since each individual classifier is trained independently, it does not provide the full benefit of using all the available labeled and unlabeled data to create a unified model. Therefore, it should typically be coupled with other SSL techniques, such as active learning or self-training, to further boost its accuracy.

### Self-training
Self-training is a technique where the base learner is repeatedly trained using the labeled and unlabeled data until convergence. In each iteration, the model is retrained on both labeled and partially labeled data generated by the previous iteration. This generates new labeled data and reduces the bias introduced by label propagation.

Here's how the self-training algorithm works: 

1. Split the data into training set, validation set, and test set. Use the training set to train the initial model, the validation set to evaluate the progress of the training process, and the test set to measure the final performance of the model. 

2. At each step i, generate pseudo-labels using the current model and apply them to the unlabeled portion of the training set to obtain a new training set with partial labels. Concatenate the newly labeled data with the labeled data obtained in previous iterations to get the final training set. Retrain the model on this updated training set to obtain the next iteration’s pseudo-labels. Continue iterating until no significant improvement in accuracy is observed. 

3. Evaluate the performance of the final model on the test set. Report the final accuracy achieved by the model.

Self-training takes advantage of all the available labeled and unlabeled data during training, making it a powerful technique for improving the overall accuracy of the model. It requires careful parameter selection to prevent overfitting and handle imbalanced classes effectively. Finally, since each iteration of training relies solely on the previous model’s output, it can be computationally intensive.
