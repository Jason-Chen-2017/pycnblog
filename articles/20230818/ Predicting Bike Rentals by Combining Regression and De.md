## 2.1 数据集描述
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are several interesting problems associated with prediction of bike rentals like:
* What trends do we have for demand for different days/times?
* How will weather conditions change in the near future?
* Are some hours more popular than others?
Therefore, this article talks about how we can predict bike rentals using machine learning algorithms on historical data. Historical bike sharing data is used as input features to train our model which then gives predictions for upcoming time periods or routes. We will use linear regression and decision trees algorithm respectively. Linear regression helps us in estimating the relationship between dependent variable (bike rentals) and independent variables (weather conditions, seasonality, time). While decision tree provides non-linear relationships among features that might be present in dataset. The final output is bike rentals count for given inputs.
## 2.2 模型设计
The proposed solution uses both linear regression and decision trees models. During training phase, we preprocess the data by aggregating it into hourly basis. Then, we split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets with an 80:20 ratio. For each hour, we fit the linear regression model on training set with feature vector containing weather condition, seasonality, time, day of week and number of holidays. After fitting, we predict the bike rentals count for remaining hours based on trained linear regression model and store them in separate file. Next, we create decision trees classifier on the same preprocessed dataset to learn patterns within the data. Here, we use Gini impurity criterion to measure the quality of splits while building decision trees. Finally, during inference time, we combine the outputs of both linear regression and decision trees models by taking average over all predicted values. This approach generates accurate results as compared to other approaches such as deep learning techniques.

### 3.1 数据预处理
We start by importing necessary libraries and reading the raw data into pandas dataframe. Preprocessing involves handling missing values, scaling numerical columns and encoding categorical variables. Once done, we aggregate the data by grouping rows by date and hour. Here's the code snippet to perform these steps:<|im_sep|>

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np
import math

data = pd.read_csv("path/to/dataset") # read the csv file
le = LabelEncoder() # initialize label encoder object

# preprocessing
data["season"] = le.fit_transform(data["season"]) # encode season column
data["holiday"] = le.fit_transform(data["holiday"]) # encode holiday column
data["workingday"] = le.fit_transform(data["workingday"]) # encode workingday column
data['year'] = data['datetime'].dt.year # extract year
data['month'] = data['datetime'].dt.month # extract month
data['day'] = data['datetime'].dt.day # extract day
data['hour'] = data['datetime'].dt.hour # extract hour
data['weekday'] = data['datetime'].dt.weekday # extract weekday
data = data[['season', 'holiday', 'workingday','temp', 'atemp', 'humidity',
               'windspeed','month', 'hour', 'weekday']] # select relevant columns
data = data.dropna() # remove null values
scaler = MinMaxScaler() # initialize scaler object
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(data.iloc[:,:-1]) # scale numercial columns
data.loc[:,:] = scaled_features # update dataframe with scaled columns
hourly_grouped = data.groupby(['year','month', 'day', 'hour']).mean().reset_index() # group data by datetime

# save processed data as CSV file
hourly_grouped.to_csv('processed_data.csv')
```
### 3.2 线性回归模型
Next step is to fit linear regression model on the aggregated hourly grouped dataset. We need to prepare two datasets: one for training and one for testing. Also, since we want to estimate the bike rentals for every single hour, so we don't have any ground truth labels, hence we should only keep the last row of each hour as target value for training and the remaining rows as input features.<|im_sep|>

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    hourly_grouped[:-1], hourly_grouped[-1:], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
lr_model = LinearRegression()
lr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_lr = lr_model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_lr)
print("MSE:", mse)
```
After fitting, we calculate the MSE metric to evaluate the performance of the model on the testing dataset. Now, let's save the predicted bike rentals count for each hour in a separate file:<|im_sep|>

```python
predicted_counts = []
for i in range(len(hourly_grouped)-1):
    x = hourly_grouped[i]
    if i == len(hourly_grouped)-2:
        predicted_count = lr_model.predict([x])[0][0]
    else:
        predicted_count = lr_model.predict([x])[0][0]
    predicted_counts.append({'date': str(x['year']) + '-' + str(x['month']) + '-' + str(x['day']),
                             'hour': int(x['hour']),
                             'prediction': predicted_count})

pd.DataFrame(predicted_counts).to_csv('predicted_counts.csv')
```
Here, we iterate through each row of the original dataset except for the last row. If it's not the last row, we directly predict the corresponding bike rentals count using the trained linear regression model. Otherwise, we first convert the current row to a list, pass it to the model to get the predicted count and append it to the `predicted_counts` list. At the end, we export the resulting DataFrame to a CSV file.
