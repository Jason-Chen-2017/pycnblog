# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most popular areas of machine learning that has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to its ability to solve complex problems by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback from it based on agent’s actions. In this article, we will introduce basic concepts such as Markov Decision Process (MDP), Q-Learning algorithm, Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation, Actor-Critic algorithms and implement them using Python programming language and OpenAI Gym library. We will also learn how to use these tools to train agents to solve various environments like Blackjack, Taxi-v2, etc., which are widely used for RL research and practice. This article assumes readers have some familiarity with machine learning and reinforcement learning concepts but do not require any previous knowledge about coding or AI libraries.

In general, developing intelligent systems requires combining human intelligence with computational power and techniques such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and optimization. Machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning (RL), provides powerful methods for solving challenging tasks by learning through trial and error interactions with an environment, making sense of rewards and punishments, and optimizing performance over time. Despite their importance, however, few articles provide comprehensive introductions to RL theory and practical applications, especially those targeting non-technical audience. 

The purpose of writing this article is to provide a concise guide for those who want to start working with RL technologies in their projects or careers. We aim to cover essential topics including MDP, Q-learning, policy evaluation, actor-critic algorithms, and code implementation using OpenAI Gym library. By doing so, we hope to help newcomers get up to speed quickly with fundamental concepts and tools needed for advanced development. Our goal is to produce a well-structured yet accessible resource for individuals looking to develop their expertise in this area.

# 3.目标读者
This article is intended for anyone interested in applying reinforcement learning (RL) technology to their project, industry, or hobby. The target reader can be a software engineer, data scientist, mathematician, or even someone who wants to understand the theoretical underpinnings of modern AI research. Our explanations should make sense to anyone familiar with computer science fundamentals, math formulas, and programming languages. Some knowledge of Python and TensorFlow would certainly benefit, though they are not required. As mentioned earlier, no prior experience with AI libraries nor reinforcement learning would be assumed. If you need further explanation or reference material, please refer to external resources provided at the end of each section. Overall, our focus is on explaining technical details rather than discussing philosophical principles or ethics. 

# 4.文章结构
We plan to write this article in six parts, roughly following the order of appearance in the table of contents. Each part will contain a brief background introduction followed by detailed descriptions and examples of relevant mathematical theory, algorithms, and code implementations using OpenAI Gym library. It's important to note that all sections are designed to be stand-alone and independent of each other, providing self-contained information that could be useful for developers seeking specific pieces of information while avoiding unnecessary redundancy or overlap. 

1. Background Introduction
Before delving into the actual theory, let us first establish the context within which reinforcement learning (RL) applies.

2. Markov Decision Process (MDP)
In this chapter, we will discuss the fundamental concept of MDP, which forms the basis of most reinforcement learning algorithms. We will explore why MDP works, identify key properties, and define notation used throughout the rest of the book. 

3. Q-Learning Algorithm
Q-learning is a type of value iteration algorithm that computes state-action values based on current estimates and reward functions. In this chapter, we will review the underlying ideas behind Q-learning, explain its components, and derive its optimality equation.

4. Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation
Monte Carlo methods involve computing sample-based estimates of expected returns and action-value functions based on observed transitions between states and actions. In this chapter, we will discuss the intuition behind Monte Carlo estimation and demonstrate how to compute estimated state-action values using Monte Carlo sampling method.

5. Actor-Critic Algorithms
Actor-critic algorithms combine insights from both policy gradient methods and Q-learning by modeling policies directly as stochastic policies that depend on continuous parameters, called critic networks, and directly updating the parameters of the actors, known as the actor networks. In this chapter, we will explore the connections between the two approaches, highlight the similarities and differences between the two algorithms, and showcase an example code implementation using PyTorch framework.

6. Code Implementation Using OpenAI Gym Library
Finally, we will present several examples of implementing standard reinforcement learning algorithms using OpenAI Gym library. These examples include training agents to play Atari games, solve the CartPole problem, and train agents to navigate autonomous vehicles in simulation.
