Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) is a new Oracle feature that allows customers to deploy multiple instances of an Oracle database on different servers or hosts within a cluster. This enables organizations to achieve high availability and scalability by providing fault tolerance and load balancing for applications across multiple nodes.

In this article, we will discuss the role of Oracle RAC in relational DBMS architecture along with some basic concepts and terminology used in describing its architectural design. We will also present a brief overview of Oracle RAC architecture and explain how it differs from other clustering technologies such as MySQL Cluster, PostgreSQL HA, MongoDB Replica Set, etc., and why Oracle RAC offers unique benefits compared to these alternatives. Finally, we will provide some examples demonstrating how Oracle RAC can be used to enhance application performance, reduce latency, increase throughput, and support advanced features like sharding and scaling out. 

This article assumes readers are familiar with fundamental principles of distributed systems design, including network topology, client-server model, shared resources, synchronization mechanisms, and service isolation techniques. It also assumes readers have experience working with various clustering technologies and understand their advantages, limitations, and common use cases.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Distributed Systems Design Principles
Before diving into the specific architecture of Oracle RAC, let’s first review some commonly used principles of distributed system design:

1. Scalability: The ability of a system to handle increased workload without degrading performance or functionality beyond a certain limit called scale. 

2. Availability: A measure of the probability that a system continues to function correctly and perform its intended tasks during any given period. 

3. Fault Tolerance: A characteristic of distributed systems which provides resilience against failures of individual components or subsystems.

4. Redundancy: Measures of redundancy typically involve copies of data or services running on different machines or locations to ensure that there is no single point of failure. 

5. Consistency: The property of a system that ensures that all data updates are reflected in real time on all nodes, ensuring that operations performed on one node consistently reflect those made on another. 

6. Partition Tolerance: The property of a system where communication between nodes may become disrupted due to a partition event - i.e. when two or more parts of a network go down. Partition tolerant algorithms should still continue to operate properly while dealing with partitions.

7. Communication Protocol: Protocols define how information is exchanged between nodes over the network. Common protocols include TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, SMTP, POP3, FTP, NFS, SMB, etc.

8. Client-Server Model: In client-server model, clients request services from a server, rather than requiring direct connection to each other. Servers process requests received from clients and return responses back to them. The main advantage of using this model is that servers can easily scale horizontally, whereas if they were designed to communicate directly with each other, horizontal scaling would require redesigning the entire system. 

9. Shared Resources: A resource is considered shared if it has several independent owners who need to access it simultaneously. Examples of shared resources include memory, disk space, printer queues, file systems, and databases. 

10. Synchronization: Mechanisms to enable different threads or processes to coordinate their activities so that they do not interfere with each other when accessing shared resources. Different types of synchronization mechanisms include semaphores, mutexes, monitors, barriers, and events. 

11. Service Isolation Techniques: Methods used to isolate functional areas of a system from each other, reducing potential interference and errors caused by concurrent execution. Typical methods include containerization, virtualization, networking overlays, and firewall rules.

## 2.2 Basic Terms
Some key terms associated with Oracle RAC architecture include:

1. Node: An instance of an Oracle database, usually installed on a separate physical machine. Each node runs independently, but shares the same set of resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and networks.

2. Instance: A logical entity representing a set of related data and configuration files stored together on a single node. Each instance contains a dedicated listener, dispatcher, and background processes.

2. Host: The computer hardware platform running the Oracle software stack on which one or more Oracle instances run. A host consists of one or more CPUs and memory, and may optionally contain additional devices such as hard drives, tape libraries, and networking equipment.

3. Database: A collection of schema objects organized into tables, views, indexes, and procedures that store and manipulate data. It represents a complete environment for storing, managing, processing, and retrieving data.

4. PDB: Pluggable databases (PDBs) are user-defined partitions that allow you to manage heterogeneous environments containing both Oracle and non-Oracle databases. They can span multiple database instances, allowing you to simplify management, deployment, and recovery of large Oracle databases. PDBs can be managed individually or collectively as part of a CDB.

5. Data Guard: Oracle Data Guard is a tool that helps you maintain a standby copy of your primary database for failover purposes. When a failover occurs, Data Guard brings the standby database up to date with changes occurring in the primary database. You can configure either synchronous replication or asynchronous replication between the primary and standby databases.

6. Failover: A switchover mechanism that enables an active Oracle database to take over its role as standby after a failure of the original node hosting the database. During a failover, the old primary database transitions to a secondary role temporarily until the new primary is ready to serve traffic again.

7. Resource Manager: The Oracle RAC component responsible for allocating resources among the members of an Oracle RAC cluster. It controls placement and allocation of resources among the nodes in a cluster based on defined policies and constraints.

8. Quorum: A quorum is a minimum number of voting nodes required to agree on the outcome of a consensus algorithm in a distributed environment. If the number of votes cast reaches or exceeds the quorum value, then the decision can be made unanimous. Otherwise, a majority vote is needed. There are three possible scenarios for determining the quorum value:

  a. Auto Quorum Detection Mode: In auto quorum detection mode, the database uses a dynamic quorum calculation algorithm to determine the optimal quorum value. The database automatically adjusts the quorum value depending on the size of the cluster and the level of risk involved in making a decision.

  b. Fixed Quorum Value Mode: In fixed quorum value mode, the database administrator manually specifies the desired quorum value.

  c. Flexible Quorum Mode: In flexible quorum mode, the database dynamically adjusts the quorum value based on the current state of the cluster. The flexibility comes at the cost of lower consistency guarantees.

# 3.Oracle RAC Architecture 
The following diagram shows an overview of the Oracle RAC architecture:


1. Physical Topology: The physical topology determines the location and connectivity of nodes in the Oracle RAC cluster. Oracle recommends deploying Oracle RAC clusters across multiple subnets for higher availability and better performance. However, the choice of how many subnets to use depends on factors such as bandwidth capacity, security requirements, and proximity to the production environment. 

2. Logical Network: The logical network connects the nodes in the cluster over the network fabric, establishing a private IP address for each instance. The port numbers used by each instance are randomly assigned by default, ensuring maximum scalability. The network protocol used for communication between nodes is configurable.

3. High-Availability Services: The High-Availability Services module includes the Oracle ASM (Advanced Storage Management), Voting, Automatic Restart, and Load Balancer services. These services make sure that the cluster remains highly available even in the case of failures, enabling fast failover when necessary.

4. Directory Services: The directory services module manages user authentication, authorization, and auditing for Oracle RAC clusters. All nodes share the same set of users, groups, and roles, simplifying administration and eliminating confusion.

5. Management Tools: Administrators use the Oracle Enterprise Manager Console or Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage the Oracle RAC cluster. The console presents graphical interfaces for monitoring cluster status, managing resources, and managing user sessions. CLI commands automate repetitive tasks and integrate well with scripting languages.

6. Database Services: The database services layer provides core database functions such as backup, recovery, archiving, logging, and change tracking. Each instance operates independently but shares the same underlying storage, ensuring consistent results.

7. Shardware Services: The shardware services layer enables Oracle RAC clusters to span multiple regions, providing improved scalability, availability, and fault tolerance capabilities. Customers can create multiple regions, each consisting of multiple sites, and assign workloads to specific regions to achieve better performance and reliability.

8. Performance Monitoring Services: The performance monitoring services gather statistics and metrics from all the nodes in the cluster, providing detailed insights into the health and performance of the overall solution. The performance monitoring tools generate reports, alerts, dashboards, and KPIs that help administrators optimize performance and identify bottlenecks early.

9. Security Services: The security services layer protects sensitive data and supports authentication, encryption, and access control policies for Oracle RAC clusters. It implements intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, and anomaly detection algorithms to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, and compromise of critical resources.

Overall, Oracle RAC is a powerful technology that offers high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance capabilities for Oracle databases. Its multi-instance architecture, automated failover, and scalable sharding options further enhance the productivity and usability of Oracle databases. By leveraging best practices from leading industries, Oracle RAC makes enterprise-class database management simpler and more efficient for developers and businesses alike.
