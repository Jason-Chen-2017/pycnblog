Radiation detection has been an active area of research for decades and is becoming more promising with the advancements in electronics technology. However, it is challenging to detect radiation without causing harmful effects on living beings or environmental protection. The advanced use of biosensors for radiation detection faces unique challenges because they require very high sensitivity and low background noise to operate reliably under diverse conditions. In this article, we will explore a simple yet powerful technique using light-absorbing fluorescent dye (LABD) based photodetectors for imaging biological samples such as cells, tissues, and organs. This approach is able to extract valuable information from the sample by taking advantage of the absorption properties of LABD materials, which can penetrate through various thicknesses of the tissue and into the cellular membrane. By combining these techniques with machine learning algorithms, we are able to build robust radiation detection systems that can accurately identify the presence of pathogens, viruses, and other toxins within the body.

In summary, the proposed technique uses ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths of light to capture biological signals and apply them directly to computer-generated images using photographic detection systems. To overcome the problem of nonuniformity caused by variations in skin thickness, thin layers of silicon oxide are used as the detector elements instead of traditional semiconductor detector elements like silicon filters. Moreover, the steep color gradients generated due to light absorption by the material also result in increased spatial resolution compared to conventional detectors. Finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is trained on synthetic data to simulate the real-world scenario where noisy environments exist and a specialized hardware platform is required for reliable operation. With these advances, we have demonstrated how easy it is to design robust radiation detection systems using biosensors, and suggest some possible future directions in addressing specific issues related to complex natural environments.

**Visible Light (VL)** - Optical radiation that passes through normal human vision at approximately 400 nm to 700 nm. It comprises several wavelength bands including blue, green, and red. 

**Near-InfraRed (NIR)** - A narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum between 900 and 1200 nm. It is typically used to measure physiological responses associated with hormones, glucose levels, fetal heart rate, etc., especially during pregnancy and childbirth.

**Ultraviolet (UV)** - An extremely narrow waveband, ranging from 150-300 nm, emitted by atoms or molecules after excited electrons react with free electrons in their valence shell. It allows for the detection of small particles in the air. UV radiation presents several unique physical and chemical properties making it useful for microorganisms, but its wide spectral range makes it less suitable for continuous monitoring applications.

**Fluorescence** - The emission of light when an object or a gas is heated or cooled. It occurs naturally in many organic compounds, metals, and some inanimate objects, and is widely used in biotechnology and medicine to visualize and analyze biological processes. Fluorescent dyes consist of a base molecule containing a fluorophore, which binds to an analyte and generates a colored beam of fluorescent radiation.

**Biosensor** - A device that senses changes in biology or its surrounding environment using only photosynthetic activity of organisms. They convert incoming light into chemical signals or make precise measurements. There are three main types of biosensors:

1. Radar Sensors : These are passive devices that emit radio waves that can be received and analyzed to obtain information about target vehicles, people, or objects around us.
2. Electrochemical sensors : These are active devices that conduct electric currents and use chemical reactions to produce an output signal that can be measured.
3. Photochemical sensors : These are similar to electrochemical sensors but rely on photoactivation of enzymes to release reactive species, which then trigger the sensor response.

**Image Processing** - The process of converting digital image data into meaningful information and insights. Image processing involves various steps such as segmentation, thresholding, feature extraction, matching, filtering, morphological operations, etc.

**Convolution Neural Network (CNN)** - A deep learning algorithm that is specifically designed for visual recognition tasks. CNNs employ multiple convolutional and pooling layers along with fully connected hidden layers to classify input images.

**Deep Learning** - A subset of machine learning methods that leverage large amounts of data and neural networks to perform complex tasks such as image classification and prediction. Deep learning models learn features automatically by analyzing millions of examples across different categories.

The proposed technique uses ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths of light to capture biological signals and apply them directly to computer-generated images using photographic detection systems. The NIR spectrometer captures the vibrations present inside the cellular membrane and the VIS spectrometer captures the structures and contents of the cell. The combined results obtained from the two spectra give rise to a hyperspectral image that shows both the structure and content of the cell simultaneously. The initial step includes applying appropriate optoelectronic components and wiring the system together. Once the system is established, the camera module captures an image of the target biological sample and sends it to the NIR detector element, which converts the NIR light intensity into digital values. Similarly, the VIS detector element is responsible for capturing the VIS light intensity and converting it into analog values. Afterward, the raw digital signals are passed through separate processors that preprocess the data by removing any outliers, scaling the signals to a common scale, smoothing, and segmenting the regions of interest (ROIs). Next, the processed data is fed into the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to generate predictions regarding the presence of pathogens, viruses, and other toxins within the body. Depending on the outcome of the analysis, further actions may be taken to prevent damage to living beings or the environment.

To overcome the problem of nonuniformity caused by variations in skin thickness, thin layers of silicon oxide are used as the detector elements instead of traditional semiconductor detector elements like silicon filters. This gives rise to improved spatial resolution and easier interrogation of thinner tissue layers. Another key aspect of this technique is the fact that the material itself performs efficient photon transmission allowing for safe and accurate operation even in the presence of complex natural environments. Additionally, the steep color gradients generated due to light absorption by the material also result in increased spatial resolution compared to conventional detectors. Lastly, the convex shape of the sensor leads to better adhesion of the NIR and VIS detectors to the cellular membrane, resulting in enhanced optical performance.
