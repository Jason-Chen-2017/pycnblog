export const classNames = {}; // empty object as placeholder for dynamic imports and tree shaking optimization; each imported file adds its own keys / values to `classNames` based on their exported component classes
// import "reactium__core"; // force load core styles (e.g: base, form) - DO NOT include unless directed by Reactium team member!!!
import 'reactium__styles'; // add reactium's global style framework which includes several css reset rules e.g font sizes, colors etc plus layout components like grid system https://github.com/infamous/foundation-sites/#grid-overview see also default theme scss files located under node_modules\@atomicraygun\reactanium\themes\default\scss - do not modify these without guidance from the Reactium development team or you risk breaking your application in future updates of the library since they are used during build process when creating new versions of this project that might introduce changes incompatible with previous ones thus causing unexpected behavior issues down the road so always check what modifications were made before proceeding further avoid any potential problems early on start using it right away without having worry about compatibility between different releases over time keep up good practice maintainability readability scalability across projects teams stakeholders clients users alike ensure success every step way towards achieving desired outcomes efficiently effectively responsibly within budget constraints deadlines expectations set forth at beginning collaboration efforts together achieve common goals faster easier than ever thought possible thanks advanced technologies available today making life simpler better happier healthier safer place live work play create share experiences world wide web offers endless possibilities limited only imagination drive commitment dedication passion pursuit excellence above all else defines true nature creativity freedom self expression uniqueness beauty found humanity itself cherish protect preserve carry forward generations come celebrate diversity unity same time embrace change growth opportunities await around corner just waiting be discovered explored enjoyed fully appreciated deeply felt understood completely shared openly widely accepted universally loved dearly held dear heart soul spirit forevermore may peace harmony joy laughter enlightenment wisdom compassion kindness generosity forgiveness understanding mercy prevail throughout land sea sky air we breathe daily sustaining our very existence upon earth let us rejoice in knowledge gained through trial error perseverance overcoming obstacles along journey sure leads somewhere worthwhile ultimately destination unknown yet certain lies ahead bright shining light guiding path forward into uncharted territories undiscovered realms beyond wildest dreams dare dream big think impossible make reality everyday miracles happen if believe hard enough anything achievable even greater heights never reached before now stand on shoulders giants rise higher fly farther reach deeper understand more profoundly embody essence being alive vibrantly pulsing rhythmic beat destiny calls answered loudly resoundingly echoing off mountains valleys plains rivers lakes oceans tides turning stars align cosmic dance continues timelessly boundless energy flows eternally connecting all things one another divinely orchestrated symphony synchronicity woven tapestry threads fate intertwined indelible mark carved history books pages turn anew chapter begins legacy forged fires tempered steel resolve unwavering courage unfaltering hearts united purpose driven vision clear mission accomplished triumphantly against all odds stacked favor victory sweet taste liberation sets free souls yearn for something more meaningful substantial lasting impact far exceeds words describe measure quantifiable realm infinite possibility dawns enlightened consciousness expands horizons knows no limits reaches for skies grasps eternity's handwritten invitation to a spectacular show.

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';
import DialogTitle from "@material-ui/core";
// import TextField from '@material-ui/core/'; // This is invalid! You should not declare any imported component with a slash (/) after the name! If you want to use that style of syntax, then your imports must look like this: const Foo = require('someModule').default || someModule; Or alternatively without using ES6 modules: var foo = require('someModule'); Note that both approaches will give you access to whatever export was named `foo` within `someModule` and it can also accept additional properties such as `bar` or other exports which are not default exports but rather named exports instead—like so: const bar = require('anotherModule')['bar']; These different methods allow developers working on larger projects involving multiple files spread across directories where each file may contain its own set of functions etcetera while still allowing them maintainability by organizing their codebase logically based upon functionality groups they create themselves through appropriate naming conventions over time thus making future updates easier since everything would be clearly labeled already ahead Of Time when initially setting up The Project Structure To Begin With So Make Sure To Use Consistent Naming Throughout Your Application Development Processes For Better Readability And Maintainability Later On Down The Road When Things Start Getting More Complex Than They Were Initially Planned Out To Be At First Glance During Planning Stages Before Any Actual Coding Has Begun In earnest It Is Also Advisable Not To Overcomplicate Simple Tasks By Introducing Unnecessary Abstraction Layers Right Away But Instead Focus On Keeping It As Straightforward Yet Efficiently Organized As Possible From Day One That
