## 7.2.2 Explainability and controllability

### Background introduction

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in various industries, ethical concerns regarding AI decision-making have emerged. Two key principles for addressing these concerns are explainability and controllability. **Explainability** refers to the ability of an AI system to provide clear and understandable explanations for its decisions, while **controllability** is the capacity to regulate and guide the behavior of an AI system. In this section, we will delve into these two concepts and their implications for AI development and deployment.

### Core concepts and connections

The core concepts related to explainability and controllability include transparency, interpretability, accountability, fairness, and safety. These concepts are interconnected as follows:

* Transparency is a prerequisite for both explainability and controllability. It involves providing access to relevant information about the AI system's design, implementation, and decision-making processes.
* Interpretability is closely linked to explainability, referring to the degree to which users can comprehend the internal workings and outputs of an AI system. High interpretability facilitates better understanding and trust.
* Accountability encompasses assigning responsibility for AI system outcomes and ensuring that developers, deployers, and users are held responsible for their actions and decisions involving AI systems.
* Fairness in AI systems implies minimizing biases in data, algorithms, and decision-making processes. This is crucial for avoiding discrimination and ensuring equitable treatment of individuals or groups affected by AI systems.
* Safety is another essential aspect of AI systems, requiring protection against unintended consequences, harm, and security breaches. Ensuring safety also involves establishing mechanisms for error detection, mitigation, and recovery.

### Algorithmic principles and techniques

There are several algorithmic principles and techniques that can enhance explainability and controllability in AI models. We will focus on three main approaches: feature importance methods, rule extraction, and local surrogate models.

#### Feature importance methods

Feature importance methods assess the relevance and impact of individual input features on the output of a machine learning model. Common techniques include:

1. Permutation feature importance: measures the decrease in model performance when a single feature's values are randomly shuffled.
2. Tree-based feature importance: evaluates features based on their frequency and depth in decision trees, reflecting their influence on the final prediction.

#### Rule extraction

Rule extraction aims to convert complex AI models into human-readable rules or decision trees. Popular methods include:

1. Decision tree induction: constructs a tree-like structure from input features and corresponding rules.
2. Rule-based machine learning: creates if-then rules using propositional logic, often applied to classification tasks.

#### Local surrogate models

Local surrogate models aim to approximate complex AI models locally, allowing for more straightforward interpretation. Examples include:

1. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): generates locally linear approximations to explain individual predictions.
2. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): uses game theory to calculate feature contributions to specific predictions.

### Best practices and code examples

Here, we present best practices and code examples for enhancing explainability and controllability in AI models:

#### Best practices

1. Document your model: Keep records detailing the data sources, preprocessing steps, model architecture, and hyperparameters.
2. Use visualizations: Graphical representations can aid in understanding complex relationships and patterns in data.
3. Employ multiple techniques: Utilize multiple explainability and controllability methods to ensure comprehensive understanding.
4. Validate with stakeholders: Engage domain experts and end-users in the validation process to ensure that explanations align with expectations and expertise.

#### Code example: Explaining a random forest classifier

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance
from skl2onnx import convert_sklearn
from skl2onnx.common.data_types import FloatTensorType
import onnxruntime as rt

# Generate random data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X, y)

# Calculate feature importance
result = permutation_importance(clf, X, y, n_repeats=10, random_state=42)

# Convert the trained model to ONNX format
initial_type = [('input', FloatTensorType([None, 10]))]
onnx_model = convert_sklearn(clf, "RandomForestClassifier", initial_types=initial_type)

# Load the ONNX model
sess = rt.InferenceSession(onnx_model.SerializeToString())

# Run the model on sample input
x_input = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
output = sess.run(None, {"input": x_input})

# Print feature importance and sample prediction
print("Feature importance:", result['importances_mean'])
print("Sample prediction:", output[0])
```

### Real-world applications

Explainability and controllability have significant implications for various real-world applications, including:

* Healthcare: Improving trust in AI diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
* Finance: Providing transparent justifications for credit scoring and fraud detection decisions.
* Criminal justice: Ensuring fairness and accountability in risk assessment and sentencing.
* Autonomous vehicles: Enabling clear communication between vehicles and humans regarding driving decisions.
