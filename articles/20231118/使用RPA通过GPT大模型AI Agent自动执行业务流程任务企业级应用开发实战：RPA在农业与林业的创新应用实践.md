“Robotic Process Automation”(RPA) refers to the use of software robots and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to assist with repetitive tasks that can be automated through computer programming. The goal is to reduce manual labor and increase productivity by automating small, routine processes such as data entry or document processing using a programmed script. However, due to the increasing complexity and heterogeneous nature of complex business process workflows, RPA has been hindered in its ability to successfully automate these complex applications. Therefore, this paper aims at providing an effective solution for developing enterprise-level Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions for managing complex business workflow applications based on GPT-3 language models trained on natural language understanding tasks. This research will provide valuable insights into applying AI technology in real-world problems across various industries such as agribusiness and forestry where natural language understanding capabilities are scarce and limited resources make it difficult to develop dedicated NLU systems. We will explore how pre-trained GPT-3 language model can effectively solve the challenges posed by highly complex business process workflows while enabling faster and more accurate decision-making automation. 

The objective of our work is to demonstrate how to develop an enterprise level RPA application utilizing GPT-3 Language Models for handling complex business workflows. Our proposed approach involves leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to train GPT-3 language models on large datasets containing detailed information about business processes within a given industry. These language models can then be used as an agent to perform a variety of automated tasks within the context of a specific business process. We will showcase examples from both agricultural and forest related domains highlighting the unique characteristics of each domain and demonstrating how GPT-3 language models can help improve efficiency, accuracy and effectiveness of these businesses’ processes. Finally, we plan to deploy our developed RPA system to a testing environment and conduct user acceptance testing to evaluate the benefits of our proposed approach over conventional methods for handling complex business workflows. 

This paper presents a technical development framework for building an RPA solution based on GPT-3 language models for managing complex business workflows. It provides practical guidance for selecting appropriate languages, training GPT-3 models on suitable datasets, integrating with existing systems and establishing communication channels between departments and stakeholders to ensure sustainable deployment of the RPA solution throughout the organization. Overall, our work demonstrates that GPT-3 language models can effectively handle highly complex business process workflows, providing faster and more accurate decision-making automation compared to other approaches. In addition, we provide a high-level roadmap for deploying our RPA system to different industries to gain widespread adoption and benefit from our solution. Thus, our work could serve as a useful foundation for future RPA projects involving advanced AI technologies. 


# 2.核心概念与联系
In this section, we introduce some key concepts and ideas that relate to the problem statement. Let us start with definitions of terms:

1. Business process – A set of activities performed by an entity or group under certain conditions to achieve a particular outcome. 

2. GPT-3 language model - A type of transformer-based neural network architecture that generates text content by predicting what comes next in a sequence of words. GPT-3 was released in October 2020 as part of OpenAI's ‘GPT-3 API.’ Its capacity to generate coherent and humanlike text prompts makes it particularly suited for generating texts that are relevant and engaging. GPT-3 is capable of generating diverse, creative yet consistent and logical texts by analyzing patterns, trends, emotions, and linguistic knowledge. 

3. Natural language understanding (NLU) - The task of extracting meaning and intent from written or spoken language. NLU allows machines to understand human language and identify critical features of speech, including entities, actions, intentions, values, emotional states, etc., allowing them to take action accordingly. 

4. State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Techniques - Machine learning algorithms that have attained significant improvements during recent years. They include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers. 

5. Enterprise Level RPA Application Development - An approach to developing enterprise-level RPA solutions for automating business processes based on GPT-3 language models. 

6. Agribusiness and Forestry Domains - Two prominent industries where machine learning can play a significant role in transforming the way they do business. 

Based on these definitions, let us now describe the structure of our paper. We divide our paper into four sections and present the following chapters: 

1. Introduction and Background  
2. Core Concepts and Methodology  
Chapter 2 introduces the main idea behind the project, i.e., the core concept of GPT-3 language models, and details the methodology adopted to build an enterprise level RPA application. 

3. Implementation and Results  
We will discuss the steps involved in implementing our proposed solution, including collecting dataset, creating custom prompt sets, fine-tuning the GPT-3 language models, and integrating the agents into existing systems. Additionally, we will present case studies from two domains, namely, agribusiness and forestry, where we demonstrate the efficacy of GPT-3 language models in solving complex business processes. 

4. Conclusion and Future Directions  
Finally, we summarize our findings and suggest directions for further research.
