# 2. Basic Concepts
Before we get into more technical details, it's important to understand some fundamental principles behind query optimization. Let's go over these basics first:
## Execution Plan
The execution plan shows how SQL Server has processed the query request. Each node represents one operation performed by SQL Server during query processing. The execution plan includes information about which operations are being performed, how many times they are occurring, and how long they take to execute. You can obtain the execution plan for a particular query by enabling Showplan Statistics in Management Studio or running the following command in SSMS:
```sql
SET SHOWPLAN_XML ON;
SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE column = 'value';
GO
SET SHOWPLAN_XML OFF;
```
This will show the XML output containing the execution plan. In general, you want to focus on nodes with high cost - those that represent the longest-running operations. Sometimes multiple nodes may appear to be contributing to high costs, but if you drill down into the individual nodes, you'll find out why exactly they are taking so long.
## Index Stats
Index statistics track various aspects of an index's performance. They include its size, fragmentation, scan activity, and physical I/O read and write activity. Keeping track of these stats allows you to identify indexes that could benefit from tuning or even avoid entirely if there is no need for that specific index.
## Cardinality Estimation
Cardinality estimation estimates the number of rows that will be returned by a query. When creating an index, SQL Server needs to estimate the total number of possible records that satisfy the search criteria before filtering out duplicates. By doing this, SQL Server can select the appropriate access method based on the estimated number of matching rows, thus improving query performance. However, sometimes cardinalities can also be underestimated, leading to unnecessary table scans or incorrect results being retrieved. Therefore, it's crucial to monitor and continuously refine the accuracy of the estimated cardinalities by running the STATISTICS PROGRAM command regularly.
## Join Order Optimization
Join order optimization refers to determining the sequence of tables used in a join operation to minimize the amount of data transferred between tables. There are several methods available for joining tables in SQL Server including nested loops, merge joins, hash joins, and index seek operations. While traditional methods like nested loop join can be very fast, newer methods like merge join offer significant benefits especially when dealing with large datasets. To optimize join orders, you can use various tools such as Query Performance Analyzer (QPA) in Management Studio or DTA in SQL Server Data Tools to compare the effectiveness of different join algorithms. Alternatively, you can modify the JOIN hint in your queries to specify the preferred algorithm(s).
## Query Caching
Query caching is a technique where frequently run queries are cached in memory on the server. This way, subsequent requests for the same query can be answered much faster by retrieving the result from cache instead of executing the query again. However, this technique can lead to outdated results if the underlying data changes after the initial caching. Therefore, it's important to keep the expiration date of the query caches up-to-date and to evict entries from the cache periodically to prevent unintended consequences.
# 3. Slow Running Queries Analysis
Let's start our analysis with the simplest type of problem: slow running queries. For this task, we will use Extended Events (XEvents) in SQL Server to capture and analyze query execution events. XEvents provides a lightweight and flexible event tracing infrastructure that lets us collect a wide range of performance metrics without relying on expensive third-party tools. We can use built-in XEvent sessions provided by SQL Server to capture detailed query profiling data. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Enable SQL Server XEvents through SQL Server Configuration Manager or by running the following commands in SSMS:
   ```sql
   ALTER EVENT SESSION [query_thread] ON SERVER
       STATE = START;
   
   ALTER EVENT SESSION [system_health] ON SERVER
       STATE = START;
   GO
   ```
   
2. Run the problematic query(ies) repeatedly until you observe that the duration of each query exceeds 1 second. This indicates that the query is not performing efficiently and needs to be optimized.
    
3. Once you've identified the problematic query, right click on the corresponding row in Object Explorer > Tasks > View Event Session Data...

4. Expand the System Health > query_thread > ExecStats node and double-click on the "Show All" link next to the target query. You should see a list of all relevant query profiling events collected during that particular query execution. 

5. Look for values greater than 100 ms in the "Duration" column to identify the slowest parts of the query execution.

6. Click on each value to view additional details about the execution, including the actual statement text and parameters used by the query. Use this information to pinpoint areas of optimization.

7. If needed, use the Profiler Trace and Statistics tool to further diagnose the cause of the slowdown and identify any correlations between issues across multiple queries.

Once you've analyzed the root causes of slow queries, it's time to apply optimizations to address the problems. Some common ways to optimize queries are outlined below:
## Index Selection & Usage
One of the most common reasons for slow query performance is poor index selection or management. Indexes are critical for ensuring optimal query performance because they allow SQL Server to quickly locate the required rows. However, too many indexes can slow down query execution and waste disk space. To manage indexes effectively, you should:

1. Identify unused indexes and drop them. Removing unused indexes reduces overhead and improves query performance.
 
2. Rebuild indexes if they have become fragmented, meaning they do not contain enough free space for storing new rows. Fragmentation can arise if indexes are modified often or if updates or deletions are frequent compared to inserts.
 
3. Monitor index utilization to detect any hotspots that may require optimization. For example, if certain columns are queried together, create an index on both columns rather than separately.

## Table and Query Design
Sometimes the issue might be caused by a badly designed table or by excessive querying of large tables. Tables that are too large or have unnecessary columns can significantly impact query performance. Common improvements to table design include:

1. Limit the number of columns in a table. SQL Server stores data in columns, so having too many columns consumes more storage and requires more CPU cycles to process. Select only the necessary columns to save space and improve query performance.
 
2. Consider partitioning large tables to speed up data retrieval. Partitioning divides a large table into smaller logical units called partitions, making it easier to retrieve data from just the necessary partitions. Splitting a single table into separate partitions can also improve insert and update performance. However, it's crucial to monitor the health of partitions to ensure that they remain healthy and growing properly.

To optimize queries, consider using Query Store to record historical query statistics and use Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) to analyze query runtime behavior at different points in time. QPAs and DMVs can provide insights into what the user is doing, where the resources are being consumed, and whether there are any performance bottlenecks. By analyzing the query execution plans and identifying slow running or complex queries, you can identify opportunities for optimization and suggest techniques accordingly.
