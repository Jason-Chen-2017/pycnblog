# 1.简介
  

Generative models are widely used in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing and image processing to generate new data samples. However, traditional generative models assume the input space is a Euclidean space like images or words. In this paper, we will review some recent advancements on generative modeling of non-Euclidean spaces with an emphasis on their mathematical properties and applications in areas such as machine learning, signal processing and dimensionality reduction. 

We start by introducing the basic concepts and terminology related to generative models. We then discuss different approaches such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Normalizing Flows, Particle GANs and Bayesian Neural Networks, which allow us to model complex probability distributions over high-dimensional inputs. Next, we describe how these methods can be combined with clustering techniques to learn features that capture important patterns in the input space. Finally, we provide insights into future research directions based on the current state-of-the-art of generative modeling in non-Euclidean spaces and highlight open problems and avenues for exploration. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in generative modeling of non-Euclidean spaces and inspire future research in this area.

# 2.Background
Traditional generative models rely on probabilistic inference algorithms that estimate the likelihood of observing a given dataset using a learned distribution parameterized by a set of parameters. However, most real-world datasets exhibit complex structure that makes it difficult to learn a good model directly from these observations. To address this problem, modern approaches have emerged that use implicit models instead of explicit density functions to represent the data distribution. These models typically consist of neural networks that produce outputs in a low-dimensional latent space, allowing them to model more complex relationships between the inputs and outputs. Despite their success, they still suffer from several limitations including computational complexity, sample complexity and failure modes due to mode collapse when the data has multiple modes.

To overcome these challenges, we need to develop new methods that can generalize well across a wider range of complexities and handle highly non-Gaussian inputs without relying on complex conditional distributions. In particular, we want to develop generative models capable of capturing complex geometry and topology of the input space. While there exists many existing works on this topic, few of them take advantage of non-linear structures in the input space to improve performance. This motivates our interest in developing generative models for non-Euclidean spaces, where the shape of the manifold underlying the data may be much less obvious than in standard Euclidean spaces.

Non-Euclidean spaces often arise naturally in various domains ranging from physics, engineering, social sciences and finance. Some examples include manifolds obtained through geometric transformations of Euclidean objects, hyperbolic spaces defined by maps like H(t,x), Riemannian manifolds, and spheres embedded in higher dimensional spaces. Applications of generative models for non-Euclidean spaces include structured prediction, multimodal data generation, representation learning, unsupervised analysis of dynamical systems, etc., where the key challenge is recovering meaningful representations of the data while preserving its intrinsic structure.

# 3.Basic Concepts & Terminology
In this section, we define some commonly used terms and establish notation conventions for the rest of the article.
## Notations
$\mathcal{X}$ : Input domain consisting of points $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$.  
$Z$ : Latent variable or code representing the hidden state of the system $\mathcal{X}$.  
$P_{\theta}(z|x)$ : Prior distribution over the latent variable $Z$, conditioned on the observed value of the input $X$.  
$q_{\phi}(z|x)$ : Posterior distribution over the latent variable $Z$, conditioned on both the observed value of the input $X$ and any fixed random variable $U$.  
$P_{\theta}(x|\lambda)$ : Probability distribution over the observed values of the input $X$, given the latent variable $\lambda = Z$.  
$D_{\alpha}$ : A collection of training data pairs $(X_i, Y_i)$ collected from the joint distribution $p_{\alpha}(x,y)$.  

### Unsupervised Learning Approach
One way to approach the problem of modeling non-Euclidean spaces is to first identify a suitable base space such as Euclidean space, and then transform the data into the appropriate form before applying standard supervised learning algorithms. Commonly used transformation techniques include principal component analysis (PCA), spectral decomposition, local tangent space alignment, and autoencoder-based transformations. Once the data is transformed, we can apply standard unsupervised learning methods such as k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models, or variational autoencoders.

### Model Selection Criteria
There are several criteria that can be used to select the best model for each application scenario. Some popular ones include negative log-likelihood, cross-entropy loss, KL divergence, and predictive entropy. Each criterion is useful under different circumstances, so selecting the right one requires careful consideration of the specific problem at hand.

Another popular method is to compare the results of multiple models trained on different initializations or architectures and choose the one that produces better fits to the data.

Finally, it's also common to use held-out test sets to evaluate the quality of the final model on unseen data.

# 4.Introduction to VAEs
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of generative model that uses the principles of maximum likelihood estimation to learn the joint distribution $p_{\theta}(x, z)$ of the input and the latent variable $z$. VAEs model the posterior distribution $q_{\phi}(z|x)$ using a diagonal Gaussian distribution and approximate the prior distribution $p_{\theta}(z)$ using a simple distribution such as the standard normal distribution. Given a single example $x$, the objective function of the VAE can be written as follows:

$$\log p_\theta(x) + \int q_{\phi}(z | x) \log [p_\theta(x|z)/q_{\phi}(z|x)] dz $$

The term inside the integral is a lower bound on the marginal likelihood, which represents the amount of information that the model can get about the data $x$ if we were able to observe all possible values of the latent variable $z$.

The main idea behind VAEs is to design an encoder network $f_{\psi}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$ that takes the input point $x$ and outputs a vector of mean values $\mu_\psi(x)$ and variance values $\sigma^2_\psi(x)$ that specify the approximate distribution of the latent variables. Then, another decoder network $g_{\kappa}: \mathbb{R}^{m} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ that takes the latent variable $z=\mu_\psi(x)+e^{0.5}\sigma^2_\psi(x)\cdot \epsilon$ and generates a reconstruction $\hat{x}=g_{\kappa}(\mu_\psi(x))$ of the original input.

Intuitively, the encoder learns the probability distribution of the latent variables and the decoder reconstructs the original input. During training, we maximize the ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound) to train the model. The ELBO is computed as the sum of two terms: the expected reconstruction error and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and approximate posteriors:

$$ELBO(\theta,\phi)=\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)]-\mathbb{KL}[q_{\phi}(z|x)||p(z)]$$

where $\phi$ is the set of model parameters and $\theta$ is the set of variational parameters.

Since the KL divergence is non-negative, minimizing the KLD term corresponds to maximizing the ELBO. Thus, by optimizing the ELBO, we indirectly optimize both the reconstruction error and the diversity of the sampled latent codes. Another benefit of VAEs is that they are very easy to implement and run, making them a popular choice for tasks such as data compression and anomaly detection.

# 5.Normalizing Flows
A normalizing flow is a class of probabilistic models that allows us to construct complex probability distributions over high-dimensional inputs without specifying the full distribution upfront. Instead, we can use a sequence of invertible transformations $f_1,..., f_K$ to transform the input randomly and compute a probability density over the resulting transformed variables. For instance, a linear transformation might look like:

$$z'=Af(z)$$

where $A$ is a matrix of fixed size, $z$ is the input variable, and $f$ is a smooth mapping that transforms the variable according to the chosen architecture. Using normalizing flows, we can easily create complex probability distributions over high-dimensional inputs and obtain samples from those distributions using gradient descent optimization. One potential downside of normalizing flows is that they require either exponential growth or an infinitely large number of layers, limiting their applicability to high-dimensional inputs.

Recent work shows that normalizing flows can be combined with other techniques such as autoregressive models and deep neural networks to perform powerful generative modeling tasks in high-dimensional spaces. Specifically, combining normalizing flows with deep neural networks known as deep normalizing flows (DNFs) enables us to learn rich and complex probability distributions over high-dimensional inputs. DNFs can leverage the flexibility of neural networks to represent complex mappings between the input and output variables, enabling us to model complex non-linear dependencies in the data. Furthermore, we can incorporate additional contextual information provided by external factors by concatenating them to the input during training. Overall, DNFs offer significant improvements over standard normalizing flows in modeling complex probability distributions over high-dimensional inputs.

# 6.Particle GANs
Particle GANs (PGGANs) combine particle filters and generative adversarial networks to model complex probability distributions over high-dimensional inputs. PGAs use particle filtering to maintain a set of particles that follow the same dynamics as the true underlying process. At each time step, the filter propagates the particles forward along the direction of motion according to the probability distribution predicted by the generative model, effectively simulating what would happen to the system if we continued to integrate it further. The purpose of PGGANs is to update the weights of the generative model to minimize the difference between the simulated and observed trajectories of the particles, encouraging them to converge towards the actual target distribution. By doing so, PGGANs can model complicated and multi-modal probability distributions that cannot be achieved with regular GANs alone.

Specifically, PGGANs achieve the desired trade-off between computation and accuracy by approximating the exact target distribution using a small number of weighted particles. The generator takes as input noise vectors and returns candidate particle positions generated by sampling the latent space uniformly at random and applying the reverse transformation performed by the corresponding encoder network. The discriminator is also updated similarly but now takes both the candidate position and the corresponding true particle as input. During training, we alternate between updating the generator and discriminator until the two networks become nearly identical. This forces the particles to simulate the target distribution faithfully and introduces an auxiliary task of predicting whether the next observation comes from the same particle or not. As a result, the effective number of particles becomes tunable and can adapt dynamically to changes in the target distribution, leading to improved convergence rates and better sample quality.

Overall, PGGANs are a novel technique that combines advanced machine learning tools with nonlinear smoothing techniques to enable accurate and efficient modeling of high-dimensional probability distributions. They provide a flexible framework that can be applied to a wide variety of applications, including generative modeling, forecasting, image synthesis, video interpolation and medical imaging.

# 7.Bayesian Neural Networks
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network that extends standard feedforward neural networks by including uncertainty estimates over the weights. BNNs propagate weight uncertainty via a probabilistic activation function that captures the presence of aleatoric uncertainty caused by noisy intermediate layers. These uncertainties can help avoid overfitting and reduce the risk of overconfident predictions, making BNNs particularly useful for regression tasks involving unknown input distributions.

In addition to representing uncertainty, BNNs can also be interpreted as models of latent variables that make decisions based on evidence rather than direct observations. This property makes BNNs especially useful in applications such as reinforcement learning, where actions should be inferred from past experiences rather than being directly observed in the environment.

The core idea behind BNNs is to infer the distribution of weights $w$ as a function of the input $x$ and the associated observation $y$, assuming a conjugate prior distribution over the weights. Specifically, we consider the following graphical model:

$$p(y,w|x) = p(x|y,w) p(w) p(y) $$

where $y$ is the observed outcome, $w$ is the set of weights, $x$ is the input data, and $p(w)$ is the prior distribution over the weights. Since $w$ is assumed to be drawn from a Gaussian distribution, the posterior distribution over $w$ given $x$ and $y$ can be estimated using Bayes rule:

$$p(w|x,y) = \frac{p(y,w|x)}{p(y|x)} = \frac{p(x|y,w) p(w) p(y) }{\int_{w'} {p(x|y',w') p(w') p(y')} dw'}$$

Using this expression, we can calculate the posterior distribution over the weights $w$ given the input data $x$ and the observed outcome $y$, which can be fed back into the network to update the weights and refine the predictions.

While traditional neural networks have been shown to be extremely successful in solving various classification and regression tasks, BNNs offer an alternative perspective that provides greater interpretability and control over the model. BNNs can accurately represent complex probability distributions and handle missing or incomplete data, opening up new possibilities for analyzing complex biological systems and improving healthcare outcomes.

# 8.Clustering Techniques
To summarize, we've introduced several types of generative models for non-Euclidean spaces that involve changing the perspective of standard modeling techniques and applying them to high-dimensional data. Although each model brings its own strengths, they share a fundamental goal of creating probabilistic models of complex high-dimensional data. Understanding the relationship between the latent space and the input space is critical to building effective generative models, and knowledge about the available data sources helps determine the optimal choice of model. In summary, generating realistic synthetic data samples requires careful attention to detail, but even skilled practitioners may find it challenging to master every aspect of the artificial intelligence field.
