Code review is a critical and time-consuming activity that requires knowledge of software development principles, best practices, coding styles, testing techniques, and other areas related to the creation of high-quality code. The goal of code review is to improve overall quality by identifying defects, inefficiencies, or security vulnerabilities early in the development process, before they become bugs, issues, or problems in production. It also provides an opportunity for team members to share their expertise with others and learn from each other's experience.

However, not all teams are willing to invest the required effort into performing regular code reviews or even have them as part of their development workflow. In some organizations, it may be considered counterproductive due to lack of resources or reputational value. However, it’s essential to ensure that any change submitted to production is thoroughly reviewed and tested by experts who have extensive knowledge in various fields such as architecture design, performance optimization, security analysis, etc., making sure that your changes do not introduce new errors, crashes, or vulnerabilities. Therefore, effective code reviews can save both money and headaches for your organization.

In this article, I will discuss why you should follow best practices when conducting code reviews, what constitutes good practice, how to approach reviewing code efficiently, and what tools and platforms exist for doing so. Finally, we will explore ways to convince management to prioritize code reviews and establish proper processes and procedures within the company to support the efficient execution of code reviews. By following these best practices, you can greatly reduce the number of defects introduced into your codebase while improving overall quality and productivity at every stage of the development lifecycle. 

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the specific details of code review best practices, let's first go over some basic concepts and terminology used in code review. These terms will help us better understand what it means to follow best practices when conducting code reviews.

2.1 Definition: A code review is an evaluation of computer source code by a peer programmer, known as a reviewer, to detect potential errors, problematic patterns, and suspicious constructs. 

2.2 Purpose: To identify and address potential issues, including errors, complexity, security flaws, maintainability, and style violations, throughout the development cycle.

2.3 Process: 
a) Planning Phase: Before starting a code review, the developer creates a plan covering the main points of the review and the necessary steps involved, as well as assigning the appropriate reviewers based on their skills and expertise.

b) Reviewing Phase: Each assigned reviewer reviews the code provided by the developer along with comments or suggestions. They analyze the code line by line and provide feedback on different aspects of its functionality, reliability, efficiency, and readability. This phase includes giving constructive feedback to improve code quality and suggest improvements where needed.

c) Testing Phase: After completing the initial review, the developers run automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, system tests, etc.) to verify the correctness and robustness of the code. If any issue is found during the testing phase, the developer needs to submit another round of review with updated fixes or modifications. Once the code passes all test cases, it becomes ready for deployment.

2.4 Important Terms:

2.4.1 Author: The person who originally wrote the code being reviewed, often referred to as "the author."

2.4.2 Comment: An explanation given by someone about the code in context, typically using natural language. Comments are added to clarify difficult sections of code or explain complex algorithms or design decisions.

2.4.3 Conclusion: The final decision reached after analyzing all feedback received during the review.

2.4.4 Context: Information relevant to understanding the purpose and content of a piece of code, such as related technical information, business requirements, and project goals.

2.4.5 Defect: An error or problem discovered in the code that must be fixed before moving forward with further development.

2.4.6 Feedback: Any communication between a contributor and a reviewer regarding the work undertaken or results obtained through the code review process. There are two types of feedback: positive and negative.

2.4.7 Improvement: A proposed improvement to existing code, such as fixing syntax errors, optimizing loops or functions, reducing duplication of code, and implementing new features.

2.4.8 Issue: A flag raised against code that indicates that there is something wrong with it, such as formatting or logical errors. Issues need to be addressed before moving forward with further development.

2.4.9 Peer Reviewer: Another member of the same team who has expertise in the area being reviewed, but is not directly responsible for the completion of the task.

2.4.10 Refactoring: A technique used to simplify and optimize code without changing its external behavior. Refactors include renaming variables, removing unused code, adding documentation, and organizing files.

2.4.11 Requirement: Any statement made by stakeholders describing a requirement, bug, or feature for the project. Requirements usually come in many forms, such as functional specifications, user stories, use cases, acceptance criteria, and diagrams. 

2.4.12 Safety: Precautions taken to prevent accidental harm or damage caused by unsafe programming practices, such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, race conditions, and deadlocks.

2.4.13 Security Vulnerability: A weakness or flaw present in a program that allows attackers to access sensitive data, compromise network communications, or manipulate application state.

2.4.14 Style Guideline: A set of rules that define a standardized way of writing code, such as naming conventions, indentation standards, commenting formats, and file structure.

2.4.15 Test Case: A scenario that verifies the expected behavior of a particular component or module, designed to reveal whether or not a change introduces a regression, breaking change, or other unintended side effects.

2.4.16 Unit Test: A small section of code that validates a single function or method, checking inputs, outputs, and edge cases to catch potential bugs before merging the code into the repository.


Now that we've covered some basics, let's move on to discuss the importance of following code review best practices.

# 3. Why You Should Follow Code Review Best Practices

Here are five reasons why you should follow code review best practices:

1. **Improve Quality**: Code reviews focus on identifying and resolving defects, which leads to more reliable and efficient software releases. Without careful attention to detail and sound judgement, however, code written by experienced developers can sometimes produce code that suffers from low-quality issues like poor variable names, unnecessary repetition, and inefficient algorithms. By getting feedback from peers on these issues, you can create more consistent and cohesive codebases that are easier to debug, maintain, and modify later on.

2. **Reduce Risk**: Continuous code review helps to identify risky parts of the code that could cause errors, crashes, or security breaches. While traditional testing methods cannot guarantee that every possible input is tested, code reviews can check for common mistakes, typos, or subtle logic errors that might have gone unnoticed otherwise. Furthermore, having experts who have multiple years of hands-on industry experience can identify and fix errors earlier than if only one individual was working full-time on the code base.

3. **Save Money & Time**: Regular code reviews allow for the identification and elimination of potential bugs before they reach the end users. With a smaller codebase, it's cheaper and faster to make incremental updates rather than risk large-scale refactors. Similarly, since most companies don't have dedicated QA staff, code reviews can act as a crucial bridge between development and operations departments, allowing engineers to get real-time feedback and avoid expensive delays caused by incorrect deployments.

4. **Conduct Better Decisions**: When code is evaluated by experts, they gain valuable insights into the inner workings of the code, leading to better decisions on future refactorings, enhancements, and additions. By communicating with colleagues and taking into account the opinions of more experienced developers, you can make more accurate and informed trade-offs between options, resulting in more predictable and reliable systems.

5. **Stay On Top of Things**: People spend countless hours developing software. As long as a codebase remains constantly evolving, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies, developments, and advancements. Code reviews serve as a reminder that fresh ideas and approaches need to be incorporated into the code, keeping it fresh and improving its overall quality. 

By following best practices when conducting code reviews, you'll significantly lower the chance of introducing defects into your codebase, improve quality and consistency, save time and cost, and enable better collaboration across the entire organization.
