Brain is the largest nervous system in our body. It consists of billions of neurons that communicate with each other via synapses. The activity of these neurons gives rise to complex movements such as walking, speaking, blinking, grooming, or shaking hands. In this article we will see how brain works from a visual and interactive approach using simplified models, equations and diagrams. 

In order to understand brain function, disease, illness and rehabilitation it is essential to have an understanding of its basic principles. Understanding the basic mechanisms of the brain helps us to better diagnose conditions, prevent diseases and treat them effectively. With neuroscience for everyone comes easy-to-understand videos, interactive simulations, and step-by-step explanations. By the end of this article you will be able to explore more about brain by yourself, with no limitations on age, gender, or medical condition.

# 2.科普背景介绍
The human brain is a large network of interconnected neurons that are responsible for decision making, memory, emotional response, motor control, language comprehension, reasoning, etc. Each neuron receives electrical impulses from the surrounding neurons through its axons. The signal travels through dendrites along the length of the neuron's cell body, where it processes the information before sending output signals to downstream neurons. This communication takes place between different areas of the cerebral cortex: frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, insula, and cerebellum. All these regions work together to process sensory input, store memories, and make decisions. Based on the study of the structure and function of the brain, various disorders can arise like Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, etc. Some of the common symptoms of these diseases include headaches, seizures, tremor, paralysis, convulsions, dizziness, confusion, slow breathing, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, hallucinations, fatigue, weakness, poor concentration, muscle weakness, etc.

To develop effective therapies to manage these diseases, scientists have come up with various techniques like medication administration, exercise therapy, psychological therapy, surgery, and genetic modifications. But all these methods require specialized training and expertise which could not be easily accessible to every person who wants to live a healthy life. To overcome this challenge, technology has been introduced to help us access the scientific knowledge of the brain. There are several devices available that provide real time visualization of the behavior of the brain in action. These devices can show us what parts of the brain are activated at any given moment, allowing us to identify specific pathways and regulate their activities based on our needs.

For example, MEG (magnetoencephalography) devices allow us to visualize high frequency signals in the brain called magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), which represents changes in the magnetic field generated by the activity of the magnet within the brain. When we experience a task that requires a particular part of the brain to perform efficiently, we can use this device to monitor the activity in that region. Similarly, functional MRI (fMRI) scans take pictures of the entire brain, but instead of showing only the surface, they show all the underlying structures. Using advanced image processing algorithms, we can analyze the pattern of gray matter in these images and identify the parts that are most active during a specific task.

Another important application area of neuroscience involves learning. Researchers have found many ways to improve our ability to learn new skills, like visuospatial skills, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, executive function, cognitive abilities, problem-solving abilities, reading fluency, vocabulary building, math skills, and spatial awareness. One way to do this is to train ourselves physically. We need to focus on different tasks while wearing different stimuli, using alternating rest periods to reduce stress, taking breaks when needed, and minimizing physical contact with others. This helps us to develop good posture, balance, coordination, and attention span. Another technique is to use multimodal feedback systems like EEG (electroencephalography) recordings, fMRI scans, MEG imaging, or eye tracking technologies. By analyzing these data, researchers can figure out which regions of the brain are involved in generating the desired behavior and teach those regions to behave similarly.

Finally, neuroscientists also play a significant role in understanding the mechanism behind some diseases and even treating them successfully. For instance, dopamine (DA) is released in the prefrontal cortex during meditative states, causing sleepiness and insomnia. Scientists discovered that DA is mainly released due to neural circuits associated with reward learning. They hypothesized that increasing the release of DA may lead to improved mental health and reduced risk of developing diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and stroke. They developed drugs like sertraline (Felbinac), metformin (Glucophage), or NMDA (Nitroprusside) to increase DA levels in the brain, leading to improvements in mood and cognition. Other examples of successful treatment outcomes include cancer patients who were treated with targeted therapy, athletes who were trained with increased strength and agility, and people living with Huntington’s disease who benefited greatly from acupuncture therapy. Despite the numerous benefits and successes achieved through neuroscientific research, there are still many challenges and issues left unaddressed.
