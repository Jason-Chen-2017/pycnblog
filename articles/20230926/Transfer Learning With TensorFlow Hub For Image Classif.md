# 1.简介
  

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that enables to learn from a pre-trained model and fine-tune it for our specific use case or task. In this tutorial, we will see how to implement transfer learning with TensorFlow Hub for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We will also explain what is transfer learning and how does it work? What are the benefits of using transfer learning in deep neural networks? How can you apply transfer learning for your own use cases?

2. 框架概述
The idea behind transfer learning is to leverage an existing trained deep neural network (DNN) and adapt it to solve new tasks by partially freezing its layers while training some of them. The main advantages of using transfer learning in DNNs include faster convergence time, lower computation cost, reduced overfitting risk and better generalization performance. 

In this tutorial, we will be implementing transfer learning using TensorFlow Hub API, which provides a set of reusable SavedModels called tfhub modules that can be easily integrated into any TensorFlow code base. Using these modules, we will train a simple convolutional neural network on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then use it as a feature extractor for another smaller model, such as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and finally classify the images using a softmax classifier. 

3. 技术要求
To follow along with this tutorial, please make sure you have the following:
* An understanding of deep neural networks (CNNs). If not, I recommend checking out Deep Learning with Python book by <NAME>.
* A basic knowledge of Tensorflow concepts like variables, tensors, models, sessions etc., would help.
* Basic programming skills including Python and some familiarity with NumPy library are necessary.

4. 假设条件
We assume that you are familiar with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and know how they work. In particular, we assume that you understand how convolutional filters slide across input images, resulting in activation maps that capture features at different spatial scales. You should also be familiar with the idea of pooling layers, which reduce the dimensionality of feature maps while retaining their most important information. Finally, you need to be comfortable writing Python code and knowing about various libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Hub. 

5. 目标和任务
Our goal is to demonstrate how transfer learning works with TensorFlow Hub and build a small but powerful image classifier using CNNs. Specifically, we will perform the following steps:
* Step 1: Understand transfer learning basics.
* Step 2: Download and prepare the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* Step 3: Define the architecture of our small CNN classifier.
* Step 4: Train our CNN classifier on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* Step 5: Fine-tune the top few layers of the CNN using the output layer of the previous CNN as inputs.
* Step 6: Evaluate the final model accuracy on the test data.
* Step 7: Use the trained model for inference on new images.
In each step, we will provide details on the theory and implementation, as well as the results and discussion sections to answer your questions and further guide you towards making improvements. Let's get started!

6. 相关术语与概念
Before we begin, let’s briefly introduce some relevant terms and concepts that we will encounter throughout this tutorial:

**Pre-trained models**: These are the already trained deep neural networks that have been extensively trained on large datasets such as ImageNet and COCO. Pre-trained models can significantly improve the accuracy of deep neural networks when applied to similar problem domains due to the fact that they already have learned valuable features and patterns that can be used directly without requiring extensive training. Examples of popular pre-trained models include VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet, InceptionV3, Xception, NASNet, etc. TensorFlow Hub also hosts several pre-trained models for computer vision, natural language processing, audio and more.

**Fine-tuning**: This is the process of adapting a pre-trained model to our specific use case or task by partially freezing its layers while training others. Fine-tuning improves the accuracy of the final model by leveraging the knowledge gained during the initial stages of training. By updating only the last few layers of the model, we preserve the weights learned through the early stages of training and adapt them to our specific task. It is crucial to ensure that the fine-tuned model has good performance before deploying it in production.

**Dataset**: A collection of labeled examples used for training, validation, and testing purposes. Images, videos, text documents, or other types of data are commonly used as datasets. Popular datasets include MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, ImageNet, COCO, etc.

**Transfer Learning Workflow:** Here’s the overall workflow for performing transfer learning with TensorFlow Hub:

1. Select a pre-trained model.
2. Freeze all the layers except for the last few ones.
3. Add a custom head to the model that fits our needs.
4. Train the entire model end-to-end using a small amount of labeled data.
5. Unfreeze the remaining layers and adjust the learning rate if needed.
6. Continue training the model until satisfactory performance is achieved.

Let’s dive deeper into each individual step of the above mentioned workflow.
