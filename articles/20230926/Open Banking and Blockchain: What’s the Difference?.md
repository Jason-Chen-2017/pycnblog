# 1.简介
  

Open banking and blockchain are both promising technologies that aim to transform financial services by digitizing and automating many aspects of financial transactions. Both platforms promise substantial benefits for consumers and merchants alike but they have some differences in terms of their architecture designs, technical specifications, security mechanisms, governance structures, and application scenarios. In this article, we will discuss what is meant by open banking and blockchain in more detail and highlight key differences between these two technologies. We will also discuss how these two technologies can complement each other effectively and provide a better approach towards building an efficient and secure global financial ecosystem.

# 2.基本概念、术语及定义
## 2.1.什么是银行业务
Banking business refers to all financial activities related to managing and supporting individual or institutional clients' accounts including savings, checking, credit cards, mortgages, loans, investments etc., including dealing with cash deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and fees associated with such activities.

## 2.2.什么是“开放式”银行
An open-banking platform allows customers to access multiple financial products and services without having to go through traditional banks. For example, a consumer can make payments online using mobile money wallet applications like MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money or Vodacom Mobile Cash.

## 2.3.什么是区块链
Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that records transactions made in various cryptocurrencies and other blockchains. It provides immutability, transparency, traceability, and trustlessness features. Blockchain systems are used to establish immutable ledgers where data is shared among different parties without any intermediaries. They serve as digital certificates, electronic contracts, and auditable records.

## 2.4.什么是联盟网络(区块链联盟)
A consortium network involves multiple organizations working together to develop blockchain infrastructure solutions based on common standards. Each organization contributes resources, expertise, and IP rights to create a unified system which brings about greater scalability, reliability, and performance than could be achieved individually. Consortium networks can help maintain data integrity and reduce potential risks associated with single-party control over data.

## 3.1.数字货币和区块链的区别
In simple terms, Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of digital currency and blockchain respectively. Digital currencies rely on blockchain technology to enable secure transfer of value while maintaining a public record of transaction history. On the other hand, blockchain is a decentralized database that stores transactions in chronological order without central authority. The key difference between the two lies in their underlying architecture. 

Digital currencies use proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms, whereas blockchain uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS). PoW requires computing power, energy, and time investment by miners, who compete to add new blocks into the chain. This results in higher transaction speed, but it also creates a bottleneck effect whereby a small group of people controls the network leading to high energy consumption and low throughput rates. To mitigate this issue, PoS relies on stakeholders agreeing to act as validators or "miners", who contribute staked tokens in exchange for voting rights. Validators have the ability to generate new blocks at a faster rate and thus boost the overall transaction capacity of the network. However, PoS does not offer instantaneous confirmation of transactions and requires a certain level of commitment from stakeholders before being granted validator status. These features ensure that blockchain has unique advantages over digital currencies when it comes to transacting and storing value.

## 3.2.如何运用区块链进行存款
When creating an account on a blockchain-based finance platform, one needs to select an available address and deposit funds into it. Once the deposit is completed, the account balance becomes visible to everyone connected to the network. Users can then start making transactions through the platform by sending fund transfer requests to another user's registered address. The sender must include enough crypto assets to cover the amount being transferred along with additional information such as recipient name, email address, phone number, transaction reference, etc. When the recipient confirms receiving the payment, he/she gets notified via SMS or Email.

In addition to basic account management functionalities, blockchain-based finance platforms usually come with advanced features like identity verification, customer support chatbot, reporting tools, and compliance modules. Some platforms even allow third-party developers to build custom applications tailored to specific industry verticals such as fintech, insurance, and supply-chain management.

## 3.3.联盟网络的应用场景
One major advantage of using a consortium network over a standalone solution is its flexibility and scalability. With a consortium network, businesses can collaborate and share resources across various parts of the organization. Consortium networks can streamline processes and simplify procedures, ensuring efficiency and consistency throughout the entire enterprise. Additionally, consortium networks offer significant economic benefits since companies can leverage their collective experience and expertise to improve operations and deliver better outcomes. Here are some practical cases where consortium networks can be applied to enhance financial services:

1. Payment Processing Network - Fintech companies can work together to deploy blockchain-based payment processing solutions across the globe. This would enable them to process payments instantly and eliminate delays due to slow transaction times.
2. Supply Chain Management Network - The Truora ecosystem enables businesses to connect seamlessly with suppliers and partners in real-time. By leveraging consensus mechanisms and interoperability, businesses can automate complex logistics processes reducing costs and improving productivity.
3. Identity Verification Network - Banks and Financial Institutions can form consortia networks to verify customer identities using blockchain-enabled digital ID authentication techniques. This would significantly reduce risk and improve service levels.
