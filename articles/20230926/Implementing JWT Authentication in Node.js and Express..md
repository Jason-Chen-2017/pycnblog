# 1.简介
  

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are becoming increasingly popular as an authentication method for web applications. In this article, we will discuss how to implement JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication in a Node.js and Express.js application using the Passport.js library. We will also cover some of the important concepts such as encryption algorithms, tokens structure, token expiration, etc., and explain the basic steps involved in implementing JWT-based authentication. Finally, we will provide sample code implementation along with detailed explanations. This blog post is targeted at those who are interested in learning about JWT authentication or want to know how it works under the hood. It can be useful if you want to build robust, scalable, and secure authentication mechanisms into your Node.js and Express.js applications.

Before getting started with our discussion on JWT authentication in Node.js and Express.js apps, let’s first understand some terms that are commonly used in JWT terminology:

1. JSON Web Token (JWT): A compact and URL-safe format for representing claims between two parties. The payload contains information about the user, device, authorization scope, etc. It may contain information related to the authenticated entity, such as username, email address, roles, permissions, etc.
2. Claims: Information contained within a JWT payload which provides information about the subject of the token. There are three types of claims defined by the JWT specification:
    1. Registered Claims: These are standardized claims which have their own registered names and values.
    2. Public Claims: Anything that doesn't violate security or privacy concerns and can be shared publicly should be added here.
    3. Private Claims: Only specific services and APIs require private claims. They should not be exposed to untrusted clients.
3. Secret Key/Key Pair: A secret key used to encode and decode JWTs. When generating a new pair, each party uses different keys for signing and verification.
4. Algorithm: An algorithm used to generate the signature from the header and the payload. Currently, there are several cryptographic algorithms supported including HMAC SHA-256, RSA-SHA-256, ECDSA using P-256 curve, etc. Each algorithm has its pros and cons and choosing the appropriate one depends on various factors such as performance, memory usage, compatibility, ease of use, etc.
5. Signature: The result of applying the chosen algorithm over the encoded header and payload components. It is then signed with the secret key so that only the owner of the corresponding public key can verify the authenticity and integrity of the message without knowing the secret key.
6. Access Token: A short-lived token issued to access resources protected by JWT authentication mechanism. Once expired, users need to refresh the token to get new access. 
7. Refresh Token: A long-lived token issued to extend access expiry time. If a user loses his session, he needs to ask for a new access token using the refresh token instead of logging out and back in again. 

# 3.实现JWT身份验证机制的过程
Now, let's dive deeper into the details of JWT authentication in Node.js and Express.js apps using Passport.js library. Let us assume that we have already set up a Node.js and Express.js app and installed the required dependencies, such as passport.js, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, etc.

## 配置Passport.js策略
The first step towards implementing JWT authentication is configuring the Passport.js strategy. To do this, we need to create a separate file called `jwtStrategy.js` inside the `config` folder where we can define the authentication strategies for our Node.js and Express.js app. Here's what the content of the file would look like:

```javascript
const passport = require('passport');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;
const UserModel = require('../models/user');

module.exports = () => {
  passport.use(
    'login',
    new LocalStrategy({ usernameField: 'email' }, async (email, password, done) => {
      try {
        const user = await UserModel.findOne({ email });

        if (!user ||!bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) return done(null, false);

        done(null, user);
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
        done(null, false);
      }
    })
  );

  passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
    done(null, user._id);
  });

  passport.deserializeUser((_id, done) => {
    UserModel.findById(_id, (err, user) => {
      done(err, user);
    });
  });
};
```

In this code snippet, we have configured a local authentication strategy using Passport.js’ LocalStrategy class. This means that our server expects credentials (username and password) sent via HTTP POST requests. We call the `authenticate()` function on the route handler, passing in the `'login'` strategy name. Whenever the request is received, Passport.js checks the incoming credentials against the database and returns either a successful response or an error response. The `done` callback takes two arguments: `(error, user)` - the `error` argument indicates any errors during authentication, while `user` is the user object returned by the authentication attempt.

We have also implemented the serialization and deserialization methods for Passport.js to handle user sessions. Serialization converts a user object into a unique identifier that can be stored in a cookie or session store, while deserialization retrieves the user object from the same storage when needed.

## 创建JWT令牌
Next, let's move on to creating the JWT token after a successful login. Here's the updated version of the `/api/auth/login` endpoint that creates a JWT token:

```javascript
router.post('/login', authenticate('login'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email, password } = req.body;

    // Check if email exists in the database
    const user = await UserModel.findOne({ email }).select('+password');

    if (!user ||!bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid Email or Password.');
    }

    // Create JWT token and send it back to the client
    const accessToken = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
    const refreshToken = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: '7d' });

    res.status(200).send({ accessToken, refreshToken });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    res.status(401).send(error.message);
  }
});
```

In this code snippet, we retrieve the user data from the request body (`req.body`), check whether the email exists in the database, validate the provided password using Bcrypt’s comparison function. If both conditions pass, we create a JWT access token and a JWT refresh token using the `jwt.sign()` function. We specify the expiration date of these tokens using the `{expiresIn}` option, which specifies the duration until they expire in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years. For example, `{expiresIn: '1h'}` sets the expiration time to one hour, while `{expiresIn: '7d'}` sets it to seven days. After creating the tokens, we send them back to the client in the form of a JSON response with status code `200 OK`. Otherwise, we respond with an error message with status code `401 Unauthorized`.

Note that we have separated the creation of the JWT access and refresh tokens into two distinct calls to `jwt.sign()`. This allows us to issue separate tokens with different expirations, which helps keep our API more secure. Furthermore, we have specified different secrets for encoding and decoding the tokens, which further improves the security of our system.

## 保护路由
To protect routes using JWT authentication, we simply add a middleware called `authorize` that checks the validity of the JWT token before allowing the request to proceed. Here's an example of how we could protect the `/api/profile` endpoint using this approach:

```javascript
// Middleware for checking JWT auth token
const authorize = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers['authorization'];

  if (!token) return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded._id;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
};

// Protected profile endpoint
router.get('/profile', authorize, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await UserModel.findById(req.user);
    res.status(200).send(user);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    res.status(500).send(error.message);
  }
});
```

Here, we first extract the JWT token from the request headers using the `req.headers[]` syntax. Then, we use the `jwt.verify()` function to check the validity of the token and obtain the user ID from the payload. We store the user ID in the `req.user` property, and allow the request to continue through to the subsequent middleware or endpoint handlers. If the token is invalid, we respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status code. Note that we've assumed that the JWT tokens are being passed in the `Authorization` header in the following format:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

This makes it easy for clients to include the JWT token in their requests.

## 使用刷新令牌续订访问权限
While JWT access tokens typically expire after a certain period of time, refresh tokens remain valid indefinitely. With refresh tokens, a user can renew their access privileges without having to log in every time. Here's how we could enable this feature in our Node.js and Express.js app:

```javascript
// Endpoint for obtaining new access token
router.post('/refresh-token', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const refreshToken = req.body.refreshToken;

    if (!refreshToken) {
      throw new Error('Refresh token missing.');
    }

    const decoded = jwt.verify(refreshToken, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET);
    const userId = decoded._id;

    const accessToken = jwt.sign({ _id: userId }, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });

    res.status(200).send({ accessToken });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    res.status(401).send(error.message);
  }
});
```

In this code snippet, we first check whether the refresh token was included in the request body. If not, we throw an error. Otherwise, we use the `jwt.verify()` function to decode the token and obtain the user ID. Next, we reissue a new JWT access token using the newly obtained user ID and the same configuration options as before. Finally, we send the new access token back to the client with status code `200 OK`.
