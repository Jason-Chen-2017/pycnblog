# 1.简介
  

Rasa是一个开源机器学习框架，它可以用于构建聊天机器人的基础设施。本文档将展示如何使用Rasa来构建一个简单的聊天机器人，包括了从数据到模型的全流程。

Rasa项目由两部分组成: 

1) Rasa Open Source - Python库，可用于训练、运行和评估聊天机器人的模型。

2) Rasa Core - Rasa框架的核心组件，包含用于构建聊天机器人的NLU（自然语言理解）模型和 dialogue manager模型。 

在本文档中，我们将展示如何安装和设置Rasa并使用其功能来建立一个简单的聊天机器人。

# 2. Prerequisites
Rasa requires python version >=3.6 to be installed on your system. You can check it by running `python --version` command in the terminal or cmd prompt.

Make sure that you have pip package manager for python installed on your system. If not then refer to https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/.

After installing pip follow the below steps to install rasa and its dependencies (make sure you are inside a virtual environment if necessary):

```
pip install rasa[spacy]
```

This will download and install all required packages including spaCy which is used as our NLP library.


# 3. Data Collection & Preprocessing 
To build any chatbot, we need data first. We can collect our dataset from various sources such as social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc., websites with conversations about our product or service, webinars, surveys, etc. In this tutorial, I am going to use an example conversation from a movie review website called IMDB. Let’s head over to their website and find some reviews of “The Dark Knight”. Once we have selected a few movie reviews, let’s save them into a file named "data.csv". Now, let's create a new directory where we'll store our chatbot files and navigate to it using the terminal or cmd prompt.

We can now start building our chatbot project by creating a new bot using the following command:

```
rasa init
```

This creates a basic structure for our bot with two folders namely "actions" and "models", along with other files like config.yml, credentials.yml, domain.yml, etc. The actions folder contains our action code while models folder contains our intent and entity recognition model. It also generates another sub-folder called "nlu" which holds our training data.

Now, open up the nlu folder and add our collected data file named "data.csv". Our CSV file should contain four columns separated by comma. Each row of the CSV file represents one message sent by users to the server. These messages include both user input text and metadata such as date and time. However, since Rasa only needs plain text input for its NLU model, we need to preprocess the raw texts before feeding it into our NLU model. This preprocessing involves cleaning the text, tokenizing it, removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization depending on the choice of tokenizer. We can do this using NLTK library in Python. Here's the complete script for preprocessing the data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
import re

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # read csv file

ps = PorterStemmer() # initialize porter stemmer

def clean_text(text):
    text = re.sub('\W+','', str(text).lower()).strip() # remove non alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    tokens = text.split() # tokenize text
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords.words('english')] # remove stopwords
    tokens = [ps.stem(token) for token in tokens] # apply stemming
    return''.join(tokens) # join back tokens

df['cleaned'] = df['Message'].apply(clean_text) # clean text column and append cleaned column to dataframe

df.to_csv('preprocessed_data.csv', index=False) # write preprocessed data to new csv file
```

Once we run this script, it will produce a new CSV file containing cleaned versions of each message stored in a column called "cleaned". We can replace our original CSV file with this preprocessed CSV file to avoid doing this step everytime when we train our model.

Next, let's move onto designing our conversational flow. To understand what constitutes a good conversational flow, consider the different types of questions and answers a customer might ask. For instance, let’s say there is a FAQ section on our website that has several common queries regarding our product or services. How would you like me to answer these questions? 

Here are five possible ways of designing the conversational flow:

1) Greeting + FAQ Section + End Session: When the user opens the chatbot for the first time they receive a greeting message. They can then ask questions related to specific sections of the FAQ. After answering a question, the chatbot can provide more information or redirect them to other relevant FAQ articles or resources. Finally, once all the FAQ articles have been covered, the chatbot can end the session.

2) Product Introduction + Search Functionality + Reviews List + Question Answering Model: Once the user starts interacting with the chatbot, they may want to learn more about our product or explore our services. So, instead of giving out an exhaustive list of FAQ articles right away, the chatbot can display a brief introduction of our company and offer search functionality based on keywords entered by the user. Based on the search results, the chatbot can display a short description of each result followed by a link to view full reviews. The user can then select a particular movie to get a detailed response about the performance, quality, and content of the movie. Alternatively, the chatbot can directly answer a series of frequently asked questions via a Q&A module that provides multiple options to choose from.

3) Task Completion Assistant + Personalized Recommendations + Suggestion Box: Instead of just providing general information about movies, the chatbot can suggest personalized recommendations based on past interactions with the user. For instance, if the user frequently asks for ratings or comments after watching a particular movie, the chatbot can recommend similar movies with high ratings or content similarities. Additionally, the chatbot can suggest products or services related to the topic discussed between the user and our company. Therefore, by integrating recommendation systems into the chatbot, we can achieve greater engagement rates and increased satisfaction levels.

4) Customer Satisfaction Survey + Feedback Collector + Customizable Chatbot Skin: To ensure that the chatbot meets the expectations of our customers, we can set up regular customer feedback survey at the beginning of the chat session. During this survey, the user can rate the overall experience of the chatbot with regards to the speed, accuracy, naturalness, and usefulness. Based on the responses given by the user, the chatbot can tailor itself to better serve the user according to their preferences. Furthermore, if the user finds any errors or issues during the interaction with the chatbot, the chatbot can send feedback emails to our support team. By collecting feedback and analyzing patterns across different sessions, the chatbot developer can identify areas of improvement and make adjustments accordingly. Lastly, to further improve the look and feel of the chatbot, the developer can customize its skin based on the branding guidelines of our company.

5) Escalation Mechanism + Priority Support + Onboarding: If the chatbot encounters any technical difficulties or issues during the process of completing a task, the chatbot can escalate those cases to a human agent who specializes in handling those situations. The human agent can work closely with the development team to resolve any issues and provide assistance or guidance on how to proceed. Similarly, if the chatbot detects abuse or spamming behavior from a particular user group, it can automatically send a warning message to inform the user and temporarily block the offending user until they reach a certain threshold of violations. Depending on the severity level of the violation, the chatbot can either terminate the conversation or restrict access to certain features or functionalities. At the same time, the developer can develop a custom onboarding mechanism that walks the user through the basics of using the chatbot so that they become familiar with its features and functions. Overall, each type of conversational flow highlights different aspects of customer journeys and demands different capabilities and functionalities from the chatbot. Choosing the most suitable conversational flow depends largely on the needs of the business and market segment being targeted.
