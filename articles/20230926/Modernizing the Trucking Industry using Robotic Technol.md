The trucking industry has been facing growing challenges due to rising population and industrialization level in developing countries. The demand for reliable transportation services is outstripping supply, which creates a pressing need for efficient management of fleet operations. 

To meet this challenge, several technological advancements have emerged over recent years that have paved the way towards automated vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles, and advanced automation technologies such as autonomous driving systems. However, existing solutions still require specialized operators with extensive skills and knowledge on vehicle operation and safety protocols, while managing the entire fleet of vehicles can be challenging.

In response to these challenges, we propose RoverNet, an AI-powered mobile tactical network system. Our approach combines advanced machine learning techniques with modern software architectures to automate communication, decision making, and control tasks within the trucking fleets by enabling high-level intelligent operations through autonomous rovers equipped with sensors and actuators.

RoverNet provides a robust and scalable framework for remote sensing, perception, localization, mapping, navigation, path planning, object detection, tracking, prediction, classification, and decision making across multiple fleets of AVs. It leverages widespread use cases, such as sensor fusion, anomaly detection, scene understanding, context modeling, decision making, and human mobility forecasting, to provide accurate situational awareness and enable real-time decision making at global scale.

Based on our preliminary research and development efforts, we expect RoverNet to significantly enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and security of the trucking industry by leveraging artificial intelligence capabilities and enhancing its operational flexibility.

**Autonomous Vehicles(AVs)** : A class of robotics technology that enables machines to drive themselves without requiring operator assistance or direct user input. AVs are capable of self-navigation, perceptual interpretation, and decision-making, all of which are essential components of any effective transportation solution. Currently, most AVs operate only in narrow environments where GPS and other sensors are available, but their range of applications is expanding rapidly.

**Connected Vehicles**: Connected vehicles combine roadways and infrastructure networks together into a single unit, allowing them to communicate and collaborate with each other seamlessly, leading to greater capacity and agility. Connected vehicles offer the potential for advances in mobility, traffic flow optimization, driver-less transportation, and economies of scale.

**Vehicle Network Management System(VNMS)**: An integrated platform consisting of hardware and software modules designed to coordinate vehicle functions including data collection, processing, storage, display, and control. This system allows VNs to manage both individual vehicles and virtual fleets through a centralized interface, ensuring optimal utilization of resources. VNMS also provides reporting and analytics tools that help identify bottlenecks and provide insights for improving performance.

**Intelligent Transportation Systems(ITS)**: These include devices and systems used to improve transportation efficiency, increase productivity, reduce costs, lower environmental impact, and enhance customer experience during travel. They integrate computing, networking, telecommunications, sensors, and actuators, and may utilize machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to optimize routes, schedule vehicles, detect and prevent accidents, and track objects in motion. ITS typically rely on point-to-point communication between vehicles and relay information back to dispatch centers when necessary.

**Autonomous Rover**: A small unmanned vehicle equipped with sensors and actuators, having limited sensing capability and no steering ability. Autonomous rovers can move independently around obstacles and navigate in complex terrain while avoiding risk.

**Robotic Terrain Mapping**: Methods for generating maps of known space by scanning and interpreting the geometry and shape of surrounding obstacles and surfaces. These maps are widely used for various applications, including marine surveillance, search and rescue, exploration, and autonomous vehicles.

**Ultrasonic Sensor**: A type of passive radar-based sensor used to measure distance to objects in air. It works by transmitting ultrasonic waves, usually in the frequency range of 20 kHz to 34 kHz, and receiving echoes from target objects that bounce off them. Ultrasonic sensors are commonly used in micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), manipulators, and surface mining.

**LiDAR Sensor**: A type of active scanner-based sensor that uses lasers to generate a cloud of points surrounding the vehicle, providing more precise measurements than traditional sonar. LiDAR sensors are particularly useful for identifying objects at great distances, especially those inside dense urban areas.

**Perception Module**: A module responsible for interpreting sensory signals received from different sources, such as cameras, LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors, etc., to extract meaningful information about the surrounding environment. Perception modules process raw sensor data, apply filters, segment images, and identify objects based on different features, such as color, shape, size, movement speed, and direction.

**Decision Making Module**: A module responsible for taking into account various factors, such as position, velocity, acceleration, predicted future positions, cost, and time constraints, to make decisions and take actions in real-time. Decision-making processes involve analyzing data, evaluating options, selecting the best action, and adjusting course if needed.

**Planning Module**: A module responsible for determining the optimal path, trajectory, and orientation for moving between two specified locations. Planning involves calculating feasible paths, estimating costs, and incorporating constraints such as battery life and fuel consumption.

**Navigation Module**: A module responsible for controlling the movement of the vehicle along a predetermined path or traversing unknown obstacles. Navigation takes into account feedback from the decision-making and planning modules to ensure safe and efficient navigation.

**Object Detection Module**: A module responsible for recognizing objects such as pedestrians, bicycles, cars, etc., in real-time and localizing them within the defined area. Object detection relies heavily on deep neural networks and image processing techniques to accurately recognize and locate objects.

**Tracking Module**: A module responsible for maintaining continuous identification of tracked objects through multi-camera stitching or Kalman filtering. Tracking helps maintain a constant relative location between vehicles even as they perform maneuvers or encounter difficult conditions.

**Prediction Module**: A module responsible for predicting future states of objects based on historical data or models, thereby enabling better decision-making and avoiding collisions. Prediction makes use of sensor inputs, such as odometry and imu readings, to estimate the motion of the objects in real-time.

**Classification Module**: A module responsible for categorizing objects according to predefined categories, such as automobiles, pedestrians, signs, etc., and associating them with appropriate behavior. Classification requires building a model using training data obtained from the perception module to learn how to classify specific types of objects.

**Anomaly Detection Module**: A module responsible for identifying abnormal behaviors or events, such as sudden changes in speed or debris covering the route, and alerting drivers accordingly. Anomaly detection relies on statistical methods to analyze large amounts of data and find patterns and trends that could indicate anomalous behavior.
