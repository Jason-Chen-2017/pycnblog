Attention is one of the most important cognitive abilities for human beings. It allows us to focus on what we need at any given moment and allow us to keep working effectively under pressure or distractions. In addition to attentional control over our environment, it plays an essential role in guiding our decision making processes, improving efficiency and productivity, and enhancing social interactions with others. Researchers have long been interested in understanding how humans use their attention, from its origins in primate brains through modern AI systems such as neural networks. However, there has not been a comprehensive survey that explores this area of research specifically targeting the design space of HCI. The goal of this survey article is to provide a thorough review of attention mechanisms used in HCI from both theoretical perspectives (e.g., computational models, eye tracking) and empirical evidence (e.g., user studies). 

In recent years, attention mechanisms have also seen significant advances thanks to advancements in sensing technology, computer vision algorithms, and artificial intelligence technologies. This new attention mechanism research landscape poses many challenges for HCI researchers, including a wide range of tasks, modalities, applications, users, and devices, which makes it difficult to obtain sufficiently detailed knowledge about attention mechanisms in all aspects of the design process. Therefore, this survey aims to provide a general framework for researchers to understand current attention mechanisms in HCI by highlighting both theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence collected across different disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, biology, behavioral science, computer science, and engineering. We will also present methods and techniques for studying these attention mechanisms, including interviews, observation, experimentation, modeling, and analysis. Finally, we hope this survey could inspire future researchers to explore further into attention mechanisms in HCI.

Overall, this survey article will help researchers gain insights into the latest research directions in attention mechanisms in HCI, allowing them to develop more effective and efficient interactive systems and products. Moreover, it can act as a reference guide for developing attentive design principles and guidelines for HCI developers and designers.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before delving into the details of attention mechanisms in HCI, let's first introduce some basic concepts and terms.

## 2.1 Introduction to Attention
Attention refers to our ability to focus on specific parts of visual information during our daily lives. It enables us to retain relevant information, complete complex tasks efficiently, and make strategic decisions. For instance, if we are watching television while driving, our eyes are constantly focused on what’s happening around us, but our brain does not pay much attention to other factors outside of the field of view, such as road conditions or pedestrians walking nearby. By focusing on what is being presented to our eyes, we can quickly identify and remember critical events occurring within the visual field. Similarly, when we read a book, we want to concentrate on the content and ignore irrelevant information, while paying less attention to typos or mistranscriptions. The key to maintaining high levels of attention is to regulate our thoughts and emotions so that they do not interfere with our work. As a result, attention mechanisms play a crucial role in managing multiple competing demands, enabling us to accomplish complex tasks with ease and precision.


## 2.2 Types of Attention
There are several types of attention mechanisms in HCI:

1. Visual Attention
Our eyes are responsible for extracting and processing visual information. There are various mechanisms involved in processing visual information, such as retina, rods and cones, and optics. Retinal ganglion cells detect light and convert it into electrical signals, which are then processed by the neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) to extract features like edges, lines, shapes, textures, and colors. These features form the image representation maintained by the brain. By modulating the amount and frequency of incoming stimuli, we can direct our eyes towards certain areas of interest, thus boosting visual attention. Furthermore, our brain can selectively suppress unwanted stimuli, reducing motion artifacts and minimizing strain on our eyes. 

2. Sensory Attention
We can also attend to sensory information, such as hearing and touch, using auditory and tactile nerve activity. These inputs are processed by different structures in the inner ear and nose, respectively, resulting in the formation of sound representations stored in the central nervous system. Our brain can leverage this information for navigation, comprehension, and action. For example, head movements can signal the presence of danger or predictable events. 

3. Oculomotor Attention
Finally, oculomotor attention involves our ability to maintain our fixation on objects without moving our eyes, using salient features like borders and contour patterns. This attention helps speed up navigation and decision making processes. During steady gaze shifts, oculomotor controls enable us to maintain fine motor coordination even in low-light settings, leading to higher performance compared to traditional visual interfaces. 
These three types of attention mechanisms represent the building blocks of human attention, and together they drive our everyday activities. Understanding each type of attention mechanism can inform us about its potential benefits and limitations, which could be useful in optimizing our interaction designs. 


## 2.3 Attentional Control and Attention Priorities
Attentional control represents the degree to which we can choose to restrict, focus, or redirect our attention. If we are engaged in reading an essay, we might prefer to focus solely on the text, whereas if we are following a conversation online, we might prioritize listening instead of looking ahead to see what people say next. There are two main strategies for controlling attention:


1. Focal Attention
Focal attention refers to gazing directly at a target, usually through sustained fixation or hyperfixation. When we focalize on something, we lose sight of surrounding context and may miss critical details. Common uses include navigating, reading, and playing video games. While focal attention provides flexibility and control, it requires effort to sustain, especially in situations where attention must be diverted away from the task at hand. Thus, focal attention should only be used when absolutely necessary, such as in medical procedures or critical scenarios requiring immediate attention.

2. Concentration Attention
Concentration attention refers to thinking or writing away from distractions, typically using non-visual sources such as music, sound, or spoken language. To achieve concentration attention, we switch off peripheral perceptions and temporarily forget everything else around us until we are finished with the task. Common examples of concentration attention include studying for exams, taking notes, and preparing presentations. Concentration attention improves mental clarity and efficiency, but it comes at a cost of attentional loss due to the temporary abandonment of unrelated stimuli. 


In summation, attentional control refers to the capacity to decide whether and how to allocate our attention to specific tasks or stimuli, which influences our level of involvement and performance. Additionally, attention priorities influence our tendency to employ focal or concentration attention during any given scenario, giving rise to varied behavioral patterns and preferences. 

# 3.Core Algorithms and Techniques
The core algorithm for achieving attention in HCI is called the Temporal Binding Theory (TBL), proposed by Hattori Shirai in 1972. TBL states that whenever we encounter a stimulus, we have two options: either accept it immediately, meaning we begin processing it right now, or delay it for a period of time. After waiting for a specified duration, we take back our focus and process whatever was originally presented. We apply this theory to the design of interface components such as buttons, menus, and sliders, where feedback needs to be delivered rapidly to avoid errors. In summary, TBL relies on the idea that we can transfer our attention between stimuli and neglect ones that are too hard to notice or interpret.

Another core algorithm in HCI is called Heuristic Evaluation, which evaluates a subjective experience based on a set of criteria designed to capture user preferences and goals. Heuristic evaluation has become increasingly popular because it provides a quick and objective way to assess user needs and expectations before creating a fully functional prototype. Some of the heuristics used in HCI include affordances, learnability, memorability, naturalness, realism, and usability. These heuristics capture the qualitative aspect of user experience. They rely on subjective judgment and intuition rather than quantitative metrics, such as error rates or benchmark scores. 

Furthermore, there are numerous technical solutions for achieving attention in HCI, such as eye tracking devices, voice recognition software, facial expression detection, and accelerometer sensors. Each technique brings unique advantages and peculiarities that require careful consideration before implementing. 

In summation, the core algorithm and techniques for achieving attention in HCI depend heavily on the nature and purpose of the application. Based on the requirements and constraints of individual projects, we can find the best approach for promoting accurate and satisfying user experiences.
