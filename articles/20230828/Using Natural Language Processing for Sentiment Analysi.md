# 1.简介
  

Sentiment analysis is a widely studied and practical technique to extract subjective information from text data such as reviews, social media posts, online comments etc. It has many applications including customer feedback analysis, brand reputation management, product recommendation systems, marketing efforts, and much more. In this article we will discuss how to perform sentiment analysis on texts using natural language processing techniques with the help of popular libraries like NLTK and TextBlob in python. We will also show some pre-processing steps to prepare our input data before performing sentiment analysis. Finally, we will evaluate the accuracy of different models used for sentiment analysis by comparing their performance metrics such as F1 score, precision and recall. 

This article assumes that the reader already knows basic programming concepts, understands NLP terminology, and has some experience working with NLTK or TextBlob library. If you are new to these topics please read my previous articles first: 



In case you don't have any prior knowledge about sentiment analysis, I recommend starting by watching one of the following videos covering key ideas behind sentiment analysis:



I hope this helps! Let's get started.

# 2. Background Introduction
Sentiment analysis is an essential task in natural language processing where it involves analyzing human opinion expressed through written or spoken words and classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The purpose of sentiment analysis is to identify emotions, opinions, attitudes, evaluations, appraisals, or intentions conveyed through language in social media platforms, user reviews, movie reviews, financial news headlines, discourse, emails, surveys, blog posts, documents, advertisements, public statements, and other types of content. Some of the common applications of sentiment analysis include brand reputation management, customer feedback analysis, market research, review rating prediction, opinion mining, opinion propagation, sentiment monitoring, and sentiment forecasting.  

The process of extracting sentiment from text data involves several stages: tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization, feature extraction, and classification algorithms. Tokenization refers to splitting text into individual terms or tokens. Stop words are commonly used English words like "the", "and" etc. which do not carry significant meaning and should be removed. Stemming involves reducing multiple variations of same word to its root form, while lemmatization involves identifying the base or dictionary form of each word. Feature extraction involves selecting specific features from the extracted text, such as bag of words model, term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF), or word embedding based models. Classification algorithms use the selected features to predict whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral. Several machine learning algorithms can be used depending on the nature of the problem at hand, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and deep learning methods. Despite the wide range of algorithms available, they share similar underlying principles and procedures to achieve good results. 

Traditionally, sentiment analysis has been performed manually, by examining thousands of sentences manually annotated with either positive, negative, or neutral labels. However, recent advancements in computational linguistics, particularly in big data technologies, have enabled the development of automatic tools for sentiment analysis. There are several open-source and commercial libraries in Python that provide easy-to-use APIs for implementing various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. Examples of popular libraries for sentiment analysis in Python include NLTK, TextBlob, VADER, AFINN, and Pattern. These libraries offer pre-built functions and object-oriented interfaces for performing complex operations required for sentiment analysis, such as training classifiers, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and topic modeling. Additionally, there are several web services and APIs provided by third parties that enable users to access advanced NLP functionality easily without having to code their own sentiment analysis pipelines. For example, Google Cloud Platform offers a cloud-based service called Natural Language API that provides support for sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and syntactic analysis among others. In this article, we will focus on building our own pipeline for performing sentiment analysis using NLTK and TextBlob.    

# 3. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before discussing the core algorithm and techniques involved in sentiment analysis, let’s take a look at the basic concepts and terminology related to sentiment analysis.  

1. Lexicon Based Approach:  
Lexicons contain a list of words associated with a particular sentiment category. Sentences or phrases containing certain lexical items are considered to express a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards a target entity. This approach requires manual labelling of large datasets and high domain expertise. Common examples of lexicons include the Bing Liu sentiment lexicon and the MPQA subjectivity lexicon.  

2. Machine Learning Approach:   
Machine learning approaches learn patterns from labeled data and automatically classify new instances based on those learned patterns. This method is highly scalable and effective for small datasets with limited human intervention. Popular examples of machine learning based sentiment analysis include Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. Training these models typically involves creating labeled data sets consisting of text samples and their corresponding sentiment labels.  

3. Supervised vs Unsupervised Approaches:   
Supervised approaches involve providing the system with both input and output data to train the model and make predictions. These methods require labeled data sets to build accurate models. On the other hand, unsupervised approaches treat only the input data and try to cluster or group instances into distinct clusters based on their similarity. One popular example of unsupervised sentiment analysis is clustering techniques like K-means, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models. These models find hidden structures in unlabeled data sets and group similar instances together according to their proximity.     

# 4. Core Algorithm and Technique
Now that we know the basics behind sentiment analysis and relevant terminology, let’s dive deeper into the technical details of the core algorithm and techniques used for performing sentiment analysis in Python.   

## 4.1 Pre-Processing Steps
Pre-processing is an important step before feeding raw text data into an NLP system. Here are some basic pre-processing steps that must be done to prepare the input data for sentiment analysis:    

1. Lowercase the text: Convert all letters to lowercase so that capitalized words are treated equally.

2. Remove punctuation marks: Remove any non-alphanumeric characters except spaces between words.

3. Tokenize the text: Split the text into individual words or tokens. Each token represents a meaningful unit of text.

4. Remove stopwords: Stop words are commonly used English words that do not carry significant meaning and should be removed.

5. Stemming or Lemmatization: Reduce multiple variations of same word to its root form, while lemmatization identifies the base or dictionary form of each word. Both processes result in shorter forms of words that are easier to work with.   

6. Normalize the text: Use techniques like stemming, lemmatization, and normalization to reduce variation in spellings, casing, and special characters. Normalizing the text makes it suitable for downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling.      
  
Here is some sample code in Python to implement these pre-processing steps:  

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

def preprocess(text):
    # convert to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    
    # remove punctuation marks
    text = ''.join([char for char in text if char.isalpha() or char ==''])

    # tokenize text
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)

    # remove stop words
    stops = set(stopwords.words("english"))
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stops]

    # stem or lemmatize the text
    porter = nltk.PorterStemmer()
    stems = []
    for item in tokens:
        stems.append(porter.stem(item))
        
    return stems
```
  
After running this function on some sample text, we would obtain a list of processed tokens representing the cleaned and preprocessed text data. 

## 4.2 Building a Sentiment Analyzer Pipeline 
Now that we have implemented the pre-processing steps, we can move onto building a sentiment analyzer pipeline that uses machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of a given text. There are two main components to a sentiment analyzer pipeline: 

1. Feature Extraction - Extracting features from the input text using existing NLP libraries like NLTK or TextBlob. 

2. Model Training and Evaluation - Training the classifier using the extracted features and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. 
 
### 4.2.1 Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is the process of converting raw text data into numerical values that can be fed into machine learning algorithms. There are several feature extraction techniques available, but most common ones include Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, and Part-of-Speech Tagging. Features could also be derived from external sources such as databases, dictionaries, or speech corpora. 

#### Bag-of-Words Model  
Bag-of-Words model is a simple representation of text data where every occurrence of each word in the vocabulary is represented once. It does not consider the order of words in the original text, just their frequency. We create a dictionary of unique words in the corpus, initialize a vector of zeros with length equal to number of unique words, and increment the count of each word in the vector. Here is some sample code to implement the Bag-of-Words model:  

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

vectorizer = CountVectorizer(max_features=1000)

X = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data['text']).toarray()
y = train_data['label']

print(X.shape) #(number_of_documents, vocab_size)
```
 
We can then split the dataset into training and testing sets and train a classifier like logistic regression or SVM on the training set using the extracted features. Once trained, we can evaluate its performance on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score metrics. 

#### TF-IDF Vectorizer
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer is another common way to represent text data. Instead of simply counting the occurrences of each word in the text, TF-IDF computes the relative importance of each word in the entire corpus by taking into account the frequency of the word in the current document and across the entire corpus. It normalizes the counts of each word to reflect the fact that longer documents tend to have higher average word frequencies compared to short documents. Here is some sample code to implement the TF-IDF vectorizer:  

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)

X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data['text']).toarray()
y = train_data['label']

print(X.shape) #(number_of_documents, vocab_size)
```
 
Again, we can split the dataset into training and testing sets and train a classifier like logistic regression or SVM on the training set using the extracted features. Once trained, we can evaluate its performance on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score metrics. 

#### Word Embeddings
Word embeddings are dense representations of text data that map individual words to real-valued vectors. They capture semantic relationships between words and are often used in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition. Word embeddings can be learned jointly over a large text corpus or obtained from pre-trained word vectors like GloVe or Word2Vec. Here is some sample code to load a pre-trained Word2Vec model:  

```python
from gensim.models import KeyedVectors

word_vectors = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('/path/to/pretrained/word2vec/model', binary=True)

embedding_matrix = np.zeros((vocab_size+1, embed_dim))

for i, word in enumerate(tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names()):
    if word in word_vectors:
        embedding_matrix[i] = word_vectors[word]
        
return embedding_matrix
```

Once loaded, we can apply this embedding matrix to the input text data after passing it through the preprocessing steps. We can also experiment with other word embedding models like Doc2Vec or FastText to see what works best for our dataset. 

#### Part-of-Speech Tags
Part-of-Speech (POS) tags are annotations assigned to each word in a sentence indicating its grammatical role within the sentence. POS tags play a crucial role in determining the correct interpretation of sentences. They can help us understand the contextual meanings of words and improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis. 

One way to extract POS tags is to use rule-based approaches that assign specific parts of speech based on regular expressions. Alternatively, we can train a supervised tagger that predicts the POS tags based on the surrounding context of each word. Here is some sample code to implement a linear chain CRF tagger using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in scikit-learn:  

```python
import sklearn_crfsuite
from sklearn_crfsuite import metrics

crf = sklearn_crfsuite.CRF(algorithm='lbfgs', c1=0.1, c2=0.1, max_iterations=100, all_possible_transitions=False)

X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data['text'])
y = train_data['label']

X_test = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(test_data['text'])
y_test = test_data['label']

crf.fit(X, y)

y_pred = crf.predict(X_test)

print(metrics.flat_classification_report(y_test, y_pred, digits=3))
```

### 4.2.2 Classifier Training and Evaluation 
Finally, we can combine the extracted features and train a classifier like logistic regression or SVM on the combined dataset using scikit-learn. Here is some sample code to train a logistic regression classifier on the extracted features:  

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

clf = LogisticRegression()

clf.fit(X, y)

y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average="weighted")
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average="weighted")
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average="weighted")

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1 Score:", f1)
```

Depending on the size and complexity of your dataset, you may need to experiment with different feature extraction techniques and classifier models to achieving optimal performance. You can also use cross-validation techniques to tune hyperparameters like regularization parameters or penalty coefficients in logistic regression to optimize the performance of the model.
