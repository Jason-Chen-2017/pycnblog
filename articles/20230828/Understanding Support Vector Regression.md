# 1.简介
  

Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the best hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in high-dimensional space to separate data points into different classes based on their target values. The support vectors are those instances that lie closest to the hyperplane and help in correctly classifying new instances. SVR attempts to fit the model with as few errors as possible while maintaining a low bias and variance tradeoff.

In this article, we will explain what support vector regression is, its working mechanism, key concepts, advantages, disadvantages, common problems faced when using it, and how it can be used effectively in various applications such as forecasting stock prices, predicting customer behavior, etc. We'll also explore some mathematical formulas involved in SVR and demonstrate code implementation for a simple example of building an SVR model using Python's scikit-learn library. Let’s get started!

# 2.Background Introduction
Support vector regression (SVR) is one of the most popular supervised machine learning algorithms. It was introduced by Vapnik in 1997. It works by finding the best hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in high-dimensional space to separate data points into different classes based on their target values. 

The basic idea behind SVR is similar to linear regression where we try to find a line that fits our data well. However, whereas linear regression tries to find the best fitting line through all the data points, SVR only considers the training samples which are closest to the hyperplane formed by the maximum margin between two classes. These samples are called support vectors and they play a crucial role in making predictions. 

One advantage of using SVR over other regression models like linear regression is that it can handle large datasets because it doesn't use complex optimization techniques like gradient descent but instead uses convex optimization methods. Another advantage is that it automatically solves the problem of outliers, which may occur when using traditional linear regression. In contrast, SVR handles outliers better than traditional linear regression since it takes into account the non-linear nature of the dataset and ignores noisy data points.

However, there are several drawbacks to using SVR. One major issue is that the kernel trick used in SVM cannot work directly on SVR, so additional steps need to be taken to convert the original input features to higher dimensional spaces before applying the SVM algorithm. This makes SVR less efficient compared to traditional linear regression even though it has been shown to perform better under certain circumstances. Additionally, SVR is sensitive to noise in the data, so it requires careful preprocessing of the data to avoid overfitting. Finally, SVR assumes that the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is linear, which may not hold true in real-world scenarios. Overall, SVR remains a promising alternative to linear regression and should be considered carefully during the selection process of any machine learning task.


# 3.Basic Concepts and Terms
Before we move ahead with discussing the working mechanism of SVR, let us first understand some basic terms and concepts related to SVR.

1. Hyperplane: A hyperplane is a flat surface that separates the space into two parts. For instance, a hyperplane in three dimensions could divide the three-dimensional space into two regions, one on either side of the plane.
2. Margin: The distance from the hyperplane to the nearest point in either class. The larger the margin, the more difficult it becomes for the hyperplane to misclassify new instances.
3. Training examples: The data points used to train the SVM algorithm. These are usually chosen randomly from the entire dataset without considering the test data.
4. Test examples: The data points used to evaluate the performance of the trained SVM algorithm. These are typically reserved from the initial dataset and used to measure the accuracy of the final model.
5. Target value: The attribute whose value is being predicted by the SVM algorithm. This might be the continuous variable representing a quantitative feature or the categorical variable indicating the presence or absence of an event. 
6. Kernel function: A non-linear transformation applied to the input attributes before feeding them to the SVM algorithm. The main purpose of kernel functions is to project the inputs into a higher-dimensional space where the data is easier to separate. Some commonly used kernels include polynomial, radial basis function, sigmoid, and linear.

Let’s now discuss the core concept behind SVR - duality. Duality refers to the fact that many of the optimization problems in machine learning involve minimizing a loss function subject to constraints. Since solving these problems is computationally expensive, researchers have come up with alternate approaches such as duality theory, Lagrangian relaxation, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. In SVR, we make use of the duality approach known as structural risk minimization (SRM), which involves minimizing the following objective function:

min_w ||w||^2 + C*sum(max{0, 1-yi*(xi*w)}) / n

where w is the weight vector, xi is the i-th input sample, yi is the corresponding target value, C is the penalty parameter, and ||w||^2 represents the regularization term. 

In words, the objective function consists of a regularization term that penalizes large weights and a sum of hinge losses, which measures the error between the decision boundary and each training example. By optimizing this objective function using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent, we obtain the optimal solution to the SVM problem along with dual variables alpha and beta. Here is the complete derivation of the SRM objective function:



# 4.Core Algorithm and Operations
Now that you've understood the basics of SVR and the core concepts, we can start looking at the details of how SVR works. 

## Training SVR Model
To build an SVM model using SVR, we follow the below general steps:

1. Select appropriate kernel function. Choose the kernel function that maps the input features into a higher dimensional space where the data is easy to separate. Commonly used kernel functions include polynomial, radial basis function, sigmoid, and linear kernel. 

2. Set the regularization parameter C. Large values of C indicate strong regularization, while small values lead to slight regularization. The choice of C depends on the complexity of the dataset and whether we want to minimize false positives or false negatives.

3. Train the SVM model using SVR. During training, the algorithm computes the weights w that minimize the SRM objective function. Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data points. 

## Making Predictions
Once we have trained the SVM model using SVR, we can use it to make predictions on new data points. Given a new input x, the prediction made by the SVM algorithm is given by:

y = sign(<w, x> + b)

where <.,.> denotes dot product, w is the weight vector learned by the SVM algorithm, and b is the bias term. The sign() function returns 1 if <w, x> + b >= 0 and -1 otherwise.

## Working Mechanism
The heart of SVR lies in the hyperplane formed by the maximum margin between the two classes. To find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, we solve a quadratic programming (QP) problem that finds the minimum-norm solution to the equation:

argmin ||w|| s.t. yi(wx+b)+margin>=1/n for all i

Here, wx+b is the inner product of the weight vector w and the input vector x plus the bias term b. The left hand side of the equation represents the distance from the hyperplane to the i-th training example multiplied by the corresponding target value. The right hand side represents the constraint that ensures that the margin between the two classes does not exceed a prescribed threshold. The overall goal is to minimize the distance between the hyperplane and the closest training example while ensuring that it exceeds the specified margin.

Since SVR uses QP to optimize the weights w, it is generally faster than other linear models like logistic regression due to the ability to exploit kernel functions. Also, unlike logistic regression, SVR does not suffer from issues like vanishing gradients caused by exponentially large numbers. Instead, SVR achieves good accuracy on large datasets despite the presence of noise.
