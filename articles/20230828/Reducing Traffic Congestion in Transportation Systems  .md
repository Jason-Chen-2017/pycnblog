Traffic congestion has become a critical issue in transportation systems as it affects the safety of people and animals, environmental health, and economic development. There are several mechanisms involved in traffic congestion including congestion charging, speed limits, vehicle miles traveled per day (VMT), travel time, route choice, etc., which make it difficult for transportation planners to effectively plan and adjust their operations to reduce congestion. To address this problem, various strategies have been proposed such as reducing travel times, improving vehicle scheduling methods, increasing VMT measures, and enhancing traffic signal control. However, these approaches typically require significant investments in developing new technologies or modifying existing ones, leading to long-term benefits. Therefore, there is a need for more efficient solutions that can be implemented quickly with minimal cost over the long term. 

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have shown impressive promise for solving various complex problems across different domains, including image recognition, natural language processing, robotics, finance, healthcare, and transportation. With the advancement of mobile computing and cloud computing technology, modern data-driven applications can generate huge amounts of valuable real-time data that can be leveraged by AI and ML algorithms to provide better services. In particular, advances in autonomous driving technologies, advanced traffic simulation software, and scalable infrastructure have enabled researchers to apply machine learning algorithms on large volumes of real-time data. These techniques have led to breakthroughs in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language understanding, predictive analytics, and decision-making for transportation planning and management. However, current traffic management systems still rely heavily on traditional optimization techniques based on human experience and subjectivity, making them prone to errors and not able to adapt to fast paced market changes.

This paper proposes an effective approach to enhance traffic management system (TMS) using AI and ML algorithms that leverage real-time data generated from sensors installed at all major junctions. The key challenges include addressing incomplete and noisy data, identifying relevant patterns and trends, integrating contextual information, dealing with multi-modality data, and optimizing performance metrics. We use state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures for pattern recognition and prediction tasks, and reinforcement learning for dynamic routing decisions. Our experiments show that our TMS framework can significantly improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accuracy in terms of reduced congestion levels compared to standard TMS. This work provides insights into how AI and ML techniques can be applied to solve transportation management issues while enabling continuous improvement through self-learning.

To summarize, we propose a novel approach for improving traffic management system (TMS) using AI and ML algorithms that leverages real-time data generated from sensors installed at all major junctions. The main contributions of this work include: (1) introducing a deep learning architecture that addresses the challenges of incomplete and noisy data, multi-modality data integration, and route optimization; (2) providing insights into how AI and ML techniques can be used for transportation planning and management; and (3) demonstrating the practical viability and benefits of applying AI and ML techniques to traffic management systems. By combining the best features of both AI and manual decision-making, our approach can significantly reduce traffic congestion, optimize vehicle schedules, and achieve improved service level under different conditions. 

# 2.主要术语与定义
In this section, we will define some important terms that will be used throughout the rest of the article.

**Congestion**: refers to the situation where vehicles enter a roadway or other transportation system faster than they can exit due to the presence of heavy vehicles blocking roads or causing traffic signals to fail to properly function. Congestion leads to disruptions in traffic flow, congested areas becoming dangerous, and pedestrians experiencing discomfort or injury. 

**Transportation System**: refers to any structure or system that transports goods or persons, including railways, waterways, airplanes, buses, and cars. A transportation system includes physical components like tracks, rails, electrical lines, signs, and vehicles, as well as operational aspects like traffic management, fleet maintenance, traffic forecasting, and accident prevention.

**Road Network**: refers to the collection of roads, streets, paths, and lanes alongside their markings, signals, and traffic lights forming a single connected network. Road networks are typically divided into two categories: urban roads (e.g., interstates, highways, local streets) and rural roads (e.g., footpaths). Urban road networks can vary in size from hundreds to thousands of kilometers, while rural road networks consist of smaller sections less than five km wide.

**Real-Time Data**: refers to data collected within milliseconds or seconds from multiple sources, including sensors installed at intersections and on traffic cameras. Real-time data contains information about traffic flows, vehicle movements, and road conditions at every stop along a given road network. Examples of real-time data include speed readings, occupancy counts, GPS locations, and weather reports.

**Vehicle Flow**: refers to the total number of vehicles passing through an area during a given period of time. Vehicle flow can be measured either by counting individual vehicles entering and exiting each intersection, or by calculating the average speed of vehicles entering and exiting each intersection over a specified interval of time.

**Optimization Problem**: refers to the process of finding the most optimal solution to a set of constraints and objectives. In the case of transportation planning and management, optimization problems involve balancing several conflicting goals such as minimizing delays, managing congestion, maintaining quality of service, and achieving compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Deep Learning Architecture**: refers to a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and functions of the brain. Deep learning models typically consists of multiple layers of neurons that are connected together and receive input from other layers, producing outputs. Each layer learns to recognize patterns and correlations between inputs and outputs, allowing the model to learn complex relationships and transform input data into useful predictions.

**Self-Learning**: refers to the ability of a machine learning algorithm to update its own parameters without being explicitly trained on examples from labeled training datasets. Self-learning allows machines to automatically learn and adapt to changing environments and user preferences, making them ideal for applications requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment.
