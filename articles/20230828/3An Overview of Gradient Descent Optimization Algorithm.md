# 1.简介
  

Gradient descent optimization is an important optimization algorithm that helps the machine learning models to find optimal solutions when dealing with non-convex functions and large datasets. There are many variants of gradient descent algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), mini batch gradient descent (MBGD) and batch gradient descent (BGD). In this article, we will review these three types of gradient descent optimization algorithms including theoretical analysis, practical implementation and common pitfalls. We hope this article can help readers understand how to optimize their models effectively in different scenarios. The knowledge and skills obtained through reading and understanding this article could be valuable for both data scientists and software engineers who work on neural networks or other machine learning projects.


In this article, I will mainly focus on explaining the working principles of the SGD, BGD, and MBGD algorithms without going into too much detail about each variant's hyperparameters or properties. If you need a detailed explanation of each algorithm, please refer to existing papers or books, which have been reviewed extensively by experts in the field. This paper assumes basic familiarity with linear regression problems and logistic regression problems. For more advanced concepts, please refer to chapters dedicated to them in future versions. 

The reader should also be familiar with vector calculus and matrix operations, since those two tools play an essential role in the derivation and computation of gradients used in gradient descent algorithms.

## 2.1 Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is one of the most popular optimization techniques used in machine learning, especially for deep neural networks. It belongs to a class of iterative optimization algorithms that repeatedly adjusts the parameters of a model in order to minimize a loss function. Given a cost/loss function J(w) and its derivative J'(w), where w represents the parameters of our model, gradient descent starts from some initial point w^0, calculates the slope of the tangent line at w^0, goes downwards along this direction until it finds a minimum point w*, which minimizes the cost/loss function. Mathematically, the update rule of gradient descent is:




where alpha is the step size parameter that controls the speed of convergence and determines the magnitude of the updates made during each iteration. Different variations of gradient descent use different step sizes to achieve better performance in practice. Typical values range between 0.01 and 0.1 depending on the problem complexity. Gradient descent has been proven to converge to a global optimum under certain assumptions on the cost/loss function. However, it may not always converge efficiently if there exists multiple local minima or saddle points in the search space. Therefore, gradient descent requires careful initialization and proper stopping criteria to prevent overshooting the true minimum. Moreover, gradient descent is sensitive to feature scaling and learning rate, so it often needs to be adjusted accordingly before applying it to real world applications.

## 2.2 Loss Function
The cost/loss function is an objective function that measures the distance between the predicted output of the model and the actual label of the training set. Typically, we use mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function for regression tasks, cross entropy for classification tasks, and KL divergence for generative modeling.

For binary classification, the loss function usually takes the form of log likelihood function L(y|x;theta):


where y = {0,1} indicates the class label, x is the input features, theta are the weights of the model, and p_i=sigma(z_i)=σ(θ^Tx_i) is the probability of positive example i being classified as 1 given the current model parameters θ.

## 2.3 Parameter Vector
A parameter vector φ ∈ R^(d+1) represents all the model parameters required to fit the dataset X. For linear regression problems, d equals to the number of features plus 1, indicating the bias term b. The first element corresponds to the intercept b, while the rest correspond to the coefficients θ^T1...θ^Td corresponding to the features. Thus, the dimensionality of parameter vectors depends on the type of problem.

For logistic regression problems, the parameter vector φ consists of d elements representing the weight vector W^T and the bias term b. The logistic function σ(.) maps any real value z to the probability value p between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid function:


Therefore, the logistic regression model uses a sigmoid activation function followed by a hypothesis function h(x;φ) defined as follows:


where x denotes the input features, φ is the parameter vector consisting of W^T and b, and P(Y=1|X=x) is the probability that Y=1 given X=x.

## 2.4 Learning Rate
The learning rate α determines the step size taken in updating the model parameters during each iteration of gradient descent. A small learning rate might lead to slow convergence, whereas a larger learning rate might result in oscillations around the minimum and get stuck in local optima. Therefore, choosing a good learning rate is crucial for achieving fast convergence and avoiding getting trapped in bad local minima. Generally speaking, the ideal learning rate lies between the reciprocal of the dimension of the parameter vector and the square root of the number of training examples, although this is still open research topic. 

# 3.算法原理及操作流程
Now let's go back to the topics mentioned above and discuss the details behind SGD, BGD and MBGD algorithms respectively. These algorithms share several similarities in terms of their general operation flow, but they differ significantly in the way they compute the gradient of the loss function. Below, I'll describe the main steps involved in each algorithm.



## 3.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the simplest and most widely used version of gradient descent. It works well even on very large datasets because it processes only one training example at a time. At each iteration t, it computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to a randomly chosen training example (x^(t), y^(t)) and makes a single update to the parameter vector based on the negative gradient. The complete update rule for SGD is given below:


where n is the total number of training samples, and k is the index of the sample used in the current iteration. Note that k does not depend on t, unlike what happens in traditional batch gradient descent, where the whole batch is processed at once. As a result, SGD can be faster than BGD or MBGD for relatively small datasets due to its memory efficiency. On the other hand, it might fail to converge to the global optimum if the loss surface has multiple valleys or ridges, making it prone to getting stuck in local minima.

## 3.2 Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)
Batch gradient descent (BGD) is a standard approach for training neural networks, which applies the entire batch of training examples at once to compute the gradient. Similarly to SGD, it processes only one training example at a time. Unlike SGD, BGD computes the average of the gradients across all training examples in each iteration. At each iteration t, the update rule for BGD is given below:


where m is the batch size, and k ranges from 1 to m in each iteration. Since the same subset of training examples is processed at every iteration, BGD is slower than SGD but can handle larger datasets that do not fit into memory. On the other hand, BGD may get stuck in saddle points or plateaus, making it less efficient compared to SGD. Also, it cannot make use of the full capability of modern hardware architectures like GPUs because all the computations happen sequentially.

## 3.3 Mini-batch Gradient Descent (MBGD)
Mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD) combines the advantages of both BGD and SGD by processing a smaller subset of training examples at a time called batches or mini-batches instead of processing the entire batch at once. Instead of computing the average of the gradients across all training examples, MBGD computes the sum of the gradients for each mini-batch, then performs an update using the normalized sum according to the batch size m. At each iteration t, the update rule for MBGD is given below:


where m is the batch size, and k ranges from 1 to m in each iteration. By processing mini-batches instead of the entire batch, MBGD can take advantage of parallelization and scale well to larger datasets that do not fit into memory. Additionally, MBGD provides a regularizing effect by reducing the variance of the gradients. While MBGD is conceptually simpler than BGD and SGD, it can provide slightly improved performance on some datasets despite its simplified structure.
