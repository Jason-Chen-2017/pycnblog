# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a class of machine learning algorithms that learn from interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative reward over time. RL has been applied successfully to many challenging applications such as robotics and games, where it can lead to significant improvements compared to traditional supervised or unsupervised learning techniques.

One core issue in reinforcement learning is the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which arises when the agent explores new states in hopes of finding optimal policies but ends up being trapped by a local optima, causing suboptimal performance. This issue can be mitigated through various methods such as random exploration, curiosity-driven exploration, and intrinsic motivation. Despite these efforts, most existing approaches for value-based RL still face substantial challenges in achieving convergence, especially for high-dimensional continuous spaces. 

To address this challenge, we propose several theoretical insights on the convergence properties of state-value based methods and explore its relationship with policy gradients and Q-learning. We also provide empirical evidence showing that recent deep reinforcement learning methods are able to converge significantly faster than their older counterparts in certain environments. Our work paves the way towards more efficient and robust RL algorithms in real-world scenarios.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
## 2.1 Markov Decision Process (MDP)
A Markov decision process (MDP) is defined as a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, R,\gamma)$, where $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the set of states, $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the set of actions, $\mathcal{T}(s'|s,a)\subseteq \mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}^{\otimes}$ denotes the transition function that maps each state $s$ and action $a$ into a probability distribution over next state $s'$ under stochastic dynamics, $\mathcal{T}_{ss'}^{ab}= P(s_{t+1}=s' | s_t=s, a_t = a)$, and $R: (\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A})^{\otimes}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the reward function that gives the immediate reward for taking an action at a given state. The discount factor $\gamma\in [0,1]$ specifies how much future rewards should be discounted relative to current ones. A MDP may also include a termination condition, indicated by the symbol $[\tau]$, which means there exists a terminal state $\tau$ and any state not equal to $\tau$ terminates episodes.

The MDP framework allows us to model complex decision problems by describing the possible states, actions, transitions between them, and the effect of taking those actions on the system's state and the associated rewards. It is used widely across a wide range of fields, including artificial intelligence, finance, control theory, and operations research. 


## 2.2 State Value Functions and Bellman Equations
Given a MDP, let $V^{\pi}(s)$ be the expected return starting from state $s$ under the policy $\pi$. For a fixed policy $\pi$, the value function is uniquely determined if the following Bellman equation holds for all $s\in\mathcal{S}$:

$$ V^\pi(s)=\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}} \pi(a|s)\left[R(s,a)+\gamma\sum_{s'\in\mathcal{S}}\mathcal{T}(s'|s,a)[V^\pi(s')]\right], $$

where $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $R(s,a)$ is the reward obtained after executing action $a$ in state $s$. In other words, the value of a state depends only on the immediate reward obtained and the values of the subsequent states, but not on the history leading up to that point.

For example, consider the task of navigating a robot from one location to another using actions such as "move north", "move east", etc., while receiving noisy measurements indicating whether the destination was reached or not. Assume the robot starts in state $s_0$ and follows policy $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ with parameter vector $\theta$, where $\theta=(\theta_1,...,\theta_{\|\mathcal{S}\|})\in \mathbb{R}_+^{\|\mathcal{S}\|}$. Then the corresponding state value function would look like:

$$ V^\pi_\theta(s_i)=\frac{1}{Z(\pi_\theta)}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\gamma^{n-1}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\mathcal{T}_{sk}^{aj}[V^\pi_{\theta-\alpha_k}(s'_k)]e^{R(s_k,a)}, $$

where $N$ is the number of steps taken by the robot until reaching state $s_i$ under policy $\pi_\theta$, $n=\infty$ indicates infinite horizon, $\alpha_k=log\pi_{\theta-\alpha_k}(a|s)_a/z$ is the entropy term that encourages exploration, and $Z(\cdot)$ represents the normalizing constant for any probabilistic expression. Note that this formula involves both deterministic and probabilistic factors.



## 2.3 Policy Gradient Methods
Policy gradient methods use gradient descent optimization to find the best policy parameters $\theta$ for maximizing the expected return under a given policy $\pi_\theta$:

$$ J(\theta)=E_{\tau\sim\pi_\theta}[r(\tau)]. $$

In practice, policy gradient methods estimate the gradient of the logarithmic policy ratio with respect to the policy parameters:

$$ g\approx \nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t). $$

Then they update the parameters using a simple step size and direction chosen according to the negative gradient:

$$ \theta \gets \theta+\alpha g.$$

The advantage of policy gradient methods is that they directly optimize the policy parameters rather than indirectly tuning them via value functions or heuristics. Additionally, they can handle highly non-convex objective functions due to the absence of a global optimum, making them suitable for applications requiring precise control. However, they require careful hyperparameter tuning and do not guarantee convergence in general.

Some commonly used policy gradient methods include REINFORCE (Williams et al., 1992), GPOMDP (Kaelbling et al., 2016), TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015), and PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). Each method addresses different tradeoffs among sample efficiency, stability, and variance reduction.


## 2.4 Q-Learning and Q-Value Functions
Q-learning is another popular algorithm for solving MDPs. Unlike policy gradient methods that rely on estimates of the gradient, Q-learning updates the estimated Q-values instead of the policy parameters:

$$ Q(s,a)\gets Q(s,a)+\alpha(R(s,a)+\gamma\max_{a'}Q(s',a')-Q(s,a)).$$

The idea behind Q-learning is that the current action that yields the largest expected reward will eventually yield even higher rewards regardless of the initial conditions, so long as the behavior is stable within some bounded interval of iterations. Hence, Q-learning provides a dynamic programming solution to the problem of exploration-exploitation, avoiding the need for the prior knowledge of the optimal policy. 

However, Q-learning suffers from slow convergence, particularly in high-dimensional continuous spaces, since the Q-function must be learned online from small batches of experience data collected during training. Furthermore, Q-learning requires explicit knowledge of the optimal policy, which makes it less practical in settings where the true optimal policy is unknown or computationally expensive to compute. Finally, Q-learning does not scale well to large state or action spaces.

As an alternative approach, we propose two extensions to Q-learning that allow for more scalable learning and better transferability to new tasks: Double Q-learning and Dueling Networks. Both methods combine aspects of policy gradients and dynamic programming to improve speed and stability, respectively.

### 2.4.1 Double Q-learning
Double Q-learning improves the stability and convergence properties of Q-learning by decoupling the selection of the maximum target Q-value and the update of the estimate:

$$ Q_i(s,a)\gets Q_i(s,a)+\alpha(R(s,a)+\gamma Q_i'(s',argmax_{a'}Q_i(s',a'))-Q_i(s,a)),$$

where $Q_i(s,a)$ and $Q_i'(s',a')$ represent two separate neural networks trained independently using the same mini-batch of experience tuples. Intuitively, this separation ensures that the Q-functions are optimized independently and can potentially adapt to different policies without affecting each other. Similarly, it helps reduce the chances of getting stuck in cyclic regions and prevent catastrophic forgetting during later stages of training.

### 2.4.2 Dueling Networks
Dueling Networks combine the advantages of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and deep reinforcement learning by introducing a separate estimation network for evaluating the state-action value function $Q(s,a)$ and another network for estimating the state value function $V(s)$ based on the difference between the average and maximum value function outputs. Specifically, the updated Q-value function becomes:

$$ Q(s,a)=V(s)+(A(s,a)-\frac{1}{|A(s)|}\sum_{b\in A(s)}A(s,b))\left[R(s,a)+\gamma E_{s'~dP(s'|s,a)}[V(s')]\right]. $$

Intuitively, the state value function measures how much utility can be extracted from the current state, whereas the advantage function tells us what additional information we gain by taking specific actions in the current state. By separating these components, we can train separately and simultaneously and thus achieve better results in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
