概率论是人工智能领域的一个重要分支，在计算机视觉、机器学习、模式识别等领域都扮演着至关重要的角色。通过对复杂系统中的随机事件发生的可能性进行建模和分析，概率论可以用来做出许多重要的决策，比如信用评分、推荐系统、监控系统、预测病情、金融交易。而理解并运用概率论，则是构建更准确、可靠的机器学习模型、制定更科学的决策规则、改善现有产品和服务质量等方面的重要手段。

本文将介绍概率论的两个主要分支——贝叶斯统计与图模型。其中贝叶斯统计描述的是给定已知信息情况下，一个变量或者一组变量发生的概率分布；图模型则着眼于推断和学习复杂的概率分布，特别是那些难以直接获得观察数据的复杂系统。本文的目标读者是具有一定概率论基础和数学功底，熟悉统计学和信息论知识，以及对复杂系统及其相关任务有一定的认识的读者。

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Random Variables and Events
### 2.1.1 Definition of a Random Variable

A random variable X can be thought of as the outcome of an experiment or process that has one of many possible outcomes with certain probabilities attached to each outcome. A simple example would be rolling a die where there are six sides and we know that the probability of rolling any particular side on a fair die is 1/6. We call this distribution of outcomes for X the probability mass function (PMF), which assigns a probability to every individual outcome. 

Formally, a random variable X takes values from some set $\Omega$ which is called the sample space. The PMF is defined as:

$$P(X=x)=p_x\ \forall x\in \Omega,$$

where $p_x$ is the probability of the value $x$. For discrete random variables, such as rolls of a die, it is conventional to represent the PMF using a table in terms of all possible values of X and their corresponding probabilities. Alternatively, if the outcomes are continuous, they may be represented by a probability density function (PDF). In this case, the PDF at a point $x$ represents the likelihood that X will take on a value between $x-\delta$ and $x+\delta$, given by:

$$P(x-\delta<X<x+\delta)=P(X)\int_{x-\delta}^{x+\delta}f_X(t)\ dt.$$

In other words, the area under the curve representing the PDF of X between these two points gives us the probability that X falls within that range. Of course, not all random variables have both a PMF and a PDF, since some distributions are multivariate or dependent.

Once we define a random variable, we can describe its probability distribution through the PMF or the PDF depending on whether the outcomes are discrete or continuous. Since we cannot observe a random variable directly, we need to use our observations or data to estimate the distribution of X. This estimation is done using various methods including maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), Bayesian inference, and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Once we have estimated the distribution, we can then perform various tasks such as calculating probabilities, generating samples, or making predictions based on the estimated distribution.

### 2.1.2 Definition of an Event

An event E is a collection of outcomes that satisfies a specific condition or criteria. An example could be rolling even numbers on a die, or flipping heads when tossing a coin. Together, all the outcomes in an event form a subset of the sample space $\Omega$, denoted as $\overline{\Omega}$. Formally, an event E is written as follows:

$$E=\{x:\ \text{$x$ is an outcome that satisfies the condition}\},$$

where $\text{such that}$ indicates that only those outcomes that satisfy the condition should belong to the event. The complementary event $E^c$ contains all outcomes that do not belong to $E$. Mathematically, an event is often denoted as $[A]$ or $[\bar{A}]$.

Events play an important role in probability theory because they provide a convenient way to work with complex situations involving uncertain events. Examples include evaluating risks, designing experiments, forecasting outcomes, and developing decision-making policies. It's worth emphasizing here that the exact meaning of "event" varies widely across fields, but the key idea behind them remains the same: they allow us to reason about uncertainty and make probabilistic decisions.

## 2.2 Discrete Distributions and Probability Mass Functions
### 2.2.1 Discrete Distributions

Let's begin with a brief overview of discrete probability distributions. These are characterized by a finite number of possible outcomes, typically labeled $k=1,\cdots,n$. For example, let's consider a biased coin flip that comes up heads with probability $p$ and tails with probability $q=1-p$. We say that the probability distribution for this random variable is given by:

$$P(X=k)=p^{k}(1-p)^{(n-k)} \quad k=1,\cdots,n.$$

This formula says that the probability of observing $k$ heads out of $n$ trials is proportional to the binomial coefficient $(n,k)$ raised to the power $p$, times the probability of observing no heads ($1-p$) raised to the power $(n-k)$. Note that the sum over all values of $k$ adds up to 1:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n P(X=k)=nP.$$

In other words, the total probability mass assigned to the entire sample space $\Omega$ is equal to the number of possible outcomes multiplied by the probability of each outcome occurring individually. Another way to think about this is that each outcome occurs independently with probability $p$, so the probability of seeing the sequence of heads and tails obtained during an infinite number of trials is simply the product of the individual probabilities of each outcome.
