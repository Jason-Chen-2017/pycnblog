# 1.简介
  

Support vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression problems. SVMs are powerful models that can perform complex tasks with high accuracy while also being easy to understand and interpret. In this article, we will explore what SVMs are and how they work. We'll begin by discussing their basic concepts such as hyperplanes and margin maximization. Then, we'll proceed to explain the core algorithm behind support vector machines - the kernel trick. Finally, we'll discuss some practical applications of SVMs in industry such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, image recognition, and fraud detection.

In conclusion, SVMs provide an effective approach towards building accurate and robust predictive models from large datasets without requiring extensive preprocessing or feature engineering. Their versatility makes them ideal for use in a wide range of applications including natural language processing, computer vision, bioinformatics, and finance.

Let's get started!

## 2.1 Hyperplanes
A hyperplane is a flat surface that separates two sets of data points in space. It has no specific shape and its location depends on the choice of the origin and normal direction. A hyperplane can be thought of as a decision boundary in a higher-dimensional space where each dimension represents a separate feature. 

For example, let's consider a dataset consisting of three features: age, income, and education level. These features could represent different characteristics about individuals who may have different risk factors associated with them. Suppose we want to build a model that predicts whether someone has a particular disease based on these features. One way to do it would be to create a hyperplane through the feature space that separates the two groups of people with the disease. This plane could define a threshold between "healthy" people and those at risk. By placing test samples onto this plane, we can determine which group they belong to. For example, if a new individual comes into contact with a healthcare provider, we can ask them to describe themselves along with their demographics so that we can classify them accordingly.


In general, there can be any number of dimensions in our input space, but for simplicity, we typically assume that we only have two dimensions - x and y coordinates. If we had more than two dimensions, then we'd need multiple planes to separate the data points. 


## 2.2 Margin Maximization
Margin maximization refers to the process of finding the best hyperplane within a specified margin around the training examples. To achieve maximum margin, we seek to find a hyperplane that is as far away from both classes of data points as possible. Mathematically, we want to solve the following optimization problem:

$$\underset{\omega}{\text{max}} \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^N \xi_i$$

where $\omega$ is the weight vector representing the hyperplane, $C$ is the regularization parameter, N is the number of training examples, and $\xi_i$ are slack variables indicating the amount of violation of the margin constraint. In practice, we minimize the hinge loss function instead of using quadratic programming. 

The solution to this optimization problem corresponds to the equation of the hyperplane:

$$wx+b = 0 $$

where w is the weight vector and b is the bias term. Taking the derivative with respect to either w or b gives us the slope and intercept terms of the line perpendicular to the hyperplane passing through the origin.


Now, let's consider the constraints that must hold for the optimization problem to converge. There are two types of constraints: soft constraints and hard constraints. Soft constraints penalize violations less severely than hard constraints; therefore, increasing the value of the cost function does not necessarily mean that violating a soft constraint is undesirable. On the other hand, hard constraints specify exact conditions that must be satisfied. Both types of constraints help to ensure that the learned model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Specifically, the first type of constraint allows for misclassifications of smaller magnitudes while still allowing for larger errors. The second type of constraint prevents the weights from taking on extreme values that might cause numerical instability or overfitting.

To enforce the margin constraint, we add a penalty term proportional to the sum of the squared distances from all the training examples to the hyperplane:

$$C\sum_{i=1}^N \xi_i = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N max(0,1-y_iw^Tx_i)^2$$

The soft margin ensures that the solutions found by the optimizer are smooth enough to avoid getting trapped in local minima, whereas the hard margin forces the model to have zero error on the training set. Once we optimize the above objective function, we obtain a hyperplane that splits the data into positive and negative regions with the largest distance between them.


## 2.3 Kernel Trick
Kernel methods are a family of techniques that allow us to apply linear classifiers to non-linearly separable data. The intuition behind kernel methods is to project the original inputs into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separation can be obtained easily. The projection can be done using different kernels like polynomial, radial basis functions, or sigmoid. Each kernel defines a similarity metric that captures the information provided by nearby observations. The inner product of two observations under a given kernel gives us a measure of their similarity. Given a kernel function k, we can formulate the decision boundary equation as follows:

$$\phi(\textbf{x}) = \textbf{x}W $$

where W is a matrix of coefficients obtained after solving an eigenvalue decomposition of the Gram matrix:

$$K = \textbf{X}\textbf{X}^{T}$$

Since K is symmetric, its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis of the column space of X. Thus, any observation can be expressed in terms of a combination of these eigenvectors.

The kernel trick involves replacing the dot product between vectors with their inner products under the chosen kernel. That is, instead of computing the dot product directly, we compute the inner product under the chosen kernel:

$$k(\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{x}_j) = (\textbf{x}_i^{\top} \textbf{x}_j) k(\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{x}_j)$$

Using the kernel trick, we can transform the nonlinear decision boundary equation into a linear one:

$$g(\textbf{x}) = sign(\langle\phi(\textbf{x}), \omega\rangle ) $$

This formula assumes that the mapping phi preserves the order of the features, i.e., phi(x[1]) should correspond to x[1]. However, in many cases, the ordering of the features might change during the transformation due to nonlinearities present in the original feature space. Therefore, before applying the kernel trick, it's important to inspect the relationship between the transformed features and the original ones to see if they preserve the necessary relationships. Also note that the choice of the kernel function affects the performance of the classifier. In general, more expressive kernels lead to better generalization performance.
