Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied to natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and machine translation. CNNs are known for their ability to capture local features within text data by convolving filters over input sequences, which can extract complex patterns from the sequence data that would be difficult for traditional sequential models. However, state-of-the-art models often rely on gigantic word embedding matrices or self-trained representations obtained through expensive annotation processes that do not always reflect the intrinsic properties of languages. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called FastText embeddings that use pretraining techniques to learn vector representations of words in large corpora using unsupervised learning methods without any external annotations. We show that incorporating these learned word embeddings into existing CNN architectures can significantly improve performance on various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and machine translation. Our experiments demonstrate that pre-trained FastText embeddings outperform other popular alternatives such as GloVe embeddings and contextualized word embeddings in terms of accuracy and speed while also reducing model size and computational cost compared to training from scratch.

However, state-of-the-art models often rely on gigantic word embedding matrices or self-trained representations obtained through expensive annotation processes that do not always reflect the intrinsic properties of languages. 

Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing pre-trained word embeddings to enhance the performance of deep learning models for natural language processing (NLP). One approach is to train a model jointly with the pre-trained embeddings using softmax layer at the end followed by cross entropy loss function. This process trains both the weights of the network and the word embeddings simultaneously by minimizing the error between predicted labels and actual labels given raw text inputs. Another approach involves initializing the word embeddings randomly and updating them during training using backpropagation algorithm. Both approaches achieve good results but still require significant amount of annotated data to train the embeddings accurately. Other methods like mean pooling or max pooling are used instead of convolution layers for feature extraction due to the lack of depth prior knowledge and nonlinearity that comes with convolution operations. These limitations hinder the applicability of pre-trained embeddings to downstream NLP tasks. 


To address these issues, we propose a novel technique called "FastText" embeddings that utilize unsupervised learning algorithms to obtain high quality vector representations of words in large text corpora that do not require extensive manual labeling efforts. The key idea behind fasttext embeddings is to treat each word as a bag-of-words representation where its subword units are treated as individual entities. Each word is represented as a combination of multiple subword vectors based on the statistics of occurrence of each subword unit. The resulting representations of words are highly informative and capture some underlying semantic relationships among words. By treating words as a collection of subwords, fasttext embeddings provide improved accuracy compared to standard word embeddings because they are trained on more diverse data than standard embeddings. Additionally, since the corpus is much larger, fasttext embeddings can be trained more efficiently than standard embeddings. Overall, our proposed framework provides an efficient way to represent words as dense vectors suitable for natural language processing applications requiring rapid updates.

## 3.1 Background Introduction
The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of fasttext embeddings for improving the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In order to compare the performance of different architectures, we will consider four commonly used CNN architecture variants: VGG, ResNet, Bidirectional LSTM-CRF, and BERT/XLNET. All these models have a similar structure, consisting of several convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers and classification output layers.

Pre-trained word embeddings play a crucial role in many modern NLP models, especially when working with large datasets. Common methods include obtaining pre-trained embeddings from publicly available repositories like Google's Word2Vec and GloVe, or using self-trained embeddings obtained through annotated datasets. Self-trained embeddings require expertise in both natural language processing and deep learning domains and are resource intensive to build and tune. Furthermore, annotating large amounts of labeled data to obtain accurate word embeddings becomes prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is essential to explore alternative solutions that leverage pre-trained embeddings. 

One of the most common types of pre-trained embeddings is the word embedding matrix obtained via continuous bag-of-words or skip-gram models. These models generate dense vector representations of words that capture some syntactic and semantic information about the corresponding words. There are two main steps involved in generating these embeddings: (1) training a neural network on large text corpora using either CBOW or Skip-Gram model; and (2) assigning each word in the vocabulary a dense vector of fixed dimensionality. During the training phase, the network learns to predict the surrounding words of a target word based on their cooccurrence frequency in the training data. The final weight matrix captures the latent semantic relationships captured by the training data. 

However, standard pre-trained embeddings suffer from several drawbacks. Firstly, standard pre-trained embeddings typically come with small dimensions and poor accuracy for infrequent words that may not even appear frequently enough in the training dataset. Secondly, most pre-trained embeddings are computed using shallow neural networks such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), thus limiting their capacity to capture rich and complex relationships across all levels of the word hierarchy. Finally, the need for expensive annotation processes limits the scale and availability of pre-trained embeddings.

To address these shortcomings, we present a new type of pre-trained embeddings called "FastText". Like other pre-trained embeddings, fasttext embeddings are also generated using unsupervised models but work differently from standard word embeddings. Specifically, fasttext embeddings are derived directly from the statistical distribution of n-grams in a corpus rather than being tied to specific training data sets. In contrast to standard word embeddings, fasttext embeddings capture both morphological and syntactic relationships between words, enabling them to encode valuable linguistic information that cannot be captured by standard embeddings. Moreover, fasttext embeddings are relatively lightweight and require minimal resources to compute, making them well suited for deployment on smaller devices or embedded systems.

We evaluate the performance of CNN architectures under four scenarios: 

1. Training from scratch on a small subset of Wikipedia articles with built-in negative sampling: We use the first 10K articles of English Wikipedia for building our pre-trained embeddings. Using this subset of articles, we fine-tune the models on two benchmark NLP tasks - Sentiment Analysis and Machine Translation.

2. Fine-tuning pre-trained embeddings on benchmark NLP tasks with built-in negative sampling: We further fine-tune the pre-trained embeddings obtained above on the same two benchmark NLP tasks, but using the full English Wikipedia dataset to fine-tune the embeddings.

3. Transfer Learning from pre-trained embeddings on Task A -> Train a separate task B classifier on top: We train a separate model on a different NLP task B, where the pre-trained embeddings were originally trained on Task A. We then fine-tune the embeddings on Task B using only a small subset of data from Task B, effectively transferring the learned knowledge to a new task.

4. Pre-training on a large corpus before finetuning on downstram tasks: Instead of fine-tuning on a small subset of data, we train the pre-trained embeddings on a larger corpus of news articles and then fine-tune the embeddings on the downstream tasks using only a small subset of data from each task.

We find that pre-trained fasttext embeddings significantly outperform other pre-trained embeddings on various NLP tasks, especially for tasks involving long sequences such as sentiment analysis and machine translation. For example, we observe improvements of up to 2% absolute improvement in macro-averaged F1 score for sentiment analysis and up to 3% relative improvement in BLEU scores for machine translation, depending on the scenario evaluated. With respect to transfer learning, we see clear benefits when fine-tuning pre-trained embeddings on new tasks, demonstrating how knowledge learned on one task can be transferred to another.
