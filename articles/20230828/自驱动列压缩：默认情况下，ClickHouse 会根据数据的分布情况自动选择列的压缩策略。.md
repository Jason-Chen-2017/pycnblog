# 1.简介
  

Columnar database systems, such as ClickHouse, are becoming increasingly popular for analytical workloads that require fast queries on large datasets with high dimensionality. However, the compression scheme used by default can result in suboptimal query performance and limited disk space utilization, especially when data is skewed or contains many missing values. In this article, we will explain how ClickHouse's columnar storage format allows us to automatically compress columns based on their distribution patterns. We will also show how this feature can be enabled and customized through system settings, which makes it easy for users to control the trade-off between query latency and compressed storage space usage. Finally, we will discuss various optimization techniques and techniques that could further improve the compression ratio of columnar databases and provide better query performance under certain conditions. 

# 2. 基本概念术语
In this section, we introduce some basic concepts and terminology related to columnar database systems.

## Column-Oriented Database Systems
Column-oriented database systems store tables row-by-row rather than storing them in a traditional table structure where each row has one fixed number of cells (columns). The idea behind column-oriented storage is to avoid unnecessary padding bytes within rows, making it easier to access specific data types or fields quickly without requiring decoding entire rows. Instead, columns within each row are stored contiguously on disk, allowing efficient retrieval of specific columns from a subset of the rows. This leads to significant memory savings and faster read/write operations compared to row-oriented storage systems. Common examples of column-oriented database systems include Apache Hadoop HBase, Cassandra, and Amazon DynamoDB. Each record or entry in these systems is typically represented as multiple key-value pairs where the keys correspond to column names and the values contain the corresponding data. 

## Row Grouping
Row grouping refers to dividing a table into groups of adjacent rows that share common characteristics. For example, if the rows in a table represent transactions over a time period, then row grouping would group all transactions that occurred at the same timestamp together. This helps to minimize the overhead associated with reading multiple small files or blocks containing only part of the table, leading to improved query processing speeds. When using a column-oriented database system, row grouping plays a crucial role in minimizing fragmentation and improving compression efficiency.

## Bitmap Indexes
Bitmap indexes are special type of indexes that are designed to support efficient filtering of multi-valued attributes like arrays or maps. A bitmap index consists of a bitmap per attribute value, indicating whether each value exists or not in the indexed column. These bitmaps allow quick lookup of relevant records based on whether a given value occurs in any of the array or map elements. Bitmap indexes can help reduce the amount of I/O required to search for matching records since they can skip ahead directly to the relevant pages of the underlying data file. Common examples of bitmap indexes include Apache Druid, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.

## Vectorized Execution Engine
Vectorized execution engines process batches of input data at once, often using SIMD instructions or specialized hardware acceleration units to increase query throughput. Examples of vectorized execution engines include Apache Arrow, Apache Spark, Google BigQuery, and Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory. Vectorized execution engines take advantage of the parallelism available in modern CPUs and GPUs to execute complex SQL queries more efficiently than standard row-wise scanning approaches.

## Data Skew
Data skew is a phenomenon where different parts of a dataset have significantly differing distributions, resulting in uneven load balancing among nodes during distributed processing. Understanding and dealing with data skew can greatly impact the overall performance and scalability of distributed systems. Common causes of data skew include uneven distribution of partition keys due to hotspotting, imbalanced write loads across partitions, and inconsistent shard sizes. ClickHouse provides automatic rebalancing capabilities that redistribute shards evenly throughout the cluster based on current workload and data distribution. 

## Dictionary Encoding
Dictionary encoding is a technique that involves converting categorical variables into numerical codes before writing them to disk or memory. This reduces the memory footprint of the data by eliminating redundant representations of variable categories, while still enabling efficient indexing and aggregation. In ClickHouse, dictionary encoding is used to encode low-cardinality string and integer columns. Common encodings include FlatDictionary, ArrayDictionary, and RangeDictionary.

## Run Length Encoding (RLE)
Run length encoding (RLE) is another commonly used technique for reducing the size of data by identifying repeated occurrences of values and replacing them with a single occurrence plus the count of repetitions. RLE can be useful when the data contains mostly zeroes, as zeros can be represented very efficiently using run lengths. ClickHouse uses RLE to optimize the representation of Boolean and Enum columns.

## Compression Algorithms
Various compression algorithms exist, ranging from simple LZ77 variants to high-performance lossless codecs like Zstandard and Snappy. ClickHouse uses widely-used LZ4 compression algorithm to compress both page-level data and column-level data structures. Additionally, ClickHouse supports transparent integration of external compression libraries like Brotli or zlib via the internal interface provided by the codec library. Users can also use custom compression algorithms implemented as plugins to achieve higher compression ratios or reduced CPU usage.
