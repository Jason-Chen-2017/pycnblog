Beijing is the world's most popular city for international business and technology hubs such as Alibaba Group, Baidu, Tencent, JD.com, etc. As a top-5 economy nation, Beijing offers a rich mix of cultures with diverse industries including finance, healthcare, energy, electronics, industry, transportation, real estate, information technology, manufacturing, retail, telecommunication, entertainment, tourism, etc. Its high level of technological development has driven its population to embrace digital transformation and cloud computing technologies. This is particularly true when it comes to public clouds like Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In recent years, China has been witnessing rapid growth in both domestic IT industry and cloud services market share. At the same time, Beijing has become a hotspot for many startups and enterprise companies building their digital infrastructure there, leading to further expansions in the regional space. 

Alibaba Cloud is one of the pioneers in this region due to its commitment to providing reliable and secure public cloud infrastructure that can scale up and down on demand. Since Alibaba Cloud launched its first region - "Shenzhen", Shenzhen has become home to hundreds of thousands of customers across multiple industries, from Finance to Retail to Telecommunication. Today, Alibaba Cloud has expanded its presence into several new regions in the north of Beijing: Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Hainan, and Macau. These areas are located far away from major cities, making them ideal locations for hosting large-scale enterprise workloads running on cloud infrastructure. 

In this article, we will explore how Alibaba Cloud is expanding its global footprint through the introduction of these new regions alongside our existing ones in Shenzhen. We will also discuss the key benefits associated with these new regions and provide guidance on choosing between different cloud service providers within these regions based on your requirements. Finally, we will touch upon some challenges faced by businesses deploying applications on cloud platforms deployed across multiple geographies and how they can overcome these issues effectively to achieve maximum uptime and scalability.

## 2.1 Basic Concepts
Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of compute power, storage, and other resources via the internet. The basic concept of cloud computing is the use of remote servers hosted on the internet instead of dedicated hardware on site or in a data center. It allows organizations to access high-performance processing capabilities and resources at low cost. 

Public clouds offer a variety of services including virtual machines, block storage, object storage, databases, container orchestration, messaging, AI & analytics, IoT, and more. They are accessible over the internet and can be used for any type of application regardless of size or complexity. Public clouds typically have a pay-as-you-go pricing model where users only pay for what they actually use. Examples of public clouds include AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, etc. 

Private clouds, on the other hand, are self-managed private clouds consisting of physical or virtual servers that are hosted either on-premise or offsite. They offer similar functionality as public clouds but may be customized for specific needs or regulatory compliance. Private clouds may involve local software installation, network routing configuration, security hardening, and management of the underlying operating system. Examples of private clouds include VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), OpenStack, Cloud Foundry, Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) and others. 

Hybrid clouds combine the advantages of public and private clouds by overlaying the two types of environments. A hybrid cloud solution combines features of both public and private clouds without compromise to ensure scalability, flexibility, and agility. Hybrid clouds can enable organizations to seamlessly transition from one cloud platform to another depending on their workload or criticality. For example, an organization might choose to run critical production workloads on Amazon EC2 while migrating non-critical workloads to Google Compute Engine.

Regardless of whether you are using a public, private, or hybrid cloud provider, the following core concepts need to be understood:

1. Availability Zone (AZ): An AZ is a physically isolated zone in a region that contains redundant components, such as servers, networking devices, and power supplies. Each AZ is completely independent of all other zones in the same region. It provides high availability and reliability for cloud resources.

2. Region: A region is a set of AZs within a geographic area, which offers resilient, fault tolerant, and highly available cloud infrastructure. Regions usually span multiple countries or even continents and support a wide range of services, such as virtual machine instances, block storage volumes, and database systems. Different regions may differ in terms of location, accessibility, and latency, but each region is connected via high-speed interconnects.

3. Edge Cloud: An edge cloud serves near-real-time application traffic and intelligent decision-making. It operates close to end-user devices and reduces bandwidth consumption by caching frequently accessed content closer to those devices. Edge clouds serve critical applications such as video streaming, gaming, and automotive dashboards.

4. Multi-Cloud Strategy: A multi-cloud strategy involves integrating multiple cloud providers to address various business needs. The strategy enables organizations to leverage the best of different clouds while still maintaining control over their own data. The strategy helps to reduce costs, meet compliance requirements, and gain a competitive advantage over rivals.

5. Global Accelerator: A global accelerator is a network layer device designed to improve the performance, availability, and responsiveness of applications by directing user traffic to optimal endpoints globally. It acts as a single point of entry for incoming traffic that then distributes requests to the right endpoint. Global Accelerators help to increase application speed and reduce latency for clients around the globe.

These concepts form the foundation of understanding the evolution of cloud computing in the past few years. However, it’s important to note that not every company wants to move their entire infrastructure to a third party provider or back to a traditional data center. Some companies may prefer to keep certain applications on premises, while moving other applications to a cloud provider. Therefore, it’s crucial to understand the benefits and drawbacks of adopting a hybrid or multi-cloud approach to meet business needs.
