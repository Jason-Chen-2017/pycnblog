Attention mechanisms have been a hot topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research for years and they are widely used in various tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, etc. In this blog post, we will go through the applications of attention mechanisms in different natural language processing tasks like Machine Translation, Question Answering using Knowledge Bases, Text Summarization, Sentiment Analysis, etc. 

Attention mechanism is a powerful technique that can help models focus on relevant parts of inputs while ignoring irrelevant ones by attending to specific positions or elements of input sequence based on their relevance. It has been shown to be effective at boosting performance in many natural language processing tasks including but not limited to language modeling, speech recognition, question answering, named entity recognition, etc.

In general, there are two types of attention mechanisms:

1. Content-Based Attention : This involves selecting only those features which carry information relevant to current output. The algorithm calculates an alignment score between each feature and the current output token and then selects only those features with highest scores to attend. For example, in image caption generation task, the algorithm first extracts features from images using convolutional neural networks and then uses content-based attention to selectively focus on regions of interest present in the input image. 

2. Query-Based Attention : This involves calculating weights for each position in the input sequence according to how well it aligns with the query vector generated from previous hidden state. During decoding time, the model generates an intermediate representation h_i based on the weighted sum of all encoded representations where wij represents the weight given to position i of the decoder j during training. The algorithm thus encourages the network to pay more attention to specific portions of the input sequence which contain critical information about the target word being predicted. Examples include text classification tasks, document retrieval systems, chatbots, etc.

In this blog post, we will discuss four major applications of attention mechanisms in NLP tasks - Machine Translation, Question Answering using Knowledge Bases, Text Summarization, and Sentiment Analysis. We will also briefly touch upon some advanced topics related to attention mechanisms. Overall, this blog post aims to provide a comprehensive overview of attention mechanisms in NLP tasks and its application scenarios along with sample code implementations in popular deep learning libraries.

Let's get started!

## 2.Basic Concepts & Terminologies
Before going into details of attention mechanisms, let us quickly understand some basic concepts associated with them. These concepts are essential to our understanding of attention mechanisms. 

### Understanding Attention Score 
An attention score measures the relevance of one element in the input sequence to another element. It takes values between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates high relevance and 0 indicates low relevance. 

For instance, consider the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". Let's say the word "fox" should be translated to English. An attention score could be computed as follows:

**Attention Score = softmax(score(word_i))**

where score() function computes the similarity between the query vector q and the key vector k of word i. The higher the value of the attention score, the greater the importance of word i to the decision making process.

### Types of Attention Mechanisms
There are two types of attention mechanisms:

1. Content-Based Attention
2. Query-Based Attention

We will now look at these two types of attention mechanisms in detail.

#### 2.1.Content-Based Attention

Content-Based Attention focuses on encoding relevant information in the input sequence. To do so, it associates each feature with the current output token and selects only those features whose content matches with the current output token. One common way to implement content-based attention is to use a linear layer followed by a tanh activation function. The formula for computing attention weights for input sequence x and output y would be:

**a_j = tanh(W[y;x_j] + b)**

Here, W[y;x_j] is a linear combination of y and the feature corresponding to position j of x, and b is bias term. Then, a_j represents the attention weight assigned to position j of x towards the current output token y.

Once the attention weights are calculated, they can be used to compute context vectors or create weighted sums of encoded representations for the next step in the decoding process. Context vectors are simply the weighted sums of encoded representations, whereas weighted sums of encoded representations form the basis of generating the final prediction or output.

#### 2.2.Query-Based Attention

Query-Based Attention involves generating a query vector based on the previous hidden state h_(t-1). It assigns greater weights to important positions in the input sequence based on their similarity to the query vector. At decoding time, the model generates an intermediate representation h_i based on the weighted sum of all encoded representations where wij represents the weight given to position i of the decoder j during training. The query vector is obtained by applying a separate feedforward network on the last encoder hidden state h_T. The formula for computing attention weights for input sequence x and query vector q would be:

**e_i = v^T * tanh(W*h_{t-1} + U*q)*w_i/u_i**

where e_i represents the attention weight assigned to position i of x towards the query vector q, * is dot product operator, W,U are matrices applied to the last encoder hidden state h_,v is a trainable vector, w_i is a scalar parameter, and u_i is an exponentional scaling factor. After obtaining the attention weights, the model applies them to the encoded representations to obtain the context vectors or generate weighted sums of encoded representations for the next step in the decoding process. Context vectors are simply the weighted sums of encoded representations, whereas weighted sums of encoded representations form the basis of generating the final prediction or output.

Note that query-based attention requires the presence of a separate query vector generator module that maps the last encoder hidden state to the query vector. Additionally, attention mechanisms require specialized layers or functions to capture the relationships between the query vector and other aspects of the input sequence such as words, phrases or paragraphs. Therefore, query-based attention may not always perform better than content-based attention depending on the task at hand.

## 3.Applications in NLP Tasks

Now that we have understood the basics behind attention mechanisms, let's take a closer look at the applications of attention mechanisms in various natural language processing tasks. Specifically, we will discuss:

1. Machine Translation
2. Question Answering using Knowledge Bases
3. Text Summarization
4. Sentiment Analysis

Let's start by looking at Machine Translation.

### 3.1.Machine Translation

In this task, the goal is to convert source sentences from one language to another language. There are several approaches to solve this problem, ranging from statistical methods to deep learning techniques. One commonly used approach called Neural Machine Translation (NMT) consists of three main components: Encoder, Decoder, and Attention Mechanism. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of an NMT system:


The Encoder encodes the source sentence into a fixed length vector representation h_enc. The Decoder produces the target sentence word by word by taking the input word, predicting what might come next, and using the previously generated words to guide its choice. During training, teacher forcing is used to force the Decoder to produce the correct target word at each timestep instead of using its own predictions. The Attention Mechanism helps the Decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each word. A single softmax classifier is used to calculate the probability distribution over possible target words based on the context vectors produced by the Decoder.

Another approach called Transformer is gaining popularity due to its ability to handle long sequences and parallelize computation efficiently. Transformers replace RNNs with self-attention modules, reducing complexity and speeding up training compared to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). A transformer consists of multiple sublayers: multi-head attention, fully connected layers, and positional encoding. Each sublayer is responsible for capturing a different aspect of the input sequence and producing the appropriate output representation. The following figure shows the architecture of a transformer system:



Finally, recent advancements in NLP technologies allow us to achieve accurate translations even for rare or out-of-vocabulary words. This comes thanks to transfer learning techniques and pre-trained embeddings. Pre-trained embedding models are trained on large corpora of data and can be fine-tuned on new languages to improve accuracy. Some examples of open-source pre-trained models include BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa. Transfer learning enables us to leverage these pre-trained models without having to train them from scratch, resulting in faster convergence times and improved accuracy.
