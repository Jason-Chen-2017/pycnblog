# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted for real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous driving and game playing. Despite its successful performance on complex tasks, there are still many open questions left for researchers to answer, especially how can we take advantage of the recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology to develop new RL algorithms that solve challenging problems more effectively. In this article, we propose a systematic approach to finding important directions in RL research by considering five key factors: task complexity, model structure, data efficiency, algorithm design, and transfer learning. We will discuss these factors from a theoretical perspective and give several examples to illustrate their importance in practical RL systems. Finally, we also list some open challenges that need further exploration in future RL research and suggest possible solutions based on our observations. This article is expected to be a useful resource for both practitioners and researchers who want to pursue DRL techniques for solving more difficult RL problems.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a promising solution to address the challenge of hard exploration in RL settings with large state spaces and high-dimensional action spaces. Recently, there have been multiple papers presenting different approaches using neural networks as function approximators or combining them with other machine learning methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, little work has examined whether and which combination of factors affects the effectiveness of DRL algorithms and whether the best strategies could be transferred across environments. To address these issues, we propose a systematic methodology to identify the most critical factors affecting the development of DRL algorithms. Specifically, we aim at identifying the contribution of each factor to improving the overall performance of DRL algorithms while keeping it simple enough so that practitioners can easily understand and apply the ideas.

In this section, we briefly introduce the core concepts, terms and technical principles of DRL. We will use related works and field studies as references when necessary.

3.1 强化学习（Reinforcement learning）
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how agents learn from interaction with their environment. The agent learns to maximize cumulative reward over time by selecting actions that yield the highest reward given the current state of the world. The term "reinforcement" refers to the idea that rewards may not always be immediate, but instead depend on long-term goals or penalties that must be achieved over a certain period of time. 

3.2 深度强化学习（Deep reinforcement learning）
The Deep Q Network (DQN), one of the most popular deep RL algorithms, is designed to leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from raw pixels from observation space. It combines CNN architecture with a deep fully connected network to estimate action values. DQN outperforms traditional RL algorithms like Policy Gradient due to its ability to handle large and continuous action spaces efficiently. Other deep RL algorithms include AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero, and MuZero, all of which combine deep learning techniques with tree search algorithms.

3.3 模型结构（Model structure）
A good model structure can significantly improve the quality of learned policy. Various models have been proposed including linear value functions, deep Q networks, attention mechanisms, or actor-critic models. Linear value functions predict state-value functions directly, while deep Q networks use convolutional layers to capture rich visual information. Attention mechanisms focus on relevant parts of input sequences, allowing the agent to focus on different parts of the image at different times. Actor-critic models jointly optimize two policies: one for selecting actions, and another for estimating state-action values.

3.4 数据效率（Data efficiency）
Training a deep RL agent requires large amounts of training data, which can become prohibitively expensive and time-consuming if collected from scratch. Transfer learning is a technique used to mitigate the lack of sufficient training data in RL by leveraging pre-trained models trained on similar tasks. Fine-tuning the weights of the pre-trained model on a specific task allows it to adapt to the target task better without requiring extensive retraining. 

3.5 算法设计（Algorithm design）
Different algorithms have been developed for DRL including proximal policy optimization (PPO), trust region policy optimization (TRPO), deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG), and twin delayed DDPG. Each algorithm addresses different aspects of the problem, making them suitable for different types of problems or tradeoffs between computation speed and stability. 

3.6 迁移学习（Transfer learning）
Transfer learning is a common technique in deep learning where pre-trained models are fine-tuned on a specific task to enhance its accuracy. By transferring knowledge learned from one domain to another, the agent can generalize better to new domains that are unrelated to the original training environment. 

# 4.论文要点
In summary, we propose a systematic approach to identifying the most critical factors affecting the development of DRL algorithms by examining five key factors: task complexity, model structure, data efficiency, algorithm design, and transfer learning. Based on our observations, the following guidelines should be followed when developing DRL algorithms:

1. Consider the intrinsic complexity of the problem: Most DRL algorithms assume the underlying MDP is known and easy to compute. As a result, they may fail to achieve optimal performance in scenarios where the MDP is highly non-stationary or stochastic. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully consider the properties of the problem and explore potential solutions to overcome any obstacles. 

2. Choose appropriate models: There are various options available for building models that provide different benefits depending on the type of problem being addressed. For example, linear models offer fast learning times and easier interpretability, while deep models allow for higher expressivity and flexibility. Different choices of model architectures can impact the stability and sample efficiency of the resulting policy.  

3. Use efficient data collection and storage: Collecting large amounts of data is essential for training RL agents. Data efficiency plays a crucial role in achieving optimal results. Efficient sampling schemes such as prioritized experience replay or hindsight experience replay can help reduce correlation among samples, leading to faster convergence rates. Moreover, storing and managing datasets can often involve significant overhead, limiting scalability and cost. 

4. Exploit algorithmic insights: Understanding and exploiting the intrinsic structure of the MDP can lead to faster learning and improved stability. Algorithms such as PPO and TRPO exploit trust regions and adaptive curvature updates to make incremental improvements to the policy during training, respectively. Alternatively, algorithms such as DDPG and twin delayed DDPG employ off-policy algorithms that train a separate critic network to perform an auxiliary task, improving data efficiency and stabilizing the learning process. 

5. Leverage transfer learning: With limited training data, transfer learning offers a promising way to improve the performance of DRL algorithms. Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on a specific task, leading to greater transferability than starting from scratch. Moreover, domain randomization or distribution shifts can help the agent adapt to new environments and increase robustness to variations in the real world. 

We also discuss several examples to illustrate the importance of each factor in practice. Lastly, we summarize the open challenges and suggestions for future research, covering areas such as continual learning and adversarial attacks. Overall, this paper aims to provide practical guidance for practitioners and researchers who want to build advanced DRL algorithms for solving challenging RL problems.
