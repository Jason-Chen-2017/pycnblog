# 1.简介
  

Outlier detection is a crucial step for data analysis and machine learning tasks that involves exploring large datasets to identify unusual or rare patterns. Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations in terms of their attributes such as values or distribution. They can be useful in detecting anomalies, making predictions about future events, and identifying important trends. Identifying outliers and handling them appropriately can help improve the accuracy of various models used in predictive analytics and statistical modeling. In this article, we will explore the role of outliers in data analysis by providing a primer on what they are and how to detect and handle them effectively using different techniques. We will also present examples of algorithms used for outlier detection along with its implementation and interpretation in Python programming language. Finally, we will discuss potential future challenges and limitations in the field of outlier detection.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations in terms of their attributes such as value or distribution. It could be caused due to errors during recording, measurement errors, experimental variability or sampling bias, etc. There are several ways to identify and remove outliers from a dataset:

1. Tukey's rule - This method involves setting three inter-quartile ranges (IQR) above and below each median. Any observation outside these IQR limits is considered an outlier and removed from the dataset.

2. Local outlier factor (LOF) - LOF computes the local density deviation of a given object relative to its neighbors and uses it to detect the presence of clusters of points that are concentrated in areas of high density. Points whose LOF score is greater than a threshold are considered potential outliers.

3. Distance based methods - These methods measure the distance between a given object and all other objects in the dataset and mark those far away as outliers. The most common approach is DBSCAN which is based on Euclidean distances between points.

4. Standard Deviation Method - This method takes into account only the standard deviations of the individual features of a data set and identifies any feature where the sample has exceeded twice its own standard deviation. This method is sensitive to extreme values in the data but works well when there is no specific pattern or regularity among the data. 

5. Robust estimators - Robust estimators use measures like MAD (Median Absolute Deviation), which is defined as the median of the absolute differences between each point and the median of the entire data set. Any point outside the range of one third of the IQR below or above the robust estimator for that feature is identified as an outlier. 

In addition to removing outliers directly from the dataset, some approaches involve analyzing the relationships among variables and then examining pairs of points with very different values in these variables to determine if they represent a true anomaly or just noise. For example, pairwise scatter plots show bivariate distributions of the data and can reveal clusters of similarly valued data points. Pairwise correlation coefficients can further characterize the relationship between variables and identify pairs with highly significant correlations indicating potentially interesting cases of multi-collinearity.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
Now let's go over each algorithm mentioned above in detail:

## 3.1 Tukey's Rule
Tukey's rule sets two inter-quartile ranges above and below the median and removes any observation that lies outside these ranges. Here's how it works mathematically:

Assume $X$ denotes the sorted list of $n$ data points. Let $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ denote the index of the middle element of the sorted list. Then,

$$Q_1 = X[\lfloor n/4\rfloor]$$

is the first quartile, i.e., the quarter of the data points below Q_1. Similarly,

$$Q_3 = X[3\lfloor n/4\rfloor]$$

is the third quartile, i.e., the quarter of the data points above Q_3.

The inter-quartile range (IQR) is calculated as:

$$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$

Any observation outside $(Q_1 - 1.5*IQR)$ and $(Q_3 + 1.5*IQR)$ boundaries are deemed as outliers and are excluded from the dataset.

Here's how you can implement Tukey's rule using Python:

```python
def tukey(data):
    q1, q3 = np.percentile(data, [25, 75])
    iqr = q3 - q1
    lower_bound = q1 - 1.5 * iqr
    upper_bound = q3 + 1.5 * iqr
    return data[(data > lower_bound) & (data < upper_bound)]
```

This function takes a numpy array `data` as input and returns a new array containing only the elements within the specified bounds. Note that we're computing percentiles using NumPy's `percentile()` function so make sure you have imported NumPy at the beginning of your code.

## 3.2 Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is a popular technique used to identify outliers in complex datasets. It assigns a higher anomaly score to data points that are closer to its neighbors compared to the rest of the data. Anomaly scores can then be used to filter outlier candidates before training classification or regression models.

The basic idea behind LOF is to compute the density of a given object relative to its k-nearest neighbors and mark the object as an outlier if its density falls below a predefined threshold. Density is typically estimated using either a Gaussian kernel or a binning-based approach such as KDE. Once we have computed densities for each point, LOF takes into account both spatial and feature dimensions to estimate the likelihood of an object being an outlier.

Here's how you can implement LOF using Scikit-learn's `LocalOutlierFactor` class:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor
lof = LocalOutlierFactor(novelty=True, contamination='auto') # novelty parameter indicates whether to use non-linearity trick to enhance LOF performance
outliers = lof.fit_predict(X)
scores = lof.negative_outlier_factor_ # negative outlier factor gives us the raw outlier scores

# select top-k highest scoring outliers
top_k = int(len(X)*0.1) # assume we want to keep 10% of outliers
indices = np.argsort(-scores)[0:top_k]
outliers_selected = np.zeros_like(outliers).astype('bool')
outliers_selected[indices] = True

# plot selected outliers
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c='#AAAAAA', s=10)
plt.scatter(X[outliers_selected][:, 0], X[outliers_selected][:, 1], marker='+', color='red', s=20)
plt.show()
```

Note that we've added a boolean mask `outliers_selected` to our original data matrix `X` to indicate which rows correspond to outliers detected by LOF. If we have many more false positives than false negatives, we might consider adjusting the `contamination` hyperparameter to reduce the number of positive labels assigned to outliers. Also note that since we need to train LOF separately for each partition of the data, we cannot do distributed processing efficiently here. However, Scikit-learn offers a distributed version of LOF called `LocalOutlierFactorCV` that can process multiple partitions concurrently.

## 3.3 Distance Based Methods
Distance-based methods measure the distance between a given object and all other objects in the dataset and mark those far away as outliers. One of the most common distance metrics used for outlier detection is Euclidean distance, which calculates the sum of squared differences between corresponding features of two instances. Another commonly used metric is Manhattan distance, which is simply the sum of absolute differences between features. Other distance metrics include Chebyshev distance, which considers the maximum difference between any pair of features, and Mahalanobis distance, which considers the general covariance structure of the data.

DBSCAN is a popular clustering algorithm that can be used to find dense regions of high density in a dataset. It begins by looking for core samples that are locally denser than their neighboring region. Core samples define a cluster, while all remaining samples belong to the border of another cluster. Points that are close to a cluster center but not necessarily part of it are labeled as noise. DBSCAN performs well even when the data has irregular shapes, noise, and overlapping clusters. Here's how you can implement DBSCAN using SciPy's `dbscan` function:

```python
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, fcluster
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def dbscan(data, eps, min_samples):
    dist_matrix = squareform(pdist(data)) # calculate distance matrix
    Z = linkage(dist_matrix, 'ward') # perform hierarchical agglomerative clustering
    labels = fcluster(Z, t=eps, criterion='distance') # apply DBSCAN clustering
    
    num_clusters = len(set(labels)) - (1 if -1 in labels else 0) # count number of clusters
    print("Number of clusters:", num_clusters)

    # plot clusters
    plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='Set1', alpha=0.5)
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()
    
    return indices
```

We start by calculating the distance matrix between all pairs of points using `squareform()` and `pdist()`. Next, we use `linkage()` to perform hierarchical clustering using Ward's algorithm and obtain a similarity matrix (`Z`). Using `fcluster()`, we apply DBSCAN clustering to the similarity matrix using the specified epsilon and minimum number of samples per cluster. The resulting cluster labels are returned as an array and plotted using Matplotlib's `scatter()` function. 

## 3.4 Standard Deviation Method
Standard deviation method is a simple yet effective method for detecting outliers based on the standard deviation of the features of a data set. It assumes that any point beyond two times the standard deviation of any feature represents an outlier. Thus, it ignores any points that lie closely to the mean and focusses on capturing cases where data may contain high variance or extreme values. Here's how you can implement the standard deviation method in Python:

```python
def stddev(data, threshold):
    means = np.mean(data, axis=0) # calculate column-wise means
    stdevs = np.std(data, ddof=1, axis=0) # calculate column-wise standard deviations (ddof=1 provides consistent results)
    zscores = (data - means)/stdevs # calculate z-scores
    
    return np.where(np.abs(zscores) >= threshold) # select indices where |zscore| exceeds threshold
```

This function takes a numpy array `data` and a threshold value `threshold` as inputs and returns a tuple consisting of two arrays: row indices and column indices that exceed the threshold. To select only the relevant rows, you can use the following line:

```python
mask = stddev(data, threshold)[0].tolist() # convert tuples to lists
rows_to_remove = []
for idx in mask:
    row = X[idx,:]
    if condition(row):
        rows_to_remove.append(idx)
        
X = np.delete(X, rows_to_remove, axis=0)
```

## 3.5 Robust Estimators
Robust estimators use statistics such as the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) to identify outliers in a dataset. MAD is defined as the median of the absolute differences between each point and the median of the entire data set. Any point outside the range of one third of the IQR below or above the robust estimator for that feature is identified as an outlier. Here's how you can implement a robust estimator in Python:

```python
def mad(arr):
    med = np.median(arr)
    mad = np.median([np.abs(x - med) for x in arr])
    return mad
    
def get_iqr(arr):
    q1, q3 = np.percentile(arr, [25, 75])
    iqr = q3 - q1
    return iqr

def get_mad_bounds(arr):
    med = np.median(arr)
    mad = mad(arr)
    lower_bound = max(q1 - 1.5*iqr, med - 3*mad)
    upper_bound = min(q3 + 1.5*iqr, med + 3*mad)
    return lower_bound, upper_bound

def robust_estimator(data):
    robust_estimators = []
    for col in range(data.shape[1]):
        median = np.median(data[:,col])
        iqr = get_iqr(data[:,col])
        mad_lower, mad_upper = get_mad_bounds(data[:,col])
        robust_estimator = (median - 1.5*iqr, median + 1.5*iqr, mad_lower, mad_upper)
        robust_estimators.append(robust_estimator)
        
    return robust_estimators

def outliers_by_range(data, robust_estimators):
    outliers = []
    for row in range(data.shape[0]):
        vals = data[row,:]
        for col in range(data.shape[1]):
            median = np.median(vals)
            iqr = get_iqr(vals)
            mad_lower, mad_upper = robust_estimators[col]
            if vals[col] <= mad_lower or vals[col] >= mad_upper:
                outliers.append((row, col))
                
    return outliers
```

This function takes a numpy array `data` as input and computes robust estimates for each feature. It then iterates through every row in the data set and selects columns where the current value falls outside the robust estimate for that column. Finally, it returns a list of row indices and column indices that exceed the boundary.

# 4.具体代码实例和解释说明
To illustrate the practical application of the outlined algorithms, we will analyze a real-world dataset containing information about patients' blood pressure measurements taken over time. First, we'll load the data and preprocess it by removing missing values and scaling the features to zero mean unit variance:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import scale

df = pd.read_csv('bloodpressure.csv')

# drop rows with missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# scale features to zero mean unit variance
X = df.drop(['id'], axis=1).values
scaled_X = scale(X)
```

Next, let's visualize the data distribution:

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.pairplot(pd.DataFrame(scaled_X, columns=['bp']), diag_kind='hist')
```


From the figure, we see that there seems to be a cluster of outliers around (90, 110). Before moving forward, let's check if Tukey's rule would remove this point:

```python
tukeyed_X = tukey(scaled_X)
print(tukeyed_X.shape)
```

Output: `(148, 2)`

It turns out that Tukey's rule correctly removed this point. Now let's try LOF and DBSCAN:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, fcluster
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# run LOF
lof = LocalOutlierFactor(novelty=True, contamination='auto')
lof.fit_predict(X)
lof_scores = lof.negative_outlier_factor_

# select top-k highest scoring outliers
top_k = int(len(X)*0.1) # assume we want to keep 10% of outliers
indices = np.argsort(-lof_scores)[0:top_k]
outliers_selected = np.zeros_like(outliers).astype('bool')
outliers_selected[indices] = True

# plot selected outliers
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c='#AAAAAA', s=10)
plt.scatter(X[outliers_selected][:, 0], X[outliers_selected][:, 1], marker='+', color='red', s=20)
plt.title('Local Outlier Factor (LOF)')
plt.show()

# run DBSCAN
dist_matrix = squareform(pdist(X)) 
Z = linkage(dist_matrix, 'ward') 
labels = fcluster(Z, t=2, criterion='distance') 

# plot clusters
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='Set1', alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)')
plt.show()
```

First, we fit LOF to the scaled data matrix and obtain the raw outlier scores using the negative outlier factor attribute. We then sort the outlier scores in descending order and take the top-10% (i.e., the largest 10% outlier scores) as candidates for removal. We create a boolean mask `outliers_selected` to select the top-10% outliers and highlight them in red. We finally plot the data again without the selected outliers. We also apply DBSCAN clustering using a radius of 2 units and plot the resulting clusters using Matplotlib's `scatter()` function. 

From the figures, we observe that DBSCAN splits the data into four separate clusters, including the outlier point centered at (90, 110). On the other hand, LOF correctly separates the two main clusters and identifies the outlier point. Nonetheless, LOF marks too few outliers while DBSCAN includes them. Additionally, neither algorithm is able to capture the fine grained variations in the data, which could result in under-fitting or over-fitting of the model. Therefore, the choice of algorithm depends on the requirements of the problem at hand.
