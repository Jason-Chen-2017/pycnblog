Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved tremendous success in solving challenging tasks such as robotics and video games. However, the conventional DRL algorithms are still computationally expensive and may not be practical in real-world applications with high-dimensional observations and complex actions spaces. To address this problem, several works proposed cooperative coevolutionary approaches to find solutions that can adaptively trade off between exploration and exploitation during training of deep reinforcement learning agents. In this work, we propose a novel approach called collaborative coevolution (COL), which is capable of finding optimal policies at low computational cost by jointly evolving neural networks, value functions, policy function, and behavior policies using cooperation. We evaluate COL on different environments from OpenAI Gym and show that it significantly outperforms other existing approaches such as multi-agent techniques or transfer learning methods. Additionally, we present results showing that COL requires fewer interactions than individual agent training and achieves better performance compared to purely independent training when agent populations are large enough. Finally, we demonstrate how COL can scale up to larger agent populations while maintaining high efficiency through efficient message passing mechanisms based on asynchronous parallel updates. Overall, our research highlights the importance of designing effective strategies for jointly optimizing multiple aspects of deep reinforcement learning agents including network architectures, value functions, policy functions, and behavior policies.

* Agent: An autonomous decision-making entity that interacts with an environment through observation, action selection, and feedback. The term "agent" refers to any entity involved in an interaction with an environment whether human or artificial.
* Environment: A physical or virtual world where the agent(s) act. It provides the agent with information about its surroundings and allows it to make decisions accordingly.
* Observation space: The set of all possible observations that the agent receives from the environment. This includes both raw visual input and structured data such as textual instructions, object locations, etc.
* Action space: The set of possible actions that the agent can choose from given an observation. Actions could include movements, shooting, playing music, etc., depending on the task being solved.
* Policy: A mapping from state to action. Given an observation, the agent selects an action according to its learned strategy. Different policies may have different levels of accuracy and completeness.
* Value function: Estimates the expected future reward obtained by taking a particular action from a given state. It takes into account factors such as current and future rewards, uncertainty in the model, and knowledge of the agent's prior experiences.
* Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL): Machine learning technique used to train artificial intelligence agents that learn to take actions in an environment to maximize their reward signal. Deep RL involves building deep neural networks that can represent the agent's policy and value functions, allowing them to perform complex tasks like navigation, control, and speech recognition without explicit programming.
* Transfer learning: Process of transferring knowledge learned from one task to another related but separate task, resulting in improved generalization ability of the second task. Transfer learning is commonly used in supervised learning settings to leverage preexisting models trained on diverse datasets for a specific task and improve performance on new, similar datasets.
* Multi-agent system: A type of artificial intelligence system consisting of multiple interacting agents within the same environment. Each agent acts independently towards the overall goal, but they coordinate their activities to achieve it more effectively.
* Explore/Exploit dilemma: The challenge of balancing exploratory actions with exploitative ones in order to obtain the most valuable information efficiently and avoid getting trapped in local minima.
* Collaborative coevolution: Technique that combines genetic algorithms with cooperation amongst multiple components to optimize parameters of an agent simultaneously and efficiently.
* Genetic algorithm: Popular metaheuristic used for optimization problems involving discrete variables. It works by mating parents to create offspring with genes inherited from either parent. The process continues until a satisfactory solution is reached.
