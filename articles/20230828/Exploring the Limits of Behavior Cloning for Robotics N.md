Behavior cloning (BC) is a machine learning technique that enables robots to imitate behaviors performed by humans in a virtual environment such as an open world setting or a physical world. The goal of BC is to learn the mapping between high-level commands and low-level actions from demonstrations so that it can perform a wide range of tasks with high accuracy. However, recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have shown that even powerful neural networks can be trained using only raw sensory inputs without any guidance from human demonstrations. In this work, we explore the limits of BC on realistic robotic navigation problems where the learned skills are challenging enough to require extensive training data collection and may not generalize well to unseen environments. We propose new algorithms called Augmented BC (ABC), which incorporates exploration strategies into behavior cloning to enable better transferability across different environments and avoid catastrophic forgetting. To evaluate ABC's performance, we train it on four simulated robotic navigation tasks and two real-world tasks: Turtlebot with manual control and Dexterous Manipulation with interactive manipulation in three dimensions.

This paper presents technical details related to ABC's implementation and evaluation. Firstly, we discuss how various exploration techniques could help ABC to achieve better transferability and adaptation ability in different scenarios. Next, we explain our approach to handle longitudinal dynamics during interaction, which ensures accurate movement of both body and arms of the agent during demosynthesis. Additionally, we show results obtained using different types of feedback signals, including visual observations, proprioceptive measurements, and motor torques. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for future research directions that can benefit from our contributions.

# 2.相关工作 Background
Behavior cloning (BC) has been used extensively in robotics for years but has recently received significant attention due to its success in sim-to-real transferability. It involves feeding recorded demonstrations to a controller and attempting to recreate those actions within some sort of simulation or reality. Reinforcement learning has also been applied successfully in similar settings with the intention of training policies directly from demonstration replay. Despite these successes, there remain challenges when applying BC to practical applications where large amounts of demonstrated data are required, making fine-tuning and domain knowledge assumptions necessary. Furthermore, the traditional way of handling exploration via random sampling does not take into account the uncertainty introduced by the model and is prone to getting stuck at local optima. Many other approaches have been proposed to address these issues, however their effectiveness still needs to be verified in practice. Our goal is to investigate one particular algorithm that combines exploration techniques with BC and attempt to build upon this idea to overcome its limitations and bring about improved capabilities. Specifically, we introduce Augmented BC (ABC) along with several additional features designed to enhance transferability and robustness.

## 3.1 Behavior Cloning (BC)
Behavior Cloning (BC) refers to a type of artificial intelligence technique that learns to replicate human behavior through recording and playback of demonstrations [1]. The system takes input data representing the observed state of the environment, applies a set of predetermined rules to transform it into an action output, then records the resulting action in a database. During testing time, the system generates output actions based solely on the current observation, ignoring the previous recordings. By analyzing the relationship between the recorded action sequences and the corresponding input states, the system is able to predict what actions will occur in the future given a certain starting point. In simple terms, behavior cloning systems use expert demonstrations to create a model of the desired task and generate outputs that match the same sequence of actions repeatedly. 

The process of BC requires careful design of the environment, reward function, and training regimen to ensure that the generated model represents the underlying structure of the problem space accurately. This can lead to suboptimal solutions when the environmental conditions change significantly, leading to instability or inefficiency in the production system. Although BC has proven itself effective in many domains, it is limited by the requirements of the demonstrator, particularly the need for consistent and complete demonstrations to cover all possible variations of behavior. As a result, it is important to consider alternative methods for generating synthetic data that capture more complex interactions between the agent and the surrounding environment. 


## 3.2 Exploration Strategies
Exploration is essential in order to find novel and diverse behaviors that were not available during training. Random exploration is often the first step taken towards finding novel solutions to RL problems, but it tends to get trapped at shallow depths and quickly becomes too boring. Moreover, while greedy optimization techniques like Q-learning tend to converge to global optimality fairly quickly, they become increasingly less helpful if there is no diversity among the explored actions. Therefore, techniques that provide more efficient exploration with respect to the available information such as Bayesian Optimization or Thompson Sampling are critical components of modern exploration strategies. 

## 3.3 Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a class of machine learning algorithms that leverage the power of Neural Networks to solve decision making problems. DRL models represent the policy as a sequence of actions and captures the interaction between the agent and the environment through Markov Decision Process (MDP). It is inspired by the behavior of animal brains where the higher level cognitive processes such as planning, memory, and reasoning influence the lower level neural activities. The most popular deep reinforcement learning method currently employed is Policy Gradient Methods (PGMs). These methods utilize gradients of rewards backpropagated through the network to update the parameters of the policy network iteratively. While PGMs can converge faster than standard value iteration, they often suffer from the "exploding gradient" issue that makes them difficult to optimize.


## 3.4 Decoupling Dynamics from Feedback
In robotics, dynamic properties such as forces, velocities, and accelerations play a crucial role in determining the motion of objects in space. Without proper modeling, these factors cannot be properly integrated into the control loop. Previous works typically assume that the joint angles or positions computed from raw sensor measurements alone suffice to fully characterize the state of the system. In contrast, we argue that the correct interpretation of raw sensor measurements must depend on the effects of the contact force, velocity, and acceleration acting on the objects in the environment. This means that direct integration of these quantities would compromise their interpretability and cause errors in the predicted trajectories. Hence, we propose a framework called Interaction-based Learning (Ibl) that separates the effects of feedback on the object’s state from the object's dynamics. The former determines the target states for imitation learning, while the latter provides useful feedback signals to guide the agent during demo synthesis. Ibl can assist robots with reaching and grasping in uncertain environments by allowing us to specify explicit goals in addition to potentially ambiguous demonstrations.
