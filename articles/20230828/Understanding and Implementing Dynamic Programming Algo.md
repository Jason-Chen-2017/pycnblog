# 1.简介
  

Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental problem-solving technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently. In DP algorithms, the optimal solutions to these subproblems are saved so they can be reused in later calculations instead of being recalculated each time. The key idea behind DP algorithms is to use previously computed values for future computations, rather than computing them all over again from scratch. This approach reduces computational complexity significantly, especially when solving large problems with overlapping subproblems. DP has been around since the mid-19th century, but it has only recently become popular due to its practicality and versatility in handling many real-world problems. 

In this article, we will discuss some common dynamic programming techniques such as memoization, tabulation, iterative vs recursive approaches, and recurrence relations, and then implement several examples using Python. We hope that by reading this article you'll gain an understanding of how DP works and learn to apply it in your own projects!

# 3.Introduction to Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming (DP) is a powerful tool for optimizing complicated functions or decision processes. It breaks down a larger problem into smaller subproblems which are easy to solve individually. Once the results for those subproblems have been calculated, DP uses them to calculate the answer to the original problem. DP allows us to optimize our decisions more efficiently by avoiding redundant work and exploiting relationships between similar subproblems.

There are two main types of DP problems: optimization problems and decision problems. Optimization problems involve finding the maximum or minimum value of some function while decision problems involve choosing a specific action among multiple options.

Optimization problems typically involve finding the best possible solution within certain constraints. For example, consider the problem of selecting k items from a set of n items where the order of selection does not matter and no item may be selected more than once. In this case, the objective is to find the combination of k items that maximizes the total value of the items chosen. Other examples include scheduling tasks on a calendar or allocating resources to maximize profit or cost.

Decision problems typically require making choices among actions based on certain criteria. These include optimization problems like assigning staff to jobs, picking out items from inventory based on their relative value, and routing vehicles for deliveries. Decision problems also arise in areas such as machine learning and game theory where we need to choose actions to maximize reward or minimize loss.

The core idea behind DP is to break down a complex problem into simpler subproblems, save the results of those subproblems, and reuse them in later computations. Depending on the algorithm used, we might come up with different ways of formulating subproblems and updating the final result. Let's take a look at some basic concepts and terminology before moving on to DP algorithms.

### 3.1. Basic Concepts
We start by looking at some basic concepts related to dynamic programming:

1. Optimal substructure property: A given problem can be broken down into a set of smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has an optimal solution, and the optimal solution for the overall problem depends upon the optimal solutions of its subproblems. Therefore, if the optimal solution to any one subproblem changes, then the optimal solution to the entire problem must change as well. For example, suppose we want to make change for $n$ units using coins of denominations $\{d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k\}$. If we have already found the most optimal way to make change for $i$ units, then we know that the optimal solution for $n$ units involves either including a coin of size $d_{j}$ in addition to the previous optimal solution or excluding that coin altogether. 

2. Overlapping Subproblems: Two subproblems overlap if the input data is identical and can be solved independently. In other words, solving one of the subproblems will allow us to reuse the results for the other subproblem.

3. Memoization: Memoization refers to storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This is done to reduce the number of expensive function calls required to compute the results. In DP, we often cache intermediate results to improve performance and reduce memory usage. 

Here's an example of the memoization implementation in Python:

```python
def fib(n):
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Check if we have already memoized the result
    if 'fib' in mem and n in mem['fib']:
        return mem['fib'][n]
    
    # Compute the Fibonacci number recursively without memoization
    res = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    
    # Cache the result
    if 'fib' not in mem:
        mem['fib'] = {}
    mem['fib'][n] = res
    
    return res
```

In the above code, `mem` is a dictionary that stores the memoized results. The base cases are handled separately, followed by checking if the result is already memoized. If yes, we simply retrieve the cached result. Otherwise, we compute the Fibonacci number recursively and store it in the dictionary alongside the index. Finally, we return the result. Note that the function modifies the global variable `mem`. To avoid this issue, we could pass the memoization dictionary explicitly to the function. 


### 3.2. Terminology
Next, let's look at some terminology commonly used in dynamic programming:

1. Cut-Rod Problem: This problem asks to determine the highest point achieved by cutting a rod and selling the pieces obtained. It belongs to the class of combinatorial optimization problems known as the Knapsack problem.

2. Binomial Coefficient: This represents the number of combinations of $n$ elements taken $r$ at a time. It comes up frequently in the context of DP because it simplifies calculation of binomial probabilities.

3. Bellman-Ford Algorithm: This algorithm is used to detect negative cycles in graph-based systems. It starts by initializing the shortest path costs to be infinity except for the source vertex, whose cost is zero. Then, it repeatedly relaxes the distances of edges until no further improvement is possible, indicating that there exists a negative cycle. The running time of Bellman-Ford algorithm is O($mn$) in the worst case. 

4. Warshall-Floyd Algorithm: This algorithm is used to calculate the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted directed graph. The algorithm calculates the shortest paths in a single iteration by relaxing all possible edge connections between vertices. The runtime of the algorithm is O($n^3$) in the worst case. 

5. Square Matrix: A matrix that satisfies the condition that all entries are non-negative integers and every row sum to exactly one. It comes up frequently in the context of DP because multiplication of matrices is associative and commutative.

6. Triangle inequality: This states that the sum of the first $k$ numbers cannot exceed twice the largest odd integer less than $m$. It comes up frequently in the context of DP because it limits the range of valid arguments for factorials and binomial coefficients.  

### 3.3. Types of DP Problems

Now let's look at the types of dynamic programming problems:

1. Divide and conquer: This type of problem involves splitting the input into smaller instances and solving each instance recursively. The final solution is composed of the solutions of the individual instances. There are various types of divide and conquer problems, such as sorting, searching, and counting. 

2. Greedy: This type of problem involves taking local decisions based on current information. As long as the choice leads to a globally optimal solution, greedy methods perform well. One example of a greedy method is Huffman coding, which assigns shorter codes to frequent characters in a message. 

3. Branch and bound: This type of problem involves exhaustively exploring all possible branches of a search tree until a feasible solution is found or pruning unnecessary branches. The process is usually guided by heuristics, such as depth-first search and limited discrepancy pruning.

4. Dynamic Programming: This type of problem involves defining subproblems and building up a table or list of optimal solutions. Each cell in the table corresponds to an entry in the subproblem. By filling in the cells bottom-up, the final answer is obtained. One common example of a dynamic programming problem is the subset sum problem, which finds whether a given target sum can be formed from a collection of positive integers using only elements from the set {1, 2,..., m}. 

5. Integer Linear Programming: This type of problem involves finding the most efficient linear combination of variables subject to linear constraints. It falls under the category of optimization problems.

6. Shortest Path Problems: This category includes problems involving planning routes through graphs, identifying the fastest route, and minimizing fuel consumption. It has applications in transportation, logistics, energy management, and social networks.

7. Constraint Satisfaction Problems: This type of problem involves satisfying logical constraints given a set of rules. These rules represent preferences, limitations, or demands imposed on agents. It plays an important role in AI, robotics, and operations research.
