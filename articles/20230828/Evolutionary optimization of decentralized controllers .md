Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to sense and communicate with a wide range of devices at low power consumption. They have also become crucial components of various applications such as home automation, industry monitoring, and remote sensing. Despite the advantages these technologies offer, they present significant challenges for researchers who want to design robust and efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale deployment scenarios. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm based on real-valued gene expressions for optimizing the central controller of WSN networks. Our algorithm uses mathematical models to simulate different behaviors of sensors and actuators within each node, then applies genetic programming techniques to optimize the network topology, routing table and decision-making policies of all nodes while ensuring high reliability and scalability. We evaluate our method using several testbeds consisting of realistic sensor configurations and communication protocols. The results show that our approach significantly improves the quality of service in terms of delay, throughput and energy consumption compared to existing approaches while achieving high levels of resilience against failures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on simulated and real WSNs with varying topologies and node properties. Our experimental results show that our system is able to automatically adapt its behavior to different situations by minimizing control parameters during runtime. This opens up new possibilities for improving efficiency and scalability in future systems.

# 3.引言
Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are emerging technologies that enable seamless communication between numerous devices at low power consumption. These technologies promise many benefits including improved energy efficiency, reduced cost, and connectivity flexibility but also pose significant challenges when it comes to implementing reliable and secure distributed computing systems. Distributed computing systems can be designed to work well under adverse conditions such as noise, interference, loss or bit errors. While some architectures have been proposed to address these issues, most still rely heavily on complex synchronization mechanisms that require careful consideration from both hardware and software engineers. 

One approach to improve reliability and security in WSNs is to use centralized controllers that coordinate the activities of all nodes. Centralized controllers can provide better fault tolerance, faster recovery from failures, and more efficient resource utilization. However, building such a highly reliable and secure controller requires immense expertise and resources which may not always be available. Furthermore, controlling a large number of nodes simultaneously poses additional challenges, making even simple improvements challenging to implement and maintain. 

In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm based on real-valued gene expressions for optimizing the central controller of WSN networks. We call this method Real-Coded Genetic Programming (RCGP). RCGP explores the parameter space of the WSN system through a set of rules expressed as a Boolean formula with input variables representing sensor values and output variables representing actuator commands. Each rule corresponds to one agent in the controller's decision-making process, and a collection of rules constitutes the behavioral model of the controller. By using real-valued genotypes rather than binary ones, RCGP enables us to capture the non-linear relationships among different agent behaviors and parameters.

Our algorithm consists of three main steps: initialization, selection, and mutation. During initialization, we randomly generate a population of candidate solutions based on a specified set of rules according to certain probability distributions. Afterward, the candidates are evaluated to determine their fitness level, where higher fitness levels indicate better performance. Selection involves selecting a subset of candidates from the current generation to pass on to the next generation based on their fitness scores. Finally, mutation occurs over a small subset of selected candidates to introduce changes to the solution landscape and prevent local minima. Overall, RCGP seeks to find a combination of rules that produces good overall behavior and controls multiple agents concurrently.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 4 provides a brief overview of wireless sensor networks and motivates why they are important for application development. Next, section 5 introduces related works on distributed computing systems and demonstrates how the problem of controller optimization fits into them. Section 6 discusses the main contributions of the paper along with the evaluation results obtained using simulations and real-world testbeds. Section 7 summarizes the conclusion and future directions of the paper.
