Image captioning is one of the most popular tasks in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) today. It involves generating a description for an image that conveys its contents in human-understandable terms. The key challenge in this task is to generate captions in natural language which describe images accurately while being concise and coherent. However, achieving high accuracy requires extensive training data, annotating large datasets with carefully designed descriptions, and optimizing complex machine learning models. 

Recently, researchers have proposed various approaches to improve the performance of image captioning systems using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These methods can be classified into two categories - attention based models and sequence-to-sequence models. In this article, we will focus on building an image caption generator using a deep convolutional neural network architecture known as VGG-19. We will use the Flickr30K dataset which contains over 30,000 annotated image-caption pairs for training our model. Once trained, we will test it on the COCO dataset, which is commonly used for evaluating image captioning systems. Finally, we will discuss some limitations and potential improvements in the future work.

* **Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)** - A type of artificial neural network where inputs are passed through multiple layers of filters to extract features from the input signal or image. It has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in many domains such as object recognition, image classification and speech recognition.
* **Deep Learning** - A subset of machine learning algorithms that leverage multiple levels of representation learning to learn complex functions that map inputs to outputs. Deep learning architectures typically consist of several layers of non-linear transformation, called neurons, between the input and output layers.

The basic idea behind building an image captioning system using CNNs is to encode the visual content of an image into low dimensional vectors using a pre-trained convolutional neural network. These encoded features then serve as input to a recurrent neural network that generates the sentence describing the image. The process of encoding the visual content into vectors involves applying several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps obtained from the previous layer. The resulting feature vector is then fed into a bidirectional LSTM cell to generate the sentences.

Here's how the overall pipeline works:

1. Preprocess the data
First, we need to preprocess the data by resizing all the images to a fixed size, extracting the regions of interest, normalizing pixel values, etc. This step reduces the computational cost required later during training.

2. Extract features
Next, we use a pre-trained convolutional neural network known as VGG-19 to extract features from each image. VGG-19 is a relatively small and lightweight CNN architecture that achieves excellent results on both tasks of image classification and fine-grained image retrieval. 

We remove the last few layers of the original VGG-19 network since they include fully connected layers that are not needed for generating image captions. Instead, we add four more convolutional layers to capture contextual information about the scene and objects present in the image. 

3. Build the Model
The extracted features are then concatenated with word embeddings generated from a pre-trained GloVe embedding matrix. Word embeddings represent words in a dense vector space where similar words are placed closer to each other. For example, "house" and "building" would likely occur near each other if they are related concepts. The final input to the recurrent neural network is formed by concatenating these two representations. The entire input is processed by a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) cell that captures temporal dependencies across the caption. 

Each time step of the BiLSTM produces a hidden state vector that represents the current state of the decoder. These states are further processed by another Linear layer and softmax function to produce probability distributions over possible next words in the caption. At every time step, the predicted word is fed back into the decoder to help in predicting the subsequent words. 

4. Train the Model
Finally, we train the model using cross entropy loss function to optimize the parameters of the model. Cross entropy measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and actual labels in a multi-class classification problem. By minimizing the negative log likelihood loss, the network learns to assign higher weights to correct predictions and lower weights to incorrect ones, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the model. 
During training, we also monitor the perplexity score, which evaluates how well the model is able to predict the next word given the previously generated words. We want the perplexity score to decrease after every epoch of training, indicating that the model is learning to generate more realistic captions. If the perplexity score starts increasing instead of decreasing, it means that the model is starting to overfit the training set and may need additional regularization techniques like dropout or early stopping.
