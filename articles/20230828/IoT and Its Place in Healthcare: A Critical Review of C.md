# 1.简介
  

Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly emerging field that has gained widespread attention from industry experts across various fields including medicine, transportation, manufacturing, etc., with many researchers, entrepreneurs, developers, startups, governments, universities, and other organizations putting their ideas into practice to advance this technology. In recent years, the IoT has become an important component of modern healthcare systems that are becoming increasingly complex and interconnected due to technological advances and the resulting challenges in patient care. Despite the importance of IoT for improving healthcare outcomes and providing personalized medicine, there is limited understanding about its place within current healthcare models and how it can benefit future directions such as better decision-making, medical informatics, and advanced machine learning. Therefore, it is essential to review existing approaches and developments in this area and identify the opportunities for further development and exploitation of the potential of IoT technologies within healthcare settings. This article aims to provide a critical review of existing solutions and identify current limitations and pitfalls, as well as present promising future directions for more effective use of IoT technologies in healthcare.
# 2.Terminology and Concepts
## 2.1 Basic Terminologies
1. Physical Object vs. Virtual Object
    - Physical object refers to any tangible or physical entity like human body, animal, plant, device, etc., while virtual objects refer to digital representations of these entities like computer software, mobile app, web page, social media post, etc. The Internet of Things connects all these different types of devices together through the internet which creates a massive amount of data generated by each physical object connected via the network. To distinguish between the two types of objects, we can classify them based on whether they have fixed or movable parts i.e., sensors or actuators respectively.

2. Sensor vs. Actuator
    - Sensors detect and measure the physical quantities like temperature, pressure, humidity, acceleration, vibrations, etc., that correspond to real world phenomena. They generate electrical signals that can be interpreted by microcontrollers or other electronic devices to control or monitor some aspect of the system. On the other hand, actuators are used to manipulate or change the state of the environment or mechanical processes, enabling machines or robots to perform specific tasks. 

3. Microcontroller vs. Embedded System
    - Microcontrollers are small processing units that work independently without requiring additional peripherals. They are designed to handle simple operations quickly and efficiently, making them ideal for sensor nodes and other low-power applications where power consumption is not a concern. However, embedded systems are more powerful than microcontrollers because they include hardware components that require more power and resources. These platforms typically run operating systems like Linux, Windows, or Android, along with pre-loaded applications or programming libraries. In contrast to microcontrollers, embedded systems do not need to rely solely on software to function, but they also incorporate specialized chips or processors that enhance performance and efficiency.

4. Cloud Computing vs. Local Networking
    - Cloud computing involves sharing services over the internet through remote servers hosted on cloud providers like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or Alibaba Cloud. It provides access to scalable computing capacity, flexibility, and economies of scale, enabling businesses to host large-scale applications and databases. While local networking involves connecting multiple devices directly to one another using wired or wireless connections, such networks are often slower and less secure compared to cloud-based options.

## 2.2 Key Concepts and Measures
1. Clinical Relevance 
    - Medical professionals need to continuously evaluate new treatments, procedures, therapies, and devices, as well as improve their knowledge and skills to keep up with the evolving healthcare landscape. Providing accurate information at the right time enables patients to make informed decisions about their treatment plans. 

2. Cost Effectiveness
    - Improving patient outcomes requires significant investments in medical equipment, infrastructure, and expertise. However, relying solely on traditional biotechnology may result in costly failures when facing the ever-increasing complexity of today’s healthcare environments. By leveraging the strengths of both biology and technology, we can create new ways to optimize resource allocation, deliver personalized treatments, reduce costs, and support continuous improvement in patient care.

3. Personalization
    - With the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, VR/AR headsets, and home assistants, people now expect the same level of convenience and interactivity regardless of location or context. As a result, developing personalized medicine through the integration of sensors, algorithms, and devices becomes critical in achieving individualized healthcare. Personalization should involve analyzing user behavior, clinical history, lifestyle factors, and demographics to tailor medical advice and diagnosis to individual preferences.

4. Efficiency and Scalability
    - Increasing amounts of data collected through IoT sensors pose a challenge for managing and storing data effectively. At the same time, energy consumption must be optimized to ensure that devices can operate reliably for long periods of time without disrupting operation. Addressing these issues will require building scalable infrastructures that can process and store vast amounts of data and respond quickly to requests.

5. Privacy and Security
    - Beyond ethical considerations, privacy and security concerns must always be addressed in healthcare settings. For example, collecting sensitive patient information, even if protected by encryption standards, may jeopardize patient safety. Similarly, vulnerabilities or hacking attacks targeting public Wi-Fi networks could expose sensitive patient records.

## 2.3 Software Architecture
The architecture of a typical IoT solution comprises several key components such as gateways, edge devices, serverless functions, cloud services, and middleware layers. The following figure shows the basic overview of the overall system design:

**Gateway:**  
A gateway is responsible for transferring data between the physical world and the cloud, thus allowing interaction between the physical world and the digital world. Gateway devices gather data from various sources and send it to the cloud for storage and analysis. Gateways are capable of filtering, transforming, and analyzing data before sending it to the cloud. Additionally, gateways offer a variety of connectivity protocols such as WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa, Zigbee, cellular networks, and GPS to enable communication with the physical world.

**Edge Devices:**  
An edge device is located close to the source of data and performs a predefined set of actions such as data collection, data processing, and data transmission. Edge devices offer high speed, low latency connection to the gateway, thus minimizing delay and saving battery life. Examples of edge devices include industrial monitoring systems, video cameras, and fitness trackers.

**Serverless Functions:**  
Serverless functions are event driven functions that run code in response to triggers provided by external events or messages. Serverless functions provide an efficient way to manage and scale the compute resources required to process incoming data. Examples of serverless functions include APIs, bots, chatbots, and speech recognition engines.

**Cloud Services:**  
Cloud services are used to store, analyze, and visualize the raw data received from the gateways and edge devices. They provide flexible, scalable, and reliable infrastructure that can handle large volumes of data. Examples of cloud services include Big Data analytics tools, data visualization tools, and Machine Learning algorithms.

**Middleware Layers:**  
Middleware layers provide a platform for integrating various IoT devices and features, enhancing security, fault tolerance, and ease of management. Middleware layers can help connect devices to the cloud, handle errors and exceptions, and streamline workflows. Common examples of middleware layers include Message Brokers, Workflow Engines, Protocol Translation Tools, and Authentication and Authorization Systems.
