As of today, the number of developers who are interested in cloud computing has exploded exponentially, and there is a need for professionals to understand how serverless architecture works and implement it using their preferred programming language or framework. 

In this article, we will learn about what is serverless architecture, why should one choose it over traditional platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions etc., and finally deploy our first serverless application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.

Let's get started!

Serverless Architecture: What is it? And Why Should I Use It?
When the term “serverless” was coined by Netflix, it was not yet common knowledge. The concept of serverless was gaining traction only recently as businesses have adopted it due to its simplicity and scalability characteristics. However, it still remains an advanced technology that requires expertise from both software engineers and infrastructure specialists to master. In this article, we will focus specifically on implementing your first serverless application on AWS, but the same concepts can be applied to any other cloud provider as well. Here are some key points you should know before reading further:

1. Serverless refers to an execution model where all the infrastructure management is done automatically, without the need for manual intervention. This means that when you write your code, you don’t need to worry about provisioning servers, managing load balancers, scaling them up/down, or backing up data. All these operations are automated and managed by the underlying service provider (AWS). 

2. The main advantage of using serverless is cost-efficiency, which allows you to scale up and down based on demand and billing only for the actual resources used. Additionally, you can also use pre-built functions provided by various vendors such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or GCP Cloud Functions. You can simply upload your function package and let the vendor handle everything else.

3. One of the biggest benefits of serverless architectures is the ability to rapidly develop new features without needing to invest large amounts of time and money into creating and maintaining the entire backend infrastructure. Instead, you can just focus on building out the business logic and delegate the rest to the service providers. By doing so, you can ensure that your product is always meeting user needs at peak performance, making it competitive with monolithic applications running on conventional platforms.

Now, let us dive deeper into deploying our first serverless application on AWS:

Step 1 – Create a New IAM User
Before getting started, create a new IAM user account in your AWS console. Once created, make sure to note down the Access Key ID and Secret access key for later use.

Step 2 – Install Node.js and Configure Environment Variables
To install node.js on your local machine, please follow the instructions mentioned here: https://nodejs.org/en/. After installing, configure environment variables named AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with the values obtained from step 1. You can set these variables permanently or temporarily depending upon your operating system.

Step 3 – Initialize Project Folder and Package.json File
Create a project folder and navigate into it. Then, initialize npm by executing the command ‘npm init’ in the terminal.

Next, add the following dependencies to your package.json file:

    "aws-sdk": "^2.795.0",
    "axios": "^0.21.1"
    
These two packages will help us interact with AWS services and make HTTP requests respectively.

Step 4 – Write Code to Connect to AWS Service Using AWS SDK
Open your favorite IDE or text editor and create a JavaScript file called index.js. Inside the file, import the aws-sdk package and create a new instance of the AWS.S3() class. 

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

// Set credentials
AWS.config.update({
  region: 'us-east-1', // replace with your preferred region
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, // replace with your access key id
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY // replace with your secret access key
});

// Create S3 service client
const s3 = new AWS.S3();
```

You can now start interacting with various AWS services through the s3 object. For example, you can list buckets in your account using the below method:

```javascript
s3.listBuckets(function(err, data) {
  if (err) console.log(err);
  else console.log(data);
});
```

This will return an array of bucket objects containing information about each bucket present in your account.

Once you have successfully connected to an AWS service using the AWS SDK, move ahead to Step 5 to deploy the serverless application on AWS.

Step 5 – Deploy Serverless Function on AWS Lambda
First, go to the AWS Management Console and select the Lambda service. Click on the Create a function button and give a name to your function. Choose runtime as nodejs12.x and leave the default role selected. Now, click on the Create function button.

Next, open your code editor and paste the following code inside the lambda function editor window. Replace the dummy bucketName value with your own S3 bucket name. 

```javascript
exports.handler = async function(event, context) {
  
  const params = {
    Bucket: event.bucketName, /* required */
    Key: `lambdaTestFile-${Date.now()}.txt`, /* required */
    Body: JSON.stringify(event),
    ContentType: 'text/plain'
  };

  try {
    
    await s3.putObject(params).promise();
    return {statusCode: 200};
    
  } catch (error) {
    
    console.log("Error:", error);
    return { statusCode: 500, body: "Unable to PUT Object" };

  }
  
}
```

Here, we define a handler function that takes two parameters - event and context. Event contains the input payload sent to the function while context provides additional runtime information about the function execution. We retrieve the bucketName parameter passed along with the request using event.bucketName.

We then construct an object literal params containing the details needed to put an object in S3. Note that the key we assign to the object is dynamic and includes the current timestamp to avoid conflicts with previous uploads.

Finally, we call the s3.putObject() method with params as argument. If successful, we return a response with status code 200. Otherwise, we log the error message and return a response with status code 500. 

Save your changes and test the function using Test tab under the Lambda function page. Invoke the function with sample event payload like this: 

```json
{
  "bucketName": "yourBucketName"
}
```

The output should show the contents of the uploaded file in the specified S3 bucket.
