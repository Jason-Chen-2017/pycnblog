# 1.简介
  

As of today’s modern times, the term Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a buzzword and everyone is obsessed with building complex machine learning models that can perform tasks beyond what was possible using just traditional programming languages like C or Java. However, it's important to note that AI does not necessarily require deep knowledge of mathematical theory or computational complexity. 

In this article, we will guide you through an in-depth understanding of how to use Python to build machine learning models for various purposes such as text classification, image recognition, and predictive modeling. We will cover fundamental concepts and algorithms used by neural networks such as forward propagation, backpropagation, activation functions, regularization techniques, and others, while providing step-by-step instructions on implementing these concepts using popular libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

By the end of this article, you should be able to build powerful and accurate machine learning models within your Python code environment, whether for personal projects or industry-level applications. Moreover, by learning some basic terminology and common practices, you can apply them to more advanced topics related to AI, such as deep reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Overall, our objective is to help you develop an intelligent and interactive way of thinking about machine learning models and create new ways of leveraging data science tools to improve decision making processes.

Before diving into the technical details, let us go over some preliminary basics:

2.1.Python Basics
2.2.Linear Algebra Concepts
2.3.Probability Theory and Statistics 
2.4.Machine Learning Terminology

If you are familiar with all these concepts, feel free to skip ahead. Otherwise, I would suggest taking up some online courses on these subjects before proceeding further. 

2.1. Python Basics
To understand the fundamentals of Python, we need to familiarize ourselves with its syntax and basic constructs such as variables, lists, tuples, dictionaries, control structures, loops, and functions. If you haven't worked with Python before, you may want to take some time to familiarize yourself with the language itself. Here are some resources to get started:

1. https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/
2. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
3. http://www.practicepython.org/

2.2. Linear Algebra Concepts
We will use linear algebra throughout this article to compute weights and biases of neural networks. Be sure to have a good understanding of vector spaces, matrices, and matrix operations. You can start by reading Chapter 2 from the book "Introduction to Linear Algebra" by <NAME> and <NAME>.

2.3. Probability Theory and Statistics 
This topic is essential for understanding neural network internals. It involves probability distributions, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and descriptive statistics. Understanding these concepts is crucial for working effectively with neural networks. A great resource for learning these topics is Coursera's "Introduction to Statistical Learning". Alternatively, there are many other resources available online.

2.4. Machine Learning Terminology
Finally, here are some key terms and concepts you should know when working with machine learning. This list will grow as we move along, so make sure to check back often!
