# 2.背景介绍
Image classification refers to the task of automatically assigning category labels or tags to digital images or videos based on their content, characteristics, and relationships between objects in the scene. It has wide range of applications such as security systems, medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, gaming, e-commerce, etc. Different methods exist to solve this task using varying machine learning algorithms, deep learning frameworks, and feature extraction approaches. This article aims at giving a comprehensive review of existing image classification techniques. We begin by defining several key terms used throughout this paper. Specifically, we classify image classification techniques according to three main categories - supervised, unsupervised, and weakly-supervised. Each category focuses on different types of input data, models, and training procedures. For example, a supervised method learns from labeled data, while an unsupervised method analyzes the structure of the data without any label information. Weakly-supervised techniques can also be categorized based on whether they require human guidance or not during training. Some commonly used datasets include CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, PASCAL VOC, and MNIST. 

In general, there are two main types of image classification problems - binary and multi-class classification problems. Binary classification considers only two class labels (e.g., dog vs cat), while multi-class classification addresses multiple labels per instance (e.g., person, car, building). Other factors affecting the performance of image classifiers include dataset size, complexity of the objects present in the images, background clutter, illumination variations, scale variations, object deformation, occlusion, noise, and inter-class variation. To address these issues, various regularization techniques, model architecture designs, and preprocessing steps may be employed to improve classifier performance. Furthermore, recent advances in deep learning have made significant progress towards achieving state-of-the-art results. 

In summary, the goal of image classification is to learn meaningful representations from digital images and assign correct labels to new instances given only the images themselves. There exists many subtasks involved in solving this complex task, ranging from pre-processing steps to model architectures. Selecting the right approach depends on both the nature of the problem and available resources. Thus, it is important to carefully evaluate and select the most effective method for your specific needs.

# 3.基本概念术语说明
Before proceeding to detailed discussion of individual image classification techniques, we need to define some basic terminology and concepts. These definitions serve as a reference point for understanding the technical details of each algorithm. Let's take a look at these definitions:

1. **Feature extraction:** Feature extraction is a process of identifying distinctive features within an image and extracting them from the original image. These features can then be fed into a machine learning algorithm for classification. Common feature extraction methods include SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). 

2. **Feature representation:** A feature vector or descriptor represents the unique attributes of an image which can be used to identify its class label. Features can come in different forms such as raw pixel values, gradients, edges, textures, and shapes. They are often represented as vectors or arrays of numerical values.

3. **Bag-of-features:** Bag-of-features models represent an image as a collection of its extracted features rather than as an actual image itself. Each feature vector is assigned a weight corresponding to its importance in describing the image. The weights are learned through a training phase using machine learning algorithms. These models have shown promising results in some image recognition benchmarks.

4. **Transfer learning:** Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model on a large dataset like ImageNet is fine-tuned for a smaller but similar domain by adjusting its parameters on the target domain’s dataset. Pre-trained models are often trained on very large amounts of high-dimensional data and perform well on a variety of tasks. Once transferred to the target domain, they can adapt to the new environment more effectively and achieve higher accuracy levels.

5. **Deep neural networks (DNN):** Deep neural networks are highly flexible models capable of representing complex functions through layers of connected units. DNNs typically consist of multiple layers of hidden neurons with nonlinear activation functions. Input images are first passed through convolutional layers to extract local patterns and feed them to fully connected layers for classification.

6. **Training set, validation set, test set:** Training sets, validation sets, and test sets are used to split the data into different parts before fitting the model to ensure that the model does not overfit to the training data and accurately predicts the performance of the model on unseen data. The ratio of the sizes of these sets varies depending on the requirements of the task and the amount of data available. Typical choices include 70%-20%-10%.

7. **Hyperparameters:** Hyperparameters are parameters that influence the behavior of the model and cannot be learned from the data directly. Instead, they must be manually tuned or optimized. Common hyperparameters for DNN models include number of layers, number of neurons per layer, dropout rate, learning rate, batch size, optimizer, and loss function.

8. **Fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning is a process of adapting a pre-trained model for a new task by slightly retraining the last few layers with new data. This enables us to transfer knowledge from the pretrained model to our new task, improving accuracy on the target task.

9. **Data augmentation:** Data augmentation is a strategy for increasing the diversity of the training data by applying random transformations to the images. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalization ability of the model. Popular data augmentation techniques include rotation, scaling, flipping, cropping, shearing, brightness changes, contrast adjustment, gaussian noise injection, and blurring.

10. **Label smoothing:** Label smoothing is a regularization technique used to avoid overconfidence in the model prediction. The idea behind label smoothing is to smooth out the predicted probabilities by adding a small constant value to all predictions, including those made confidently by the model. This encourages the model to produce more robust predictions, making it less likely to make incorrect or surprising moves.
