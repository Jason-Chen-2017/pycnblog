Support vector regression(SVR) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. In this article we will discuss how to implement SVR using Python programming language.

Support vector machines (SVMs), which are also known as support vector regressors (SVRs), work by finding the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that best separates the data points into two classes or categories. The hyperplane is chosen such that it maximizes the margin between the data points, i.e., the distance from the hyperplane to the nearest data point. This technique works well when the relationship between the input variables and output variable is linear, but it becomes less effective as the complexity of the relationship increases. 

On the other hand, SVR is a variant of SVM designed specifically for solving regression problems. It uses kernel functions to transform the original input space into a higher-dimensional feature space where most of the training examples become linearly separable. The SVR model then finds the optimal hyperplane within this transformed space to minimize the squared error between predicted values and actual values. By minimizing the error instead of maximummizing the margin, SVR avoids overfitting issues caused by large margins and non-linear relationships in the dataset. 

In this tutorial, we will use the Boston Housing dataset to demonstrate how to perform SVR on the dataset. We will start with importing the required libraries, loading the dataset and splitting it into train and test sets. Then we will preprocess the dataset by scaling and standardizing the features, and encode categorical variables if any. After that, we will fit an SVR model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set. Finally, we will visualize the results and explain why we got the predictions we did.

Overall, this tutorial should give you an idea about implementing SVR algorithm in Python, and provide insights into the various techniques used for handling complex datasets and dealing with nonlinear relationships in them.

## 2.1 Support Vector Machine（SVM）
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful machine learning algorithms that are widely used in computer vision, natural language processing, and many other fields. An SVM consists of a set of binary decision boundaries that help classify new inputs into different categories. A line that separates the positive and negative instances called the "margin" maximizes the separation between these instances while keeping the errors within a certain range. The goal of the SVM is to find the best possible hyperplane that can separate the data into distinct regions without errors.


The above figure shows a simple representation of SVM’s working principle. Given some training data points, labeled as either belonging to class (+1) or not (-1), an SVM searches for the hyperplane that has the largest possible margin (the perpendicular distance between it and the closest data point). Hyperplanes can be drawn directly in higher dimensional spaces and their position along one dimension represents the threshold value at which they separate the data into two regions. The location of the hyperplane depends on the relative sizes and orientations of the data points.

SVMs are particularly useful in cases where there exists clear distinctions among the classes being separated. For instance, SVMs are often applied in image recognition tasks where objects need to be classified based on their appearance features rather than textual descriptions. However, because SVMs have high computational complexity and tend to overfit the training data, they may not always produce accurate results even when they perform well on a given problem. Therefore, several regularization methods have been developed to address this issue. These include soft margin constraints, slack variables, and penalty terms. To handle more complex situations, neural networks have also been used in conjunction with SVMs.

SVMs are commonly used in applications like spam detection, sentiment analysis, face recognition, and recommendation systems. They can identify patterns in complex datasets, make decisions based on user preferences, predict outcomes accurately, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of various machine learning models. Overall, SVMs play a crucial role in modern machine learning and artificial intelligence systems.

## 2.2 Support Vector Regressor （SVR）
Support Vector Regressor (SVR) is a variation of SVM that can be used for solving both classification and regression problems. It tries to find the best hyperplane that fits the data while taking into account the target variable's distribution and ranges. SVR is closely related to Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net Regression. Unlike traditional linear regression models, SVR doesn't assume that the response variable follows a normal distribution. Instead, SVR uses kernel functions to project the input data into a higher-dimensional space where most of the training examples become linearly separable. The SVR model then finds the optimal hyperplane within this transformed space to minimize the squared error between predicted values and actual values. Thus, SVR provides an alternative approach to linear regression that considers non-linear relationships present in real-world datasets.


As shown in the above figure, SVR provides improved flexibility compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression in cases where the data has non-linearities. Traditional OLS assumes a linear relation between the predictor variables and the dependent variable; whereas, SVR allows for non-linear relations by employing kernel functions that map the input variables into a higher-dimensional feature space where the data becomes separable.

One advantage of SVR is that it automatically handles outliers and leverages all available data for making predictions. On the other hand, SVMs are slower due to their requirement to solve quadratic optimization problems, and require careful tuning of parameters for better performance. Nevertheless, SVMs offer faster execution times, especially when dealing with larger datasets, and are more suited for smaller datasets with simpler relationships.
