Hierarchical clustering (HC) is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique that forms clusters of similar objects based on their similarity or distance measures between the objects. The output of HC can be used for data visualization, exploratory analysis, outlier detection, pattern recognition, and prediction tasks. HC has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its simplicity, interpretability, and ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality. Despite these advantages, it remains challenging to understand the resulting cluster hierarchy. 

In this article, we will explore hierarchical clustering trees as a way to interpret the results of HC. A hierarchical clustering tree represents the relationships among the original data points by branching into smaller groups until each group contains only one object. Each node in the tree corresponds to a cluster generated by HC and shows the number of original objects contained within the cluster. At each node, there are pointers leading to child nodes representing subclusters further divided into finer grained subgroups. By following the path from root to leaf nodes, an analyst can reconstruct how individual data points were grouped together during the HC process.

We will first discuss some basic concepts and terminology before proceeding to explain the core algorithmic principles behind generating HC trees. Then, we'll cover specific steps involved in building a HC tree and illustrate them using simple examples. Finally, we'll provide sample code snippets and interpretations explaining how to use the implementation of HC algorithms in various programming languages such as Python, R, and Java.

By the end of this article, you should have a good understanding of what HC trees are and how they can be interpreted to gain insight into the structure and characteristics of your data.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Definition
A hierarchical clustering (HC) tree is a graphical representation of the relationship between the data points based on their proximity or dissimilarity measure. It starts at the topmost level where all the observations belong to separate clusters, and recursively splits the set of objects down into more manageable subsets until every subset contains only one observation. At each step, the cut-off point is determined by comparing the inter-cluster distances and determining which pair of objects produces the smallest difference. This continues until the desired number of clusters is reached or no more significant differences exist. 

The final division of data into clusters typically involves minimizing intra-cluster distances while maximizing inter-cluster distances. Intra-cluster distances refer to the minimum Euclidean distance between any two members of a cluster, whereas inter-cluster distances refer to the maximum distance between any two non-overlapping clusters. When creating a HC tree, the cut-off point is selected by considering both intra- and inter-cluster distances simultaneously, thus ensuring that each grouping reflects the underlying distribution of the data accurately.

## 2.2 Terminology
**Node:** A single rectangular box containing an interior region representing a cluster. Each node may contain zero or more child nodes corresponding to its subclusters.

**Parent Node:** The larger rectangle surrounding the children nodes. If a node has no parent, then it must be considered to be a root node.

**Child Nodes:** The small rectangles below the parent node. They represent the subclusters formed when dividing a particular cluster. Child nodes usually correspond to intermediate levels of the HC tree, starting from the second level upwards.

**Leaf Node:** A terminal node that does not contain any additional child nodes. Leaf nodes represent the most fine-grained partitions possible given the current cut-off criterion.

**Depth:** The distance from the root node to a particular node. For example, if a node n has depth d, then it is located at depth d+1 relative to its parent node.

**Branch Length:** The length of the horizontal branch connecting a parent node to its child nodes. Branches are also known as "edges" in graph theory.

**Height:** The total height of the entire HC tree, measured from the root node to the deepest leaf node. Height is equal to the maximum depth plus one.

**Intra-Cluster Distances:** These are the minimum distances between any two elements of a cluster. To compute the intracluster distances for each cluster, we need to find the centroids of each cluster and measure the Euclidean distance between each element and its respective centroid. The resultant matrix of intra-cluster distances gives us information about the cohesion and separation of different clusters.

**Inter-Cluster Distances:** These are the maximum distances between any two distinct clusters. There are several methods available to calculate the intercluster distances depending on whether we want to include self-distances in our calculation or not. Self-distances refers to the distances between each cluster and itself. Including self-distances allows us to estimate the stability of the partition over different cut-offs. Otherwise, excluding self-distances assumes that the observed cluster assignments do not change significantly with varying cut-offs. We can use metrics like Ward's linkage method or complete-linkage to compute the inter-cluster distances.

**Dendrogram:** Dendrograms are graphs showing the arrangement of clusters in a hierarchical manner, starting from the bottom-level clusters and working towards the root node. They show the split decisions made by the HC algorithm during the construction of the tree, allowing us to interpret the results better.

# 3. Core Algorithm Principles
## 3.1 Steps to Build a HC Tree
Building a HC tree requires multiple iterations of the same basic steps:
1. Calculate the centroid of each remaining cluster.
2. Calculate the inter-cluster distances between adjacent pairs of clusters.
3. Select the best cut-off point based on the increase in intra-cluster distances but decrease in inter-cluster distances.
4. Divide each remaining cluster into two new clusters based on the chosen cut-off point.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all clusters are grouped into one big cluster or the desired number of clusters is achieved.

These steps form the basis of the HC algorithm, alongside many other variations and enhancements. However, the overall framework remains the same across all variations. Therefore, the rest of this section focuses on the specific details of implementing the above steps using modern computing technologies.

## 3.2 Building a HC Tree Using Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn provides implementations of several popular HC algorithms, including Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, Centroid Linkage, Median Linkage, and Ward’s Method. Here are the general steps to build a HC tree using scikit-learn:

1. Import the required library: `from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering`
2. Define the input dataset X and the desired number of clusters k: `hc = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=k)`
3. Fit the model on the dataset X: `y_pred = hc.fit_predict(X)`
4. Extract the labels of the leaves: `leaves_id = hc.children_[[-1]]`
5. Sort the indices of the leaves according to their distance from the root: `order = leaves_id[np.argsort(hc.distances_[leaves_id])]`
6. Plot the dendrogram: `plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))`
   `dn = sch.dendrogram(sch.linkage(X, method='ward'),`
      `labels=range(len(X)), color_threshold=0, orientation='left')`
  `  plt.show()`
  Note: Here, `method='ward'` specifies the metric to be used to calculate the inter-cluster distances (`'complete'` could also be used).

Here's a brief explanation of the above steps:
1. First, we import the necessary libraries - numpy for mathematical operations and matplotlib for plotting purposes. Additionally, we use scipy’s cluster module to create the dendrogram.
2. Next, we define the input dataset `X`, the desired number of clusters `k`, and initialize an instance of the AgglomerativeClustering class.
3. After that, we call the fit_predict() function to generate the predicted labels y_pred for each data point in X.
4. We extract the index values of the last level (leaf nodes) using the `.children_` attribute of the AgglomerativeClustering instance.
5. We sort the index values based on their distances from the root using np.argsort().
6. Finally, we plot the dendrogram using scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram(). The `color_threshold` parameter is set to 0 to ensure that all branches are plotted.

Overall, this approach makes it easy to apply HC techniques to real world problems without worrying too much about the underlying complexities of the algorithms or tweaking the parameters. Of course, there are many ways to modify this process to suit different needs and constraints.
