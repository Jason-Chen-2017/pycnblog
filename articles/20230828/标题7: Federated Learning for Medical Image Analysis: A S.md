# 1.简介
  


Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm where multiple devices or nodes collaborate to train a model on their local data samples while keeping the trained models isolated from each other. The federated training approach allows for more scalability as it reduces network communication overhead and enables distributed computing resources across different locations or institutions. This paper presents an overview of FL in medical image analysis with emphasis on four key challenges that need to be addressed: privacy, scalability, interoperability, and robustness. 

The importance of these challenges has been highlighted by several recent research efforts in this field such as Grand Challenges in Computer Science (GCI) at CVPR 2019 and China AI Summit 2020. Over the years, various approaches have been proposed to address these challenges using various algorithms and architectures. In this survey article, we provide a comprehensive review of existing work addressing these challenges including pre-processing techniques, neural networks architectures, training methods, and evaluation metrics. We also discuss some practical considerations to make federated learning suitable for medical imaging applications and potential pitfalls and limitations when applying federated learning in practice. Overall, our goal is to promote awareness among researchers and developers in medical image analysis community and enable them to apply federated learning to real world problems efficiently and effectively.

1. Distributed computing: Distributing tasks or computations across multiple processing units, either on a single computer system or over a network is called distributed computing. It involves dividing a problem into smaller chunks which can be processed independently and then merging the results back together.

2. Edge device: An edge device refers to a low-cost device such as smartphones, tablets, or IoT devices used for peripherally connected applications. These devices are typically located near the end user and require minimal bandwidth compared to traditional servers. 

3. Central server/cloud: A central server or cloud platform provides computational resources for hosting and managing large-scale federated systems. It coordinates the activities between all the participants in the federation and ensures data security and privacy guarantees. Examples of central server platforms include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

4. Node: A node refers to one participant in the federated learning system. Each node holds its own dataset partition and can compute updates locally without contacting the others. Nodes communicate through the exchange of messages that contain the updated parameters after each round of computation. There are two types of nodes:

  - Clients: The clients send requests to the server or cloud platform requesting training on their local data samples. They do not receive any update until they request the latest version from the server. Clients can use edge devices for offline training.

  - Servers: The servers host the global model weights learned from the client datasets. The server aggregates the updates received from the clients and distributes them to the corresponding clients. Additionally, the servers may perform additional operations such as data encryption or decryption, model validation, or monitoring during training.

  5. Aggregation function: After receiving updates from the clients, each server applies a aggregation function to combine their individual model updates into a global update. Common aggregation functions include weighted average, median, or FedAvg (Federated Average). Weighted average involves assigning equal weight to each update and takes the arithmetic mean of the resulting vectors; Median only keeps the best performing update(s); FedAvg combines the updates according to their contribution ratio determined by the number of times each parameter was updated before the current round of training.
   
  6. Communication mechanism: To enable the communication between the clients and the servers, there are several mechanisms available such as peer-to-peer, centralized, and federated messaging protocols. Peer-to-peer protocols establish direct connections between the clients and the servers so that they can exchange messages directly, but rely on reliable connectivity and lower latency than other schemes. Centralized protocols involve setting up a message queue and routing the messages from the clients to the appropriate servers, but suffer from high overhead due to frequent server interactions. Federated messaging protocols allow both parties to participate in a conversation without explicitly specifying the destination of the message, but require complex infrastructure setup and management.
   
  7. Privacy guarantee: Privacy concerns arise whenever personal information or sensitive health information is shared among multiple users, organizations, or devices. One way to ensure privacy is to encrypt the data exchanged between the clients and the servers. However, implementing secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols requires significant development time and expertise, limiting its widespread adoption. For now, most works focus on ensuring data security based on authentication and authorization policies implemented at the central server level.
   
  8. Interoperability: Another challenge is the need for interoperability of different ML libraries, frameworks, and hardware accelerators used in the federated learning process. While some technologies like Tensorflow Lite and ONNX provide compatibility with popular ML frameworks, some components still need specialized support in order to fully leverage the benefits of federated learning. 
   
  9. Robustness: Federated learning systems should be resilient against adversarial attacks or malicious behavior such as data poisoning, evasion, or model stealing. Several defense strategies have been proposed to mitigate these threats, such as adding noise to the gradients during training, detecting and rejecting suspicious behaviors early, and using differential privacy techniques.

  This section will give a brief introduction to the basic principles behind Federated Learning. More detailed mathematical explanations and step-by-step implementation details will be given in subsequent sections.
  
  1. Data distribution: In Federated Learning, the clients hold a subset of the overall dataset, called the local dataset, and each client trains a model independently on their local dataset. Each client contributes a fraction of the total loss function to the final optimization objective, which leads to improved generalization performance. Since the client does not share the entire dataset with the server, the amount of data sent between the server and the clients must be kept small to avoid excessive communication costs.
   
   2. Model averaging: Once the clients have aggregated their local models, the server performs model averaging to obtain a global model. The resulting global model replaces the previous model held by the clients. The main idea here is to reduce the variance introduced by the diversity of local models produced by the clients. This technique is similar to the bagging algorithm commonly used in ensemble methods for regression and classification problems.
    
       3. Model synchronization: To implement model synchronization, the server sends the global model to the clients periodically, allowing them to keep track of the latest state of the model. Client-side convergence checks can help prevent straggler problems where some clients do not finish updating their models within a certain duration.
        
       4. Local training: The clients use local optimizers to optimize the loss function on their local dataset for a fixed number of epochs. During each epoch, the clients sample a batch of examples from their local dataset and calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to their model parameters. The local optimizer updates the model parameters accordingly based on the computed gradient and regularization terms.

        5. Parameter sharing: When synchronizing the model updates between the clients, the server uses a combination of both full model transfer and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strategy to selectively distribute the updates to the respective clients. Full model transfer involves sending the entire model to each client, while SGD selects a subset of parameters randomly and uses it to approximate the global update. This helps minimize the bandwidth requirements by reducing the amount of redundant data exchanged between the clients.

         6. Evaluation: To evaluate the accuracy of the global model, the test set of the overall dataset is divided into subsets, known as mini-batches, and the global model is evaluated on each mini-batch separately. The final test accuracy is obtained by aggregating the accuracies of the individual mini-batches generated on each client's local dataset. This procedure simulates the deployment scenario where the model is tested on new patient data without ever being exposed to any of the patients' actual labels or data.

           7. Computation offloading: To further improve efficiency, some of the calculations involved in the federated learning process might be performed on dedicated edge devices rather than the central server or cloud platform. For example, GPU acceleration could be leveraged for deep neural network inference tasks, leading to faster training times.
