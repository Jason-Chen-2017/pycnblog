# 1.简介
  

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform society, many companies are looking to hire talented engineers who can contribute to their mission by building machine learning models that enable them to understand human languages better. Language models are important because they can provide us with a way to communicate more effectively, enabling machines to interact with humans in new ways. One type of language model is called a neural machine translation (NMT) system, which translates text from one language into another while retaining its meaning. NMT systems use deep learning algorithms to create powerful models that learn patterns from large amounts of training data. In this article, we will be discussing how to train an NMT model using PyTorch and Tensorflow libraries on real-world datasets such as WMT’s English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks. We also demonstrate how to evaluate the quality of our trained models using standard metrics like BLEU score and perplexity and compare different types of architectures for our models. Overall, this article provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to build and fine-tune an NMT system using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This knowledge will help you get started with researching and applying for these kinds of jobs in the future.

Before diving into the technical details of how to train and evaluate an NMT system, let's first discuss some key terms and concepts used in NMT:


## Tokenization
Tokenization refers to splitting a sentence into individual words or substrings known as tokens. The goal of tokenization is to convert raw text into numerical representations that can be easily processed by a machine learning algorithm. Common techniques for tokenization include word-level tokenization, character-level tokenization, and subword-level tokenization. Word-level tokenization involves breaking down each sentence into a list of words, whereas character-level tokenization splits sentences into individual characters. Subword-level tokenization involves representing words using shorter combinations of multiple letters or symbols instead of single letters or symbols. 


## Vocabulary
The vocabulary is the set of all unique words and phrases used in a dataset. When working with natural language processing tasks like NLP, it is essential to ensure that both the training data and the testing data share a common vocabulary, so that the model learns meaningful relationships between words and the task being performed. For example, if we want to train an NMT system to translate French to English, the French and English vocabularies would need to match perfectly in order for the learned translations to make sense. Similarly, if we want to test our trained NMT system on unseen data, the same vocabulary restrictions must apply to avoid introducing unexpected errors or biases.


## Embeddings
Embeddings are vectors containing information about the semantic relationships between words. They map every word in our vocabulary to a high-dimensional vector space where similar words are placed closer together than dissimilar words. These embeddings allow us to capture contextual and syntactic information about words, making it easier for NMT systems to perform accurate translations even when given limited training examples. There are several methods for generating embeddings including pre-trained embedding models and transfer learning based approaches. Pre-trained embedding models require massive amounts of labeled data but offer significant advantages over random initialization. Transfer learning is useful when we only have a small amount of labeled data available. It allows us to leverage pre-trained weights from a larger corpus without having to start from scratch. 

In summary, tokenization is used to split a sequence of characters into smaller units, such as words or subwords. The resulting tokens are fed into the encoder part of the network, which generates contextualized embeddings for each token. These embeddings are passed through a decoder part of the network that predicts the target language representation of each input token. During training, we feed back the predicted output and correct ground truth values to adjust the parameters of the model until convergence. Once the model has been trained, we can evaluate its performance using various metrics such as BLEU score and perplexity. Finally, we can deploy our trained NMT system in production environments and integrate it into applications that require language understanding capabilities.
