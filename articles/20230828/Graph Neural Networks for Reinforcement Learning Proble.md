Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables agents to learn from their experience and make decisions based on those experiences. In recent years, many breakthroughs have been achieved using RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Prioritized Experience Replay, Noisy Network, Distributional DQN, ACER, PPO, A2C/A3C, Rainbow, and AlphaGo Zero. However, these methods still struggle with the problem of training large neural networks efficiently and effectively, especially when dealing with complex environments such as robotics or medical imaging tasks. 

In this paper, we explore how graph neural networks (GNNs) can be used in RL problems specifically in the domain of medical imaging. We first review existing GNN techniques in the context of image processing, followed by an introduction to GNNs for reinforcement learning applications in the medical field. Specifically, we focus on two types of GNN models: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs). Then, we present our key contribution, which is to incorporate GNN into three popular deep RL algorithms for medical imaging tasks, namely DQN, A2C/A3C, and PPO. Finally, we discuss possible future directions and challenges related to applying GNNs in RL problems in the medical field.

本文将探索如何在医疗图像领域中利用图神经网络(GNNs)进行强化学习任务。首先回顾了图像处理中的现有的GNN技术，然后简要介绍了用于医疗领域强化学习应用的GNN模型。特别地，我们着重讨论了两种类型的GNN模型：信息传递型神经网络（MPNN）和图卷积神经网络（GCN）。随后，我们提出了一种关键贡献，即将GNN纳入三个著名的深度强化学习算法（DQN、A2C/A3C、PPO），特别适用于医疗图像任务。最后，我们讨论了可能的未来的方向和困难，相关联于医疗领域中的强化学习任务的GNN应用。

Graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as one of the most promising tools for modeling complex systems, such as social networks, electronic circuits, and molecular structures. Despite its success, it remains challenging to apply GNN to different domains due to various factors such as high dimensionality, non-convexity, multi-relational data, and scalability issues. Several works have focused on extending GNN to reinforcement learning problems, such as AlphaZero, R2D2, and IMPALA, but they did not consider using GNN directly in the RL framework. Furthermore, several GNN-based approaches have also been proposed for other fields like natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), but there are no suitable frameworks for medical imaging tasks yet.

图神经网络(GNN)是一种用于复杂系统建模的热门工具，如社交网络、电子电路和分子结构。尽管取得了成功，但仍然存在诸多因素使得GNN难以直接应用到强化学习领域，例如高维、非凸性、多关系数据、可扩展性等。已经有许多研究试图将GNN扩展到强化学习问题上，如AlphaZero、R2D2和IMPALA，但是它们并没有直接在RL框架下使用GNN。此外，也有一些基于GNN的方法被提出用于其他领域，如自然语言处理(NLP)和计算机视觉(CV)，但对于医疗领域尚无合适的框架。


Recently, numerous papers have explored using GNN to solve sequential decision making (SDM) problems in the medical domain, where a patient's healthcare trajectory needs to be predicted over time. For example, Nishida et al., [1] applied GCN to predict hospital admissions within short term care facilities based on patient information, identifying patients who will require further treatment. Sabharwal et al., [2] developed a sequence-to-sequence model using GPT-2 transformer language model to generate clinical reports based on medication administration records, improving accuracy by up to 30%. These studies suggest that GNN may help improve performance in medical tasks by leveraging prior knowledge about the relationships between entities and events, without relying on explicit labels or ground truth annotations.

最近，已经有很多论文探索了利用GNN解决医疗领域的序列决策问题(Sequential Decision Making, SDM)。例如，西田太一等人[1]利用GCN预测短期护理机构内住院患者比例，并识别需要进一步治疗的患者。苏杭尔等人[2]开发了一个采用GPT-2变压器语言模型的序列到序列模型，以生成从药物administration records生成的临床报告，准确率提升至少30%。这些研究表明，GNN可以帮助改善医疗任务的性能，通过借助实体之间的联系和事件，而不需要使用显式标签或事实注释。
