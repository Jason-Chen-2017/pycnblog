：视频理解（video understanding）旨在从高质量的视频中提取有意义的内容、关键帧和动作。视频理解的目的是为了帮助用户更快、更直观地理解自然世界，同时也促进视频内容生产和传播。视频理解涉及计算机视觉、图像处理、机器学习、模式识别等众多领域。其主要技术方向包括目标检测、行为分析、视频压缩、结构化视频表示学习、连续视频理解等。深度学习在视频理解领域的应用也逐渐增长。

# 3.1 CNN-based video feature extraction:
CNN-based methods use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from videos at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In general, they can be divided into two categories: spatio-temporal CNNs and fully convolutional CNNs. Spatio-temporal CNNs focus on capturing both visual motion cues and relevant events in videos by processing them over time and space separately. They have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in many tasks including action recognition, object detection, and event localization. Fully convolutional CNNs learn global representations of the input video directly without requiring any additional supervision or recurrent connections between frames. These methods have also demonstrated good performance in some tasks such as activity recognition where few labeled examples are available.
The architecture of a typical CNN based approach includes three main components: 1) a series of convolutional layers that capture local and temporal relationships within the image sequences; 2) pooling layers that downsample the output of the previous layer to reduce its dimensionality and represent it more compactly; and 3) a dense layer followed by softmax activation function used for prediction. The parameters of each component are learned through backpropagation using stochastic gradient descent algorithm with momentum. To obtain better accuracy, various regularization techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, and weight decay can be applied. Additionally, the outputs of different layers can be concatenated to form a higher level representation which is fed to an auxiliary task such as video classification.
3.2 Action recognition:
Action recognition involves identifying what actions occur during a sequence of videos. There are several approaches to perform this task, such as handcrafted features, deep learning models, and data driven approaches. Handcrafted features include manual feature engineering, but their limitations are hard to handle complex videos and variations in lighting conditions. On the other hand, deep learning models usually rely on complex architectures that take advantage of raw pixel information along with rich contextual cues. Most commonly used architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Although these models show impressive results on various benchmarks, they often require large amounts of training data and computation power to train. Therefore, there has been much interest in developing lightweight models that can operate efficiently on mobile devices and embedded systems. One promising technique is to fine tune pre-trained models on smaller datasets specific to the target domain, thus reducing the required computational resources and ensuring high accuracy. Another approach is to use weakly supervised learning methods like contrastive learning and multi-task learning that leverage unlabeled data to improve the performance.
3.3 Object detection:
Object detection refers to locating and recognizing objects in a given image or video, especially those that move or vary rapidly in appearance or motion. Several methods have been proposed to detect objects in videos, including classical algorithms like template matching, tracking algorithms, and deep learning based approaches. Classical algorithms employ sliding windows over the video sequence, while trackers follow targets and estimate their movement accurately. In recent years, deep learning based detectors have achieved significant improvements in terms of accuracy, speed, and memory usage compared to classical methods. Most popular detectors nowadays involve CNN-based architectures like YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, etc., that utilize a set of convolutional filters to identify candidate regions of interest in the images and then apply non-maximum suppression (NMS) to eliminate redundant detections. Other approaches incorporate region proposal networks that generate potential bounding boxes around objects and predict whether they contain an object of interest before applying NMS. These networks typically consist of a backbone network like ResNet-101 or VGG16 that takes in an input image and generates a set of feature maps at different spatial resolutions. Then, they pass these feature maps through additional layers to produce refined predictions about the presence of an object. However, we still lack a comprehensive study on how well these networks work under different types of object appearance and motion. It would be interesting to explore future directions in this area by exploring new design principles, tuning hyperparameters, analyzing dataset characteristics, and optimizing model architectures.
