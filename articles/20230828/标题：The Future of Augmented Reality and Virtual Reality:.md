Companies like Facebook and Google, who have invested billions of dollars in developing these technologies, are dominant players in the field but don’t appear to be following in the footsteps of smaller firms. To develop these technologies further, more awareness and investment from industrial leaders must be made.

This article seeks to address several challenges related to the development of AR and VR in the industrial sector, including the key factors driving the trends, examples of successful businesses that rely on these technologies, and opportunities for the next generation of products and services based on these technologies. We hope that by analyzing these factors and expanding on them, we can generate actionable insights to support growth and development in this area.

1.	定义、历史及现状分析
Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) refer to technologies that allow users to virtually interact with real objects or environments through computer generated visual effects and audio cues. Both technologies were first introduced in the mid 90s alongside the Internet and mobile computing technologies. During that time, AR was mainly focused on medical image analysis but later became more widespread due to its low cost and portability compared to more expensive high end hardware platforms. Since then, VR has gained popularity in fields such as entertainment, gaming, automotive, and transportation, where it offers powerful realistic simulation capabilities that people can use to feel like they are interacting with the physical world. These technologies continue to evolve and gain new features regularly, making them ideal for exploratory work tasks that require high levels of interactivity and immersion.

History tells us about how AR and VR came to be. According to Wikipedia, AR was originally called “mixed reality”, which was coined in a paper published in 1984 by <NAME> and <NAME>, in which they proposed a framework for simulating multiple realities simultaneously in order to create a single unified representation. They also developed a prototype system in May 1987 under the name “IRIS” that incorporated head mounted displays and advanced image processing techniques. Eventually, AR technology shifted from computer-generated visual effects to full fledged 3D models of real world objects placed in the user's environment.

On the other hand, VR, named after its developer Imagination Technologies, was initially created in 1994, although its potential hadn't been realized until the launch of HTC's Vive in April 2016. It provided high-fidelity stereoscopic vision through high resolution displays paired with motion tracking sensors and controllers. Its early success helped inspire AR developers like Brian McKay and Shane Lorca to create new ways to integrate these technologies into modern life. As time passed, VR technologies continued to mature and improve, leading to the current state today where anyone can purchase a VR device and enter one of the most engaging and immersive virtual reality environments available.

Nowadays, AR and VR technologies have gone far beyond just being useful tools for hobbyists and youngsters. Governments, corporations, educational institutions, healthcare providers, manufacturers, and other industries are all adopting these technologies in different ways, contributing to their individual benefits. However, research shows that the majority of businesses are not yet ready to fully take advantage of these technologies because they lack sufficient expertise and resources.

To understand why industries are reluctant to adopt these technologies, let's look at the key factors that influence the choice between AR and VR:

1. Safety and security concerns: Although AR and VR are fun and convenient, they can potentially pose serious risks if misused or exploited by hackers or unscrupulous business partners. This is especially true when these technologies are integrated into existing systems or embedded in safety-critical situations.

2. Cultural shift: Another important factor is cultural shift. People may not appreciate virtual reality or prefer traditional reality-based media, so the transition to virtual reality can be challenging for certain groups. Additionally, even small improvements in usability and ease of interaction can lead to major changes in behavior and expectations, requiring organizations to train employees or change culture and mindset.

3. Monetization: Most VR/AR startups focus on selling hardware or software solutions rather than developing products or services themselves. For these reasons, profit margins may not be very high and adoption could prove difficult for businesses that need to compete with established brands or services.

4. User experience: Last but not least, user experience plays a crucial role in whether people choose to adopt AR/VR technologies. A poor user interface can result in frustration, confusion, and disorientation, whereas a good design and intuitive interactions can make VR much more enjoyable and productive.

5. Social impact: There is also a social impact aspect to consider. Using AR/VR technologies can produce creative and imaginative ideas that might otherwise go unnoticed or ignored, causing negative consequences for individuals or societies.

In summary, key factors affecting the decision of industries to adopt AR/VR include cultural shift, monetization, safety and security concerns, and social impact. Given the importance and power of these technologies, industries should aim to bring greater transparency, accountability, and collaboration to ensure that these technologies reach the intended audience effectively and safely.
