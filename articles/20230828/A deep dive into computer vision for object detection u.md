## What is Computer Vision and why do we need it?
Computer Vision is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves the creation of systems that can “see” the world around them with high accuracy. It enables machines to identify objects, recognize faces, track motion, understand human emotions, and much more. 

With advancements in hardware technology, there has been tremendous growth in image processing capabilities over the past few years. The applications of Computer Vision are expanding exponentially, from self-driving cars to medical imaging devices. In this article, we will learn about some basic concepts and algorithms related to Computer Vision. We will also discuss how they apply to the field of Object Detection.

Object Detection is one of the most common tasks performed by a computer system to detect and locate specific objects within an image or video frame. This is a crucial step towards automating many applications such as security, surveillance, manufacturing, etc., which require advanced detection capabilities.

In this series of articles, we will take a deeper look at what makes up CNNs, how they work, and how they can be used to perform object detection. Let’s get started!

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this series, you should have knowledge of Python programming language and machine learning concepts such as neural networks, convolutional layers, pooling layers, backpropagation, and optimization techniques like gradient descent. If not, don't worry, you can still learn these skills in our free course on "Python Machine Learning". You can also refer to other resources online if needed.

Here's the list of required libraries:
* NumPy library
* Matplotlib library
* TensorFlow library (with GPU support recommended)
* Keras library
* OpenCV library

We'll use these libraries to implement various features including data pre-processing, model building, training and testing. Once you've installed all the necessary libraries, let's move on to the first part of our journey.

# 2. Basic Concepts
Before diving into object detection, we must first cover some fundamental concepts in Computer Vision. Let’s begin with understanding Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).


# 3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Introduction
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specialized for analyzing visual imagery. Its architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers, each containing neurons responsible for extracting particular features from the input images. These feature maps are then passed through several non-linear activation functions to produce output predictions. ConvNets were introduced in 2012 by <NAME> et al. with the goal of achieving state-of-the-art results on complex visual recognition problems. Today, ConvNets play an essential role in numerous fields ranging from autonomous driving systems to medical imaging analysis tools. 

The architecture of a typical ConvNet consists of several convolutional layers, interspersed with pooling layers. Each convolution layer applies filters to the input image to extract spatial features, while the pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature map and consequently decrease computational complexity. Finally, the output of the last pooling layer is fed into a dense layer of neurons that produces class probabilities or regression values depending on the task being addressed.



# Why Do We Use CNNs For Image Recognition?
Why do we use Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition instead of traditional methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Naive Bayes Classifiers? There are several reasons:

1. **Shape Variation:** Images often contain variations in shape, size, orientation, and color. Traditional methods may fail to capture these variations accurately since they treat pixels individually. By using convolution operations, the network learns to recognize patterns across the entire image.
2. **Translation Invariance:** While translation does not affect the appearance of an object in an image, it can significantly alter its position. Traditional methods cannot handle this variation effectively because they rely solely on local pixel information. 
3. **Scale Invariance:** Large objects appear smaller when scaled down compared to their original size. As a result, traditional methods typically struggle to classify large objects correctly. However, CNNs can adaptively adjust their receptive fields to accommodate different sized objects in the same scene.
4. **Fine-Grained Features:** Many image recognition tasks involve recognizing fine-grained details like shapes, textures, and colors. Traditional methods, especially SVMs, may not be able to capture these features accurately due to their inability to process global patterns or spatial relationships between individual pixels. CNNs, on the other hand, can effectively learn these fine-grained features thanks to their ability to analyze larger areas of the image.
5. **Parallelism:** Modern processors are highly parallel and capable of running multiple processes simultaneously. By breaking down an image into small blocks, convolution operations can leverage parallel computing power to speed up the computations required for pattern recognition.
