# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing, also known as NLP, is an area of computer science that focuses on enabling machines to understand human language in natural ways. The goal of this technology is to enable the creation of intelligent applications that can analyze, process, and derive meaning from large amounts of unstructured text data such as emails, social media posts, news articles, web pages, etc. Although the field has evolved over time, it still remains one of the most advanced areas in artificial intelligence due to its reliance on machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis techniques, and optimization algorithms for training models that are able to extract meaningful insights from large volumes of data. 

In recent years, there have been several popular libraries or frameworks such as Apache Stanford's CoreNLP, spaCy, Google's TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and many others that provide easy-to-use APIs for performing various tasks related to NLP such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and so on. However, these tools may not always be sufficient if you want to perform more complex tasks like building a chatbot, creating a document summarizer, analyzing customer feedback, or implementing a recommendation system based on user preferences.

Python and NLTK are two main programming languages and libraries used for NLP today. Python provides easy access to various pre-built libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and so on that make it very suitable for performing various machine learning tasks. Moreover, Python offers high-level features like object-oriented programming, dynamic typing, exception handling, and lambda functions that make it ideal for writing code that needs to scale up quickly. On top of all that, Python comes packaged with a rich set of built-in modules and libraries that make working with natural language easier than ever before.

NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs for NLP. It provides easy-to-use interfaces for performing common NLP tasks like stemming, lemmatization, parsing, classification, clustering, and topic modeling among other things. These tools are widely used by developers, researchers, and students around the world for building scalable NLP systems. Furthermore, NLTK is compatible with multiple versions of Python including Python 2.7+ and Python 3+. This makes it even easier for users to switch between different versions depending on their requirements. Last but not least, NLTK is well documented and maintained by a vibrant community of developers who contribute to keep improving the library over time. Therefore, it is an excellent choice for anyone interested in exploring NLP or building real-world applications with NLP technologies.

By following this tutorial, you will learn how to use NLTK to build your own natural language processing applications while gaining practical experience with hands-on exercises that cover essential concepts and methods. In addition, we hope that this article will help increase your understanding of what NLP is about and how to apply it to solve challenging problems related to natural language processing.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before moving forward with our tutorial, let us first discuss some basic concepts and terminology related to NLP. We'll take a brief look at some key terms and ideas that you need to know before diving into the actual tutorials. Feel free to skip this section if you already have a good grasp of these concepts. 

## Tokenization
Tokenization refers to splitting raw text documents into individual words or phrases, which can then be analyzed individually for various purposes such as analysis, retrieval, and storage. The task of tokenizing text involves breaking down each sentence into its constituent parts and identifying important characteristics such as stopwords, punctuation marks, conjunctions, determiners, and other clues that indicate a break in the flow of sentences. Typically, tokens are separated by whitespace characters, although certain special cases exist where hyphens, underscores, or other non-whitespace characters may serve as delimiters. Once tokenized, the resulting list of strings can be fed into further processing steps such as stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging. For example, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" would be tokenized as follows: ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]. 

## Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization are both processes that aim to reduce words to their base or root form. The difference between them is subtle and they both play a crucial role in reducing dimensionality and accuracy of word representations. While stemming involves removing endings such as "ing," "ly," or "ation," lemmatization involves choosing the appropriate lemma, which is usually the inflected form of the root word. Both approaches rely on rules that define the relationship between words and their components. Examples of stemmers include Porter stemmer and Snowball stemmer, while examples of lemmatizers include WordNetLemmatizer and Spacy's lemmatizer.

## Part-of-Speech Tagging
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging involves labeling each word in a given sentence with its corresponding category or function within the sentence. Common categories include nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, adverbs, numerals, coordinating conjunctions, and so on. POS tags are particularly useful when trying to identify the underlying meaning of words and develop effective feature extraction strategies for downstream NLP tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. For instance, given the sentence "John went to the store and bought apples," the part-of-speech tagger might assign the POS tags [NNP (noun, proper noun), VBD (verb, past tense), PRP (pronoun, subject), TO (infinitive marker), VB (verb, base form), IN (preposition/subordinating conjunction), DT (determiner), NN (noun, singular 'apple')] to each token.
