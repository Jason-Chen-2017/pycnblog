Hierarchical clustering is a popular technique used for grouping objects into clusters based on their similarity or distance measures. It involves dividing the dataset into several groups where each group contains similar data points and dissimilar data points are assigned to different sub-clusters within each group. The end result is a tree structure that reflects the hierarchical relationship between the objects. In this article, we will implement the hierarchical clustering algorithm named Single, Complete, Average (SCA) linkage method using the R programming language. We will also discuss its advantages, limitations and potential applications. 

Hierarchical clustering has been an important concept in many fields such as biology, sociology, marketing, finance, etc., due to its ability to capture complex relationships among data points. However, it remains challenging to implement efficiently and accurately because of its high computational complexity. Therefore, efficient algorithms have been developed to reduce the time complexity and provide reliable solutions. One example is the DIANA algorithm, which is widely used for large scale cluster analysis. Nevertheless, there are many other clustering techniques like K-means, DBSCAN, spectral clustering, and neural networks that can handle large datasets with high dimensionality effectively. Hence, choosing the most appropriate clustering algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.

In this article, we will implement SCA linkage clustering algorithm using the R programming language. SCA linkage is one of the most commonly used methods when implementing hierarchical clustering in practice. It assigns each object to its nearest neighbours, calculates the average distance between them, and merges two adjacent clusters together until all the objects belong only to one cluster. Each cluster is represented by a single node in the dendrogram. Although SCA is not perfect, it provides fast and effective clustering results compared to other clustering algorithms. Moreover, since it does not require any prior knowledge about the distribution of the data points, it is less sensitive to noise than other clustering methods like k-means. Thus, it may be useful in situations where there is uncertainty regarding the underlying density function of the data points. In conclusion, SCA linkage clustering algorithm can be implemented easily and quickly in R while providing accurate clustering results. 

# 2.Basic Concepts & Terminologies
Before we start implementation, let's first understand some basic concepts and terminologies related to hierarchical clustering:

1. Distance metric: A measure of the similarity between two objects. For instance, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, and cosine similarity are commonly used metrics. 

2. Dissimilarity matrix: A square matrix containing distances between every pair of objects in the dataset.

3. Similarity matrix: The inverse of the dissimilarity matrix obtained from the original distance matrix using a suitable transformation.

4. Dendrogram: A graphical representation of the hierarchy created during the hierarchical clustering process. Each branch represents a cluster and its length corresponds to the distance between the corresponding objects in the original dataset. The height of the branches shows how well separated they are.

5. Linkage criterion: A rule by which pairs of clusters are combined to create new clusters. There are various linkage criteria available including single, complete, average (SCA), centroid, median, and Ward’s minimum variance. We will use SCA linkage method in our implementation. 

# 3.Algorithm Description
The following steps describe how to perform hierarchical clustering using SCA linkage method:

1. Calculate the dissimilarity matrix between all pairs of objects. This can be done using any distance metric, although the choice of distance metric influences the resulting clusters.

2. Create a list of initial clusters, consisting of each individual object in the dataset. These will form the root nodes of the dendrogram.

3. Assign each object to the closest cluster using the dissimilarity matrix.

4. Sort the clusters according to their size in descending order. Keep track of the total number of objects assigned to each cluster so far.

5. For each cluster c1 and cluster c2, calculate the distance between their respective sets of objects using the mean of the pairwise distances. This gives us a value called the “merge distance”.

6. Combine c1 and c2 into a new cluster whose members are all the elements of both c1 and c2. The new cluster forms the child node of the parent clusters c1 and c2.

7. Update the dissimilarity matrix by removing the rows and columns associated with c1 and c2, respectively, and adding a row and column representing the new merged cluster. This ensures that the next iteration uses the correct distances when assigning objects to clusters.

8. Repeat step 4 through step 7 until all objects belong only to one cluster.

9. Generate the final dendrogram by connecting each leaf node in the previous step to its successor along the path of maximum increase in distance.

10. Determine the optimal number of clusters by examining the shape of the dendrogram and looking for the elbow point that indicates separation between distinct groups. Commonly used rules include cutting the dendrogram at the point of maximum decrease in intra-cluster distances or selecting a certain percentage of largest clusters as representatives.

The key idea behind SCA linkage method is that it requires minimal computation by simply comparing each object to its k-nearest neighbors and calculating the average distance between them. This approach works well in practice for datasets with moderate to large dimensions and smooth multivariate distributions. Despite its simplicity, SCA performs surprisingly well in practice and offers good tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and scalability.
