# 1.简介
  

Deep learning is currently revolutionizing many fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. It has led to breakthroughs in tasks like object detection, image classification, and speech synthesis. In this article we will go through the process of building a simple deep neural network using Python's popular machine learning library TensorFlow. We will implement each step of the algorithm line by line, explaining the theory behind it along the way. At the end, we'll have built an artificial intelligence model that can classify images into different categories. This project serves as a good starting point for anyone interested in exploring the field of deep learning.

In order to follow along, you should be familiar with basic concepts and terminology related to deep learning, including tensors, layers, activation functions, optimization algorithms, loss functions, etc. If you are not yet familiar with these topics, I suggest checking out my other articles on them: 




We will also assume that you have some familiarity with Python programming, specifically its scientific computing libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc., as well as understanding the basics of machine learning, including data preprocessing, splitting data sets, overfitting, regularization techniques, etc.

## 1. Background Introduction
In 2006, Hinton and his collaborators introduced the "deep belief networks" concept, which was later refined and applied to the task of classifying handwritten digits. The name "deep" refers to the fact that they used multiple hidden layers of artificial neurons, leading to increasingly complex representations of the input data. Today, deep learning models are used in a variety of applications ranging from self-driving cars to face recognition systems. 

A key challenge in applying deep learning to real-world problems is how to design a high-performance architecture while minimizing training time and memory consumption. In this guide, we will focus on implementing a simple deep neural network using the popular TensorFlow library. TensorFlow provides a flexible framework that allows us to build complex neural networks easily, making it suitable for experimentation and production deployment.

To implement our neural network, we will use the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is 28 pixels wide and 28 pixels tall, resulting in a total of 784 pixel features per image. Our goal is to train a classifier that can recognize which digit is represented by each image. Here's what the first few samples of the MNIST dataset look like:


Let's start by importing all necessary packages and loading the MNIST dataset. Since we want to compare the performance of different architectures, we will split the original training set into two parts: one for training and one for validation. We will then use the latter to tune hyperparameters, evaluate the model's accuracy, and select the best performing architecture. Finally, we will test the final model on unseen data.
