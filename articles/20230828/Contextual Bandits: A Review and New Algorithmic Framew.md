Contextual bandit (CB) is a family of machine learning algorithms that can be used for sequential decision making problems where a context or information about the user needs to be taken into account in order to choose an action. In this article, we will review existing CB algorithms as well as new algorithmic frameworks that have emerged over time. We also provide detailed explanations of how each CB framework works and highlight its advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss potential directions for future research on CBs.

CBs are widely used in recommendation systems, advertising, robotics, medical treatments, healthcare, and many other applications where sequential decision-making based on user behavior is required. Despite their popularity, there has been relatively little work done on developing theoretical foundations or designing novel algorithms for solving these problems. This gap is particularly significant because it can significantly impact real-world business applications with high stakes such as healthcare.

In this paper, I first introduce basic concepts of CBs and state which ones make sense when applied to specific scenarios. Then, I explain different algorithmic frameworks that exist today, including LinUCB, Thompson Sampling, Bayesian UCB, and Finite-time Analysis of Stationary Agents (FTSA). I focus on proposing general insights into the structure of these frameworks, identifying key similarities and differences between them. Lastly, I identify the challenges involved in applying these methods in practical scenarios and suggest avenues for further research. Overall, my goal is to inspire and guide the development of more robust and effective CB algorithms through careful consideration of their underlying principles and properties, while simultaneously highlighting open questions and opportunities for further exploration. 

# 2.Background
## Introduction
Sequential decision-making problems arise in various domains ranging from economics to healthcare. These problems involve taking multiple actions that influence subsequent outcomes, known as "arms," given some context or information about the user, known as "context." For instance, in the online advertisement industry, one may use CB algorithms to select ads based on the current user's search query, past behavior, demographics, location, etc. The goal is to maximize the expected reward obtained by choosing the best arm at each step, without peeking into the future rewards or outcomes.

Traditionally, CB algorithms rely on either expert knowledge or inference mechanisms to estimate the value function of each arm based on its historical performance and predict the optimal choice among available arms at any given point in time. However, recent years have seen several breakthroughs in developing better algorithms that can learn to balance exploration and exploitation in sequential decision-making problems.

Two key components of modern CB algorithms are **exploration** and **exploitation**. Exploration refers to the process of trying out alternative choices to improve overall performance; exploitation refers to the act of using the current knowledge to select the optimal arm based on estimated values of all arms. Within this framework, the objective is to explore more effectively than simply selecting the most likely option due to limited experience or resources.

The ability to adaptively trade off exploration versus exploitation during training enables CBs to achieve much higher cumulative regret compared to standard non-contextual bandit techniques like epsilon greedy, ucb1, thompson sampling, etc., even when facing complex unknown environments with changing feedback signals. Therefore, they offer substantial benefits in optimizing complex sequential decision-making problems with potentially long horizons and uncertain contexts.

One common challenge faced by CBs is dealing with the continuous nature of user preferences, context variables, and rewards. Continuous input variables pose serious challenges because traditional linear models cannot capture the complex relationships that exist between context and action selection, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal results. To address this issue, several variants of CB algorithms have been proposed that employ deep neural networks to model the value function instead of simple parametric functions. These include Deep UCB (D-UCB), Neural Linear Model (NLLM), and Deep Bayes (DB) algorithms. Despite these advances, it remains challenging to devise efficient algorithms that handle both discrete and continuous inputs efficiently and robustly.

Furthermore, related work shows that CBs can often be further improved by introducing additional assumptions or regularization terms to reduce variance and encourage sparsity in the learned policies. Specifically, policy gradient approaches, such as REINFORCE, PPO, TRPO, and AlphaZero, have shown promise in addressing issues associated with sample complexity, vanishing gradients, and mode collapsing, respectively. Despite their success, developing advanced optimization algorithms still requires careful tuning of hyperparameters and architecture design.

Finally, multi-armed bandit literature provides valuable insights into the tradeoffs made in building CBs and enhancing their utility in different application areas. There have been numerous contributions that leverage the theoretical guarantees provided by certain strategies, such as finite-time analysis of stationary agents (FTSA) or discounted mean estimation (DMAE). Some of these ideas have also been combined with CBs to develop new algorithms, such as Bayesian UCB, EXP3++, Thompson++ (TUSP), and Factorized Multi-Armed Bandit (FMB). Combining these ideas can lead to powerful yet flexible solutions that are tailored to individual tasks and scenarios.
