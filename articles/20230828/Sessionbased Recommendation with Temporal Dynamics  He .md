Session-based recommendation is a widely adopted recommendation technique that aims to predict the user's next interaction based on their historical behavior within an individual session. The core idea behind this approach is that users' previous actions in a given session are more valuable and informative than those of other sessions, which can be helpful for personalized recommendations and providing accurate predictions at the right time.

Recently, several researchers proposed incorporating temporal dynamics into session-based recommendation models. However, there has been limited attention paid to applying temporal dynamics onto the task of session recommendation due to its complexity compared to sequential recommendation. In this article, we propose a novel framework for modeling the temporal dynamics between sessions in session-based recommendation. We build upon two key insights:

1. Users often make multiple decisions within one session without waiting for the result of subsequent interactions. This is referred to as "overt decision-making". Understanding such dynamics may help improve the quality of recommendations by revealing hidden preferences and peculiar behaviors.

2. Interactions in different sessions have different recency distributions but share some common characteristics. These features indicate that users might benefit from exploiting shared information across sessions. To exploit these potential benefits, we introduce a session clustering algorithm called EASE (Exploratory and Adaptive Session Embedding) that discovers latent patterns of overlapped sessions and assigns them corresponding clusters. By leveraging cluster semantics, our model learns contextual representations for each session and utilizes them for better recommendation performance.

To evaluate our model, we use real-world datasets collected from e-commerce websites and report comprehensive experimental results including offline metrics such as precision@k and recall@k, online evaluation metrics like MAUC, and user feedback evaluations using Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Our experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art sequential and content-based recommendation algorithms by a significant margin in terms of both offline metrics and user feedback scores. Moreover, our experiment also validates the effectiveness of our temporal dynamic modeling approach by analyzing the learned session embeddings and identifying the underlying overlapped groups, which provide valuable insight into the users' preferences and behaviors. Overall, our work demonstrates that incorporating temporal dynamics into session-based recommendation provides valuable insights and improved recommendation accuracy while reducing human intervention and thus promoting active engagement towards more enjoyable products.

In summary, we hope this paper inspires readers to consider how to effectively utilize multi-session data during recommendation tasks, particularly when it comes to dealing with overt decision-making and uncertainty induced by long-term effects. Besides, we suggest further research directions to explore the connections between session recommendations and social media usage patterns, which can provide new perspectives for understanding users’ interests, needs, and preferences.

## 2.1 Sequential Recommendation
Sequential recommendation is another commonly used recommendation technique where the system suggests items in order of decreasing relevance or rating score. For example, Netflix recommends movies according to their release date or rating score, and Amazon displays recommended product suggestions based on past purchase history or browsing behavior. 

The basic principle behind sequential recommendation is simple yet effective: given a set of known user preferences, select the most relevant item for the current user based on what they have consumed before. There are various approaches to building recommendation systems using sequential data, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid recommendation systems, and deep learning methods.

However, sequential recommendation suffers from drawbacks including scalability issues, cold-start problem, sparsity issue, and no notion of diversity. To address these problems, many researchers have proposed alternative techniques such as neural collaborative filtering (NCF), hybrid recommendation systems, explainable recommendation systems, and knowledge-graph-enhanced recommendation systems.

## 2.2 Content-Based Filtering 
Content-based filtering assumes that similar items tend to have similar properties or categories, and selects the most relevant item based on these properties. It can capture users' preference over items directly through explicit ratings or implicit preferences inferred from the user's behavior. The main challenge is to find suitable representation vectors for items to enable efficient similarity search. Popular techniques include matrix factorization, vector quantization, and deep learning methods.

Despite their successes, content-based filtering still suffers from drawbacks such as high dimensionality, slow speed, lack of adaptability to changes in user tastes, and no consideration of temporal aspects. Therefore, researchers have proposed numerous techniques to combine sequential and content-based approaches to enhance recommendation performance.

## 2.3 Hybrid Recommendation Systems
Hybrid recommendation systems combine sequential and content-based approaches to improve recommendation performance by combining strengths of each method. Two popular examples include collaborative filtering with content-based filtering (e.g., CBF), where the former focuses on capturing user preferences based on past purchases and clicks, while the latter captures item properties to generate recommendations that are specifically tailored to users' preferences.

However, there has been little exploration of integrating temporal dynamics into hybrid recommendation systems. Some recent works incorporate time-aware collaborative filtering into hybrid recommendation systems, such as CF-TWR, which combines ratings and timestamps to refine the recommendation process. Despite the success of these works, they do not explicitly handle temporal dynamics in the recommendation process. Additionally, most hybrid recommendation systems only focus on generating general recommendations, neglecting the specific requirements of different types of users who may require customized recommendations depending on their lifestyle, goals, and preferences. Thus, there is a need to develop more advanced hybrid recommendation systems that take into account user preferences, goals, constraints, and behaviors to deliver the optimal experience for each individual user.
