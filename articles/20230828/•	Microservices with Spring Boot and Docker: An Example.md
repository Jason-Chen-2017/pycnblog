## Microservices with Spring Boot and Docker: An Example Project Case Study
Microservice architectures are becoming increasingly popular as a way to develop software applications that can be easily maintained, scaled and deployed in different environments without disrupting the services’ own business functionality or other microservices. In this blog post, I will present an example project using Spring Boot and Docker for developing microservices and discuss its implementation details such as eureka server, gateway, service registry, monitoring tools, configuration management, etc. The purpose of this article is to provide valuable information about how to build scalable and robust microservices using Spring Boot framework and Docker containerization technology.


In this blog post, we will implement an example project that includes two microservices (employee and department) that communicate via HTTP requests using RestTemplate. We will also use Eureka Server, Gateway and Service Registry for managing these microservices across multiple instances. Finally, we will add some extra features like monitoring tools, configuration management, logging and testing to make our application more reliable, flexible and secure. By following the steps outlined below, you should have a good understanding of how to design, implement and deploy your own microservices using Spring Boot and Docker technologies. 

## Prerequisites: Java/JDK 1.8+, Maven 3+ and Docker installed on your system.
Before getting started, please ensure that you have installed the required prerequisites mentioned above. Also, it is recommended to have basic knowledge of RESTful API concepts. If not, then I suggest you read up on those before proceeding further. Additionally, if you are new to microservices architecture and Docker, I would recommend reading up on the basics of both topics first. 

Let's get started by setting up our development environment. 


# Development Environment Setup
To set up our development environment, we need to install JDK 1.8+, Apache Maven 3+ and Docker on our machine. Here are the step-by-step instructions to do so:

1. Install JDK 1.8

2. Install Apache Maven 3

Note: Please ensure that the mvn command is recognized even when there isn't an explicit mvn script added to your path. You may need to create a symbolic link or modify the path variable depending on your operating system.

3. Install Docker 
Finally, we need to install Docker on our system. There are various ways to do so depending on the platform and type of installation you prefer. However, here are the step-by-step instructions for installing Docker on Ubuntu Linux:

   i. Update Package Lists
   ```sudo apt-get update```
   
   ii. Install Dependencies 
   ```sudo apt-get install \
     apt-transport-https \
     ca-certificates \
     curl \
     software-properties-common```
   
   iii. Add Docker GPG Key 
   ```curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -```
   
   iv. Set Up the Repository 
   ```sudo add-apt-repository \
     "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
     $(lsb_release -cs) \
     stable"```
   
   v. Update Package Lists Again 
   ```sudo apt-get update```
   
   vi. Install Docker CE 
   ```sudo apt-get install docker-ce```
   
   viii. Verify Installation 
   ```sudo docker run hello-world```
   
 Note: This guide assumes that you are familiar with the basics of Unix commands and package managers. For advanced users, there are many resources available online, including Docker documentation. 
 
 
 
Now, let's move onto implementing our example project.
