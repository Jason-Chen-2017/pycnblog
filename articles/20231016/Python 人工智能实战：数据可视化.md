# 1.背景介绍


Data visualization is one of the most important skills for data scientists and AI developers. It helps them to communicate their findings and insights better with non-technical audience. Therefore, knowing how to visualize data effectively can save a lot of time and effort for both researchers and practitioners. 

The importance of Data Visualization lies in its ability to help you make sense of your data. You need to have an intuitive understanding of what information is present in the dataset before you start working on it. This will help you choose the right visualizations that are appropriate for your needs and convert complex ideas into simple graphs and charts.

In this article, we will explore various techniques used by data visualization experts to visualize data efficiently. We will also demonstrate some real-world examples along with code implementation so that readers can understand the concept clearly. By reading this article, readers should be able to create effective and engaging data visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh.

# 2.核心概念与联系
Before diving deep into data visualization, let’s first review some key concepts and principles:

1. Audiocapitalism: Data Visualization enables us to extract valuable insights from raw data without having to analyze it manually. The value derived from these insights often outweighs any manual analysis required to find the same.

2. Chartjunk: There is no perfect chart or graph that fits every scenario. Sometimes, one may feel that too many charts distract from the main message. In those cases, a good technique would be to use smaller, simpler charts that complement each other rather than clutter up the entire report. 

3. Simplicity: Clear and concise representation of data is essential in order to convey the message effectively. Any overrepresentation of certain values or categories can easily mislead others. When drawing conclusions, it's always advisable to refer back to the original source material if necessary.

4. Gridlines and color coding: Gridlines provide a framework where users can compare different aspects of the data set. Color coding is another useful feature that allows analysts to quickly identify patterns and trends in the data.


Now that we have reviewed the basics, let’s dive deeper into several common data visualization tools used in industry today:

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is perhaps the oldest and most commonly used data visualization library available in Python. It provides a powerful interface for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations within a single environment. It has extensive support for scientific computing and publication quality graphics. Matplotlib supports numerous types of plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram, pie chart, etc., which makes it easy to produce high-quality figures even for large datasets. However, Matplotlib doesn't have a built-in support for advanced features such as radar plot, polar plot, etc. Additionally, Matplotlib lacks flexibility when it comes to customizing individual elements of the plots such as axis labels, titles, legends, colors, size, layout, etc. So, if more advanced customization is needed, it requires a good amount of extra work. On the other hand, Matplotlib offers a wide range of themes and styles that can be customized easily. Matplotlib is suitable for generating basic but clean graphical representations.

Here's an example of plotting a simple line graph using Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('X Label')
plt.ylabel('Y Label')
plt.title('Simple Line Graph')
plt.show()
```

Output:


We just created a simple line graph using Matplotlib. We specified x and y coordinates of our points and plotted them using `plt.plot()` function. Then, we added labels and title to our graph using `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()` and `plt.title()`. Finally, we displayed the figure using `plt.show()` function.
