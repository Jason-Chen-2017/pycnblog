## 定义及分类
 marketing strategies are those tools and methods used to engage customers or potential customers in a desired market segment for the purpose of generating sales, revenue or profits. Their goal is to develop meaningful relationships with prospective customers and identify their needs, wants and desires, so that they become repeat buyers or users. They rely on a variety of techniques such as branding, pricing, distribution channels, customer service, product placement, etc., which help them achieve these goals. Marketing strategies can be classified into four main categories: direct marketing (also known as transactional marketing), search engine marketing, content marketing, and social media marketing.
 Market segmentation is the process by which businesses target specific groups of customers based on common characteristics such as demographics, behaviors, interests, products, brands, locations, etc. These segments are then targeted using different marketing strategies depending on the nature of the business and its objectives.
 Market research plays an important role in determining what marketing strategy is most suitable for each market segment. It involves examining data such as company performance indicators, competitor analysis, consumer behavior patterns, survey responses, customer feedback, etc. Based on this information, marketers select the appropriate marketing strategy(ies) to attract and retain customers.
## Why use marketing strategies?
To provide value to consumers, organizations need to engage customers effectively within their target markets. This requires understanding the customer's preferences, motivations, aspirations, concerns, wants and needs, as well as their financial situation and level of commitment to the organization. By utilizing marketing strategies that are tailored to each customer, companies can generate more effective leads and reduce churn rates. Additionally, through effective segmentation and targeting, marketing strategies allow companies to reach people who might not otherwise consider buying from the company. Overall, marketing strategies are essential for any successful business model.

## Customer Segmentation
Market segmentation refers to the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on certain attributes such as demographic characteristics, behavioral traits, location, industry, size, and age. Among other things, it helps businesses understand the needs and preferences of different types of customers and create customized marketing programs tailored towards each group. For example, if a company has a large number of students, marketing programs may focus on promoting scholarships or educational resources rather than general merchandise. Similarly, if a retailer sells clothing items, it may tailor promotional offers to suit those with low income or high education levels. Businesses often use various techniques such as surveys, focus groups, and profiling to gain insights about their target audience and design custom marketing campaigns tailored specifically to them.
## Customer Personas
A customer persona represents a set of characteristics and behaviors that define a typical customer, including demographics, psychographics, attitudes, behaviors, needs, motivations, hobbies, skills, values, emotions, and beliefs. To better serve these individuals, businesses must create personalized marketing materials that reflect their unique characteristics. For instance, a college student persona might have a strong preference for higher quality classes while also being driven to succeed. On the other hand, a woman with poor financial circumstances may prioritize accessories over fashion because she does not want to spend too much. Creating clear and concise descriptions of individual customer personas allows marketing teams to create highly targeted marketing materials.
## Behavioral Targeting
Behavioral targeting involves identifying customers' habits and preferences and creating marketing campaigns that match them. Customers typically seek out familiar products, services, or brands, but marketing strategies can target customers' behavioral traits such as shopping styles, frequency of purchases, usage patterns, sentimentality, and perceptions of fairness. This approach not only creates greater engagement with customers but also encourages loyalty and adds credibility to the brand image. For example, a movie theater chain might target younger viewers who prefer classic movies or comedies, whereas a bookstore could promote books that appeal to teenagers. Despite the importance of behavioral targeting, many businesses still rely heavily on traditional demographics-based targeting due to its limitations in capturing nuanced customer preferences.
## Geography Targeting
Geographical targeting involves targeting customers based on their geographical location. Companies can utilize this technique when they have physical stores, distribution centers, or delivery agents located across multiple regions or countries. Providing relevant products and services in local markets can increase sales and improve customer experience. However, it becomes difficult to maintain consistency across all regions since marketing strategies and trends vary widely. In contrast, geography-based targeting can lead to compromised outcomes since individual customers may have conflicting opinions about where they should shop or visit.
## Pricing Strategy
Pricing strategies aim to determine how much a customer will pay for a particular product or service. There are several ways to price products, including setting a base price, inflating prices, setting minimum/maximum prices, or charging discounts or freebies. Common pricing models include markup, cost per acquisition, cost per lead generation, cost per unit sold, and discount percentages. Understanding the factors that influence pricing decisions can inform marketing decisions, especially when dealing with complex pricing structures that require optimization or dynamic adjustments. Additionally, businesses must account for taxes and fees associated with online transactions before finalizing pricing.
## Social Media Promotion
Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have become increasingly popular among millennials and young adults alike. With their ease of accessibility and large user bases, these platforms are becoming indispensable in communicating ideas, providing support, and connecting with fellow members of the community. As a result, marketing strategies involving social media play an integral role in gaining traction and building connections with potential customers. Popular platforms like Instagram and YouTube offer a vast amount of opportunity for creative marketing activities, including photography, video production, and storytelling. Other platforms like Facebook and Twitter enable businesses to interact directly with customers via live chat or emails, thereby reducing the likelihood of losing customers during busy periods. Overall, the ability to connect with customers online and leverage social media platforms is critical for driving growth and enhancing customer experience.
