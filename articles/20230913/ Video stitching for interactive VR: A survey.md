Video Stitching is a process of joining or concatenating multiple video streams to create a single continuous stream that can be viewed as one logical video from different perspectives and angles. Interactive Virtual Reality (IVR) has emerged as a new technology in the last decade with the advancement of gaming consoles such as Oculus Quest and HTC Vive. It brings immersive experiences to users by allowing them to interact with virtual objects through their eyes or hands while experiencing videos and audio stimuli together. In this paper we review the literature on Video Stitching techniques used in IVR systems and identify several issues related to current approaches. We then propose a novel approach for optimizing IVR content delivery based on our understanding of user needs and design principles. Finally, we present a set of research challenges and opportunities in Video Stitching for IVR systems. 

In addition, we provide guidelines for authors on how to structure technical articles and references appropriate for scientific papers and conference proceedings.

2.相关术语与定义
- Video Stitching: Video stitching is the merging of two or more video segments into a single continuous image or video sequence called panorama or mosaic. This involves creating an overlapping view of distinct images or parts of scenes taken at different times or places using computer algorithms. Video stitching applications include surveillance, security, medical imaging, and photography. 
- Computer Vision: The field of computer vision explores the use of machine learning methods to extract valuable information from digital images, mainly focussing on identifying and describing visual features. Its applications include face recognition, object detection, motion analysis, and scene understanding. 
- Gaze Tracking: Gaze tracking refers to the process of obtaining eye movement data from the human eye. These movements can be tracked over time using various technologies including camera-based systems and smartphone hardware. Applications of gaze tracking are diverse, ranging from mobile hci to medical devices. 
- Optical Flow: Optical flow is the vector field created when light or other forms of radiation propagate through an image or frame. By measuring the spatial and temporal displacement between adjacent frames, it enables computer algorithms to infer the motion of objects in the video. Some common optical flow techniques include Lucas-Kanade algorithm and Horn-Schunck algorithm. 
- Motion Capture Systems: Motion capture systems record and store motion data generated by objects moving within a static environment. These systems use markers attached to the subjects' bodies or clothing to track their position and orientation changes. Examples of motion capture systems include LeapMotion and Kinect.

## 3.1 Overview of Common Approaches
The majority of the existing works in video stitching for IVR system rely on feature extraction followed by matching techniques like ORB/SIFT, RANSAC and triangulation. However, these methods require specialized hardware and may not work accurately under all conditions. Therefore, there have been attempts to optimize these processes by developing multi-scale detectors and descriptors. Nevertheless, these methods still fail to achieve real-time performance in high definition environments where small details can become visible. 

Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in numerous tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. There exists many DNN architectures specifically designed for video processing like convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and transformers. CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art results in various video tasks including action recognition, anomaly detection, and object tracking. Despite significant improvements, CNNs have limited ability to handle large scale video datasets due to its computation complexity and memory usage. To address these limitations, recent works explore transformer models that leverage parallel computing capabilities and attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy of video representations. 

To optimize content delivery, some authors suggest adaptive streaming protocols that adaptively adjust resolution levels, bit rates, and buffer sizes depending on network bandwidth and quality constraints. Other proposals seek to reduce latency during playback by incorporating multi-threading and asynchronous rendering techniques. Last but not least, caching strategies can be employed to avoid redundant computations by storing intermediate results in local storage.

## 3.2 Improved Techniques for Enhancing Image Quality
Several techniques have been proposed recently to improve the quality of video stitched images by reducing noise, blurring, removing artifacts, and improving contrast. Some popular techniques include denoising techniques such as Wiener filter, total variation denoiser, non-local means denoiser; texture filtering techniques like guided filtering and bilateral filtering; and super-resolution techniques like LapSRN, SRCNN, and ESRGAN.

Some studies also suggest that adding smoothness prior to denoising or applying certain filters before stitching could further improve the final result. Several researchers suggest integrating edge detection techniques into the pipeline to automatically detect edges and extract discontinuities in the input video sequences. They also argue that adopting subspace clustering techniques would help group similar images together and generate more stable panoramas.

Another promising direction is using upsampling layers instead of pooling layers in deep neural networks. Upsampling layers enable the model to learn rich features at different scales which will help to better preserve fine structures in the original images.
