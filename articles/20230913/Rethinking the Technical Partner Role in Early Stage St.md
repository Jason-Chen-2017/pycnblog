# 1.简介
  

Technology plays a crucial role in many aspects of early stage start-ups’ success. The technological paradigm shifts and new technologies emerge every day, making it difficult for early stage companies to keep pace with these developments while still managing their strategic direction effectively. In this article, we will discuss how technical partners can play an essential role in achieving sustainable growth and competitive advantage during the early stages of company development. We will also look at different roles and responsibilities that technical partners could have within their company structure to ensure that they function efficiently and effectively. 

The concept of technical partner has been around since the beginning of the internet era. It refers to a person who has expertise in certain areas of technology such as software engineering or network architecture, but may not be directly involved in executing specific projects or products. Technical partners are crucial in ensuring that the startup is well positioned to address issues related to product strategy, design, marketing, finance, customer service, operations, and support. However, defining and structuring the role of technical partners can be challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of early stage startups and the need for flexibility. To overcome these challenges and provide structured guidance on what technical partners should do, we propose using the framework provided by the famous media company Iron Summit Media to redefine and refine the traditional technical partner role. 

This approach provides clarity on the necessary skills required by technical partners, including problem-solving abilities, communication skills, leadership qualities, and knowledge of relevant technologies. Additionally, it sets clear expectations and outlines key tasks that technical partners should perform throughout the company lifecycle. By focusing on the role of technical partners and leveraging the existing strengths and capabilities of digital media companies, our proposed framework aims to help create a more collaborative environment where everyone is involved in developing successful businesses.
