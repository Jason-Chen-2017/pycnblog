# 1.简介
  

Domain adaptation is a fundamental problem in machine learning where the target domain has different distributions than the source domain, which requires special techniques to transfer knowledge from one domain to another. Neural machine translation (NMT), as an important subtask in natural language processing, suffers from this problem due to its low-resource requirement and diversity in human languages. In NMT, the encoder learns to encode information from both input sentence and corresponding output sentence pairs in parallel, but there remains no guarantee that these two sentences correspond semantically or syntactically. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial training scheme called Adversarial Domain Adaptation for NMT. Specifically, our method involves adversarially training two neural networks simultaneously: the first network learns to map the source sentences into target sentences while the second network tries to predict whether a pair of translations are real or fake based on their lexical similarity. This new approach allows us to learn more accurate representations and generate more fluent and natural-sounding translations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmark datasets such as WMT'14 EN-DE, IWSLT'14 EN-FR, and News Commentary v13 DE-EN. Finally, we hope this work can inspire further research in domain adaptation for NMT and other related tasks.

## Domain adaptation
Domain adaptation (DA) refers to the task of transferring knowledge learned from one domain to another without any label information about the target domain, such as test sets. DA methods involve optimizing a loss function with respect to a joint distribution between the source data and the target data. Common DA algorithms include:

1. Distribution alignment: train a model using only labeled target data to match the distribution of labeled source data. Examples include least square regression, kernel density estimation, and adversarial autoencoder.
2. Regression based: learn a mapping function between the features of labeled source data and those of unlabeled target data by minimizing the difference between them. The most common example is supervised domain adaptation, where the goal is to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted and actual values of the target variable given the source feature representation. Other examples include meta-learning and conditional adversarial networks.
3. Generative models: use generative modeling to align the probability distributions of latent variables in the source and target domains. An example of this technique is style transfer, where the target image is generated by transforming the content image in the source domain according to the style transferred from the target domain. Another example is adversarial autoencoders, where a discriminator is trained to distinguish synthetic images generated from the shared encoder part of the generator and true images in the target domain. 
4. Hybrid approaches: combine multiple DA techniques together to improve generalization performance. One example is mixup, where a linear combination of original samples is used during training instead of simply copying them. Another example is DANN, where a classifier is trained on the concatenation of the softmax outputs of the source and target domains. 

The main idea behind domain adaptation is to leverage the existing labeled source data to construct a reliable model that can handle the new challenging scenarios in the target domain. We often assume that the distributions of source and target data do not overlap significantly, so it may be challenging to directly apply standard deep learning methods to solve DA problems because they rely heavily on labeled data. However, recent advances in deep learning have made significant progress towards solving this challenge. Nevertheless, many open challenges still remain before the field becomes fully mature. For instance, how should we incorporate prior knowledge into the DA process? Should we consider domain shifts across modalities or within a single modality? How can we ensure that the final learned model works well under different evaluation settings? How can we evaluate the effectiveness of various DA algorithms? These questions will continue to drive the development of DA technologies. 

## Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
Neural machine translation (NMT) is a popular subtask in natural language processing that aims at automatically translating text between two languages. NMT relies on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to build a sequence-to-sequence model that maps a sequence of words in one language to another. The encoder takes in the source sentence and encodes it into a fixed-length vector representation. The decoder then generates the target sentence word by word based on this encoded representation and previous predictions. While RNNs have achieved impressive results in many NLP tasks, their success comes with a trade-off - they require extensive amounts of training data and suffer from the curse of dimensionality when dealing with large vocabularies. To deal with this limitation, NMT systems typically employ attention mechanisms, which enable the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. Despite their successes, NMT systems also face several practical limitations that hinder their widespread usage. Firstly, lack of high-quality training data hinders NMT system's ability to learn robust mappings between source and target languages. Secondly, conventional MT systems usually produce only the top ranked hypothesis, which means that errors cannot always be detected early enough to correct them. Additionally, even though NMT systems achieve good accuracy, they tend to produce long sequences that make them difficult to read and understand. To address these issues, several techniques have been proposed in the literature to enhance NMT systems' quality, efficiency, and interpretability.

## Adversarial Training
Adversarial training is a powerful technique for improving deep neural networks' generalization capability. It involves generating adversarial examples that intentionally violate the ground truth labels and thus fool the classifiers. Adversarial examples can be classified into three categories:

1. Gradient based: Generate gradient attacks against the network parameters by adding small perturbations to the inputs, which cause the gradients of the network to become zero or very close to zero. Examples include FGSM attack and PGD attack.
2. Input space based: Generate pixel attacks by randomly changing the pixels of the input image. Examples include FastGradientSign Method and Iterative Attribution Methods Algorithm.
3. Decision boundary based: Train the network to classify all possible inputs into two classes and perform decision boundary attack by perturbing the input sample until it changes the classification result. Examples include Boundary Attack and CW Attack.

In order to create adversarial examples, the adversarial training algorithm needs to maximize the dissimilarity between the probabilities assigned by the network to real and adversarial inputs. One way to accomplish this is through the cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between the logit values assigned by the network to the true and false labels. However, this loss does not take into account the diverse nature of natural language data, leading to the likelihood of producing misleading adversarial examples that pass some semantic checks but fail others. To address this issue, we introduce an auxiliary objective function to measure the distance between two real translations by measuring their cosine similarity. Intuitively, if two translations are similar in terms of their syntax and meaning, their associated probability distributions should be close. By contrast, if two translations differ in structure or form, their probability distributions should be far apart. Therefore, the secondary objective encourages the network to assign higher probability to pairs of real translations whose distances between their associated probability distributions are closer, while assigning lower probability to pairs with larger distances. Our proposed framework, Adversarial Domain Adaptation for NMT (ADDA), combines adversarial training with auxiliary objectives to improve the generalization performance of NMT models across domains with varying levels of data availability and distribution differences.
