# 1.简介
  


Coding interviews are an essential aspect of a software developer’s job description. However, many candidates fail to perform well in these tests due to lack of knowledge or skills and poor communication with the interviewer. To overcome this issue, we need to prepare ourselves effectively by learning how to handle coding interviews. 

In this guide for all employers, I will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to master coding interviews so that you can ace them without feeling too intimidated. Whether it is your first time preparing for coding interviews or if you have experience in conducting interviews, I hope my article helps! 

 # 2.基础知识准备
Before embarking on your journey towards becoming a top-notch software engineer, it is essential to have a solid understanding of programming concepts such as algorithms, data structures, object-oriented design patterns, etc. You should also be familiar with popular coding libraries and frameworks like Java, Python, JavaScript, etc., so that you can utilize their built-in functions when solving problems. Additionally, familiarity with system architecture principles, security best practices, and web application development techniques would be beneficial.


# 3.面试前准备
Firstly, make sure you practice the standard techniquest (questions) used in real-world technical interviews beforehand. This way, you can anticipate any potential pitfalls or weaknesses during the interview process. Here are some tips to help you out with the preparation: 

 - Know your interview language(s): Choose the languages commonly used in the industry or companies that you want to work for. Understanding the syntax and basic constructs of each language will give you a better grasp on common coding challenges.

 - Reach out to colleagues: If possible, ask other engineers at the company to review questions from different domains and experiences. This could help you identify which areas may require deeper expertise in order to answer more complex interview questions. 

 - Be specific about your background: It's important to provide enough information regarding yourself and your relevant experience to ensure that the interviewer understands your strengths and interests. Speak clearly and concisely, and avoid making assumptions or generalizations based solely on facts alone.

 - Prepare sample code solutions: Before the actual interview, try to write down a couple of example code solutions to difficult problem statements that you feel comfortable handling. This not only gives you practice writing clean and efficient code but also provides insight into what approach you might take when approaching similar scenarios during the interview.

 - Make use of online resources: There are numerous online resources available for free that provide examples of good coding practices, algorithm implementations, and interview question prompts. Utilizing these resources can save you significant time and effort spent researching and studying for interviews.

 - Practice using whiteboard/pencil: Practicing interviewing techniques with a whiteboard or paper can improve your ability to visualize data structures and processes visually, allowing you to more accurately communicate your thought process with the interviewer. Moreover, it's useful to keep track of previous exercises, notes, and mistakes to reinforce your knowledge and build stronger problem-solving skills.



Now let's move on to the core concepts of algorithmic thinking, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, string manipulation algorithms, and dynamic programming. We'll also discuss hash tables, graphs, trees, and other data structures and their applications in various contexts. In addition, we'll explore binary search trees, heaps, and ternary search trees, as well as how to implement them efficiently using arrays. Finally, we'll talk about recursion, memoization, and backtracking algorithms, as well as why they're critical components of modern computer science. By the end of this section, you should have a solid understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structure concepts, which will be crucial to your success in coding interviews. 



# 4.Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is an efficient method for arranging elements in a list or array in ascending or descending order. The most widely known sorting algorithm is the bubble sort algorithm, followed closely by insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, heapsort, and others. Each has its own set of properties and advantages, but overall they follow a similar pattern of comparison-based swapping operations. 

Here are some common sorting algorithms along with their average and worst case time complexity:

 - Bubble Sort: Average Case O(n^2), Worst Case O(n^2). Efficient for small lists or partially sorted lists.
   
  ```javascript
  function bubbleSort(arr) {
      var len = arr.length;
      for (var i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
          for (var j = 0; j < len - i - 1; j++) {
              if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                  // Swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
                  var temp = arr[j];
                  arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                  arr[j+1] = temp;
              }
          }
      }
      return arr;
  }
  ```
 
 - Insertion Sort: Average Case O(n^2), Worst Case O(n^2). Similar to bubble sort, but slightly less efficient for partially sorted lists.

  ```javascript
  function insertionSort(arr) {
      var len = arr.length;
      for (var i = 1; i < len; i++) {
          var key = arr[i];
          var j = i - 1;
          while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
              arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
              j--;
          }
          arr[j + 1] = key;
      }
      return arr;
  }
  ```

 - Selection Sort: Average Case O(n^2), Worst Case O(n^2). Inefficient on large datasets because it involves multiple passes through the dataset. 

  ```javascript
  function selectionSort(arr) {
      var len = arr.length;
      for (var i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
          var minIndex = i;
          for (var j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
              if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                  minIndex = j;
              }
          }
          if (minIndex!== i) {
              var temp = arr[i];
              arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
              arr[minIndex] = temp;
          }
      }
      return arr;
  }
  ```

 - Merge Sort: Average Case O(n log n), Worst Case O(n log n). Divide the list into halves recursively until there are single element subarrays, then merge them together in sorted order.
 
  ```javascript
  function mergeSort(arr) {
      if (arr.length <= 1) {
          return arr;
      }
      var middle = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
      var leftArr = arr.slice(0, middle);
      var rightArr = arr.slice(middle);
      return merge(mergeSort(leftArr), mergeSort(rightArr));
  }
  
  function merge(leftArr, rightArr) {
      var result = [];
      var indexLeft = 0;
      var indexRight = 0;
      while (indexLeft < leftArr.length && indexRight < rightArr.length) {
          if (leftArr[indexLeft] < rightArr[indexRight]) {
              result.push(leftArr[indexLeft]);
              indexLeft++;
          } else {
              result.push(rightArr[indexRight]);
              indexRight++;
          }
      }
      return result.concat(leftArr.slice(indexLeft)).concat(rightArr.slice(indexRight));
  }
  ```

 - Quick Sort: Average Case O(n log n), Worst Case O(n^2). Select a pivot element and partition the array around it, placing smaller elements on one side and larger elements on the other. Then recursively apply the same procedure to the two resulting partitions.

  ```javascript
  function quickSort(arr) {
      if (arr.length <= 1) {
          return arr;
      }
      var pivot = arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)];
      var leftArr = [];
      var rightArr = [];
      for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
          if (arr[i] < pivot) {
              leftArr.push(arr[i]);
          } else if (arr[i] > pivot) {
              rightArr.push(arr[i]);
          }
      }
      return quickSort(leftArr).concat([pivot], quickSort(rightArr));
  }
  ```

 - Heap Sort: Average Case O(n log n), Worst Case O(n log n). Build a max heap from the unsorted array, then repeatedly extract the maximum element and replace it with the last remaining element in the heap.

  ```javascript
  function heapSort(arr) {
      buildMaxHeap(arr);
      for (var i = arr.length - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
          swap(arr, i, 0);
          siftDown(arr, 0, i - 1);
      }
      return arr;
  }
  
  function buildMaxHeap(arr) {
      for (var i = Math.floor(arr.length / 2) - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          siftDown(arr, i, arr.length - 1);
      }
  }
  
  function siftDown(arr, start, end) {
      var root = start;
      while (root * 2 + 1 <= end) {
          var child = root * 2 + 1;
          if (child + 1 <= end && arr[child] < arr[child + 1]) {
              child++;
          }
          if (arr[root] < arr[child]) {
              swap(arr, root, child);
              root = child;
          } else {
              break;
          }
      }
  }
  
  function swap(arr, i, j) {
      var temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[j];
      arr[j] = temp;
  }
  ```

  
  
# 5.Searching Algorithms

A search algorithm is used to find a particular item within a collection of items. Common searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, depth-first search, breadth-first search, and others. Linear search iterates through the entire list sequentially, checking each item for a match, whereas binary search divides the list into halves, eliminates half of the remaining elements, and repeats the process until the target item is found. Here are some common searching algorithms and their time complexity:

 - Linear Search: Average Case O(n), Worst Case O(n). Simply iterate through the list, comparing each item to the target value until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

  ```javascript
  function linearSearch(arr, target) {
      for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
          if (arr[i] === target) {
              return i;
          }
      }
      return -1; // Target not found
  }
  ```

 - Binary Search: Average Case O(log n), Worst Case O(n). Compare the target value to the midpoint of the current subarray being searched, eliminate half of the remaining elements, and repeat until the target is found or the subarray contains no elements.

  ```javascript
  function binarySearch(arr, target) {
      var left = 0;
      var right = arr.length - 1;
      while (left <= right) {
          var mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
          if (arr[mid] === target) {
              return mid;
          } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
              left = mid + 1;
          } else {
              right = mid - 1;
          }
      }
      return -1; // Target not found
  }
  ```
  
 - Depth-First Search: Traverse a graph or tree data structure starting from a specified node and visiting every connected component of the graph, exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|) where V denotes vertices and E denotes edges.

  ```javascript
  function dfs(graph, startNode) {
      visited = {};
      stack = [startNode];
      while (stack.length > 0) {
          var currentNode = stack.pop();
          if (!visited[currentNode]) {
              console.log(currentNode);
              visited[currentNode] = true;
              for (var neighbor in graph[currentNode]) {
                  stack.push(neighbor);
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
    
 - Breadth-First Search: Traverse a graph or tree data structure starting from a specified node and visiting all nodes at the same distance from the starting node before moving on to the next level of depth. Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|) where V denotes vertices and E denotes edges.

  ```javascript
  function bfs(graph, startNode) {
      visited = {};
      queue = [startNode];
      while (queue.length > 0) {
          var currentNode = queue.shift();
          if (!visited[currentNode]) {
              console.log(currentNode);
              visited[currentNode] = true;
              for (var neighbor in graph[currentNode]) {
                  queue.push(neighbor);
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  
  
# 6.String Manipulation Algorithms

String manipulation algorithms involve manipulating strings character by character, usually following certain rules or transformations. Some common string manipulation algorithms include substring finding, palindrome detection, regular expression matching, string replacement, and others. Here are some common string manipulation algorithms and their time complexity:

 - Substring Finding: O(m + n) time complexity where m and n represent lengths of input strings respectively.

  ```javascript
  function findSubstring(str, substr) {
      var count = 0;
      for (var i = str.indexOf(substr); i!= -1; i = str.indexOf(substr, i + 1)) {
          count++;
      }
      return count;
  }
  ```

 - Palindrome Detection: Check if a given string reads the same backward as forward.

  ```javascript
  function isPalindrome(str) {
      var left = 0;
      var right = str.length - 1;
      while (left < right) {
          if (str[left].toLowerCase()!== str[right].toLowerCase()) {
              return false;
          }
          left++;
          right--;
      }
      return true;
  }
  ```

 - Regular Expression Matching: Use a pattern to match text against a set of predefined characters, wildcards, and special symbols. Can be used for spellchecking, text parsing, tokenization, and more.

  ```javascript
  function regexMatch(pattern, str) {
      var re = new RegExp("^" + pattern + "$");
      return re.test(str);
  }
  ```

 - String Replacement: Replace occurrences of a substring in a string with another substring.

  ```javascript
  function replaceSubstring(str, oldSubstr, newSubstr) {
      return str.split(oldSubstr).join(newSubstr);
  }
  ```
   
  
# 7.Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler subproblems, and storing the results of those subproblems to reuse later. Dynamic programming offers significant speedup over brute force methods and is particularly helpful for optimization problems, which often exhibit overlapping subproblems. There are several types of dynamic programming approaches, including bottom-up, memoized, tabulated, and recursive approaches. Here are some common dynamic programming algorithms and their time complexity:

 - Bottom-Up Approach: Solve simple subproblems first, store the results, and combine them to solve the original problem. Best suitable for problems with distinct subproblems.

  ```javascript
  function fibonacci(n) {
      var cache = {};
      cache[0] = 0;
      cache[1] = 1;
      for (var i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
          cache[i] = cache[i-1] + cache[i-2];
      }
      return cache[n];
  }
  ```

 - Memoized Approach: Same idea as bottom-up except the cached values are stored instead of computed again. Good for problems with overlapping subproblems.

  ```javascript
  function lcsLength(str1, str2) {
      var cache = {};
      function helper(i, j) {
          if (i == null || j == null) {
              return 0;
          }
          if (cache[[i, j]]!= undefined) {
              return cache[[i, j]];
          }
          if (str1.charAt(i) === str2.charAt(j)) {
              cache[[i, j]] = 1 + helper(i+1, j+1);
          } else {
              cache[[i, j]] = Math.max(helper(i+1, j), helper(i, j+1));
          }
          return cache[[i, j]];
      }
      return helper(0, 0);
  }
  ```

 - Tabulated Approach: Precompute all combinations of subproblems upfront and store them in a table. Best suited for problems with increasing size of inputs.

  ```javascript
  function knapsackProblem(items, capacity) {
      var n = items.length;
      var dp = [];
      for (var i = 0; i <= capacity; i++) {
          dp[i] = [];
      }
      for (var i = 0; i <= capacity; i++) {
          for (var j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
              if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                  dp[i][j] = 0;
              } else if (items[j-1].weight <= i) {
                  dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j-1], items[j-1].value + dp[i-items[j-1].weight][j-1]);
              } else {
                  dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1];
              }
          }
      }
      return dp[capacity][n];
  }
  ```

 - Recursive Approach: Solve the base cases (i.e., when either the number of items or the capacity limit is zero) separately, and otherwise split the problem into two parts, recursing on the appropriate part of the problem, and combining the results.

  ```javascript
  function factorial(n) {
      if (n == 0) {
          return 1;
      } else {
          return n * factorial(n-1);
      }
  }
  ```

  

# 8.Data Structures

Data structures are the building blocks of programming languages. They organize and manage data, providing ways to access, manipulate, and search for it. Data structures can vary significantly in terms of efficiency, space usage, and features provided. Popular data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, sets, maps, trees, and graphs. Let's go through some common data structures:

 - Arrays: An ordered sequence of fixed size, implemented as contiguous memory locations. Supports constant-time appends and random access to individual elements.

  ```javascript
  var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  ```

 - Linked Lists: A sequence of nodes containing data and pointers to other nodes. Supports fast insertion and deletion at both ends of the list.

  ```javascript
  function Node(data) {
      this.data = data;
      this.next = null;
  }
  
  function LinkedList() {
      this.head = null;
      this.tail = null;
  }
  
  LinkedList.prototype.add = function(data) {
      var newNode = new Node(data);
      if (this.head == null) {
          this.head = newNode;
          this.tail = newNode;
      } else {
          this.tail.next = newNode;
          this.tail = newNode;
      }
  };
  ```

 - Stacks: Last-in, First-out (LIFO) data structure supporting push and pop operations.

  ```javascript
  function Stack() {
      this.items = [];
  }
  
  Stack.prototype.push = function(item) {
      this.items.push(item);
  };
  
  Stack.prototype.pop = function() {
      return this.items.pop();
  };
  ```

 - Queues: First-in, First-out (FIFO) data structure supporting enqueue and dequeue operations.

  ```javascript
  function Queue() {
      this.items = [];
  }
  
  Queue.prototype.enqueue = function(item) {
      this.items.push(item);
  };
  
  Queue.prototype.dequeue = function() {
      return this.items.shift();
  };
  ```

 - Heaps: A specialized tree-based data structure where parent nodes always contain greater values than children. Used for implementing priority queues, scheduling algorithms, and many other applications.

  ```javascript
  function MaxHeap() {
      this.heap = [];
  }
  
  MaxHeap.prototype.insert = function(element) {
      this.heap.push(element);
      var currentIndex = this.heap.length - 1;
      while (currentIndex > 0) {
          var parentIndex = Math.floor((currentIndex - 1) / 2);
          if (this.heap[parentIndex] < this.heap[currentIndex]) {
              var temp = this.heap[parentIndex];
              this.heap[parentIndex] = this.heap[currentIndex];
              this.heap[currentIndex] = temp;
          }
          currentIndex = parentIndex;
      }
  };
  
  MaxHeap.prototype.extractMax = function() {
      var maxElement = this.heap[0];
      this.heap[0] = this.heap[this.heap.length - 1];
      this.heap.splice(-1, 1);
      var currentIndex = 0;
      var length = this.heap.length;
      while (true) {
          var leftChildIndex = currentIndex * 2 + 1;
          var rightChildIndex = currentIndex * 2 + 2;
          var largestIndex;
          if (leftChildIndex < length && this.heap[leftChildIndex] > this.heap[largestIndex]) {
              largestIndex = leftChildIndex;
          }
          if (rightChildIndex < length && this.heap[rightChildIndex] > this.heap[largestIndex]) {
              largestIndex = rightChildIndex;
          }
          if (largestIndex == null) {
              break;
          } else {
              var temp = this.heap[largestIndex];
              this.heap[largestIndex] = this.heap[currentIndex];
              this.heap[currentIndex] = temp;
          }
          currentIndex = largestIndex;
      }
      return maxElement;
  };
  ```

 - Sets: An unordered collection of unique elements. Set membership testing takes O(1) time on average.

  ```javascript
  var fruitsSet = new Set(['apple', 'banana', 'orange']);
  fruitsSet.has('apple'); // true
  fruitsSet.size; // 3
  ```

 - Maps: A key-value pair collection, where keys must be unique. Map lookups take O(1) time on average.

  ```javascript
  var personMap = new Map();
  personMap.set('Alice', {'age': 25, 'gender': 'female'});
  personMap.get('Alice').gender; // female
  ```

 - Trees: A hierarchical data structure where each node represents a vertex and its relationships to other nodes form edges.

  ```javascript
  class TreeNode {
      constructor(val) {
          this.val = val;
          this.left = null;
          this.right = null;
      }
  }
  
  const root = new TreeNode(1);
  root.left = new TreeNode(2);
  root.right = new TreeNode(3);
  root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
  root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);
  ```

 - Graphs: A network of nodes connected by edges representing relationships between objects.

  ```javascript
  class Graph {
      constructor() {
          this.nodes = new Map();
      }
      
      addNode(node) {
          this.nodes.set(node.name, node);
      }
      
      addEdge(sourceName, destName) {

# 9.Common Algorithmic Puzzles

Algorithmic puzzles present a challenge for developers who are looking to enhance their problem-solving skills. While not directly related to coding interviews, they are still worth practicing regularly to improve our problem-solving abilities. Here are some common algorithmic puzzles:

 - Hamming Weight Problem: Determine the total number of set bits in an integer.

  ```javascript
  function hammingWeight(n) {
      var count = 0;
      while (n > 0) {
          count += n & 1;
          n >>= 1;
      }
      return count;
  }
  ```

 - Maximum Product Subarray Problem: Find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray of integers.

  ```javascript
  function maxProduct(nums) {
      var maxSoFar = nums[0];
      var maxEndingHere = nums[0];
      var minEndingHere = nums[0];
      for (var i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
          var tempMax = maxEndingHere;
          maxEndingHere = Math.max(tempMax * nums[i], nums[i], minEndingHere * nums[i]);
          minEndingHere = Math.min(tempMax * nums[i], nums[i], minEndingHere * nums[i]);
          maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere);
      }
      return maxSoFar;
  }
  ```

 - FizzBuzz: Print numbers from 1 to N. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print “FizzBuzz”.

  ```javascript
  function fizzBuzz(N) {
      for (var i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
          if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
              console.log("FizzBuzz");
          } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
              console.log("Fizz");
          } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
              console.log("Buzz");
          } else {
              console.log(i);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

 - Single Number: Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

  ```javascript
  function singleNumber(nums) {
      var res = 0;
      for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
          res ^= nums[i];
      }
      return res;
  }
  ```

 - House Robber: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

  ```javascript
  function rob(nums) {
      var prevPrevMax = 0;
      var prevMax = 0;
      for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
          var tempPrevMax = prevMax;
          prevMax = Math.max(prevPrevMax + nums[i], prevMax);
          prevPrevMax = tempPrevMax;
      }
      return prevMax;
  }
  ```
