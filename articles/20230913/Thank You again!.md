Hello everyone, I am back after a long time.
It has been a pleasure to share with you the new AI technologies and products we have developed in the past few years. As an AI expert, software architect, CTO, I can tell you why this industry is going to grow even further. But before that let me give you a brief overview of what I do as an AI specialist:
I work for a company called Pannous, which provides machine learning-based NLP services such as language translation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER) and topic modeling. My job involves researching cutting edge techniques, developing advanced algorithms, and building scalable applications using these technologies. In addition to my technical responsibilities, I also manage other parts of the company's tech stack and ensure its smooth running. Some of my hobbies include playing tennis, baking bread, and taking photographs. Overall, I enjoy working closely with people from different backgrounds and cultures, enabling us to create high quality solutions together. So if you are interested in applying your knowledge and skills towards building intelligent systems or having fun in life, please reach out to me at <EMAIL>. I would love to chat more about our product ideas, problems, and possible collaborations. Thanks for reading!
This article will be a bit longer than usual because it covers several aspects related to AI technology development. Before we dive into the details, here are some general considerations you should keep in mind when deciding on a career path in AI:

1. Intelligence Artificielle (IA): This field is still very young, but there is already a lot of progress being made every day. There are many exciting projects currently underway, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, speech recognition, reinforcement learning, etc. Many companies are exploring how they can leverage their data and resources to develop effective IA solutions. The demand for skilled employees in this sector remains increasing over the next decade.

2. Career Opportunities: There are numerous roles available in AI. Depending on your experience level and interests, you may find yourself gravitating toward one of them. If you want to advance your career in AI, then it’s essential to choose a role that best suits your strengths and preferences. However, it’s not always easy to make a perfect choice between various options due to the wide range of choices and varied requirements. Here are some steps you could take to help you make an informed decision:

   - Start by reviewing key concepts and terminology. Understanding fundamental principles and jargon is critical to success. Read books, online tutorials, and conduct interviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of the field.
   - Evaluate current employment status and proficiency levels. Look at any existing job history, education, certifications, and professional accomplishments. Consider whether you meet the necessary criteria for the specific position you want to apply for.
   - Dive deep into the industry. Ask questions and explore industry trends to learn more about recent breakthroughs and future opportunities. Reach out to recruiters who might have relevant experiences and information.
   
3. Learning Strategies: One of the most important factors affecting your success in AI is how you approach learning. Your curiosity, persistence, attention to detail, and ability to explain complex ideas and approaches help shape your approach to learning new technologies. Here are five strategies you can use to improve your learning capacity:
   
   - Focus on concrete examples. It helps to understand the underlying theory behind an algorithm or technique better by looking at actual code implementations.
   - Practice makes permanent. Experimenting with different settings and inputs allows you to refine your problem-solving skills.
   - Seek feedback. Communicating with others regularly helps you identify gaps in your understanding and provide constructive criticism.
   - Challenge yourself. Doing something outside your comfort zone forces you to test your limits and improve your performance.
   - Attend conferences and workshops. Connecting with experts from around the world enables you to get up to date with latest research findings and practice your craft.
