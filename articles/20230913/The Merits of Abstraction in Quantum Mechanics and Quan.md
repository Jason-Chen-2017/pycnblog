## 1.1 为什么要写这个主题？
从物理学的角度来说，量子力学已经成为最重要的基础科学。它使得现代物理学和工程学得以突破古典观念并发现新的物理世界。在过去的几十年里，量子计算和量子通信等被应用到诸多领域中。其中的一些项目取得了巨大的成功，例如人工智能、生物信息学和量子控制系统。而对于其他一些项目，则存在严重的问题。例如，量子传感器的构建困难，这一点被认为是量子计算和量子通信技术的一个长期缺陷。因此，想要弄清楚量子力学与量子计算机技术之间的关系，理解它们的优势与局限性是非常重要的。此外，为了更好地理解和应用量子计算和量子通信技术，需要对这些技术背后的抽象原理有所了解。由于篇幅限制，我们只讨论两个大的研究领域——量子计算和量子通信，分别提出了自己的观点和意见。
## 1.2 写作目的与要求
在写作这个文章之前，我首先看了一遍量子计算的概述，介绍量子计算机的概念和组成部分，还有量子通信的基本概念和技术。然后仔细阅读量子力学与量子计算机的关系，发现它们都涉及到大量的抽象思维和数学模型。因此，本文将着重于量子计算和量子通信的抽象原理，以及它们的特点。基于抽象的视角，阐述它们为什么如此有效和优美，以及它们遇到的问题和挑战。最后，展望未来的发展方向和可能的挑战。
# 2. Abstract
In this article we will review the fundamental abstraction concepts used in quantum mechanics and quantum computer science. We will explore how these abstractions allow for new perspectives on problems that have been studied previously, leading to significant advances in areas such as quantum computing and quantum communication. Within each area, we will describe the key ideas behind these abstractions and their merits over previous approaches. Finally, we will discuss future directions and challenges in both areas. We hope that by examining these abstractions and explaining them in a clear and concise way, we can inform others about the importance of abstract thinking and mathematical modeling in quantum mechanics and quantum computer science, enabling more efficient solutions to complex problems through improved understanding of physical phenomena.
# 3. Introduction: Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing Overview
Quantum mechanics is one of the most famous branches of physics. It offers unprecedented insights into nature and has revolutionized many fields ranging from chemistry to biology, energy to transportation. In recent years, it has become increasingly popular due to its applications in quantum information processing, which provides immense potential for advancing scientific research, engineering, technology, and even society itself.

Quantum computing is an interdisciplinary field consisting of several subfields including quantum algorithms, quantum hardware, and software tools. To fully understand quantum computing, we need to first understand some basic concepts related to quantum mechanics. These include the concept of a qubit (quantum bit), entanglement, superposition, and measurement. Additionally, we also need to be familiar with various techniques and procedures involved in developing quantum computers. Some examples of quantum computing systems are superconducting circuits, quantum simulators, and cloud-based quantum computers.

The relationship between quantum mechanics and quantum computer science lies at the core of modern computational theory. They share similarities in terms of underlying principles but differ in terms of scale and scope. The latter includes theoretical models, simulations, and real-world implementations of quantum computing systems. 

For example, when we talk about quantum computation, we often use the term "algorithm" or refer to specific programming languages. However, in contrast, when we talk about quantum communication, we use the term "protocol". This distinction is important because protocols are precise sets of rules that define how two parties communicate using quantum communications devices. Similarly, the level of abstraction required for designing quantum algorithms also differs depending on the context. For instance, quantum error correction codes typically require a high degree of logical complexity compared to classical digital signal coding methods.

This article focuses specifically on the role of abstraction in quantum mechanics and quantum computer science, providing a thorough explanation of the underlying concepts and mathematical models used to study them. We will begin our discussion with a brief history of quantum mechanics before diving into the fundamental abstractions and models used in quantum computing and quantum communication. 
# 4. Quantum Mechanics Background
## 4.1 History
Quantum mechanics was proposed by Feynman in 1927 alongside his groundbreaking work on electrons in atoms. He hypothesized that elementary particles—such as electrons and protons—could exist in a quantum state rather than being restricted to certain physical states. Using mathematical formalism, he developed a general theory of quantum mechanics that allowed for predictions of the behavior of subatomic particles. Despite its intriguing character, however, quantum mechanics remained relatively unknown until the late 1950s, after Bell’s theorem had been developed and mathematically rigorously established.

After decades of progress in theoretical physics, experimentalists continued to push forward the boundaries of what had been thought possible. Quantum mechanics became widely recognized during World War II, following the defeat of Germany's Pan-American campaign in March 1945. During this conflict, physicists discovered unexpected features in radioactive decay and neutron stars. One major discovery was that light could shine through solid matter and reach deep into space. Another unsolved problem was whether white holes were possible in atomic nuclei and whether they would eventually go dark once vacuum pressure increased.

Even though quantum mechanics came to dominate the field of physics, it still remained far beyond the abilities of any individual scientist. In order to develop practical quantum machines, theories had to be broken down into smaller, more manageable components and explained in language that non-experts could understand. A large part of this process included using abstract algebra, linear algebra, and tensor algebra to represent the laws of quantum mechanics.

With all of these achievements in mind, we turn now to the world of quantum computing and quantum communication.
