# 1.简介
  

Welcome to this blog series on building your first android app with the help of Kotlin language. In this article, we will be discussing how to build a basic MVP architecture Android application using Kotlin programming language along with understanding key concepts such as View, Presenter and Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM) architecture pattern. By the end of the article, you should have an idea about creating apps in Android with Kotlin and understand the fundamentals behind it. 

In order to follow through this tutorial, you are expected to have some experience working with Kotlin programming language and know the basics of Android development like creating activities, fragments, views, layouts etc. If you don't have these skills yet, I suggest checking out my previous tutorials on Android development from scratch before attempting this one:


 
 
 
If you are still not familiar with Kotlin or any other part of Android development, please refer to the official documentation available for better learning outcomes. This is just a beginner's guide on building simple applications in Android using Kotlin programming language and MVVM architectural pattern so keep learning!

Let's start by looking at the main components of an Android Application and what they do.

# 2. Components of an Android Application
An Android application can be divided into various components as shown below:
## 2.1 Activities
Activities represent single screen of user interface which contains UI elements and handles user interaction. Each activity represents different functionality of the application. An activity can have multiple instances but there can only exist one activity running at a time within an application instance. An example of an Activity is the MainActivity of an app. When you open the app, it launches the MainActivity. 

To create an Activity in Android Studio, right click on package name -> New -> Activity -> Choose the type of activity you want to create (e.g., Basic Activity). Name your class according to the functionality of that particular activity. For e.g., if you want to implement a login feature, you may call the LoginActivity class. Then, add layout files to your activity where you want to display the UI.

Once you run the app, you'll see your new activity displayed on the device. The launch mode of the activity determines whether it gets restarted every time the user navigates back to it or remains in memory until explicitly killed. You can change the launch mode by modifying its properties in the AndroidManifest file.

Some common use cases of activities include:

 - Launching another activity

 - Displaying data on a screen

 - Sending or receiving data between activities
 
 - Updating the UI based on events
 
## 2.2 Fragments
Fragments allow us to break up complex screens into smaller chunks that can be easily maintained and modified without affecting the rest of the application. A fragment consists of two parts – a view hierarchy and logic code associated with it. It does not reside inside an Activity, instead it floats above the Activity’s view hierarchy and draws its own UI elements. We can embed fragments anywhere inside an activity and manage their lifecycle independently. Some examples of commonly used fragments are a navigation drawer, tabbed screens, dialogues, settings pages etc. To create a Fragment, extend the support.v4.app.Fragment class.

To include a fragment in our activity, simply override onCreateView() method and inflate the layout containing the fragment using the following code snippet:

  ```kotlin
    override fun onCreateView(inflater: LayoutInflater?, container: ViewGroup?,
                              savedInstanceState: Bundle?): View? {
        // Inflate the layout for this fragment
        return inflater!!.inflate(R.layout.fragment_name, container, false)
    }
  ```
  
This inflates the specified layout and adds it to the current activity's view hierarchy. Once added, the system manages the fragment's lifecycle. We also need to register the fragment in the activity's layout XML file by adding a placeholder for the fragment in the activity's root view, like this:
  
  ```xml
  <FrameLayout
      xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      android:id="@+id/container"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="match_parent">

      <!-- Add the Placeholder here -->
      
  </FrameLayout>
  ``` 
  
We then set the FrameLayout as the container for the fragment in onCreate(). Finally, we attach the fragment to the activity by calling `FragmentManager` methods and passing in the fragment manager, container ID and fragment object respectively. Here's an example:
  
   ```kotlin
    private val mFragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        // Create a new Fragment to be placed in the FrameLayout
        val myFragment = MyFragment()
 
        // Inflating the FrameLayout and placing the fragment inside it
        var transaction = mFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
        transaction.add(R.id.container, myFragment)
        transaction.commit()
 
    }
  ```

Here, we create a new instance of the MyFragment and initialize it when the activity is created. After that, we add the fragment to the activity's layout file using the FrameLayout defined earlier and attach it to the activity using a transaction object obtained from the FragmentManager. Now, whenever we navigate away from the activity and come back again, the fragment reappears with its saved state.
