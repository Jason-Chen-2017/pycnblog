# 1.简介
  

Web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites by using computer programming language scripts. It involves automating actions performed through a web browser, typically clicking on links or submitting forms, and then capturing the resulting pages' HTML code for later analysis. While traditional web scrapers written in scripting languages like PHP or Python can extract large amounts of unstructured text data, recent advancements in web technologies have enabled more efficient methods of web scraping that employ modern tools such as Selenium or Beautiful Soup. In this article, we will cover the basics of web scraping using these powerful libraries. 

In short, BeautifulSoup is an open-source library for parsing HTML documents and pulling out relevant information, while requests is an HTTP library that allows you to send GET/POST requests to web servers. These two libraries together allow us to access website content and scrape it without having to manually browse through them. We'll also look at some real world examples of how to use these libraries to collect useful data and insights from websites.

# 2.关键术语
Before diving into the technical details of web scraping, let's briefly define the key terms:

1. Crawler: A program used to automatically scan a website and find specific data or resources that are available online. The term crawling comes from the ancient Greek words "koron" meaning to move quickly and "graphos," meaning "to gather." 

2. Parsing: Extracting meaningful information from raw data, whether it be plain text or structured content, is called parsing. This process involves identifying patterns within the data and converting them into usable formats. For example, when scraping social media platforms such as Twitter, RSS feeds, etc., we need to parse their HTML or XML content so that we can identify the different pieces of information that interest us.

3. Spider: Another type of automated tool that scans a website and collects data from multiple pages is known as a spider. Unlike a crawler, which looks for new links and continues exploring them recursively until all relevant data has been collected, a spider only visits one page at a time and follows its internal links to retrieve additional data. 

4. Web scraper: A software application or script that retrieves data from websites using techniques such as web crawling and parsing is referred to as a web scraper. It uses various programming languages and tools including BeautifulSoup and requests, among others, to accomplish its task.

5. Web server: A computer system that stores and serves internet content over the World Wide Web (WWW). Each website runs on its own dedicated server, allowing users to interact with the site via their browsers. When a user navigates to a website URL, they are directed to the corresponding web server.

6. Website: A collection of webpages hosted on a single domain name under a shared IP address. They may contain images, videos, music files, text files, and other types of multimedia files. Users can view and navigate through a website using their web browsers. Examples include Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, BBC News, etc.

# 3.BeautifulSoup Library
The BeautifulSoup library provides functions to parse a given HTML document and extract useful information. Here are some basic concepts and operations:

1. Creating a soup object: To create a soup object, simply pass the string representation of an HTML document to the BeautifulSoup constructor function. Once created, we can apply various methods to extract information from the HTML. For example:

``` python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_doc = """<html><head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>
<body>
<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>

<p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
<a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
<a href="http://example.com/lacie" class="sister" id="link2">Lacie</a> and
<a href="http://example.com/tillie" class="sister" id="link3">Tillie</a>;
and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p>

<p class="story">...</p>
"""

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify()) # pretty-prints the HTML code
```

2. Tag selection: We can select tags based on certain criteria using the tag name, attribute values, CSS selectors, and XPath expressions. We can also iterate over the selected tags using the `find_all()` method, which returns a list of matching tags: 

``` python
# Select all anchor elements with href attributes starting with http
for link in soup.find_all('a', href=lambda href: href and href.startswith('http')):
    print(link['href'])
    
# Select all p elements with class attribute equal to title
titles = soup.select("p.title") 
print(len(titles)) # prints 1

# Iterate over all b elements inside each paragraph element
for para in soup.select("p"):
    bold_text = ""
    for bold in para.select("b"):
        bold_text += bold.get_text() + " | "
    
    if len(bold_text) > 0:
        print(bold_text[:-3])
        
# Find all <ul> elements containing <li> child nodes
uls = soup.find_all('ul')
for ul in uls:
    lis = ul.find_all('li')
    for li in lis:
        print(li.get_text())
```

3. Tag modification: We can modify tags by changing their contents, adding or removing attributes, or replacing them altogether. We can also nest tags within other tags to form larger structures. Here are some common operations:

``` python
# Replace an existing tag with another tag
tag = soup.new_tag('blockquote')
tag.string = "This text was originally italicized but now has become blockquoted!"
target_tag = soup.find(id='para1').find_parent('p')
target_tag.replace_with(tag)

# Add a new attribute to a tag
tag = soup.find('img', alt='picture of Lacie')
tag['class'] = "sisters"
print(tag)

# Remove an attribute from a tag
del tag['alt']

# Insert a tag before or after another tag
new_tag = soup.new_tag('br')
tag = soup.find('p', class_='title')
tag.insert_before(new_tag)
```

4. String manipulation: Since we're dealing with strings rather than actual DOM objects in Beautiful Soup, we can perform several string manipulations such as finding substrings, splitting strings, and performing regular expression matches. Here are some examples:

``` python
# Convert all text in a tag to uppercase
tag = soup.find('b')
upper_text = str.upper(tag.get_text())

# Split a string based on whitespace
text = "Hello   World!  How   Are    You?"
words = text.split()

# Find the first occurrence of a substring in a string
substring = "world"
index = text.lower().find(substring.lower())

# Check if a pattern exists in a string using regex
import re
pattern = r"\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}"
match = re.search(pattern, "My phone number is 123-456-7890.")
if match:
    print("Found a phone number:", match.group(0))
else:
    print("No phone number found!")
```

# 4.Requests Library
The Requests library is an easy way to send HTTP/1.1 requests easily. Using it, we can make simple GET or POST requests to any valid URL and obtain the response. Here are some basic concepts and operations:

1. Making a request: To make a request, simply call the appropriate function depending on the desired method (`requests.get` or `requests.post`). The function takes two arguments - the URL to request and optionally any parameters to pass along with the request. Here's an example:

``` python
import requests

url = 'https://www.google.com/'
response = requests.get(url)
print(response.status_code)
print(response.content)
```

2. Handling errors: If a request fails, we get an exception indicating what went wrong. We can handle these exceptions gracefully by catching them and doing something else instead of crashing our program. Here's an example:

``` python
try:
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status() # raise an error for non-successful status codes
except Exception as e:
    print("Error occurred:", e)
```

3. Authentication: Some websites require authentication to access certain resources. In this case, we would need to provide credentials in our requests. There are many ways to do this, but here's one possible approach using Basic Auth:

``` python
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

url = 'https://myprotectedsite.com/'
username ='myusername'
password ='mypassword'

auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)
response = requests.get(url, auth=auth)
```

4. Request headers: Depending on the target website, we might want to specify certain header fields in our requests. For instance, some sites may treat bots differently if they receive certain headers or cookies. Here's an example of setting custom headers:

``` python
headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

# Real World Examples
Let's take a closer look at how we can use these libraries to collect interesting data from popular websites such as Quora, Nairaland, and Reddit.
