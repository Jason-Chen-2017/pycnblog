# 1.简介
  

在这篇文章中，我们将从以下几个方面对Context-based Machine Translation with Transformers进行一个简单的介绍：

1.1 Transformer模型背景
Transformer模型由Vaswani等人在2017年提出，它基于seq2seq架构的transformer架构被广泛应用于机器翻译领域。它的优点包括编码器-解码器结构、平滑的attention机制、较强的并行计算能力、容易学习长距离依赖关系等。在此基础上，Google、Facebook、微软等科技巨头也陆续引入了Transformer到自然语言处理任务中，如Google Translate、Facebook Neural Translator、微软Onedrive云文档翻译等。

1.2 Context-based Machine Translation
Context-based Machine Translation(CBMT) 是指通过分析源文与目标文之间的上下文信息，利用其相互关联性并结合多种翻译方法来达到比传统方法更高质量的机器翻译。在2019年以前，CBMT模型主要以句法规则为依据，通过生成树的方式来整合各个词语的意义信息，通过启发式的方法来避免不必要的错误或遗漏信息，但效果一般。随着深度学习技术的发展，基于神经网络的CBMT模型获得了很大的发展，其中最重要的代表就是BERT模型。

1.3 本篇论文的研究内容和创新点
本篇论文作者们围绕着三方面展开研究：

1）CBMT模型的研究和实现。作者们首先从模型的历史角度回顾了Transformer的诞生；然后，探讨了Transformer的结构特点、各模块的工作原理和用途，并给出了一个具体的CBMT模型——BERT；最后，结合不同的数据集和翻译方向，系统地评估了BERT模型的性能。

2）基于BERT的NMT模型的研究。作者们还从模型的训练、测试、部署三个方面给出了建议，提出了新的优化策略、架构设计、数据集等，使得BERT可以直接用于NMT任务，取得了极大的成功。

3）新的翻译任务和研究方向。作者们提出了“通用翻译”（Universal Translation）这个旷日持久的研究方向，并重点介绍了在这一方向上的最新进展，同时谈及了对该研究领域的展望。

# 2. Context-based Machine Translation: A Review of the State of the Art and Future Outlook
## 2.1 Background Introduction
### 2.1.1 History of MT research in machine translation (MT): from phrase-based to neural approaches. 

In the past decade, there have been many works on MT that use phrase-based techniques such as rule-based or statistical machine translation (SMT). These methods are simple yet effective but they cannot capture complex linguistic information between words like contexts, connectives, discourse markers etc. In order to address this issue, various neural models have emerged to extract more complex features from parallel corpora using deep learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers.

However, these NMT based models still suffer from several drawbacks, including high computational complexity, low accuracy due to the lack of representational power, and the failure to model long-distance dependencies accurately. To address these issues, researchers continue to study different strategies to integrate multi-modalities into an end-to-end system called multimodal MT which combines both monolingual data and translations obtained through back-translation or other techniques. However, it is also worth mentioning that existing systems often fail to generate accurate fluent output when trained on small amounts of training data because of the mismatch between target language structure and source language style. Thus, efforts are needed to develop better and more comprehensive pre-processing and post-processing steps to handle different types of text variations in a wide range of languages.

The next generation of context-based machine translation aims at addressing these limitations by integrating both sequential and parallel corpus sources for generating a unified representation of the input sentence that can capture all relevant content regardless of its position within the original document. This representation will be then used to guide the generation process during decoding, taking into account both global and local dependencies within the sentence.

### 2.1.2 Summary of NMT architectures: Recurrent Neural Networks, CNNs and Transformers.

To solve the above mentioned challenges, various neural MT architectures have been proposed, ranging from RNN-based models to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models to Transformers.

**Recurrent Neural Network**: It is one of the most widely used type of NN architecture where each word in the input sequence is processed sequentially according to the previous states. The hidden state of the i-th word is computed based on the previous hidden state h_i−1 along with the embedding vector of the i-th word w_i. The hidden states are passed to a linear layer for predicting the corresponding output label y_i. Similarly, LSTM and GRU units are used for implementing the RNN network architecture.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** : They were originally designed for image processing tasks, but nowadays they have found their way into natural language processing tasks too. They consist of a stack of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. Each filter learns a specific feature in the input sentence, resulting in a fixed length vector. Finally, these vectors are fed to softmax function for classifying the input sequences into different categories. CNNs have proved to perform well in computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection, but their performance has not been shown comparable to other models for NLP tasks like SMT and MT.

**Transformers**. Transformers are among the fastest-growing NLP models today. They belong to the family of encoder-decoder models, where the inputs and outputs are sequences rather than individual tokens. At the heart of transformer lies a self-attention mechanism that enables the model to focus on important parts of the input sentence while encoding it. While traditional RNNs encode the entire sequence of input words before passing them to the decoder, transformers only attend to the relevant parts of the input sentence during decoding. Overall, Transformers have achieved significant improvements over vanilla RNNs, particularly in terms of speed and memory efficiency.
