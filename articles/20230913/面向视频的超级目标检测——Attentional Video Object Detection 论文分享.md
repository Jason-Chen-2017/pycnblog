## 概述

​    在实际应用中，视频中的物体检测一直是一个亟待解决的问题。近年来，随着计算机视觉技术的飞速发展，在一些行业也开始把注意力转移到视频中物体检测上。如电影制作、直播娱乐、视频监控等行业都在大力追求视频中的物体检测能力，例如自动驾驶、智慧城市、体育赛事直播等等。

​    本文将会介绍一种新的基于注意力机制的视频物体检测方法，这种方法能够处理一段视频中具有多个物体的检测任务。此外，本文还将展示一种有效地从序列特征和时空特征进行特征融合的方法，并给出相应的代码实现。在实验结果中，我们可以看到该方法能够有效提高视频物体检测的准确率和效率，同时保持了其鲁棒性。

​    Attentional video object detection (AVOD) is a new approach to perform multiple object detection in videos using an attention-based mechanism. The key idea of AVOD lies in the ability to use contextual information from neighboring frames and time steps while learning features for each individual instance. To achieve this, we first extract spatio-temporal convolutional feature maps by applying several convolutional layers with varying kernel sizes over both space and time dimensions. We then apply differentiable dynamic routing algorithms to selectively focus on informative regions in the sequence feature map based on their relative importance. Finally, we feed the selected region features into separate prediction heads that predict class probabilities and bounding boxes. The proposed method can handle videos containing complex motion patterns and objects with various scales without relying on handcrafted features or templates.

​    In addition, we propose a simple yet effective way to fuse sequence and temporal features through attention mechanisms. This fusion allows us to leverage the strengths of sequence-based methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, which are trained to detect specific visual concepts. By fusing these models' features, we enable our model to learn better representations of the scene at different spatial and temporal scales. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AVOD algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art video object detectors on a range of benchmarks and tasks, while maintaining high inference speed. Moreover, our code implementation provides a solid starting point for future research in the field of attention-based video object detection.

综上所述，基于区域的多目标检测、基于模板的多目标检测、时序检测器及深度学习方法均具有自己的局限性，如何结合这些模型以提升性能，仍然是一个关键研究方向。

## 方法概述

​    Attentional video object detection (AVOD) is a novel deep learning-based approach for performing multiple object detection in videos using an attention-based mechanism. The basic idea behind AVOD is to capture relevant contextual information while leveraging global spatial and temporal relationships between instances. Specifically, we learn local and global contextual features separately using two parallel neural networks: one to generate spatial features and another to generate temporal features. These features are fed into separate prediction heads to generate final predictions for all detected objects. 

### 网络结构
​    AVOD consists of three main components: feature extractor, diffusion network, and prediction head. We start by building a feature extractor module that takes input raw video sequences and outputs a set of sparsely sampled feature maps. Each feature map is obtained by applying several convolutional layers with varying kernel sizes over both space and time dimensions. We also include residual connections throughout the architecture to maintain robustness against gradient vanishing and exploding problems during training.  

Next, we build the diffusion network module that uses attention-based mechanisms to selectively focus on informative regions within each frame's sequence feature map. The input to the diffusion network is the output of the feature extractor module, which contains densely sampled feature maps representing every pixel and its surrounding context. A probabilistic representation of the location of interests within each feature map is learned by passing it through a series of fully connected layers followed by softmax activation functions. The softmax output represents the relative importance of each location, where larger values indicate greater importance. To capture the global contextual information across the entire sequence, we pass the softmax activations back through the same layer stack used to generate the softmax scores, allowing us to take advantage of both local and global cues to refine the selection process. Once we have generated the weighted locations, we feed them into a modified ResNet-style architecture called Dynamic Routing Network (DRN). DRN learns weights for combining the features at each location based on their relative importance. During testing time, only the most informative locations are retained and passed into the corresponding prediction heads to obtain the final detection results.
