Many popular programming languages and frameworks come prepackaged with drivers or ORM libraries that simplify interactions with the respective databases. These libraries often offer advanced features such as connection pooling, automatic failover, and transactions that make it easier to build robust applications. It's essential to leverage these tools whenever possible to minimize code complexity and improve developer productivity.

In this article, we will discuss how to use a supported driver or ORM library in your application development projects using several examples from various programming languages and frameworks. We will also explain basic concepts of database connectivity, SQL queries, data types, and database schema design. By reading this article you'll learn best practices for connecting to different types of databases and building scalable applications that are easy to maintain and scale. 

Before diving into specific implementations, let's first understand some key points about choosing a suitable database system:

1. Performance and Scalability: Choosing the right database system is critical because performance plays an important role in determining the speed at which our application can serve requests. Additionally, scaling horizontally (i.e., adding more servers) or vertically (i.e., increasing server resources like RAM or CPU) will directly impact the performance of our application. Therefore, selecting the correct database system based on our requirements is vital. 

2. Query Optimization: As we interact with the database system, we need to write efficient SQL queries that efficiently retrieve and manipulate large amounts of data. Writing complex queries with joins, subqueries, or functions can result in slow query execution times and increase the load on both the client and server components. The choice of appropriate indexes and primary keys is crucial to optimizing query performance.

3. Database Schema Design: Understanding and designing an optimal database schema is one of the most challenging tasks in any project. A good schema design should balance the needs of the business and reduce redundancy, ensure consistency, and provide efficient querying capabilities. 

Now let's dive deeper into specific implementation strategies and techniques for each type of language and framework:

1. Python + Django Framework: In Django, we can install additional packages such as `psycopg2` (a PostgreSQL driver), `mysqlclient` (a MySQL driver), etc., depending on the target database systems. To connect to a particular database, we simply define a database configuration within the settings file. Once configured, we can establish a connection to the database by calling the `django.db.connection` method. For example:

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2', # Or django.db.backends.mysql
            'NAME': '<database-name>',
            'USER': '<username>',
            'PASSWORD': '<password>',
            'HOST': '', # Set host if needed
            'PORT': '', # Set port if needed
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Once connected, we can perform CRUD operations using Django model methods such as `.objects.create()` or `.objects.filter()`. Here's an example code snippet:
    
    ```python
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        
    obj = MyModel(name='John Doe')
    obj.save() # Save object to database
    
    objects = MyModel.objects.filter(name__icontains='doe') # Filter records containing "Doe"
    print([obj.name for obj in objects])
    ```
    
2. Node.js + Express.js Framework: Similarly, in Node.js, we can install additional packages such as `pg`, `mysql`, etc., depending on the target database systems. To configure database connections, we set environment variables or pass parameters to middleware constructors. Here's an example code snippet:
    
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    const app = express();
    app.use(bodyParser.json());
    
    // Connect to Postgres DB
    const Pool = require('pg').Pool;
    const pool = new Pool({
      user: process.env.DB_USER,
      host: process.env.DB_HOST,
      database: process.env.DB_DATABASE,
      password: process.<PASSWORD>.DB_PASSWORD,
      port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT),
    });
    
    // Create endpoint for inserting data
    app.post('/insert', async function (req, res) {
      try {
        const values = [req.body.name];
        await pool.query('INSERT INTO mytable VALUES($1)', values);
        return res.status(201).send({ success: true });
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
        return res.status(500).send({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
      }
    });
    
    // Start server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server started!');
    });
    ```
    
3. Java + Spring Framework: In Spring Boot, we can add dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file according to the required database system driver package. For instance, to enable support for PostgresSQL, we include the following dependency:
    
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
        <exclusions>
          <!-- Exclude JDBC connectors -->
          <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId>
          </exclusion>
        </exclusions>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
        <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```
    
    To configure database properties, we create a `application.properties` file under `/src/main/resources/` directory and specify necessary details like username, password, URL, etc.:
    
    ```yaml
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/<dbname>
    spring.datasource.username=<username>
    spring.datasource.password=<password>
   ...
    ```
    
    Finally, we can inject JPA repositories into our services layer classes and execute standard CRUD operations through annotated methods. Here's an example code snippet:
    
    ```java
    @Repository
    public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<EmployeeEntity, Long> {}
    
    @Service
    public class EmployeeService {
        
        private final EmployeeRepository employeeRepo;

        public EmployeeService(EmployeeRepository employeeRepo) {
            this.employeeRepo = employeeRepo;
        }
        
        public Employee save(Employee employee) {
            return employeeRepo.save(new EmployeeEntity(employee));
        }
        
        public List<Employee> findAllByNameContainsIgnoreCase(String name) {
            return employeeRepo
               .findAllByNameContainingIgnoreCaseOrderByLastNameAscFirstNameDesc(name)
               .stream().map(entity -> entity.toDomain()).collect(Collectors.toList());
        }
        
        // More methods...
    }
    ```
