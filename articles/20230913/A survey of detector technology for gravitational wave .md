## Gravitational-wave astronomy
Gravitational waves (GWs) are strong, electromagnetic radiation emitted by distant objects that travel through the Universe. The largest GW events have been detected in recent years and have had significant impacts on both physics and engineering fields, including astrophysics, cosmology, medicine, spacecraft guidance, and nuclear sciences. In this paper, we will review some of the current detector technologies used to detect GWs and present an overview of their capabilities and limitations, so as to provide readers with basic information about the topic. We also highlight several emerging applications of GW detection technologies and discuss open research challenges and opportunities for future research directions in this field.
## Survey Objectives
The main objectives of our survey are:

1. Present an overview of various detector technologies currently used to detect GWs.
2. Identify the key features and advantages of each type of detector technology.
3. Discuss the relative merits of different types of detector technology based on their scientific benefits and technical feasibility.
4. Provide insights into the development of next-generation detector technology.
5. Highlight open research challenges and opportunities for future research directions in the area of GW detection technologies. 

In addition, we hope to encourage further discussion around the following topics:

1. Future progress towards larger GW event detection with higher sensitivity and lower background rates.
2. Exploiting multi-messenger signals for detection of both compact binary mergers (CBMs) and continuous black hole binaries (CBC).
3. Developing algorithms that can quickly identify multiple signals originating from the same source in real time during LIGO’s and Virgo’s first observing run.
4. Utilizing machine learning techniques to improve the speed, accuracy, and precision of GW detection and interpretation.
5. Benefits of using deep neural networks (DNNs) for gravitational-wave parameter estimation and classification tasks. 

Finally, we suggest publishing articles focusing on specific detector technologies or subfields such as signal processing, data analysis, computer vision, artificial intelligence, seismology, radio astronomy, etc., which may benefit the research community significantly. This could lead to more efficient use of resources and collaborations within the field. Moreover, it would help spread awareness of the many exciting possibilities of advanced detection technologies and contribute to enhancing reproducibility and replicability of GW results.
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
## Review of Detector Technology Types
There are three major classes of detector technology used to detect GWs:

1. Optical detectors: These include ground-based telescopes like HET (LIGO), Advanced LIGO (A+LIGO), Virgo, and KAGRA, as well as low-frequency interferometers like Einstein Telescope (ET), Dark Energy Camera (DECam), and Swift (the last interferometer for radio astronomy). They employ imaging techniques, such as millimeter-wave (mmWave) imaging or wideband imaging, which enable them to resolve transient sources up to several hundred kilometers away at low frequencies (up to few tens of Hz). However, they cannot penetrate the densest regions of the galaxy environment due to their limited resolution and limited depth of field.

2. Radio detectors: These include large antenna arrays installed on satellites and spacecraft, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) for radio continuum observations. They receive remote signals from Earth and process them to extract physical parameters, such as position, orientation, amplitude, and frequency, that can be used for GW identification and parameter estimation. Satellite-borne instrumentation, such as the NICER Telescope array, has shown promise for high cadence (~1-hour intervals) observation of flaring neutron stars. However, these systems require a relatively long duration to collect enough samples for reliable inference, making them less suitable for ultra-short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). 

3. Electromagnetically sensitive metals: These are mounted directly over the sky like the SKA system, with the goal of being able to measure electromagnetic spectra without any need for optics. One example is the Global Relay Observatory (GRO), which uses solar cells to absorb incoming EM radiation and produce a high-resolution spectrum of the entire sky with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. The advantage of GRO lies in its ability to cover all parts of the sky simultaneously, enabling the study of variations in electromagnetic properties across the Milky Way and beyond. However, its size limits the potential energy received per wavelength and requires specialized components to create individual bands of interest. Furthermore, these technologies typically suffer from thermal noise issues, beam spillage, and temperature stability problems, leading to reduced sensitivity compared to other detector technologies.

Another important aspect worth noticing is that most GW detectors are hybrid devices combining optical, radio, and electronic sensors, allowing them to achieve high sensitivity, multiplicity, and dynamic range. Some examples of hybrid detector designs include those utilizing X-rays, microwaves, and particle showers, such as SuperKASCADE, HIMAX, and BaBdipole. Other hybrid detectors, such as the KAGRA Follow-Me Shower Detection System (FMSDS), utilize miniaturized detector elements located near the target under active GW propagation. Such hybrid detectors offer the opportunity to explore new ways of exploiting GW signatures, such as using active Galactic nuclei (AGN) as probes for scintillation measurements.

Regardless of their design philosophy and performance criteria, all detector technologies must address various challenges such as cost, complexity, power consumption, and reliability, before they can become a widely used tool in GW research. With the advent of next-generation detector technologies, additional challenges arise, such as increasing spatial and temporal resolution, improving angular resolution, and reducing false alarm rates.
