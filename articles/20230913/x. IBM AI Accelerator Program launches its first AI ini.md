# 2.前言
Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the ability of machines to understand human languages naturally and communicate with humans in natural language form. This involves analyzing text data, identifying patterns, extracting valuable insights, and making meaningful decisions based on the information extracted from the text. A few common examples of NLP applications include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, text classification, etc. 

With the increasing availability of large amounts of unstructured data in various forms including social media posts, emails, customer feedback, medical records, e-commerce transactions, etc., businesses require advanced analytics tools to extract valuable insights from them. However, building complex models and training them requires significant computational power, time, and expertise. As a result, there has been a recent surge in interest in leveraging AI technology for solving real-world problems like NLP tasks. 

In order to address this need, IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator Program provides a low-code environment for developing and deploying NLP solutions on cloud platforms. This includes enabling users to import their datasets into Cloud Pak for Data and perform exploratory data analysis, pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment through a user-friendly interface. By doing so, the program aims to simplify the process of building NLP solutions and reduce the amount of coding required while ensuring high accuracy.

This article will introduce you to the basics of NLP and highlight how we have used various methods available within IBM Cloud Pak for Data to build robust NLP systems for various industry verticals. 


# 3.定义、术语及概念
Let us start by defining some important terminologies and concepts associated with NLP:

1. Text data: Refers to any type of written language which needs to be analyzed by the system. It could be sentences, paragraphs, documents, or even entire books. 

2. Corpus: Collection of texts that share similar characteristics, usually grouped together according to certain criteria. Commonly used criteria include author, date of publication, genre, theme, and location. 

3. Tokenization: Process of dividing raw text into smaller units called tokens, typically words or characters. Each token represents a specific concept or idea found in the text. For instance, “the” and “cat” would be two separate tokens while they both represent a noun phrase. 

4. Stemming: Process of reducing each word in a token to its root form, typically by chopping off prefixes and suffixes. For instance, stemming of “running”, “runner”, and “run” would all produce the base word "run". 

5. Lemmatization: Similar to stemming but differs from it in that lemmatization ensures that the correct part of speech is obtained, i.e., words like “was” and “is” get converted to “be”. 

6. Stopwords: Common words that do not carry much meaning and contribute little value to the overall meaning of the sentence. They may include articles (“the”, “a”, “an”), pronouns (“he”, “she”), conjunctions (“and”, “or”), determiners (“this”, “that”), adverbs (“not”, “only”), and others. 

7. Bag of Words Model: A model where each document is represented as a vector of word counts. Each dimension in the vector corresponds to a unique word in the corpus, and the corresponding count represents the frequency of occurrence of the word in the document. 

8. TF-IDF Vectorizer: An algorithm that converts a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features. It assigns higher weights to rare or less frequent words in the document and reduces the weightage of words that occur frequently across multiple documents. 

9. Sentiment Analysis: Classification task that determines the underlying sentiment behind a given piece of text, either positive, negative, or neutral. There are various ways to approach this problem depending on the level of granularity needed. 

10. Topic Modelling: Algorithmic technique that identifies the dominant topics present in a corpus of documents. The output is a list of keywords or categories that best explain the underlying structure of the data.

Now let’s discuss about the architecture and components involved in building NLP solutions using IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

# 5. Building Robust NLP Solutions with IBM Cloud Pak for Data
So far, we discussed about what IBM Cloud Pak for Data is, why we chose it for building robust NLP solutions, and talked about the architecture and components involved in building such solutions. Now, let’s dive deeper into details of building a robust NLP solution using Cloud Pak for Data. We will take the use case of Sentiment Analysis as an example to illustrate the steps involved in building a robust NLP solution using Cloud Pak for Data. 

Sentiment Analysis is a common NLP application where the goal is to determine whether a particular piece of text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards a particular subject matter. In this scenario, we want to classify new incoming reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, depending upon the content of the review itself.  

Here are the general steps involved in building a robust NLP solution using IBM Cloud Pak for Data:

Step 1: Import Data into Cloud Pak for Data Exchange

We begin by importing our dataset into Cloud Pak for Data Exchange. This step involves connecting to different data sources, selecting the desired file format, and specifying the target database or object storage. Once imported, we can visualize and analyze the data using the built-in graphical interface or Jupyter Notebooks.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis and Pre-Processing

Once we have imported our data, we can move on to performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into our data. Here, we can check for missing values, outliers, class imbalance, and duplicates. Based on the results of the analysis, we may decide to clean our data by removing stopwords, fixing spelling errors, or applying other pre-processing techniques. Depending on the size of our data, we might opt for sample selection instead of relying solely on exploratory analysis.

Step 3: Feature Engineering

After cleaning our data, we proceed to feature engineering. This involves converting the textual data into numerical representations that can be consumed by machine learning algorithms. One way to achieve this is by using bag-of-words approaches.

Bag-of-Words Model: A model where each document is represented as a vector of word counts. Each dimension in the vector corresponds to a unique word in the corpus, and the corresponding count represents the frequency of occurrence of the word in the document. In this approach, we ignore the order of the words and only consider their frequencies. 

TF-IDF Vectorizer: An algorithm that converts a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features. It assigns higher weights to rare or less frequent words in the document and reduces the weightage of words that occur frequently across multiple documents.

Step 4: Train Model and Deploy it

Next, we train a machine learning model on our preprocessed and featurized data. We can select a suitable algorithm based on the nature of the problem we are trying to solve. Next, we deploy the trained model into production. To do this, we export the model artifact along with any required dependencies, and then upload them to IBM Cloud Pak for Data runtime. Finally, we test the deployed model using samples of new data and refine it further if necessary.

Step 5: Monitor and Evaluate Performance

As we continue to collect and label data, we need to constantly monitor the performance of our model. This involves evaluating the accuracy of the model and identifying areas where it needs improvement. We can use metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, PR curve, and AUC-ROC to measure the effectiveness of our model. If the model is struggling with certain classes, we can try to tweak its hyperparameters or add additional features to improve its accuracy. Additionally, we can leverage other tools within Cloud Pak for Data, such as AI OpenScale, to identify potential biases and fairness concerns and take appropriate actions to mitigate them.
