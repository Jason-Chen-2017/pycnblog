Day-trading refers to the method of investing in stocks by buying and holding them at market open for a specified period of time until the next trading session, usually five or ten minutes later. Most retail investors use this strategy because they can capture quick gains without risking too much. However, with the rise of algorithmic strategies that trade continuously while making money on every tick, many traders who believe themselves to be investment experts have embraced the day-trading approach as an alternative. In fact, some even refer to their training as “day trading” or “algorithm trading.” Although this may sound like a good idea at first glance, it is important to recognize that it has its drawbacks, including high costs, slow returns, and low confidence in earnings. Therefore, becoming proficient at trading with algorithms requires more than just technical skills. It also requires understanding how to apply these algorithms effectively, manage risk, and overcome common challenges faced by day-traders. Here’s how you can become more successful day-trading using the most effective methods today.
In this article, we will explain why traditional day-trading approaches don’t work well for long-term investments, and then discuss several techniques used to beat day-trading by applying algorithms and managing risk. We will cover concepts such as stop losses, profit taking, position sizing, trailing stops, and momentum. By following our tips and suggestions, you can become a proven expert in developing your own systematic trading plans, which not only yield better results than pure speculation, but also help protect your capital from sudden falls.

To begin our discussion of smart selling, let’s start with defining some basic terms and principles. 

## Position Sizing 
Position sizing refers to the amount of shares bought or sold during any given trading session. The goal is to keep an appropriate level of leverage to ensure efficient execution of trades. The two main types of position sizing are Long/Short (L/S) and Contract Size (CS). 

Long/Short means entering into a long position if the price moves up and exiting the position when the price drops. Leverage is defined as the ratio between available assets and liabilities; therefore, a higher leverage ratio increases the size of each individual position. For example, a leveraged account with two positions would have two separate deposits while maintaining one shared balance. A hedge fund might take advantage of larger positions with lower interest rates.

Contract Size refers to the number of units that can be purchased per share. Traditionally, contract sizes were small numbers, typically no greater than 100 contracts, but as algorithmic trading becomes increasingly popular, larger contract sizes may prove more beneficial. 

Another factor to consider is market impact, which describes the degree to which orders placed on electronic exchange platforms affect order flow and fill rates. Market impact can vary depending on the type of security being traded and the trading venue. Some securities, particularly those related to commodities or crypto currencies, may experience significant price fluctuations that could result in extreme volume spikes and unrealistic bid/ask spreads. As such, it is important to understand market conditions and potential risks before committing to a position.

## Stop Losses
Stop losses are designed to prevent losses due to temporary price declines. They consist of setting a predetermined trigger point below which all existing positions should be liquidated. When the price reverses above the stop loss threshold, existing positions can either exit fully or partially, depending on the market movements. If the price reaches the original stop loss price after having been triggered, there is a chance that the trade will not close, especially if the initial move was relatively weak. 

It is essential to carefully select a suitable stop loss based on the desired trade outcome and the current market conditions. Generally speaking, the smaller the stop loss value, the more aggressive the trade, resulting in larger losses and higher volatility. Additionally, bearish divergences, consolidation periods, and strong pullbacks can cause stop losses to be triggered prematurely, leading to massive losses. Therefore, it is crucial to constantly monitor and adjust the stop loss levels to maintain optimal performance.  

## Profit Taking
Profit taking allows a trader to maximize the benefit of closing trades. Profit taking is accomplished by placing a limit order above the current best ask price, essentially offering to buy back at the cost of less than the asking price. When the market moves against the buy order, the seller agrees to pay the seller’s commission and receive the difference. If the seller accepts, the transaction closes. On average, profit taking generates slightly higher yields than waiting for the price to go down. However, there is a potential risk associated with profit taking – the possibility of losing money if the opportunity arises early enough.

As with stop losses, it is essential to carefully set profit targets according to the expected outcomes and market conditions. Similarly to stop losses, smaller values generally lead to more aggressive trades, requiring larger potential gains. To avoid the risk of losing money, it is recommended to check the market signal periodically and adjust the target accordingly. 

## Trailing Stops
Trailing stops allow a trader to track the movement of the underlying asset beyond the current market price by placing a stop loss at a percentage distance away from the current market price. Once the asset moves away from the stop loss, the existing positions can be closed. This mechanism provides an automatic way to reduce unnecessary losses by terminating positions early once the price has moved farther behind. However, the added complexity can increase risk and decrease profitability, so careful management is required. 

For instance, a trailing stop can be set at a 1% distance below the current market price. This means that the stop loss triggers automatically 1% below the current market price, triggering any existing positions immediately. However, if the underlying asset continues to move down, the stop loss will eventually trigger again, potentially causing further losses. Consequently, a tight monitoring of the trailing stop price is crucial, ensuring that it stays reasonable within acceptable limits. 

Additionally, bearish divergence periods can lead to persistent high volumes that distract from the primary trend and dampen the effectiveness of trailing stops. To mitigate this risk, longer durations for the trail can be chosen, reducing the likelihood of extended downtrends. Additionally, advanced models such as Triple Barrier Spread (TBS), which place multiple barriers throughout the day, can provide additional safety nets against highly volatile markets.

## Momentum 
Momentum is the drive behind a stock price’s recent movement, regardless of whether it is positive or negative. Traders commonly use momentum to enter long positions, anticipating price increases in advance of rising trends. However, momentum trading can also generate unpredictable outcomes, especially during bearish divergences. To mitigate these risks, traders need to strike a balance between risk tolerance and return preferences. While certain models, such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), seek to identify oversold or overbought markets, momentum can still produce unexpected gains through momentum turning signals. 

By following a systematic approach to assessing market trends and navigating potential market swings, traders can significantly improve their chances of achieving long-term success. With proper planning and monitoring, smart selling provides a powerful tool for personalized portfolio management and improved returns over the long run.
