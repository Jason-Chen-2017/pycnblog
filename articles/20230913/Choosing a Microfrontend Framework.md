Micro frontend architecture is one of the promising architectures for building large-scale web applications with modularized frontends. It provides an effective way to build maintainable and scalable web applications by breaking down the entire application into smaller independent modules that can be developed, tested, deployed independently, scaled separately, and integrated easily in any environment. However, choosing a micro frontend framework that suits your needs can be challenging since there are many options available today. In this article, I will describe some popular micro frontend frameworks along with their strengths and weaknesses, as well as share my experience on selecting the right framework based on personal preferences and requirements.

In general, micro frontend architecture involves splitting up the monolithic web app into small, independent applications (also known as microfrontends) that work together to form the complete user interface. Each micro frontend runs inside its own sandboxed iframe or web component, making it more isolated from other parts of the application. This allows developers to develop each micro frontend independently using their preferred technology stack, while still integrating them seamlessly within the main application. Here's how a simple example of a micro frontend architecture might look like:


The above figure shows a sample micro frontend architecture where three separate apps - A, B, and C - are built using different technologies such as React, Vue.js, and Angular respectively. These individual apps communicate through a shared library that defines a standard API between them. The central gateway app handles routing and navigation across all these apps and acts as a single point of integration. When the customer navigates to a certain URL, the gateway app determines which micro frontend should handle the request and delegates the rendering to it. 

As you can see, micro frontend architecture offers several benefits such as better modularity, faster development cycles, improved developer experience, and easier maintenance over time. On the other hand, choosing the right micro frontend framework for your project requires careful consideration of factors such as team size, complexity, velocity, scalability, usability, and tooling support.

# 2.Basic Concepts & Terminology
Before we proceed further, let’s clarify some basic concepts and terminology used in micro frontend architecture.

1. **Micro Frontend:** A standalone application that delivers a core feature or functionality to the user. Micro frontends follow the principle of “write once run anywhere”. They consist of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data resources and are designed to be embedded into another application’s UI or rendered dynamically using modern browser APIs. 

2. **Shared Library:** A common set of functionalities exposed by multiple micro frontends that enable them to communicate with each other and share data. Shared libraries typically define a standard contract or protocol that specifies what methods are supported and how they can be invoked.

3. **Central Gateway App:** An application responsible for orchestrating the communication between various micro frontends and handling the overall navigation and routing. Central gateways provide a unified entry point for users and delegate requests to appropriate micro frontends based on predefined rules. 

4. **Integration Mechanism:** A mechanism that enables the creation of virtual windows or frames around micro frontends, enabling them to integrate seamlessly into the rest of the parent application without actually mounting them into the DOM. Integration mechanisms may use techniques such as portals or postmessage events to inject micro frontend components into the parent application’s view hierarchy.

5. **Shell/Host App**: The top level host application that loads and renders all the micro frontend content into the same page. Shell apps also serve as containers for hosting shared dependencies, styles, scripts, and assets needed by the micro frontends. 

6. **Single Page Application(SPA):** A type of web application where the whole page is loaded at once and updated instead of reloading the entire page after every change. SPAs rely heavily on AJAX and client side rendering and are increasingly popular due to their simplicity and speed. 

7. **Componentization:** The process of breaking down complex software systems into smaller, self-contained pieces called components. Components encapsulate both logic and presentation and enable reuse across projects, teams, and organisations. There are several ways to implement componentization including monorepos, multipackage repositories, or serverless functions.  

# 3.Strengths and Weaknesses
There are several micro frontend frameworks available today, each with its own characteristics and benefits. Some of them have advantages such as better performance, reduced load times, increased flexibility, and enhanced security, while others offer additional features such as analytics monitoring, internationalization, and testing tools. Let’s now discuss some popular micro frontend frameworks and their strengths and weaknesses.

1. **Single-spa** : Single-SPA is a JavaScript framework for developing micro frontends that uses web standards and best practices. It is easy to learn and has a straightforward approach to routing, dependency management, and global state management. Its biggest advantage is its ability to handle asynchronous loading of micro frontends, thus improving the initial load time and reducing the perceived latency of the application. However, Single-SPA does not include a built-in router, so it relies on third party routers like react-router and vue-router to handle the navigation and routing. Additionally, Single-SPA only supports a subset of HTTP verbs, leaving out DELETE and PATCH operations. Another limitation is that Single-SPA lacks official documentation, community support, and examples. Overall, Single-SPA is ideal for rapid prototyping, POCs, MVPs, and experiments but may not be suitable for production-level applications due to its limitations and lack of expertise in enterprise grade environments. 

2. **Angular Elements**: Angular Elements is a new Angular feature introduced in version 8 that allows you to create custom elements that can be used throughout the Angular application, regardless of whether they were originally written in Angular or not. Custom elements created with Angular Elements can render Angular templates, interact with Angular components and services, and exchange data via properties and attributes. As with Single-SPA, Angular Elements do not come with a built-in router, so external ones need to be used. Also unlike Single-SPA, Angular Elements cannot handle async loading of micro frontends and require the use of system.js to manage module loading. Overall, Angular Elements offers high degree of control and power, but comes with a steeper learning curve compared to other frameworks and lacks built-in tooling and guidance for larger scale applications. 

3. **Stencil**: Stencil is an open source web component compiler that generates standards-compliant Web Components that run natively in all modern browsers. Stencil takes TypeScript code and compiles it into vanilla Web Components. It works with any front end framework, whether Angular, React, Vue.js, or plain JavaScript. Unlike most other frameworks, Stencil can generate lightweight components with minimal bundle sizes, allowing developers to quickly iterate on design and functionality. Stencil includes a powerful CLI that helps developers scaffold new projects, automate builds, and test components before shipping them to production. However, Stencil requires knowledge of web component standards and advanced programming concepts, making it harder for beginners to get started. Overall, Stencil is an excellent choice if your product is focused on creating fast and reliable web components for internal consumption. 

4. **Svelte Kit**: Svelte Kit is a new framework coming from Svelte team, inspired by Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Remix.js. It brings joyful experiences to building fullstack web applications and is powered by Svelte itself. With its familiar syntax and conventions, Svelte Kit makes it quick and fun to write interactive UIs without sacrificing performance or SEO optimizations. Similar to Stencil, Svelte Kit encourages developers to break down their applications into small, self-contained components and offers a very flexible architecture. However, although Svelte Kit has official support for Angular and React, it doesn't yet have dedicated guides or docs for those platforms. Overall, Svelte Kit offers a great balance between ease of use, productivity, and performance, and fits well for medium to large scale applications. 

5. **Imba**: Imba is a Ruby on Rails inspired language that transpiles to performant JavaScript. It provides a concise and elegant syntax for writing web components and empowers developers to focus on the creative aspects of application development without getting bogged down in technical details. Imba has a strong ecosystem of prebuilt web components that make it easy to create highly interactive and dynamic interfaces. However, Imba's compilation step can sometimes slow down the development process and limit cross-platform compatibility. Overall, Imba is a great option if you prefer a language that combines expressiveness with the safety and performance of traditional languages like JavaScript. 

Based on our analysis, it seems like angular elements, stencil, and svelte kit are among the top contenders when it comes to implementing micro frontend architecture in your next project. Both Angular Elements and Stencil offer similar levels of abstraction, requiring less understanding of web components than Svelte Kit and Imba. While Svelte Kit and Imba have their own unique strengths, none of them meet the bar for being widely adopted in large-scale enterprises. Overall, micro frontend architecture presents several compelling benefits, especially for large and complex applications. However, choosing the right framework for your specific needs is important, and keeping up with the latest trends and advancements is crucial to stay competitive in the industry.
