# 1.简介
  

Bitcoin is one of the most important innovations in recent years as it allows a peer-to-peer digital currency that has become highly popular due to its low cost and immutability. It was launched by Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008 with a block reward of only 50 BTC (or $50 million at the current price). Today, Bitcoin has become the backbone of several digital currencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc., making them centralized or decentralized depending on their design. This article provides insights into Bitcoin's basic concepts, core algorithms, code examples, and future prospects. The author hopes that this knowledge can be used by technical enthusiasts and professionals who want to learn more about Bitcoin technology.

## 2.1 Blockchain
Blockchain is a distributed ledger that stores transactions across multiple nodes or computers. Each node creates new blocks which are linked together to form a chain. In Bitcoin, each block contains the transaction details including sender, receiver, amount transferred, timestamp, and hash of the previous block. A unique cryptographic key pair called public/private keys is associated with each user account, which ensures that every transaction can be verified without being stored on any single server. All the information recorded on the blockchain is permanently archived and cannot be tampered with once it reaches consensus. Thus, it serves as a secure and decentralized database for verifying and tracking all transactions between different users. 

## 2.2 Transactions
A transaction is a message sent from one party to another through a network. In Bitcoin, the record of these messages is kept in blocks, where each block represents a set of transactions. When two parties want to exchange value using Bitcoin, they create a new transaction with their respective addresses as input and output. These transactions contain metadata such as the number of bitcoins sent, the date and time of creation, and the senders' signatures. Once created, the transactions are broadcasted to the network and added to the next block in the chain. Anyone can monitor the blockchain for activity related to Bitcoin and make payments instantly without having to wait for confirmation. 

## 2.3 Mining
Mining refers to the process of solving mathematical puzzles in order to obtain rewards in Bitcoin. As the name suggests, mining is essential to ensure that Bitcoin has security and reliability. Every eight hours, a miner generates a new block containing unconfirmed transactions. To do so, the miner must solve a cryptographic puzzle consisting of random numbers generated by the network. If successful, the miner gets rewarded with some newly minted bitcoin (BTC) based on the size of the block. However, if the solution takes too long or the miner does not provide valid solutions, he loses his reward. Therefore, the Bitcoin protocol uses competition among miners to determine the correct sequence of transactions and confirm transactions quickly. 

## 2.4 Wallets
Wallets are software programs used to store and manage digital assets such as Bitcoin. They allow users to create, receive, send, and track digital assets like Bitcoins. There are many types of wallets available, ranging from online web applications to desktop applications. Most wallets come equipped with features such as encryption, recovery options, and transaction history tracking. Additionally, mobile wallets offer convenient access to your funds anywhere, even without internet connection. 

## 2.5 Tokens
Tokens are digital tokens created on top of the existing cryptocurrency system. They enable various use cases, such as offering financial services or utility. Examples include ERC-20 tokens, which are fungible tokens that represent ownership over an asset; BEP-20 tokens, which are non-fungible tokens that are unique and divisible; and TST tokens, which are a type of token designed specifically for real estate. Unlike traditional currencies, tokens have no physical existence and therefore cannot be bought or sold, but they can be traded and exchanged within a marketplace.  

## 2.6 Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain. They perform certain actions automatically when triggered by events occurring on the blockchain. Examples of smart contracts include token sales, automated insurance discounts, or property registrations. These contracts are implemented using programming languages such as Solidity, Vyper, and LLL. Developers need to write the source code for the contract before creating it and then deploy it on the blockchain network. They also need to pay a fee for deploying and running the contract on the network.
