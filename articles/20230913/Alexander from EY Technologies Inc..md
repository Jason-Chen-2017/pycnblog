# 1.简介
  

早在20世纪70年代末期，IBM推出了自己的机器学习系统Watson。而后，该公司于2012年被Oracle收购，获得了AI领域的龙头地位。2019年底，EY Technologies Inc.正式成立于美国加利福尼亚州费城市。目前该公司在人工智能、云计算、区块链等领域都处于领先地位。公司自成立以来已为客户提供领先的人工智能产品和服务，在国际范围内拥有众多知名企业的合作伙伴，并已积累了一大批技术人才。作为一家优秀的AI公司，我们有理由相信，它将继续领导并引领AI技术的发展。因此，在今年的创新者大会上，我们想邀请到欧洲最大的AI公司EY Technologies Inc.的CEO、总裁Alexander来做为嘉宾，分享他对人工智能行业的看法及创业经验。
# 2.背景介绍

> AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can perform tasks such as learning and reasoning. In this sense, it is a subfield of computer science that concerns itself with building computational systems that mimic the way the human brain functions. These programs are able to learn new knowledge and make predictions based on patterns found in large data sets. 

随着科技的飞速发展，人工智能技术日渐走进生活的方方面面。智能手机、自动驾驶汽车、人脸识别、视觉识别、语言理解、强化学习、强人工智能等正在成为这个行业不可或缺的一部分。而AI的应用也越来越广泛，各种应用场景涵盖经济、金融、交通、教育、医疗等各个领域。不过，如何实现AI技术落地，尤其是在现实世界中，仍然是一个难点。

基于这条道路，一家由AI技术驱动的初创企业——EY Technologies Inc.，带着初心，决定重新定义下一代人工智能产品的形态。她一开始就看准了人工智能领域的两大痛点：第一，如何让AI技术落地实际生产环境；第二，如何让AI技术不断优化和迭代，提升模型的效果。同时，她充分利用业界资源，与业界顶级品牌结合，为客户提供符合要求的解决方案。

1. 深度学习（Deep Learning）

    > Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning in deep learning occurs via multiple layers of interconnected neurons or nodes. Each layer learns to extract patterns from its input, which is transformed through nonlinearity into output. The process continues until the desired output is achieved. This method enables computers to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler pieces and then solving each piece separately.

2. 梯度下降法（Gradient Descent）

    > Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize cost or error functions. It works by iteratively moving towards the minimum of a given function, starting from an initial guess. In each iteration, we calculate the gradient vector of the function at the current point, which points us in the direction of steepest descent. We then move in the opposite direction to reduce our loss function. By repeating these steps many times, we can find the global minimum of the function.

3. 正则化（Regularization）

    > Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. The goal of regularization is to add additional information to the model to make it more generalizable and avoid the risk of overfitting the training data. Two main types of regularization are L1 and L2 regularization, where the former encourages sparsity while the latter encourages smoothness.

4. 模型评估指标（Evaluation Metrics）

    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1 Score
    - Mean Squared Error
    - Root Mean Squared Error


# 4.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解

Alexander在发表演讲时主要围绕以下三个方面进行了深入的阐述：

1. 计算机视觉中的目标检测

    > One of the primary uses of deep learning algorithms is for image recognition and analysis. For example, object detection is the task of identifying objects and their locations within an image. To do this effectively, one approach would be to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically designed for this purpose. CNNs consist of multiple layers of filters, also known as feature detectors, that apply different transformations to the input image. The resulting features can be passed through fully connected layers to produce a prediction about what's in the image. Among other advantages, CNNs allow us to handle images of variable size without resizing, making them very scalable. However, they may not always provide accurate results when applied to real-world scenes due to the wide variety of lighting conditions and background clutter. To address this problem, Alexander discussed several techniques for improving object detection accuracy: data augmentation, anchor boxes, and focal loss.

2. 使用深度学习实现强化学习

    > Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been involved in various fields throughout history, including game playing, natural language processing, speech recognition, and decision-making. But how much does AI contribute to modern industries like finance? One possible answer lies in reinforcement learning (RL). RL is a type of machine learning where an agent interacts with an environment to learn policies that enable it to maximize rewards over time. Traditionally, AI researchers have focused on developing techniques for training agents to play games well; however, recently, there has been growing interest in applying RL to financial markets and other applications. One key challenge in using RL in financial markets is ensuring good performance during long periods of trading, particularly in environments where market dynamics change rapidly. To address this issue, Alexander demonstrated how he developed a deep learning-based RL framework called StockNAS.

3. 在区块链中实施人工智能

    > Blockchain technology offers significant benefits for businesses today, but it hasn't yet had significant impact on AI development. Even so, blockchain technologies offer exciting possibilities for enhancing AI capabilities. Many companies and startups are exploring ways to utilize blockchains to create more comprehensive AI solutions. One area where this could prove particularly valuable is in security. While traditional encryption tools help keep sensitive data safe, they don't scale well to massive amounts of data generated by AI devices. Instead, using blockchains allows AI developers to generate immutable records of transactions that cannot be tampered with, creating a verifiable record of all activity related to AI projects. Another benefit of utilizing blockchains in AI development is the potential for peer-to-peer exchange of resources, services, and expertise. Overall, Alexander described several examples of AI-powered blockchains in action, such as Cyber Security First Responder, which provides AI-powered digital forensic analysis services for law enforcement agencies.
