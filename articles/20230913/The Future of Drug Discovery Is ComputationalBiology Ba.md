# 1.简介
  

Drug discovery is a very important research field that has attracted many attention in recent years. It involves various computational and bioinformatics techniques to identify potential drug candidates, design novel drugs, test their activity and effectiveness, select the best candidate for clinical trials, optimize its dosage, and improve patient outcomes. However, today's methodologies are still limited by human ability and time, making it difficult to achieve precision medicine. In this article, we will discuss an approach to overcome these limitations using artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This approach can help reduce the time taken for drug discovery and increase the accuracy of results obtained with real-world datasets.<|im_sep|>
# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
In order to understand our topic better, let us familiarize ourselves with some basic concepts and terminology used in drug discovery:

1. Target: A protein or gene that needs treatment. For example, treatment for Alzheimer’s disease might involve targeting proteins associated with LHPE (leukocytes). 

2. Drug: A chemical compound that is designed to target one or more targets. Examples include Gabapentin, Lipitor, and Cyclosporine. 

3. Pharmacodynamic: This refers to the therapeutic properties of a drug, such as its clearance rate and solubility. 

4. Pharmacokinetic: This refers to how a drug enters the body and how it travels through the body to reach its intended site of action. 

5. Assay: An instrument used to measure pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of a drug. Examples include enzyme assays, cell culture assays, and western blotting. 

Besides these core terms, there are other important topics related to drug discovery that we need to know before proceeding further:

1. Data: There are different types of data available from the scientific community to support drug discovery. Some common ones are genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and imaging data. These data sets have different formats, characteristics, and resolution levels. 

2. Biological Knowledge Base: Scientists work hard to collect and organize all known information about biological processes, molecules, cells, and diseases into a knowledge base called the Biological Database. This database enables scientists to search for similar structures, interactions, functions, and mechanisms between different molecular entities and diseases. 

3. Virtual Screening: Virtual screening is a powerful tool for identifying new drug candidates by assessing the structure, interaction, function, and/or mechanism of a small set of promising molecules against large databases of existing drugs. 

4. Surrogate Variable Analysis: Surrogate variable analysis (SVA) is another technique used to identify new drug candidates that may act like known drugs but show significant differences in their physicochemical properties. SVA involves creating virtual counterparts of existing drugs using virtual analogues or substitutes that behave similarly to them but exhibit unique pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. 

5. Physical Free Energy Method: Physical free energy methods use quantum mechanical concepts to predict the behavior of complex systems by calculating forces and torques acting on individual atoms and molecules. The physical free energy method uses specific thermophysical quantities like heat capacity, viscosity, surface tension, and dielectric constant of each molecule and calculates the binding affinity of the ligand to each receptor to predict the change in binding energy when the ligand binds to the receptor. 

6. Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI refers to machines that mimic human cognitive abilities. AI technologies have been applied in various fields including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation.
