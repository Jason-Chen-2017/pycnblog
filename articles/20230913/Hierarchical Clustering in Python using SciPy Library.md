Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for cluster analysis of data points in high-dimensional space. It involves partitioning the dataset into a set of clusters that share similar characteristics. This article will cover hierarchical clustering with Python and scipy library.

In this tutorial we'll go through an implementation of agglomerative or divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm which can be applied to different datasets. We'll use k-means as one of the initial centroid selection methods alongside with single linkage and complete linkage criteria. The code snippets are written in python programming language and required libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, etc. 

This article assumes readers have some knowledge about machine learning concepts such as supervised/unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms, distance metrics, etc., and basic understanding of python programming language. If you're not familiar with these topics, it's recommended to read related articles first before proceeding further.

Before starting our work let me give you a brief overview of hierarchical clustering:

1. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering - In agglomerative hierarchical clustering, each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged together recursively until all observations belong to just one large cluster. There are two types of merges:

   * Single Linkage - When two clusters are merged, the pair of clusters with the smallest distance between their most distant members (single linkage) are combined to form a new cluster.
   * Complete Linkage - When two clusters are merged, the pair of clusters with the largest distance between any two of their members (complete linkage) are combined to form a new cluster.
   
2. Divisive Hierarchical Clustering - In divisive hierarchical clustering, each observation starts in its own cluster, and iteratively splits the clusters by finding the best split at each step. There are several ways to find the optimal split including variance minimization, Gini index minimization, maximum increase criterion, and minimum impurity decrease. Once the final cluster tree has been constructed, we can apply cutting techniques to extract clusters from the tree. 

3. Dendrograms - Dendrograms represent a tree-like structure showing the relationships between clusters and the distances between them. They provide insights on how the clusters were formed, revealing the order and size of clusters, and indicating regions where there may be overclustering or underclustering.

## 2.1 Data points
A collection of features or attributes describing a particular object or entity. Each data point belongs to a certain class label or category. For example, given a list of customers and their demographics, data points could be the age, income, education level, occupation type, marital status, gender, and so on, while the corresponding categories would be customer profiles based on those attributes.

## 2.2 Distance metric 
A mathematical function that measures the similarity between two objects based on their feature values or dimensions. Common examples include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, Cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and other numerical measures. 

## 2.3 Clusters
Groups of data points whose properties differ significantly from one another. These groups can arise naturally in real-world scenarios, e.g., when grouping people by their shared interests, when segments of the population exhibit different health conditions, or when analyzing document collections to discover hidden patterns. 

Clusters can also be defined by human input, either explicitly as pre-defined labels or implicitly as subsets generated by an unsupervised learning algorithm. 

## 2.4 Centroids
The center point or representative element of a group of points within a cluster. In hierarchical clustering, a cluster can have multiple levels or nodes, and each node represents a cluster with a smaller number of members than the parent cluster. Thus, instead of representing each cluster separately as we do in flat clustering, we need to maintain information about both the cluster membership and hierarchy of individual clusters. Hence, centroids play an important role in maintaining the hierarchy of clusters throughout the process of hierarchical clustering.

Centroids can be determined by various methods such as mean-based approaches, median-based approaches, density-based approaches, or user-specified strategies. Some common methods include K-Means++, Farthest Seed Selection (FSS), Spherical k-Means, and Rousseeuw et al.'s 'DUNN' approach.

## 2.5 Root node
The topmost node of a dendrogram, representing the entire dataset. Each leaf node corresponds to a cluster created by the hierarchical clustering procedure.

## 2.6 Leaf nodes
Nodes that contain only one data point and no child nodes, usually because they cannot be divided further without violating the minimum cluster size requirement.

## 2.7 Parent node
A node below a given level or depth in a dendrogram, containing one or more child nodes.

## 2.8 Child nodes
Nodes above a given level or depth in a dendrogram, contained within their respective parent node(s).

## 2.9 Branch length / Height
The vertical distance between a cluster's root and its furthest descendant leaf node, or the height of a branch if represented as a straight line.

## 2.10 Distance matrix
A square matrix that stores the distances between every pair of data points in the dataset.

## 2.11 Similarity matrix
A symmetric binary matrix that indicates whether two clusters are similar enough to combine them into a larger cluster during agglomerative hierarchical clustering. This matrix needs to be derived from the original distance matrix according to a threshold value. For instance, if the distance between two data points exceeds a predefined threshold then they should be marked as dissimilar; otherwise, they are deemed similar and hence should be marked as similar in the similarity matrix.

## 2.12 Minimum cluster size
The minimum number of data points that can exist in a cluster before it is considered a singleton cluster and ignored during hierarchical clustering procedures.
