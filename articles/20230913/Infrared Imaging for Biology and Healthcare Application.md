# 1.简介
  

Infrared (IR) imaging is becoming more popular in biomedical imaging since the advent of fluorescent light-based microscopy and other advanced scanning technologies that are sensitive to IR radiation. In this article we will cover basic concepts and terminology related to infrared imaging applications in medicine, with a focus on application areas in neuroscience and cardiology. We will then describe core algorithms involved in various imaging techniques including LASER (light-activated silicon), PMT (photo diode array tube), XRD (X-ray diffraction), Raman spectroscopy, etc., and show how they can be used effectively in different medical imaging tasks such as imaging neuronal activity, identifying diseased organs, and monitoring vital signs. Finally, we will discuss potential future developments in this area and highlight challenges associated with these advancements.

This article assumes readers have prior knowledge about infrared imaging principles, techniques, and devices, as well as some understanding of biochemistry, pathophysiology, and anatomy relevant to the topics discussed here. It also provides brief descriptions of key computer science concepts and programming languages involved in developing image processing software.

This article is intended as a collaborative effort between researchers from various disciplines to provide a comprehensive guide on infrared imaging for biology and healthcare applications. The goal is to foster discussion among experts across multiple fields and contribute towards establishing standardization in this field by promoting interoperability and making scientific progress through open access publishing. Therefore, feedback from interested parties is highly encouraged and will be taken into consideration while writing this article.

## 2.1 什么是 3D 打印？
三维打印（3D printing）是利用无源、有机化学反应或者其他的方法在真空或液态状态下制备形状各异、大小适中的物体。主要应用于工程建筑领域，如制造产品零件、打印设备、实验室仪器等。3D 打印技术能够快速、精确地制造复杂物体，且无需繁复的外购件，通过快速复制与构建具有独特性质的模型，解决了在工程领域中缺乏高效、低成本且易维护的材料问题。3D 打印技术主要包括金属加工（例如塑性加工和挤压）、复合材料加工、塑性制品、结构加工等。

## 2.2 什么是 X-光透射扫描（XRT）？
 X-光透射扫描（X-Ray Tomography, XRT），又称为计算机二维(2D)衍射(CT)成像，是利用X光线探测器对对象进行的计算机三维重建技术。其基本原理是通过特定组织的组织细胞或其它细胞特征(例如DNA)来生成一个二维平面上的多层图像，通过改变组织内的生理状态(如器官扩张/收缩)，调整不同的参数，从而获取不同组织在不同位置的形态分布图。它具有超快速度、准确度高、成像精度高、高分辨率等优点，同时也存在着高耗能、不稳定、样本与传感器交互不良、产生偏差等缺陷。
 
 ## 2.3 什么是光电子显微镜（LED Microscopy）？
 光电子显微镜是利用利用闪光产生的电子束及其所引起的电场变化来制作镜头的一种成像设备。其原理是用激光照射在样品上，通过在不同波长的电子束混合作用和变化的相干效应使得不同厚度的电子元件之间的相互作用，产生光子。通过这些光子的散射记录到照相摄影片中，就可得到图像。这种成像技术受显微镜的热熔耦合成像效应的影响，将样品表面某种类型的电极吸附在其表面，然后释放出一束由多种不同波长的电子束组成的闪光，使得这些电子束被凝聚在一起，形成强大的电场，从而形成一幅图像。

 ## 2.4 什么是超声波断层扫描(HS-DLP)?  
 水下超声波断层扫描 (Hyperspectral Differential Light Absorption Profiler, HS-DLP) 是由宇航员用于检测水下目标的视觉系统。它是基于无线电和红外等传感器，将海拔高度在几百米至几千米的水下目标通过无线电信号捕捉到并存储，并且通过超声波断层扫描来识别其内部的空间分布。它的特点就是通过收集不同频率、不同波长的红外光谱信息，与远处天空的大气光谱结合起来，实时获取海洋环境信息。该技术已广泛应用于近海、远海和海上环境探测、气象监测、军事卫星遥感探测等领域。

# 3. Infrared Imaging for Medical Applications
Infrared (IR) imaging has been gaining significant attention recently due to its ability to reveal detailed information about living organisms and their internal structures in real time. However, it is still mostly studied in academia and most of the research efforts are focused on exploring its possibilities in medical imaging, particularly in visualizing nervous system function and identifying diseased regions. Here, we will provide an overview of various aspects of infrared imaging in biomedical applications and explore its role in the following three main categories:

* Neuroimaging: This includes studies on using infrared imaging to visualize neural activities in the brain, especially in localized regions, thereby enabling insights into both central and peripheral processes. Furthermore, it can help diagnose diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and epilepsy. 
* Cardiac Imaging: In recent years, development of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has enabled researchers to obtain high-resolution images of cardiac motion, blood flow, and myocardium structure. These findings have paved the way for new treatments, including targeted therapies for heart failure and arrhythmias. In addition, CMR offers the opportunity to directly image the underlying anatomical structures of the heart. 
* Vascular and Endocrine System Imaging: Vascular imaging involves studying the structure and function of the body's arterial and venous systems. Endocrine imaging involves observing changes in hormone levels and secretion in cells throughout the body. Both of these approaches rely heavily on infrared imaging technology.  

We will first introduce the basics of infrared imaging and review various imaging modalities available today, ranging from visible light to near-infrared spectrum. Then, we will go over each category mentioned above in detail and explain how infrared imaging can be used to address specific medical problems. Specifically, we will look at neuroimaging methods and apply them to assess functional connectivity patterns of cortical layers and regions of interest within the human brain. We will also demonstrate how neuroimaging can identify several types of diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and epilepsy based on differences in functional connectivity pattern between patients and controls. Next, we will move on to cardiac imaging to illustrate how infrared imaging can help us detect abnormalities in cardiac function and assist in treating heart failures. Lastly, we will use vascular and endocrine imaging to study the structure and function of the arterial and venous systems, respectively. By addressing these issues individually, infrared imaging can offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for many diseases, improve clinical decision making, and lead to better patient outcomes.
