# 1.简介
  

Nearest Neighbors (NN) is one of the most fundamental algorithms used for data mining and machine learning tasks. It can be thought as a type of clustering algorithm where we try to group similar objects together based on similarity measures between them. In this article, I will talk about what NN is, its basic concepts and terms, core algorithms, how they work internally, use cases, applications, and potential challenges in future research directions. At the end, there are also some tips and tricks that might help you improve your understanding of these important algorithms.

## What is Nearest Neighbor?
Nearest Neighbor(NN) is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts or classifies an unknown instance by finding the closest training example in feature space. The nearest neighbor model assumes that instances with similar features belong to the same category or class, so it learns to classify new instances using the knowledge gained from the training set.

For instance, let's say we have a dataset consisting of house prices along with their respective features such as number of rooms, area, location etc. We can train a Nearest Neighbors model on this dataset by first computing the Euclidean distance between all pairs of examples in the dataset. Then, for any new input example, we can find the k-nearest neighbors in feature space and assign the label of the majority vote amongst those k neighbors to the input example.

Similarly, if we have a text classification task and want to identify the sentiment of a sentence, we can use Nearest Neighbors to learn patterns in the labeled sentences and apply the learned rules to unseen test examples. If two sentences share similar words, then they may belong to the same topic/sentiment category. 

In summary, Nearest Neighbors is a powerful tool that allows us to perform both classification and regression tasks without much effort. But before going deeper into details, let's understand the key components involved in building a Nearest Neighbors Model:

1. Feature Space: This refers to the space where our data points live, which means the dimensionality of our problem at hand. For instance, in a text classification task, the feature space would represent the bag-of-words representation of each sentence.

2. Distance Metric: A metric that quantifies the “distance” between two data points. Common metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance and cosine similarity. 

3. K-Value: This parameter determines the number of neighbors that should be considered when making predictions. In other words, k is the hyperparameter that controls the complexity of the model. When dealing with small datasets, choosing k=1 is usually sufficient; however, increasing k leads to more accurate predictions but also increases computation time.

4. Training Set: This consists of a subset of the full dataset that the model uses to learn the underlying pattern. The remaining part of the dataset is called the testing set and is used to evaluate the performance of the model once trained.

5. Query Point: This is the new observation or test point that needs to be classified or predicted. Its corresponding label is not known since we only know its feature vector.

Now, let's move further and discuss different types of Nearest Neighbors models.

## Types of Nearest Neighbors Models
### Classification - Supervised Learning Algorithm
Classification refers to assigning labels to new data points based on previously seen examples. Nearest Neighbors algorithm is commonly used for classification problems, especially when the number of classes is large or the amount of data is limited.

Here’s a general process of the Nearest Neighbors Classifier:

1. Compute distances between query point and all training samples in the feature space.

2. Select the top-k neighbors based on their distance values.

3. Assign the label of the majority of the selected neighbors as the prediction for the query point.

This approach works well because similar instances tend to occur near each other, hence the neighboring training samples have similar features. Moreover, the majority voting strategy takes care of the ties between multiple neighbors.

The following figure illustrates the working principles of the Nearest Neighbors classifier:


Example: Let’s consider a binary classification problem where we need to determine whether an email is spam or not. Here, we assume that the dataset contains many emails already labeled as either SPAM or HAM (not spam). Our goal is to build a classifier that can accurately predict the labels of new emails. Based on this assumption, here are the steps we can follow:

1. Collect a dataset of labeled emails containing both SPAM and HAM categories. Each email contains a feature vector representing the content, sender, date, and other relevant information.
2. Split the dataset into a training set (70% of the total dataset) and a testing set (30% of the total dataset).
3. Train a Nearest Neighbors classifier using the training set. During this step, we compute the distances between the features vectors of each pair of emails in the training set. 
4. Test the accuracy of the classifier using the testing set. To do this, we compute the distances between the features vectors of each pair of emails in the testing set, select the top-k neighbors, and assign the label of the majority of the selected neighbors to the query point. Finally, calculate the accuracy of the classifier based on the number of correct predictions out of the total queries.

### Regression - Unsupervised Learning Algorithm
Regression refers to predicting numerical values given a set of inputs. Nearest Neighbors algorithm can also be used for regression problems. 

The principle behind Nearest Neighbors regression is very similar to the classification case. However, instead of selecting the label of the majority of the neighbors, we take the average value of their targets. Hence, we predict the target value associated with the query point as the weighted average of the k-neighbors' targets, where the weights are determined by their distance.

The following image shows the working principles of the Nearest Neighbors regressor:


Example: Suppose we have a dataset containing the price history of stocks over a period of time. We want to forecast the closing price of a stock at a certain time horizon. One way to do this is to use the historical close prices of previous days as features and the expected trend of the stock movement as the target variable. 

1. Collect a dataset of historical stock prices containing the target variables (close prices) and the historical feature variables (open, high, low, volume, etc.).
2. Split the dataset into a training set (70% of the total dataset) and a testing set (30% of the total dataset).
3. Train a Nearest Neighbors regressor using the training set. During this step, we compute the distances between the feature vectors of each pair of stock prices in the training set. 
4. Test the accuracy of the regressor using the testing set. To do this, we compute the distances between the feature vectors of each pair of stock prices in the testing set, select the top-k neighbors, and predict the mean value of the targets of the selected neighbors. Finally, compare the actual target values with the predicted ones and measure the error rate of the regressor.
