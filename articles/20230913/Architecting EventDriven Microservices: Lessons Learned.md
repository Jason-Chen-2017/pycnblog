In this blog post we will explore the event-driven architecture and microservices concepts in detail, including their advantages over monolithic architectures and how to apply them for building a distributed order processing system using Apache Kafka and its streaming library, Kafka Streams. 

We will also discuss some of the challenges that may arise when applying these principles, as well as provide insights into how best to structure our code and infrastructure to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability throughout the development process. Finally, we will provide practical examples demonstrating how to build a fully functional end-to-end application based on event sourcing and CQRS patterns. We hope you find this article helpful in guiding your next step in designing complex, scalable enterprise systems based on event-driven microservices!


Before we begin, let's clarify what "microservices" and "event-driven architecture" are. 

Microservices is a software architecture pattern that structures an application as a collection of small services or modules, each running independently but collaborating together to deliver business value. Each service runs on its own process and communicates through a lightweight messaging protocol such as HTTP. The key advantage of this architectural style lies in its modularity and ability to scale up or down individual components without affecting others. Additionally, it enables developers to focus on implementing domain-specific functionality rather than worry about technical details like data storage, messaging protocols, or communication libraries. 

Event-driven architecture is another popular architectural pattern that allows applications to respond to events that occur asynchronously outside of traditional request-response cycles. In other words, instead of waiting for requests to be made and then responded to immediately, applications can subscribe to specific types of events and trigger actions whenever those events occur. This approach makes it easier to react to changes in state or trigger updates to user interfaces, which results in better performance and increased responsiveness. However, there are several drawbacks to this type of architecture, including complexity and operational overhead due to the need to manage large numbers of loosely coupled microservices.

So why do we use microservices and event-driven architecture for building enterprise systems? Here are a few reasons:

1. Scalability: As mentioned earlier, microservices enable us to easily scale individual components without affecting others, making it easy to handle increasing demand for resources or improving response times under varying loads.
2. Reusability: By breaking our application into smaller, more modular components, we increase the potential for reuse across multiple projects and organizations. This helps avoid duplication of effort, reduces errors, and saves time spent debugging.
3. Flexibility: Microservices make it easier to adjust processes and procedures quickly to meet changing requirements or customer feedback. This provides greater flexibility and ensures that new features can be added or removed seamlessly without disrupting existing functionality.
4. Resilience: Microservices offer higher levels of resiliency compared to monolithic applications because they are designed to operate independently and communicate through messaging protocols. If one component fails, it does not bring down the entire application.

# 2. Background
Before diving into the core concepts and technologies involved in building event-driven microservices, let’s first understand the context and problem statement of our scenario. Suppose we want to develop an e-commerce platform that handles both order creation and fulfillment in real-time. Our goal is to create an efficient and reliable system that meets high availability standards while minimizing latency and maximizing throughput. To achieve this, we will follow these steps:

1. Choose a message broker technology: We will choose Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, as our primary choice for handling messages between different microservices.
2. Implement event sourcing and CQRS: To ensure consistency and reliability at every stage of the order processing pipeline, we will implement event sourcing and command query responsibility separation (CQRS) patterns. 
3. Build the microservices: We will divide our application into two separate microservices - one for handling orders and the other for managing shipping logistics. These microservices will interact with the Kafka cluster via RESTful APIs and publish events to various topics in Kafka when certain operations take place.
4. Use Kafka Streams for stream processing: We will use the Kafka Streams library for stream processing of incoming events from the Kafka cluster. With this tool, we can transform, filter, aggregate, or join streams of events before outputting the result to downstream services.
5. Test, deploy, and monitor: Once the microservices have been tested and validated, we will deploy them to production servers and monitor them closely to identify any issues or bottlenecks.

To summarize, we plan to break down the order processing pipeline into two microservices - one responsible for handling orders and the other for managing shipping logistics - and employ event sourcing and CQRS patterns for ensuring consistent and reliable operation at every stage of the pipeline. We will use Kafka Streams for stream processing of events within each microservice and implement additional monitoring tools to detect any issues or bottlenecks. Overall, we aim to create an efficient and reliable solution that meets high availability standards while maximizing throughput and meeting strict latency requirements.
