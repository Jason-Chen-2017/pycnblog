# 1.简介
  

Kubernetes (K8s) is a cloud-native container orchestration platform that provides several services such as cluster management, scheduling, and service discovery. In this blog post, we will be deploying a sample Python Flask application to K8s using Minikube, which is a local single node K8s installation with no additional dependencies required. We will also cover how to connect the application to an external database and add monitoring features.
# 2.前置条件
Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

2. pipenv - Install Pipenv by running `pip install --user pipenv`.
3. kubectl - Install kubectl by running `curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl` and then moving the binary to your $PATH (`sudo mv./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl`). Make sure you have version 1.15 or greater.
4. Minikube - Follow the instructions on their website for installing Minikube. I recommend using the latest release of minikube.
# 3.项目结构
The project structure should look something like this:
```
project_name
    ├── app              # The flask application code
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── deployment       # Directory containing kubernetes manifest files
    │   ├── configmap.yaml
    │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   ├── ingress.yaml
    │   └── service.yaml
    └── Dockerfile       # Dockerfile to build the docker image
```
Here's what each file in the directories do:
* `app/__init__.py`: This contains the Flask application itself. It defines routes, handlers for HTTP requests, and connects to databases etc. If there are any libraries used by the application (e.g., SQLAlchemy), they need to be imported here as well.
* `deployment/configmap.yaml`: A ConfigMap object stores configuration data separate from containers. Here, we define environment variables that our application requires. For example, if we want to use MySQL instead of SQLite, we would set the appropriate connection parameters here.
* `deployment/deployment.yaml`: A Deployment specifies the desired number of replicas of a particular pod that should run at any given time. This allows us to scale the application horizontally as needed without having to manually manage pods.
* `deployment/ingress.yaml`: An Ingress defines rules that allow incoming traffic to reach the Service (i.e., the Flask application). Here, we map the Service port to a URL path so that users can access the application through a domain name.
* `deployment/service.yaml`: A Service describes a set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Here, we define the ports exposed by the application (default is 5000) and specify that it should load balance between multiple pods behind the scenes.
* `Dockerfile`: Defines the steps to build the Docker image that will be deployed to K8s. It installs all necessary packages, copies over the application code, sets up the environment variables specified in the ConfigMap, and exposes the correct port.
# 4.准备工作
First, let's create a new directory called "flask-app" where we'll start working on the project:
```
mkdir flask-app && cd flask-app
```
Next, initialize the virtual environment and install necessary packages:
```
pipenv install flask gunicorn pymysql sqlalchemy
```
Now, create the main Flask application file called `__init__.py`. We won't go into too much detail about this since it's beyond the scope of this article but feel free to check out other resources online.

Create a `Dockerfile` inside the root folder of the project with the following content:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.7
WORKDIR /app
COPY. /app
RUN pip install pipenv \
  && pipenv install --system \
  && rm -rf ~/.cache/pip
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind=0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```
This Dockerfile uses the official Python image (version 3.7) as its base, sets the working directory to `/app`, copies over the entire project directory, installs necessary packages via pipenv, removes cached packages to reduce image size, and runs Gunicorn with the Flask application loaded. Note that we're exposing port 5000 outside the container so that it can receive incoming traffic. 

Now let's move onto creating some YAML manifest files to deploy the application to K8s. Create three empty files inside the `deployment` directory - one for each resource type: deployment, service, and ingress. These files will serve as blueprints for K8s objects that represent these resources. Together, they form a complete specification of the application's behavior within the cluster.
