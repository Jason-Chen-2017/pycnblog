## What is a molecule? And what are the building blocks of a compound?
A **molecule** is an indivisible unit that has three essential components: 
- A *hydrogen* atom or atoms;
- An *oxygen* atom or atoms (H<sub>2</sub>O);
- A single bond.

In other words, it's a substance composed primarily of one type of atom surrounded by two types of electrons arranged in a certain pattern called a molecular orbital. In chemistry, we call this a "simple" molecule since it doesn't have any complicated structure beyond these three basic components. However, many more complex molecules exist, including those made up of different combinations of atoms and their structures. These molecules can be classified into several groups based on how they behave under different physical conditions, such as temperature, pressure, moisture, etc. 

The building block of a compound is typically a chemical element or group consisting of multiple atoms joined together through covalent bonds. The building blocks can also include small organic molecules like carbohydrates and lipids or even larger macroorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. Building blocks represent the smallest possible units of a molecule and combine to form larger molecules with various properties, which make them useful for creating new materials and substances. 


## What are bonds in chemistry? How do they interact and why does bond breaking occur?
Bonding occurs when two atoms in a molecule come together, forming a strong electrostatic attraction between them known as an **ionic interaction**. Ionic interactions cause changes in the relative orientation of the two atoms' electron clouds, allowing them to align and form additional bonds. This process is known as hydrogen bonding.

Another way to form bonds is through the sharing of common electron shells or alkali metals, both of which share electrons in similar ways but differ in their atomic number or binding energies. Metals tend to bind to smaller elements whereas nonmetals attach to larger ones. By combining these two types of bonds, molecules can form higher-order structures known as polymers and microstructures known as nanoparticles.

One important property of bonds is that they can be broken. When an atom loses enough charge to its valence electron count, it breaks all the bonds attached to it. The result is that the bond disappears completely from the molecular structure leaving only the individual atoms behind. Bonds break because there are fewer available electron pairs than needed to carry out the ionic interactions responsible for maintaining their existence. As a consequence, bonds often become shorter, weaker, and less stable over time, leading to changes in the overall shape, size, and material properties of molecules.


## Why are protons, neutrons, and electrons important in chemistry? How can you identify these particles accurately using spectroscopy?
Protons and neutrons make up about half of the nucleus of every atom. They are positively charged while electrons are negatively charged. There are three main types of atomic particles:

1. Proton: A proton is an electrically neutral particle. It is formed when a quark becomes unbound during the fusion of two quarks. 

2. Neutron: A neutron is a weakly charged particle that makes up most of the rest of the nucleus of an atom. It forms when a neutron from one nucleus decays into a pair of quarks, which then fuse to form a proton. During this reaction, some energy is lost, resulting in a net positive charge.

3. Electron: An electron is a light particle that cannot interact directly with other atoms. Instead, it interacts indirectly via interaction forces with atomic nuclei. Each electron in an atom has an associated electronegativity value, which indicates its tendency to attract or repel other electrons. Therefore, different kinds of electrons appear in different chemical environments, such as positively or negatively charged surfaces or crystal lattices.

To identify these particles accurately, scientists use spectroscopy, which involves analyzing the emission of radiation caused by particles moving across spectra generated by highly sensitive detectors placed near or in front of the target sample. Spectroscopists determine whether each peak corresponds to either a proton or a neutron by observing how much energy it causes to move downwards versus the background radiation. Proton peaks are shifted slightly lower in energy compared to neutron peaks due to the presence of other massive competing ions. Once identified, the corresponding masses and charges can be determined and used for further analysis.
