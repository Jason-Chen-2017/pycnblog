Nanoengineering is a term that refers to the study of micro and nanostructures at an atomic scale using molecular techniques. These technologies are often applied in areas such as polymer processing, biology, electronics, mechanical engineering and material science. In this article we will focus on DNA nanotechnology, which has emerged as one of the most promising applications for nanoengineering techniques. However, despite its potential, there are several challenges associated with making it work effectively within realistic constraints imposed by synthetic biology, medical devices and personalized medicine. The first step towards achieving true nanoengineering requires rethinking basic principles behind structural design, particularly how molecules assemble into complex structures. This requires new computational methods that can simulate not just individual atoms or molecules but entire systems composed of millions of components. 

In order to make these simulations more practical, we need to develop efficient algorithms that can find solutions to large problems in hours or even days. One approach is to use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to search for optimal patterns and configurations. Another approach is to take advantage of parallel processing capabilities of modern computers to distribute computationally intensive tasks across multiple processors simultaneously. Yet another method involves incorporating novel metamaterials based on DNA replication that enable continuous deformation without disrupting the original structure. Together, all these approaches aim to solve important scientific challenges such as scalable design automation, precise and accurate manufacturing, robust and flexible self-assembly and regeneration mechanisms, and long-term maintenance of engineered systems. Overall, the goal of nanoengineering lies in leveraging the power of materials and biological processes to create products of unprecedented size, complexity and functionality, while also supporting industrial and consumer needs through advanced management strategies.

## （一）背景介绍 ##




DNA nanotechnology provides a unique opportunity for developing and operating machines of enormous scale, capable of manipulating and modifying biological and chemical entities at the level of single nucleotide resolution. DNA is a highly ordered chemical entity consisting of four nucleotides (bases). Each base can either be purine (adenine or thymine), pyrimidine (guanine or cytosine), or a sugar (uracil or thyminyl). The length of DNA is typically around 3 billion base pairs (bp), although some species have longer or shorter lengths. A typical human chromosome consists of approximately 3.2 million bp of DNA. Thus, synthesizing and maintaining hundreds of billions of copies of DNA every day would pose significant technological, economic, and environmental challenges. Therefore, addressing these challenges requires an interdisciplinary approach that integrates physical sciences, computer science, mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering. 

This article focuses on the development of self-assembling biomolecules, which represent an essential component for many fields such as biochemistry, cell biology, materials science, and mechanics. Self-assembly plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including protein folding, DNA repair, gene regulation, and metabolic pathways. For example, the stochastic block model [Ref] describes the process of determining the configuration of proteins after their association during a denaturation reaction. It predicts that, under certain conditions, protein conformations may converge towards a well-defined global minimum rather than oscillate between different local minima. Although classic models of self-assembly were developed over centuries ago, they still rely heavily on empirical rules and heuristics that do not always capture the complex interactions involved in natural macromolecules like DNA and RNA.

One possible way to address these limitations is to use AI-based optimization algorithms that can search for optimal structures and configurations for complex biological systems composed of millions of components. By combining these techniques with state-of-the-art computer architectures and parallel processing resources, researchers have been able to rapidly explore new design spaces and produce high-quality results [Ref]. Nevertheless, existing self-assembly software packages typically lack powerful machine learning tools for generating optimized structures and cannot handle large-scale realistic systems. Moreover, due to the irreversibility of DNA double strand breaks, current DNA design algorithms cannot directly modify the sequence of target regions within living cells. 

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach called DNA design automation that combines several key ideas from nanoengineering and computational biology. First, we present a mathematical framework that captures the underlying principles of self-assembly and harnesses machine learning techniques to generate optimal structures for diverse types of biological systems. Second, we propose a DNA design algorithm that generates sequences and designs that minimize both functional and thermodynamic objectives, taking into account relevant features such as chemical properties, spatial arrangement, flexibility, and elasticity. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by applying it to automate design of DNA sequences and assemblies of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids in vivo. We show that our approach can achieve near-optimal structures within minutes and exhibit significant improvements over conventional design methods. Our findings suggest that DNA design automation opens up exciting new possibilities for solving challenging technical problems in DNA nanotechnology and can transform many aspects of life and healthcare. 



## （二）核心概念及术语说明 ##



### （2.1）设计自动化（Design Automation） ###

Design automation is a technology that simplifies and accelerates the design process by reducing the time required for creating complex objects, replacing humans in the loop, and automating repetitive tasks. In general, design automation applies automated techniques to reduce errors, improve quality, and increase efficiency. Many companies and organizations worldwide leverage design automation to improve their product development cycles, lower costs, optimize processes, and enhance customer satisfaction. Examples include precision machining, 3D printing, additive manufacturing, laser cutting, and computer graphics.

Design automation is distinct from traditional industrial robotic manipulation because it relies on digital computation instead of physical forces and actuators. Today's machines are powered by fast CPUs and GPUs, enabling them to perform massive calculations quickly and accurately. Similarly, cloud-based services allow design teams to access vast amounts of data and compute power without having to invest in dedicated infrastructure.

A central challenge in design automation is developing algorithms that can efficiently search for optimal solutions to complex optimization problems. Traditional optimization techniques are limited by the amount of available training data and slow convergence rates. Machine learning techniques offer the promise of improving performance by automatically extracting patterns and relationships from historical data. There are two main classes of machine learning algorithms used in design automation: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised learning algorithms learn to map inputs to outputs based on labeled examples provided by humans. Unsupervised learning algorithms detect patterns and group similar examples together without prior knowledge of their class membership. Examples of supervised learning include regression analysis, decision trees, and support vector machines. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, principal component analysis, and dimensionality reduction. Both supervised and unsupervised algorithms can be applied to design optimization problems to generate effective designs.

The early stage of design automation generally involves experimentation and iterative improvement. Early results can help inform future iterations by identifying bottlenecks and gaps in the process. Once the core algorithm is established, it should be integrated into a larger system that includes hardware platforms, interface design, and integration testing. Additionally, safety measures must be implemented to ensure proper operation of the tool and prevent accidental damage or injury. Continuous monitoring and feedback loops provide opportunities to adapt algorithms to user preferences and identify issues before they become critical.

### （2.2）功能性DNA（Functional DNA） ###

Functionally defined DNA (FBD) refers to a genetic code where each codon codes for a specific function, such as that of amino acids, nucleotides, or part of a polypeptide chain. FBD allows for the creation of complex structures, such as organelles, membranes, or assembled viruses. Nonetheless, standard cloning techniques require manual intervention to specify the desired functions for any given genomic segment, leading to low levels of reproducibility and scalability. Instead, we propose using DNA replication fidelities to define the functional properties of DNA segments and replicate them via synthetic biology. SynBio’s library of DNA parts represents a good starting point for defining large-scale DNA libraries that contain sequences with targeted functions. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9 technology enables us to introduce targeted mutations within the host cell, allowing us to design customized sequences tailored to a specific task.

More specifically, CRISPR-Cas9 screens small, noncoding RNAs (siRNAs) for binding sites within host genes. When activated, siRNA cleaves the RNA transcript and produces Cas9, a helper protein that guides its interaction with its partner DNA endonuclease. CRISPR-Cas9 screens thousands of targets per hour, leading to a large number of candidate constructs that encode different functional genes, ranging from antibodies to drug delivery systems. By screening and selecting candidates, we can create custom FBD libraries containing selectively expressed constructs and targeted markers that fit the needs of a particular application. Using this approach, we can build genetic circuits, memory arrays, and other DNA constructs that operate autonomously inside cells.

### （2.3）弹性DNA（Elastic DNA） ###

Elastic DNA refers to a type of DNA architecture that uses multimerization and stretchable secondary structure to create structures that can change shape and morphology in response to external stimuli. Elastic structures can be designed for use in many fields, including biology, medicine, transportation, and energy production. Popular elastic DNA technologies include self-assembling protein blocks, lipid bilayers, and biofouling agents. While elastic DNA offers great potential for building new materials, understanding its inner workings remains elusive. Here, we propose a theoretical model that explains how DNA supports flexible shapes and bends under stress. Understanding elastic DNA is key to achieving high-performance and versatile DNA materials, such as those used in soft robotics, biosensors, and bioactuators.

Our model considers two fundamental forces that control the behavior of elastic DNA: entropic forces and volume preserving forces. Entropic forces push and pull DNA into random orientations and redistribute its information content, causing strain and buckling. Volume preserving forces maintain the same volume throughout the lifetime of a molecule, ensuring that the structure maintains its overall shape and connectivity. Combining these forces creates a flexible, adaptable and yet durable structure that can withstand extreme loading, temperature changes, and vibrations.

### （2.4）半绞合酶设计（Semi-Permanently Coordinated Regulatory Elements, SPREs） ###

SPREs consist of repeats of DNA that bind to a target site and coordinate multiple functions such as transcription, translation, and signal transduction. They have been shown to modulate gene expression, promote chromatin condensation, and direct the movement of metabolites around the cell surface. Despite their importance, SPRE design is currently limited by the difficulty of finding suitable repeat sequences and finding appropriate positions to integrate them into the target genome. To address these challenges, here, we propose a deep learning-based approach that optimizes SPREs' interaction with target sites, function, and expression. We train a neural network on a set of benchmark datasets to recognize splice variants that can form stable connections with the target site. Next, we use reinforcement learning to learn the best combination of splice variants to maximize the activity of the resulting construct. Within minutes, we can produce an ensemble of highly specialized SPREs that interact specifically and seamlessly with their target site to regulate gene expression and dynamic behaviors of the cell.

### （2.5）体积优化（Nanoparticle Shape Optimization） ###

Shape optimization is the process of minimizing the objective function that determines the geometry of a body by changing its dimensions and shapes until it satisfies predefined criteria. In practice, this involves searching for the lowest cost solution that satisfies a series of constraints, such as symmetry, flatness, and compactness. Many applications involve designing solvent-accessible, water-soluble, porous and hydrophobic shapes, or building complex interfaces between different materials. In recent years, numerous studies have attempted to apply shape optimization methods to various materials systems, including polymers, lipids, and metallic glasses.

Here, we propose a novel approach called Morphology Placement Techniques (MPT) for guiding the placement of nanoparticles on surfaces. MPT exploits the unique geometry of lamellae and their geometric nature to guide the distribution of nanoparticles evenly among a substrate surface. The technique works by modeling the shape gradients of lamellae along their curvature direction, which can be estimated using numerical simulations. Then, we use convex optimization algorithms to adjust the position of each particle so that the sum of squared differences between the actual and predicted shape gradients is minimized. Since this problem is NP-hard, we use a gradient-enhanced quasi-Newton algorithm combined with trust region methods to optimize the objective function.

Additionally, we demonstrate our approach using a mathematical model that quantifies the effect of deformation and elasticity on the alignment of particles in terms of their interparticle distance. Experimentally, we validate the accuracy and stability of our method on two-dimensional materials, such as polystyrene and monolayer graphene, demonstrating its ability to generate symmetric shapes and strong bond forces. We believe that the proposed mathematical framework, MPT, and experimental validation will lead to better characterizations of nanoscale shape optimization and pave the road for more powerful and reliable shape manipulation techniques in a wide range of applications.
