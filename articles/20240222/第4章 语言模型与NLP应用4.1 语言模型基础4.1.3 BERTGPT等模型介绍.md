### 4.1.1 What is a Language Model?

A language model is a probabilistic model that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words occurring in a given context. In other words, it estimates the probability $P(w\_1, w\_2, ..., w\_n)$ of observing a sentence or document with $n$ words, where each word $w\_i$ is drawn from a fixed vocabulary $V$.

Language models have many applications in natural language processing (NLP), such as text generation, machine translation, speech recognition, and question answering. By training a language model on large amounts of text data, we can capture the patterns and structures of human language and generate more realistic and fluent text.

<a name="why-do-we-need-language-models"></a>

### 4.1.2 Why do we Need Language Models?

Language models play a crucial role in many NLP tasks because they provide a way to represent the meaning and context of words and sentences in a numerical and computable form. Here are some reasons why language models are important:

* **Distributional Semantics**: The idea behind distributional semantics is that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. By analyzing the co-occurrence patterns of words in large corpora, language models can learn to map words to vectors in a high-dimensional space, where the distance between vectors reflects the semantic relatedness of words. This approach is called word embedding, and it has been shown to be very effective in capturing subtle nuances and shades of meaning.
* **Syntax and Grammar**: Language models can also capture the syntactic and grammatical structure of sentences by modeling the dependencies and relations between words. For example, a language model can learn to predict the correct verb tense or agreement based on the surrounding words. By incorporating these linguistic features into the model, we can improve its performance and interpretability.
* **Transfer Learning**: Another advantage of language models is that they can be used as pretrained models for downstream tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or question answering. By fine-tuning a pretrained language model on a specific dataset, we can leverage the knowledge and representations learned from the large-scale pretraining and adapt them to the target task. This approach is known as transfer learning, and it has become a standard practice in modern NLP research and applications.

## 4.2 Core Concepts and Connections

In this section, we will introduce some core concepts and connections that are essential for understanding language models and their applications. These concepts include probability and conditional probability, word embeddings and distributed representations, sequence-to-sequence models, attention mechanism, and transfer learning and fine-tuning. We will explain each concept briefly and show how they relate to each other.

<a name="probability-and-conditional-probability"></a>

### 4.2.1 Probability and Conditional Probability

The foundation of language models is probability theory, which provides a mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty and randomness. Specifically, we are interested in the concept of probability distributions, which describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment.

For example, suppose we roll a fair six-sided die and observe the outcome. The possible outcomes are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the probability distribution assigns a probability of 1/6 to each outcome, since there are six equally likely outcomes. The sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1, since one of the outcomes must occur.

Now, let's consider a more complex scenario, where we observe a sequence of words and want to estimate the probability of the sequence. To do this, we need to define a joint probability distribution over all possible sequences of words. One common approach is to factorize the joint probability into conditional probabilities using the chain rule of probability:

$$
P(w\_1, w\_2, ..., w\_n) = P(w\_1) \cdot P(w\_2 | w\_1) \cdot P(w\_3 | w\_1, w\_2) \cdot ... \cdot P(w\_n | w\_1, w\_2, ..., w\_{n-1})
$$

This formula says that the probability of a sequence is the product of the probabilities of each word given the previous words. Intuitively, this makes sense, since the probability of a word depends on the context provided by the previous words.

<a name="word-embeddings-and-distributed-representations"></a>

### 4.2.2 Word Embeddings and Distributed Representations

One challenge in language modeling is how to represent words and sentences in a way that captures their meaning and context. Traditional approaches use one-hot encoding, which represents each word as a binary vector of length $|V|$, where $V$ is the vocabulary size. However, this representation suffers from several drawbacks, such as sparsity, lack of generalization, and inability to capture semantic relationships between words.

To address these limitations, recent advances in NLP have focused on developing word embedding techniques, which map words to dense, continuous vectors in a low-dimensional space. The idea behind word embeddings is to exploit the distributional hypothesis, which states that words with similar meanings tend to occur in similar contexts. By analyzing the co-occurrence patterns of words in large corpora, word embedding algorithms can learn to project words into a vector space, where the distance between vectors reflects the semantic relatedness of words.

There are many popular word embedding algorithms, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. These algorithms differ in their details, but they share the same basic principle of computing word vectors based on their contextual usage. In practice, word embeddings have been shown to capture various linguistic properties, such as synonymy, antonymy, analogy, and hierarchical relationships.

<a name="sequence-to-sequence-models"></a>

### 4.2.3 Sequence-to-Sequence Models

Language modeling is not only about predicting the next word given the previous words, but also about generating sequences of arbitrary length and complexity. For example, machine translation involves mapping a sequence of words in one language (source) to another sequence of words in another language (target). A natural way to model such problems is to use sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, which consist of two main components: an encoder and a decoder.

The encoder takes a sequence of input words and maps them to a fixed-size context vector, which encodes the meaning and context of the input sequence. The decoder then generates a sequence of output words, conditioned on the context vector and the previously generated words. Seq2seq models can be trained end-to-end using maximum likelihood estimation, by maximizing the log-likelihood of the target sequence given the source sequence.

Seq2seq models have achieved impressive results in many NLP tasks, such as machine translation, summarization, and dialogue systems. However, they face some challenges, such as the difficulty of handling long sequences, the lack of explicit attention to important parts of the input, and the inability to generate diverse and creative outputs.

<a name="attention-mechanism"></a>

### 4.2.4 Attention Mechanism

To alleviate the limitations of seq2seq models, researchers have proposed the attention mechanism, which allows the decoder to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence at each time step. The intuition behind attention is that when generating a word, the model should attend to the most relevant parts of the input, rather than relying solely on the context vector.

Attention mechanisms come in various forms, but the most common one is called additive attention or Bahdanau attention, named after the authors who introduced it. In additive attention, the attention weights for each input position are computed by taking the dot product of a query vector and a key vector, followed by a softmax activation function. The query vector represents the current state of the decoder, while the key vector represents the input word at each position. The resulting attention weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the input values, which serves as the context vector for the decoder.

Attention has become a standard component of modern NLP models, due to its ability to improve the interpretability and performance of seq2seq models. By allowing the model to focus on the relevant parts of the input, attention helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, reduce the computational complexity, and enable more accurate and diverse generation.

<a name="transfer-learning-and-fine-tuning"></a>

### 4.2.5 Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning

Another trend in NLP research is transfer learning, which refers to the ability of a model to transfer knowledge and representations learned from one task to another task. Transfer learning has become possible due to the availability of large-scale pretrained models, such as BERT and GPT, which have been trained on billions of words and millions of documents.

Transfer learning works by first training a model on a large-scale dataset, such as Wikipedia or Common Crawl, and then fine-tuning the model on a smaller, task-specific dataset. During fine-tuning, the model parameters are updated using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, while keeping the pretrained parameters frozen or partially unfrozen. This approach allows the model to leverage the pretrained knowledge and adapt it to the target task, without requiring excessive amounts of labeled data or computation.

Transfer learning has several benefits over traditional supervised learning, such as reducing the need for labeled data, improving the generalization and robustness, enabling faster convergence, and facilitating multi-task learning. Moreover, transfer learning has enabled the development of new NLP applications, such as few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and unsupervised learning, which can handle scenarios with limited or no labeled data.

## 4.3 Core Algorithms and Operations

In this section, we will present some core algorithms and operations that are commonly used in language models and NLP applications. These algorithms include word embedding algorithms, transformer architecture, BERT architecture and training objectives, and GPT architecture and training objectives. We will explain each algorithm briefly and provide some implementation details using popular libraries and frameworks.

<a name="word-embedding-algorithms"></a>

### 4.3.1 Word Embedding Algorithms

As mentioned earlier, word embeddings are dense, continuous vectors that represent words in a low-dimensional space. Word embedding algorithms aim to learn these vectors from raw text data, by analyzing the co-occurrence patterns of words and their context. Here, we introduce two popular word embedding algorithms: Word2Vec and GloVe.

<a name="word2vec"></a>

#### 4.3.1.1 Word2Vec

Word2Vec is a word embedding algorithm developed by Mikolov et al. in 2013, which consists of two architectures: Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context words, while Skip-Gram predicts the context words given a target word. Both architectures use a shallow neural network with one hidden layer, which maps words to vectors using a simple linear transformation.

The main idea behind Word2Vec is to optimize the objective function of the neural network using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation, by minimizing the loss between the predicted and true words. During training, the model updates the word vectors based on the error gradients, using a technique called negative sampling or hierarchical softmax. This technique allows the model to sample negative examples efficiently and avoid computing the full softmax distribution over all vocabulary words.

Once trained, Word2Vec can generate word vectors for any word in the vocabulary, by looking up the corresponding row in the weight matrix. These vectors can be used for various downstream tasks, such as similarity comparison, clustering, analogy completion, and visualization.

Here is an example of how to train a Word2Vec model using the Gensim library in Python:
```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import gensim.downloader as api

# Load the text data as a list of sentences
sentences = api.load('text8')

# Train the Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(sentences=sentences, size=100, window=5, min_count=5, workers=4)

# Access the word vectors
vector = model.wv['example']
print(vector)
```
<a name="glove"></a>

#### 4.3.1.2 GloVe

GloVe is another word embedding algorithm developed by Pennington et al. in 2014, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation. Unlike Word2Vec, which uses local context windows to predict the target word, GloVe uses global co-occurrence statistics to learn word vectors. Specifically, GloVe aims to minimize the following objective function:

$$
J = \sum\_{i,j=1}^{|V|} f(P\_{ij}) (w\_i^T w\_j + b\_i + b\_j - log P\_{ij})^2
$$

where $f$ is a weighting function that reduces the contribution of frequent words, $w\_i$ and $w\_j$ are the word vectors for the $i$-th and $j$-th words in the vocabulary, $b\_i$ and $b\_j$ are bias terms, and $P\_{ij}$ is the probability of observing the $j$-th word in the context of the $i$-th word. The intuition behind GloVe is that the dot product of two word vectors should capture the semantic relationship between the corresponding words, such as similarity, relatedness, or analogy.

To optimize the objective function, GloVe uses stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation, by updating the word vectors based on the error gradients. However, unlike Word2Vec, GloVe does not require negative sampling or hierarchical softmax, since the co-occurrence probabilities are computed explicitly from the corpus.

Here is an example of how to train a GloVe model using the Gensim library in Python:
```python
from gensim.models import GloVe
import gensim.downloader as api

# Load the text data as a list of sentences
sentences = api.load('text8')

# Train the GloVe model
model = GloVe(no_components=100, learning_rate=0.05, min_count=5, epochs=30, verbose=True)
model.fit(sentences, window=5, batch_words=10000)

# Access the word vectors
vector = model.wv['example']
print(vector)
```
<a name="transformer-architecture"></a>

### 4.3.2 Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture is a deep neural network architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017, which has become the de facto standard for language modeling and NLP applications. The transformer architecture consists of several components, including multi-head self-attention, position encoding, feedforward networks, and layer normalization. Here, we focus on the first two components, which are essential for capturing the meaning and context of words.

<a name="multi-head-self-attention"></a>

#### 4.3.2.1 Multi-Head Self-Attention

The key innovation of the transformer architecture is the use of multi-head self-attention, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, without relying on recurrence or convolution. The main idea behind self-attention is to compute the attention weights between each pair of words in the sequence, based on their content and context. Specifically, the attention weights are computed as follows:

$$
\mathrm{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \mathrm{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d\_k}})V
$$

where $Q$, $K$, and $V$ are the query, key, and value matrices, obtained by projecting the input sequence into three different subspaces using linear transformations. The query and key matrices are used to compute the attention scores, while the value matrix is used to compute the output sequence.

Multi-head self-attention extends the basic self-attention mechanism by allowing the model to learn multiple attention patterns in parallel, by applying the same operation multiple times with different projection matrices. Specifically, the input sequence is projected into $h$ different subspaces, each with its own query, key, and value matrices. The outputs of these projections are then concatenated and linearly transformed again, to produce the final output sequence. The number of heads $h$ is a hyperparameter that controls the capacity and diversity of the attention patterns.

Here is an example of how to implement multi-head self-attention using PyTorch:
```less
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiHeadSelfAttention(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_heads):
       super().__init__()
       self.hidden_size = hidden_size
       self.num_heads = num_heads
       self.head_size = hidden_size // num_heads
       self.query_projection = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
       self.key_projection = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
       self.value_projection = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
       self.output_projection = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
       self.layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hidden_size)

   def forward(self, inputs):
       # Project the inputs into the query, key, and value matrices
       query = self.query_projection(inputs)
       key = self.key_projection(inputs)
       value = self.value_projection(inputs)

       # Apply the multi-head self-attention mechanism
       batch_size, seq_len, _ = query.shape
       query = query.view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_size).transpose(1, 2)
       key = key.view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_size).transpose(1, 2)
       value = value.view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_size).transpose(1, 2)
       scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-1, -2)) / math.sqrt(self.head_size)
       attn_weights = nn.functional.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
       outputs = torch.matmul(attn_weights, value).transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)

       # Add the residual connection and apply the layer normalization
       outputs = self.layer_norm(outputs + inputs)

       # Apply the output projection
       outputs = self.output_projection(outputs)

       return outputs
```
<a name="position-encoding"></a>

#### 4.3.2.2 Position Encoding

Another challenge in language modeling is how to encode the position information of words in a sequence, since transformers do not have any inherent notion of order or distance. To address this challenge, Vaswani et al. proposed to add a fixed position encoding to the input sequence, before feeding it into the transformer layers.

The position encoding is a vector of length equal to the hidden size, which encodes the absolute position of each word in the sequence. The position encoding is added to the input embedding using element-wise summation, so that the resulting vector has both the content and position information.

The formula for the position encoding is as follows:

$$
\mathrm{PE}\_{i, 2j} = \sin(\frac{i}{10000^{2j/d}}), \quad \mathrm{PE}\_{i, 2j+1} = \cos(\frac{i}{10000^{2j/d}})
$$

where $i$ is the position index, $j$ is the dimension index, and $d$ is the hidden size. This formula generates a sinusoidal pattern along each dimension, where the frequency increases exponentially with the dimension index. The intuition behind this formula is that the low-frequency components capture the global position information, while the high-frequency components capture the local position information.

Here is an example of how to implement the position encoding using NumPy:
```python
import numpy as np

def get_position_encoding(seq_len, hidden_size):
   """
   Generate the position encoding matrix for the given sequence length and hidden size.
   :param seq_len: int, the sequence length
   :param hidden_size: int, the hidden size
   :return: numpy.ndarray, the position encoding matrix of shape (seq_len, hidden_size)
   """
   encoding = np.zeros((seq_len, hidden_size))
   for i in range(seq_len):
       for j in range(hidden_size):
           if j % 2 == 0:
               encoding[i, j] = np.sin(i / (10000 ** (j / hidden_size)))
           else:
               encoding[i, j] = np.cos(i / (10000 ** (j / hidden_size)))
   return encoding
```

### 4.3.3 BERT Architecture and Training Objectives

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular pretrained language model developed by Devlin et al. in 2018, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification. Here, we introduce the architecture and training objectives of BERT.

<a name="bert-architecture"></a>

#### 4.3.3.1 BERT Architecture

The architecture of BERT consists of multiple transformer layers, stacked together and initialized with pretrained weights. Each transformer layer contains a multi-head self-attention module and a feedforward network, followed by layer normalization and residual connections. Additionally, BERT uses two special tokens, [CLS] and [SEP], to mark the beginning and end of a sentence, respectively. These tokens are used to compute the sentence-level representations, which are useful for downstream tasks.

Unlike traditional unidirectional language models, BERT uses a bidirectional encoding scheme, which allows the model to learn the contextual relationships between words in both directions. Specifically, BERT uses a masked language modeling objective, where some of the input words are randomly replaced with a special token [MASK], and the model is trained to predict the original words based on their surrounding context. By doing so, BERT can learn to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, without relying on recurrence or convolution.

To further improve the generalization and robustness of BERT, Devlin et al. introduced two additional techniques: next sentence prediction and whole-word masking. Next sentence prediction involves training the model to predict whether two sentences follow each other in the original corpus, by adding a binary classification task after the final transformer layer. Whole-word masking involves replacing all the tokens corresponding to a word with the [MASK] token, instead of just one token at random, to encourage the model to learn the dependencies between adjacent tokens.

<a name="next-sentence-prediction"></a>

#### 4.3.3.2 Next Sentence Prediction

Next sentence prediction is a binary classification task that aims to predict whether two sentences follow each other in the original corpus. Given a pair of sentences $(s\_1, s\_2)$, the model is trained to predict the probability of $s\_2$ being the next sentence of $s\_1$, denoted as $P(s\_2 | s\_1)$.

During training, the model receives as input the concatenation of $s\_1$ and $s\_2$, separated by the [SEP] token, and the true label indicating whether $s\_2$ follows $s\_1$ or not. The model then applies the transformer layers and adds a binary classification head after the final layer, to predict the probability of the next sentence. The cross-entropy loss function is used to optimize the model parameters.

Next sentence prediction has several benefits over traditional language modeling objectives, such as reducing the vocabulary size, improving the contextual understanding, and enabling transfer learning across different NLP tasks. For example, the [CLS] token can be used as a sentence-level representation, by taking the output of the final transformer layer and applying a fully connected layer with softmax activation. This representation can then be fine-tuned for
