=====================================================================================================================================

Speech recognition is a critical component of many artificial intelligence (AI) applications. It enables computers to convert spoken language into written text, which can then be used for various purposes such as transcription, translation, and command and control. In this chapter, we will delve into the basics of speech recognition, focusing on speech signal processing. We will start with an introduction to the background and core concepts, followed by an in-depth explanation of the algorithms, specific steps, and mathematical models involved. We will also provide practical implementation examples and discuss real-world use cases. Finally, we will recommend some tools and resources and summarize the future development trends and challenges in speech recognition.

Background Introduction
-----------------------

Speech recognition has been a topic of interest for researchers and engineers for several decades. Early efforts focused on rule-based systems that relied on handcrafted features and rules to transcribe speech. However, these approaches were limited in their ability to handle variations in speech due to factors such as noise, accents, and speaker characteristics.

With the advent of machine learning and deep learning techniques, speech recognition has made significant strides in recent years. These techniques enable the automatic extraction of features from speech signals and the modeling of complex relationships between those features and the corresponding transcriptions. As a result, modern speech recognition systems are capable of achieving high accuracy rates even in noisy environments and with diverse speakers.

Core Concepts and Relationships
-------------------------------

At a high level, speech recognition involves several key components, as illustrated in Figure 1. The first step is speech signal acquisition, where the speech signal is captured using a microphone or other recording device. The second step is preprocessing, where the speech signal is prepared for analysis by removing noise and other unwanted artifacts. The third step is feature extraction, where relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed speech signal. The fourth step is modeling, where statistical models are built based on the extracted features and corresponding transcriptions. The final step is decoding, where the most likely transcription is determined based on the models and the input speech signal.
