# 1.简介
  

Deep learning is a new type of machine learning technique that allows computers to learn from large amounts of data without being explicitly programmed. The goal of deep learning is to develop machines with the ability to learn and understand complex patterns in data by modeling the way the human brain processes information. Deep learning enables us to build more intelligent systems that can recognize, classify, and interpret data at a deeper level than ever before. It has revolutionized fields such as speech recognition, image processing, natural language understanding, recommendation engines, and autonomous driving. This article will introduce you to deep learning and why it is widely used today.

## 2.1 深度学习的定义、特点及应用场景
Deep learning (DL) refers to artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are inspired by the structure and function of the human nervous system. ANNs are composed of layers of neurons, interconnected between each other like a neural network. Each layer consists of nodes or units, which process input signals and pass on output signals through connections called edges. These edges transmit signals to adjacent layers, where they can be processed further. In this way, an ANN learns to extract meaningful features from its inputs and then use those features for classification, prediction, and decision making. DL also provides several advantages over traditional machine learning techniques:

1. Scalability: DL models can analyze large datasets quickly using parallel computing hardware. As a result, they can handle big data efficiently and produce accurate results within reasonable time frames.

2. Robustness: DL models can adapt to changes in the input data by updating their weights dynamically during training. Therefore, they can avoid overfitting problems associated with traditional ML models, which occur when they have insufficient capacity to model the underlying patterns in the data.

3. Flexibility: DL models can handle high dimensional input data, such as images, audio clips, and textual data, and can automatically discover relevant features based on the structure of the data itself. 

4. Efficiency: DL models consume less computational resources compared to traditional ML algorithms, which makes them highly efficient for real-time applications.

In summary, DL offers several benefits compared to traditional ML approaches: scalability, robustness, flexibility, and efficiency. However, there are still some limitations in DL's applicability and effectiveness. For instance, DL requires extensive preprocessing of raw data, which can take up significant computational power and reduce the overall accuracy. Moreover, DL tends to overfit to small datasets and perform poorly on larger ones. Consequently, there is a need for researchers to explore novel ways of handling these challenges. Additionally, different tasks require different types of DL architectures, which must be designed separately. Finally, DL remains challenging because it relies heavily on labeled data, which can be expensive to obtain. Nonetheless, DL is transforming many industries across various sectors, including finance, healthcare, transportation, energy, education, and manufacturing.

## 2.2 深度学习中的关键词——激活函数、优化算法和损失函数
The activation function plays an essential role in deep learning models. An activation function determines how neuron outputs are calculated given its inputs. There are several commonly used activation functions in DL, including sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), rectified linear unit (ReLU), softmax, and maximum out. Activation functions can significantly affect the performance of deep learning models, so it is important to carefully choose one suitable for the task at hand.

The optimization algorithm specifies the method used to update the parameters of the model while minimizing the loss function. Popular optimization algorithms include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD), adagrad, rmsprop, Adam, and Adadelta. SGD updates the parameters based on the current batch of data, MBGD updates the parameters after processing a fixed number of samples, whereas others adaptively adjust the step size based on recent gradients.

Finally, the loss function measures the difference between predicted values and actual values. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), cross entropy, and hinge loss. MSE calculates the average squared differences between predicted and true values, while cross entropy measures the difference between two probability distributions. Hinge loss penalizes incorrect classifications according to a margin parameter. Loss functions determine the degree of error in the model's predictions and help optimize the model parameters using the specified optimization algorithm.
