# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before we delve deeper into data science itself, let's first go through some basic concepts and terminology used throughout the rest of this article. These will be useful when working with complex topics such as machine learning algorithms and statistics. We'll also briefly explain some important terms related to data engineering and data governance to give you a better understanding of why they are so critical to the successful implementation of data science projects.

2.1 Data Engineering
Data engineering is the process of designing, developing, integrating, and optimizing data infrastructure across the enterprise. It involves creating automated pipelines that move data from various sources (e.g., databases, file formats) to reliable storage locations for further processing, transformation, and analytics. Data engineers typically handle tasks such as schema design, data modeling, ETL processes, data quality checks, indexing strategies, and monitoring tools. They ensure that data is consistent, accurate, and free from errors before it reaches its final destination. 

2.2 Data Governance
Data governance refers to the mechanisms responsible for ensuring that all stakeholders involved in managing data assets adhere to established policies, procedures, and standards. It includes establishing data stewards who oversee the entire lifecycle of data, ensuring that appropriate access controls are implemented and data usage is monitored for compliance purposes. Additionally, data governance ensures that the proper documentation exists around data assets, providing transparency and traceability of changes made to them. Overall, good data governance requires careful consideration of data ownership, management, and utilization. 

2.3 Statistics and Probability Theory
Statistics and probability theory are both fundamental concepts required for any data scientist to work effectively with data. Statistics provides mathematical tools for analyzing data sets, identifying patterns, and making predictions. Probability theory is the branch of mathematics that studies the likelihood of events occurring. Together, these two fields form the basis of modern data science.

2.4 Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine learning algorithms are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms that leverage patterns and relationships between data points to learn and predict outcomes. There are several types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Supervised learning models require labeled training data where the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs, while unsupervised learning models identify patterns in unlabelled data without any prior knowledge. Reinforcement learning involves agents interacting with environments in order to learn optimal actions, rewards, and behaviors. Deep learning architectures rely on multi-layered neural networks that mimic the structure and function of the human brain.

2.5 Data Analysis and Visualization Tools
In addition to machine learning algorithms, other popular data science tools include data visualization tools like tableau, seaborn, ggplot, matplotlib, etc. These tools allow users to explore and analyze data visually, enabling them to identify trends, outliers, and relationships amongst variables. Other common tools include pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, nltk, spacy, etc. All these tools enable data scientists to perform exploratory data analysis and feature extraction to prepare raw data for downstream processing.
