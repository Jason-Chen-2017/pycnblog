Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of artificial intelligence that learns how to make decisions and take actions in an environment by trial-and-error methods. The core idea behind RL is the agent interacts with its environment through action, which results in feedback or reward, leading to improved performance over time. The goal of RL is for the agent to learn a policy function that maps states to actions based on experience gained from interacting with the environment. In other words, the objective of RL is to maximize the cumulative rewards it receives as it explores the state space and discovers optimal policies. 

The field of reinforcement learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to solve complex problems like robotics and autonomous driving. Today, RL is applied in fields such as finance, healthcare, education, transportation, and gaming. However, it can also be used for many other applications where optimization algorithms are required to find the best solution given limited information or noisy data. This article provides a comprehensive introduction to reinforcement learning by covering fundamental concepts, algorithms, and practical applications using Python programming language.  

This book covers two main areas of reinforcement learning: Markov decision processes (MDPs) and temporal difference (TD) learning. It starts by introducing fundamental concepts related to MDPs and TD learning before discussing various planning algorithms, Q-learning, SARSA, and dynamic programming techniques for solving these problems. Next, we move into specific environments and tasks, including gridworlds, robotic control, maze navigation, and task allocation in cloud computing systems. We then discuss several applications of reinforcement learning, including games, robotics, scheduling, and knowledge representation. Finally, this chapter includes a discussion about future trends and challenges in RL.

In conclusion, reinforcement learning offers an effective approach for developing intelligent agents that can learn from their interactions with the real world. However, careful consideration must be made when implementing RL algorithms to ensure they converge efficiently and produce stable policies that generalize well to new situations. The efficacy of RL depends critically on choosing suitable problem formulations and appropriate exploration strategies to avoid getting trapped in local optima. The application of RL to real-world problems requires researchers to collaborate with domain experts to identify the relevant aspects of the system and devise suitable algorithms for each case. Overall, reinforcement learning presents a powerful tool for improving the quality of life and making efficient use of resources. With the right tools and techniques, reinforcement learning can transform many industries and fields, such as retail, transportation, energy management, and health care.

# 2. 基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 马尔可夫决策过程（Markov Decision Process）

A Markov decision process (MDP) is a sequential decision-making framework that defines the transitions between states and the rewards that result from those transitions. Formally, an MDP consists of four components:

1. States: A set of states $S$ represents all possible states that the system could be in.
2. Actions: A set of actions $A(s)$ represents all possible actions that can be taken in any given state $s$. 
3. Transition probability matrix: A transition probability matrix $T(s,a,s')$ represents the probabilities of transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$ under action $a$, i.e., the conditional probability distribution $p(s'|s,a)$. 
4. Reward function: A reward function $\text{r}(s,a,s')$ specifies the expected reward obtained after taking action $a$ in state $s$, ending up in state $s'$. 


An MDP can model a wide range of decision-making problems, including inventory control, stock exchange trading, game playing, resource allocation, and biological systems. By defining the transition probability matrix and reward function, an MDP allows us to compute the value functions associated with each state and derive optimal policies that maximize long-term rewards. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms behind MDPs is critical for applying RL to practical problems.


## 2.2 时序差分学习（Temporal Difference Learning）

Temporal difference (TD) learning is another way to approximate the value function associated with each state in an MDP. Unlike Monte Carlo method, which estimates the value function based on the entire episode of interaction starting from the initial state, TD adjusts the estimate based on only one step of interaction at a time, called a time step. 

At each time step, the algorithm updates the estimated value function based on the current observation and previous action. The update rule involves subtracting a discount factor $\gamma$ multiplied by the next reward from the current estimated value of the current state and adding the discounted estimation error, computed using a temporal difference error:

$$V(s_t)\leftarrow V(s_t)+\alpha[R_{t+1}+\gamma V(s_{t+1})-V(s_t)]$$

where $V(s_t)$ denotes the current estimated value of state $s_t$, $\alpha$ is the step size, $R_{t+1}$ is the reward received at time step $t+1$, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. 

Similar to MC, TD also converges to the true value function but may require more computational effort than MC. Additionally, since it considers only immediate rewards, it tends to overestimate the values of transient states or actions that led to them. In contrast, MC treats each state visited during an episode as equally important, regardless of the number of times it was visited.

## 2.3 状态值函数（State Value Functions）

Given an MDP defined by a transition probability matrix $T(s,a,s')$ and a reward function $\text{r}(s,a,s')$, the state value function $v(s)$ represents the expected total reward that would be obtained if the agent were to start in state $s$ and followed the optimal policy thereafter:

$$v(s)=\sum_{s'} p(s'|s,\pi^*(s))[\text{r}(s,\pi^*(s),s')]$$

where $\pi^*$ denotes the optimal policy for state $s$, defined as follows:

$$\pi^*(s)=\underset{a}{\operatorname{argmax}} q^\pi(s,a)$$

where $q^\pi(s,a)$ denotes the action-value function evaluated under policy $\pi$. Intuitively, $v(s)$ measures the "goodness" of being in state $s$, whereas $q^\pi(s,a)$ measures the "quality" of taking action $a$ in state $s$ according to the behavior of the agent who follows policy $\pi$.


## 2.4 动作值函数（Action Value Function）

The action-value function $q(s,a)$ gives the expected total reward obtained from taking action $a$ in state $s$, following the optimal policy $\pi$:

$$q(s,a)=\sum_{s',r}\left[p(s'|s,a)[r+\gamma v(s')]\right]$$

where $s'$ and $r$ represent the resulting state and reward after executing action $a$ in state $s$, respectively. Intuitively, $q(s,a)$ quantifies the utility of taking action $a$ while being in state $s$, given the current policy $\pi$.

## 2.5 策略函数（Policy Function）

The policy function $\pi(s)$ determines what action should be chosen in state $s$ based on the available evidence. Policy evaluation maximizes the value of a given policy $\pi$, while policy improvement finds better policies by exploring the state space and evaluating the corresponding action-value function $q(s,a)$.
