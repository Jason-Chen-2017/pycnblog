# 1.简介
  


Digital transformation has been a key theme and disruptor in business revolution for over two decades now. Within this period of time, there have been numerous digital transformation leaders such as Evolve Investment, Thrive Capital, Transview and Deloitte. But only few companies across industries focus their resources towards building better technologies to help them evolve faster and become more competitive. In this article, we will talk about one such company - Harnessed which aims at harnessing the power of big data to transform businesses across different sectors and geographies globally. 

Harnessed is an AI powered service provider that specializes in helping organizations across different sectors adopt new technology practices with high efficiency and impact. The company offers solutions to various problems faced by companies while implementing innovative strategies based on Big Data analysis. It utilizes several cutting-edge machine learning techniques and algorithms along with cloud computing infrastructure to provide customized solutions to customers’ business requirements. We will discuss what sets Harnessed apart from other companies when it comes to transforming businesses using Big Data.  

Let us start our journey together today! 

# 2.Concepts and Terminology

Before discussing how the concept can be applied in solving business problems using big data, let us first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to Big Data Analytics.

1. Big Data: Big Data refers to large datasets that are so massive in size and complexity that traditional data processing applications cannot handle them efficiently enough. A typical example of Big Data is social media analytics where large amounts of data generated every second contains valuable insights into customer behavior, brand perception, trends and preferences.

2. Hadoop: Hadoop was initially released by Google Inc., but later acquired by Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Hadoop provides distributed storage, processing, and analysis capabilities for Big Data. Its core component is called HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) which allows parallel processing of data stored in multiple nodes within the cluster.

3. MapReduce: MapReduce is a programming model used to process large datasets in parallel on a distributed system. MapReduce consists of two main components: Map function and Reduce function. The map function applies transformations on individual records of data and emits intermediate key-value pairs, whereas the reduce function aggregates these intermediate values based on keys to generate final output.

4. Spark: Apache Spark is another popular framework used for Big Data analytics. Similar to Hadoop, Spark also provides distributed storage, processing, and analysis capabilities for Big Data. However, unlike Hadoop, Spark uses Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) abstraction instead of HDFS for storing and manipulating data.

5. Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves training machines to improve performance through experience. Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.

6. Neural Networks: Neural networks are models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are designed to learn complex patterns in data and make accurate predictions or classifications. One type of neural network widely used in Big Data analytics is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which extracts features directly from raw images without manual feature engineering. 

7. Streaming Data: Streaming data refers to real-time, continuous flow of data generated from multiple sources in small chunks or batches. Examples of streaming data include stock prices, sensor readings, and live video streams. To analyze streaming data effectively, Apache Kafka and Apache Storm are commonly used frameworks. 

8. Database Management Systems (DBMS): DBMSs are software tools used for managing databases. There are many types of DBMS including SQL (Structured Query Language) databases, NoSQL (Not Only Structured Query Language) databases, and Graph databases. Each of these DBMSs have unique characteristics and functions, making it essential for analyzing Big Data.

In summary, Big Data Analytics requires understanding of several fundamental concepts like Big Data, Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, Machine Learning, CNN, Streaming Data, and Database Management Systems. These concepts enable analysts to apply advanced data mining techniques and build scalable and reliable systems that can handle vast amounts of data quickly and accurately.
