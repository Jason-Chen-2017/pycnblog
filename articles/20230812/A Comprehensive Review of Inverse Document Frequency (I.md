Inverse document frequency (IDF) is a crucial concept in text analysis and information retrieval as it helps to weigh the importance of words that appear frequently but less frequently across documents in a corpus. IDF plays an important role in many applications such as search engines, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, etc., where the relevance of a query or item to a corpus needs to be evaluated based on its terms' frequencies within different documents. 

In this review paper, I will discuss about several popular IDF measures used in machine learning text analysis, including term-frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), pointwise mutual information (PMI), divergence from randomness (DFR), augmented TF-IDF (ATF-IDF), tf-idf with variable smoothing parameter and normalization techniques, and probabilistic IR models like Okapi BM25 and language modeling approaches. Additionally, I will provide insights into their practical use cases and limitations, as well as summarize them into the following four categories: 

1. Binary vs. non-binary IDFs: The binary and non-binary versions of IDFs differ significantly in terms of how they handle multiple occurrences of the same word in a document. This category includes traditional binary IDFs and variations like logarithmic scaling, additive smoothing, and augmented binary IDFs.

2. Term weighting schemes: Some IDFs may take into account different weighting schemes while calculating the weights. These include the classic inverse document frequency scheme, cosine similarity scheme, DFR scheme, and probabilistic models like PMI.

3. Hybrid IDFs: Several hybrid IDFs have been proposed to combine the advantages of both binary and non-binary IDFs. These include min-max TF-IDF, discounted cumulative gain (DCG) weighted IDF, and boosted IDFs using user feedback data.

4. Text pre-processing requirements: Most common text preprocessing steps are removal of stopwords, stemming, lemmatization, punctuation processing, and tokenization. Accordingly, some IDFs require certain text preprocessing techniques before being applied.

Overall, this review paper aims at providing a comprehensive overview of various IDF measures used in machine learning text analysis along with practical insights into their implementation and application scenarios. It provides clear guidelines for choosing the appropriate measure according to the specific characteristics of the problem and dataset involved. By reading through this paper, one can choose the most suitable IDF measure(s) for their own use case without feeling overwhelmed by all available options. I hope you find this review helpful!
# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 词项频率（Term Frequency）
Term frequency is the number of times a particular word appears in a document divided by the total number of terms present in the document. If two words occur together more than once in a given document, they would have higher term frequency values compared to words that only appear once. For example, if the word "apple" occurs three times in a given document, then its term frequency value for that document would be 3/9 = 0.33 or 33%. Similarly, if the word "banana" occurs twice in the same document, then its term frequency value for that document would be 2/9 = 0.22 or 22%.

## 2.2 逆文档频率（Inverse Document Frequency）
The inverse document frequency (IDF) is the relative frequency of each word in the collection of documents and is computed as follows:

IDF(t) = log_e(Total Number of Documents / Number of Documents Containing t) + 1

where 't' refers to a particular term and Total Number of Documents represents the total number of documents in the corpus. The formula ensures that terms that occur rarely across the entire corpus receive lower weight than those that occur frequently in a few documents. Mathematically, the logarithmic transformation makes the calculation more stable and gives a smoother curve. To compute the inverse document frequency, we need to first calculate the total number of documents in the corpus, which varies depending on the size of the corpus. Once we obtain this count, we iterate through every document in the corpus and count the number of times the term 't' appears in it. Finally, we divide the total number of documents containing the term 't' by the total number of documents to get the IDF value.

## 2.3 停止词（Stop Words）
A stop word is a commonly used word (such as “the”, “is”, “and”) that does not carry significant meaning and whose occurrence in a sentence doesn't convey any useful information. Stop words usually do not affect the underlying meaning of a sentence much and hence should be removed during natural language processing tasks to improve the efficiency of downstream analyses. Common stop words in English include “a”, “an”, “the”, “in”, “on”, “at”, “of”, “to”.

## 2.4 搜索引擎中的倒排索引（Invert Index）
The inverted index consists of a list of all unique terms extracted from the corpora and pointers to the corresponding postings lists where each posting list contains the documents that contain the term. The indexing process involves iterating through each document in the corpus and extracting all unique terms. Each term's position in the corresponding posting list indicates the frequency of the term in the document. The final product of the indexing process is a compact representation of the entire corpus enabling efficient searching and retrieval of relevant documents quickly.

## 3.1 TF-IDF模型
### 3.1.1 定义
Term-frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) model is a popular statistical method used for text classification and clustering. It assigns greater weights to words that are more relevant to a particular document in a corpus, taking into consideration the fact that some words may appear frequently in general but might not be informative enough to classify a particular document. The TF-IDF score is calculated as follows:

TF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) * IDF(t)

where 't' refers to a particular term in a document 'd', TF(t, d) denotes the term frequency of the term 't' in the document 'd' and is defined as:

TF(t, d) = Count of Occurrences of t in d / Total Number of Terms in d

where 'Count of Occurrences of t in d' is the number of times the term 't' appears in the document 'd'.

Similarly, IDF(t) denotes the inverse document frequency of the term 't' in the entire corpus and is calculated as follows:

IDF(t) = log_e(Total Number of Documents / Number of Documents Containing t) + 1

where 'Number of Documents Containing t' is the number of documents in the corpus that contain the term 't'. Note that adding 1 to the numerator is optional since it has no effect on the ranking.

The overall goal of using the TF-IDF model is to assign greater weights to more informative terms, thus increasing the chances of correctly classifying a document into the desired category.

### 3.1.2 模型优缺点
#### 3.1.2.1 优点
1. Easy to implement: Since the TF-IDF algorithm calculates term scores based on the frequency of individual terms and the frequency distribution of the entire corpus, it is easy to understand and apply. It also reduces the impact of irrelevant terms on classification results.

2. Responds well to the presence of noise and incomplete information: As long as there are sufficient samples in the training set, the TF-IDF model responds well to noise and incomplete information in new documents, making it robust against outliers and typos.

3. Provides interpretable feature vectors: The TF-IDF vector representations obtained by applying TF-IDF to the corpus enable us to identify patterns and relationships between terms in the context of the whole corpus, which facilitates the interpretation of classification results.

4. Captures semantic information: While the TF-IDF approach focuses solely on the syntactic aspects of language, it captures some semantic aspects as well. This makes it particularly useful for tasks involving reasoning about entities, concepts, and topics.

#### 3.1.2.2 缺点
1. Sensitive to small changes in the input data: Although the TF-IDF model is relatively insensitive to minor changes in the input data (i.e., slight deviations in word order, spelling errors, etc.), large variations in the distribution of terms in the corpus can lead to drastic differences in the resulting feature space.

2. Calculation time scales linearly with the size of the corpus: The computation required by the TF-IDF model grows quadratically with the size of the corpus because of the need to compute IDF for each term in the corpus separately. Therefore, large datasets can pose scalability issues when using TF-IDF.

3. Cannot capture interactions between terms: When dealing with sparse high-dimensional data (e.g., text), the TF-IDF model cannot capture complex interactions between pairs of features accurately due to its binarized nature. For example, the absence or presence of a pair of words in a document alone cannot determine whether other related pairs exist in the document or not. However, these factors make the TF-IDF model suitable for some types of applications, such as topic detection, keyword extraction, and clustering.

## 3.2 AT-IDF模型
Augmented TF-IDF (ATF-IDF) is another variant of the TF-IDF model that incorporates additional features to capture the inherent properties of the data. Specifically, it adds a penalty term to the TF-IDF formula to penalize frequent but uninformative terms, reducing the contribution of such words towards the final TF-IDF score. The formula is defined as follows:

ATF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) * IDF(t) * (K + 1) / (K + TF(t, d))

where K is a tuning parameter that controls the degree of redundancy introduced by the additional term.

Aside from capturing uninformative words, the ATF-IDF model also considers the frequency distribution of terms within each document, leading to better handling of rare and infrequent terms. Overall, the ATF-IDF model enhances the performance of TF-IDF model while maintaining its original strengths, namely ability to detect domain-specific patterns and interpretable feature vectors.

## 3.3 DFR模型
Divergence from Randomness (DFR) model was proposed to address the drawbacks of TF-IDF model. The key idea behind the DFR model is to scale down the contributions of low-frequency terms instead of assigning zero weight to them entirely. Thus, it encourages diversity among the selected keywords and discourages monoculture bias. The DFR formula is defined as follows:

DFR(t, c) = (k+1)*TF(t, c)/K(c) * log((N - Nt + 0.5)/(Nt + 0.5)), where N is the total number of documents in the corpus, k is a constant scaling factor, Ntc is the total number of occurrences of term t in category c, and Nt is the total number of documents in category c that contain the term t.

Given the concept of categories in the text classification task, the DFR model allows users to selectively focus on important terms in each category without compromising the accuracy of the remaining ones.

## 3.4 Probabilistic IR Models
Probabilistic IR models aim to estimate the probability of relevance for each document given the query. There are several variants of the probabilistic IR models, including Okapi BM25 and Language Model-based models. We will briefly describe these models here.

### 3.4.1 Okapi BM25
Okapi BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a probabilistic model that uses statistics to adjust the rankings of candidate matching documents for a given query. The basic intuition behind Okapi BM25 is that a document containing many instances of a query term should rank higher than a document containing fewer instances. Statistical techniques can help identify the best possible matches even though exact string matches don't always work.

The Okapi BM25 equation is defined as follows:

BM25(q, d) = sum_{t \in q}(k1 + 1)\frac{f(t, d) * ((k2 + 1)\frac{\lceil n(t, d) / avgdl\rceil}{\lceil n(t) / avgdl\rceil})}{f(t, d) + k3} * idf(t) * L(q, t)

where f(t, d) is the frequency of term t in document d, nt is the total number of documents that contain term t, and qt is the average length of documents that contain term t.

This formula takes into account the frequency of each term in the document as well as the length of the document, giving preference to longer and more diverse documents. The idf function computes the inverse document frequency of each term. Finally, the L(q, t) function is a form of laplace smoothing that prevents division by zero when computing probabilities.

Using Okapi BM25 requires careful tuning of parameters to achieve optimal performance. However, it works well in practice and is widely used in modern search engines.

### 3.4.2 Language Model-Based Models
Language Model-based models rely on predicting the likelihood of occurrence of a sequence of words in a corpus, i.e., the probability of a phrase or a sentence appearing next in the document. They assume that the probability of generating a word depends on the previous words in the sequence, known as Markov assumption. Two popular language model-based models are neural language models and n-gram language models.

Neural language models are trained on massive amounts of unannotated text data, consisting of sequences of words generated from web pages, news articles, blogs, tweets, emails, and other sources. These models capture the dependencies between words and automatically learn to generate novel sentences, paragraphs, and dialogues that sound coherent. Popular examples of neural language models include GPT-2, BERT, and RoBERTa.

On the other hand, n-gram language models use the history of words seen so far to predict the next word. These models are simple yet powerful ways of generating text based on the preceding words. Examples of n-gram language models include the Good-Turing smoothing technique, Laplace smoothing technique, and the interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing technique.

Both n-gram and neural language models can be trained on large corpora of text data, especially for tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation. Neural language models can generate accurate results but require more computational resources than n-gram models. On the other hand, n-gram models offer faster predictions at the cost of reduced accuracy, making them ideal for short texts such as SMS messages or names of people.
