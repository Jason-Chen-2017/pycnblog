# 1.简介
  

大多数机器学习算法都离不开求解参数（coefficients）的问题。在参数确定之前，需要首先对数据进行预处理、特征提取等一系列的工作，而这些过程往往需要通过迭代的方法不断优化模型的性能。一个最简单的迭代法就是梯度下降法，这种方法可以使得代价函数最小化。虽然刚开始看上去很神秘，但是它的奥妙就在于如何计算代价函数的梯度以及如何根据梯度决定更新的参数值，因此非常有必要了解一下它。

在本文中，我们将从以下几个方面详细介绍梯度下降法：
1. 梯度下降算法的原理
2. 如何计算代价函数的梯度
3. 在实际问题中如何应用梯度下降法
最后，我们还会讨论一些关于梯度下降法的问题，如局部最小值和鞍点问题，以及其解决方案。


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology 
## 2.1 Definitions
- **Gradient descent** (GD): an iterative optimization algorithm that aims to find the minimum or maximum of a function by taking steps towards the direction of steepest descent as determined by the negative gradient vector at each step.

- **Parameters**: are variables involved in mathematical calculations that we want to optimize through training our model. These parameters can be adjusted during the learning process to minimize the cost/error function. Parameters can represent coefficients of linear regression models, weights of neural networks, etc. 

- **Learning rate**: determines the size of the step taken on each iteration of GD. A small learning rate will make sure that our updates move us closer to the optimal value but may take longer time to converge. On the other hand, a large learning rate might cause oscillations around the minima or maxima which is not ideal for convergence. In general, it's usually recommended to start with a low learning rate and gradually increase it until you see some level of convergence.

- **Batch vs Stochastic GD**: Batch GD processes all data points at once while SGD processes one example at a time. Batch GD requires more memory space than SGD because it needs to store the entire dataset. However, batch processing offers faster speed when dealing with larger datasets. Therefore, choosing between batch and stochastic GD depends on your specific problem statement. 

- **Cost Function**: The function used to evaluate how well our model performs on given data examples. It measures how close our predicted values are to the actual target values. We use this error signal to update our parameters using GD so that they can produce better predictions in future. Depending on whether we have a classification or regression task, there are different types of cost functions:

    - For regression tasks, commonly used cost functions include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Huber loss.
    - For binary classification tasks, common cost functions are cross-entropy and logarithmic loss. 
    - For multi-class classification tasks, popular cost functions include softmax loss, multinomial logistic loss, and hinge loss. 

## 2.2 Intuition behind GD
In order to understand what gradient descent is doing under the hood, let’s consider a simple example. Suppose you want to find the minimum point on a parabola y=x^2+x. One way to approach this problem would be to look at the slope of the curve at any given point x and then take a step in the direction opposite to that slope until we reach the bottom left corner where the slope becomes zero. This method is called “steep gradient” method since it follows the gradients with increasing magnitude until reaching a flat plateau. Here’s how the same idea works mathematically:

1. Start from an initial guess (let's say x=1). 
2. Calculate the slope dy/dx = 2x + 1.
3. Move towards the direction (-dy/dx, dx) i.e., (−2∗(1)+1,∗1)=(-2,1)<(0,1) in terms of the coordinate system.

Repeat Step 2 & 3 until we reach a point where the slope becomes zero. At this point, the minimum point lies within the range [−1, −1] and its exact location will depend on the starting position (initial guess). Hence, we need to repeat the above procedure multiple times to get the global minimum of the function.  

To formalize this concept of gradient descent, we need to define two things: 

1. A set of parameters (θi) that we want to tune such that the objective function J(θ) is minimized. This is achieved by moving along the directions of steepest decreasing (negative gradient) at each iteration of GD.  
2. Learning rate η, which controls the amount of movement made at every iteration. If the learning rate is too high, it may miss the optimum value; if it is too low, it will take long time to converge to the optimum solution. 


# 3. Algorithm and Steps 
## 3.1 Derivation of GD
Now that we have defined these basic concepts, let's derive the key equation that defines gradient descent algorithm. Specifically, we'll derive how to calculate the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to each parameter θi to obtain the negative of its gradient vector which gives us the direction of the most rapid change of the cost function wrt θi. Then, we'll apply this formula repeatedly to iteratively improve our current estimates of the parameters until we arrive at the local minimum or the saddle point. Finally, we'll discuss several practical aspects of applying GD to machine learning problems.
