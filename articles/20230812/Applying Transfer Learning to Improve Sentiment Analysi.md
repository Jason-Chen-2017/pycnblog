Natural language processing (NLP) is a crucial component of any modern day application that involves human communication. One common NLP task is sentiment analysis which aims to classify the overall attitude or emotion behind a piece of text into one of two categories: positive or negative. Traditional approaches for sentiment analysis involve feature engineering and machine learning models such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Neural Networks (NNs). However, these traditional methods do not capture complex contextual semantics present in natural language and thus fail to perform well on real world applications. In recent years, transfer learning techniques have emerged as a powerful approach to overcome this problem by leveraging knowledge learned from large datasets to improve performance on smaller datasets. In this article, we will discuss how transfer learning can be used to enhance sentiment analysis using transformer-based ensembles. 

In short, transfer learning consists of training a model on a large dataset and then fine-tuning it on a smaller but related dataset where the target task is more challenging. This technique has been successfully applied to several natural language processing tasks including image classification, question answering, speech recognition etc. The idea is simple, we don't need to start from scratch and instead use pre-trained models and fine-tune them on our specific domain data to achieve better results. Among all the available transformer-based models, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) stands out due to its ability to capture complex contextual semantics and make significant improvements over other state-of-the-art models. Therefore, let's dive deeper into how transfer learning can help us improve sentiment analysis with transformer-based ensembles!

Before diving into technical details, let’s quickly go through some key terms and concepts. 

 - **Sentiment analysis** : Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that focuses on classifying the overall attitude or emotion behind a piece of text into one of two categories: positive or negative.
 - **Transformer**: An attention mechanism introduced by Vaswani et al., which was capable of achieving state-of-the-art results in various sequence modeling tasks like translation, summarization, and language modeling. It operates on sequences of tokens and uses attention mechanisms to compute a fixed size representation of each token based on its interactions with other tokens. In a nutshell, it learns the importance of individual words and phrases and their relationships between them.
 - **BERT**: Pre-trained transformer-based language model developed by Google that offers state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks like masked language modeling, next sentence prediction and named entity recognition. BERT works by jointly predicting the masked word and the missing word simultaneously. Moreover, it also performs multi-task learning, where it learns to solve different NLP tasks at once by combining multiple layers of representations obtained from the same input.

## 3.1 How does Transfer Learning Work?
Transfer learning refers to the process of transferring knowledge gained from a larger dataset to a smaller, related dataset. During training, we first train an AI system on a big corpus of data consisting of both high level features and low level features. We freeze these weights because we want to preserve the general trends in the data. Then we remove the top layer of the neural network and replace it with a new layer trained specifically on the small dataset. This replaces the final output layer with a new set of weights initialized randomly according to the selected activation function. The goal of fine tuning is to adapt these new weights to fit the unique characteristics of the new data while still retaining the strengths learned during training on the large dataset. To summarize, here are the steps involved in transfer learning:

 1. Use a pre-trained model on a large dataset for transfer learning.
 2. Freeze the weights of the last few layers of the model so that they retain their pre-trained values.
 3. Add a new output layer on top of the frozen layers with random weights.
 4. Fine tune the new output layer on your specific dataset using backpropagation.
 



We can see in the above figure that the blue box represents the pre-trained model on a large dataset (e.g. GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT) and the orange box represents the fine tuned model on our specific dataset (i.e. our target sentiment analysis dataset). We have already discussed what happens when we add a new output layer on top of the frozen layers. Now, we just need to fine tune the new output layer using backpropagation to optimize the model for our particular target task. 

Now that you know the basics about transfer learning, let's move onto transformers.

## 3.2 What is BERT?
BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It is a transformer-based language model that was pre-trained on large corpora of unstructured text data. These pre-trained models enable us to conduct transfer learning on downstream tasks without starting from scratch. BERT has achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple NLP tasks and is widely adopted today. Here's a brief overview of the components of BERT architecture:



 1. Input Embeddings Layer: Consists of an embedding matrix that maps vocabulary indices to dense vectors of fixed size, known as embeddings. Each token is mapped to an embedding vector that captures its semantic meaning. 
 2. Hidden Layers: Composed of stacked transformer blocks that learn to represent the sentences in the form of contextualized word embeddings. 
 3. Output Layer: Takes the hidden states produced by the last transformer block and applies linear transformations followed by softmax to generate predicted probabilities for each label.


BERT combines advantages of two dominant strategies, namely self-attention and pretraining. Self-attention enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sentence during training and decoding time. Pretraining the model on large amounts of unlabeled text data helps it acquire robust and generic language understanding capabilities.
