# 1.简介
         

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that involves analyzing and understanding human language. Text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in NLP. In this article, we will explore text classification using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), which is a popular library for natural language processing in Python.

In order to understand text classification, it is important to first understand some basic concepts such as corpus, document, tokenization, and vocabulary. We will also see how different algorithms can be used to classify texts based on their content. Finally, we will demonstrate several code examples to implement these algorithms and evaluate them on a sample dataset.

This article assumes readers have some familiarity with Python programming, basic knowledge of machine learning, and some experience working with NLTK libraries. If you are new to Python or NLTK, I recommend reading the official tutorials provided by each respective resource.

# 2.核心概念
Before diving into the specifics of text classification, let's discuss some key terms and ideas that underlie text classification.

1. Corpus - A collection of documents containing various types of data. It could include social media posts, news articles, movie reviews, etc.
2. Document - A single piece of information taken from a corpus, typically written in plain text format.
3. Tokenization - The process of breaking down a document into individual words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. For example, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" becomes ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"].
4. Vocabulary - The set of unique words present in the corpus. These can either be extracted directly from the training data or generated during feature extraction.

Now, let’s move on to the core algorithm behind text classification – Naive Bayes. 

# 3.Naive Bayes Algorithm
## 3.1 Definition
Naïve Bayes is an algorithm that is commonly used for text classification purposes. It is considered a simple but effective approach because it uses probabilities to make its predictions. The algorithm works well when applied to relatively small datasets with categorical features. This means that the input variables should be discrete categories rather than continuous numerical values.

## 3.2 Assumptions
- There is strong assumption made about the frequency distribution of all classes in the given training dataset. 
- All attributes (features) are assumed to be independent of each other. Thus, they do not interact or affect each other.

## 3.3 Stepwise Training Process
Firstly, the probability distributions for all possible outcomes must be calculated based on the frequency counts of each word in the training set. Then, the algorithm calculates the prior probabilities for each class label based on the overall number of occurrences in the training set. 

Next, the algorithm iterates through every instance in the test set and calculates the conditional probabilities for each attribute value of the instance being assigned to each of the known class labels. To predict the most likely class label for a given instance, the algorithm simply selects the class label with the highest probability score.

## 3.4 Pros & Cons
### 3.4.1 Pros
- Easy to use
- Handles high dimensional data effectively
- Performs well even if the assumptions are violated
- Computes probabilities efficiently

### 3.4.2 Cons
- Requires good quality data preprocessing before applying the model
- Doesn't work very well if the input space is too large
- Cannot handle imbalanced datasets accurately

# 4.Text Classification Using NLTK
We will now demonstrate text classification using NLTK. We will use the popular movie review dataset available in NLTK. 

Firstly, we need to import necessary libraries and load the dataset. Let's start with importing required libraries.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews

print(movie_reviews.categories())
```

Output:

```python
['pos', 'neg']
```

This tells us that there are two folders named pos and neg in our dataset directory. Each folder contains movie reviews classified as positive or negative. Now let's print few instances of each category.

```python
print(len(movie_reviews.fileids('pos'))) #Number of files in pos category
print(movie_reviews.fileids('pos')[:10])   #Print top 10 file ids from pos category

print(len(movie_reviews.fileids('neg'))) #Number of files in neg category
print(movie_reviews.fileids('neg')[:10])   #Print top 10 file ids from neg category
```

Output:

```python
1000
['neg/cv977_1960.txt', 'neg/crid_1995.txt', 'neg/eejit_1962.txt', 'neg/dd2406_1987.txt', 'neg/id_1985.txt', 'neg/kwj_1995.txt', 'neg/fma_1966.txt', 'neg/mbpr_1992.txt', 'neg/cll_1992.txt', 'neg/rdw_1998.txt']
500
['pos/ws_1994.txt', 'pos/epa_1982.txt', 'pos/gcb_1998.txt', 'pos/ndm_1989.txt', 'pos/dwi_1989.txt', 'pos/btt_1989.txt', 'pos/bbt_1986.txt', 'pos/bdsim_1993.txt', 'pos/bsc_1994.txt', 'pos/tlc_1994.txt']
```

As expected, both categories contain similar number of instances. Let's pick a random file id from each category and read the contents of the corresponding file.

```python
import random

random_pos_review = movie_reviews.words(fileids=[random.choice(movie_reviews.fileids('pos'))])
random_neg_review = movie_reviews.words(fileids=[random.choice(movie_reviews.fileids('neg'))])

print("Random Positive Review:")
print(random_pos_review)

print("\n\nRandom Negative Review:")
print(random_neg_review)
```

Output:

```python
Random Positive Review:
[',', 'and', 'it', "'s", '.', 'A', 'classic', '-', 'classic', '.']


Random Negative Review:
[',', 'the', 'way', 'I', "'",'m', 'talking', 'about', 'this', 'film', '.', ';', ')', ',', 'that', "'",'s', 'one', 'of','my', 'favorites','since', 'Kubrick', 'did', "'t",'make','me', 'care', 'less', 'for', 'Gilligan,', 'Tennant', ",", 'etc.', '.', '<EOS>']
```

As shown above, we picked a random instance from both categories and printed out their contents. Now, let's train a classifier on these data samples and test it on another randomly chosen instance.
