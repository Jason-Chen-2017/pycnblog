As robots become increasingly capable and useful in schools, they will become the next generation of educators. They can transform education from a manual system to one where students are taught by machines. This transformation has the potential to revolutionize both curriculum design and pedagogy across the country. 

Today’s educators have been using many different teaching methods for decades, including lectures, group discussions, tests, assignments, projects, and interactive learning environments. However, as human-robot interactions increase and technologies become more advanced, it is clear that more attention needs to be paid to developing new techniques and tools for utilizing the best features of robotics in classrooms. In this article, we will discuss how educational robotics shaped our future vision of schools, with particular focus on what lies ahead for humanities and social sciences education in the US and globally.

Educational Robotics refers to the use of robots or artificial intelligence (AI) agents in education settings. It involves applying AI algorithms to simulate real-world tasks such as teaching, assessment, observation, diagnosis, and research, among other applications. There are several categories of educational robotics systems - teaching assistants, game-based learning platforms, mobile manipulators, automated instructional scaffolding, and virtual coaches. These various types of robotic systems have their own unique characteristics and functionalities but share some common principles and objectives. 

We will briefly introduce these concepts and terminology before diving deeper into educational robotics systems and explain how they fit into the larger picture of education technology development. 

1. Teaching Assistants: A teaching assistant, also known as TAs, is a type of educational robot designed to assist teachers with everyday activities such as marking assignments, grading exams, checking attendance, and providing feedback. These assistants often work together with humans to ensure that lessons go smoothly. Some examples include Pepper (Waveshare Inc.), Jane (NVIDIA Corporation), and Dexter (Samsung Electronics Co.). Teacher assistants serve as an important component in remote education and provide valuable assistance during real-time scenarios like online classes. 

2. Game-Based Learning Platforms: A game-based learning platform is another form of educational robot used to supplement traditional classroom teaching. Instead of relying solely on textbooks and worksheets, students interact with the environment and learn through playing games. Some examples include Star Wars VR, Microsoft Flight Simulator, RoboRecall, and Pac-Man Chase. These platforms aim to promote creativity and encourage active participation in learning activities. 

3. Mobile Manipulators: Mobile manipulators are a type of educational robot which allow students to manipulate objects around them, move along a workspace, and explore various learning resources. These maneuverable robots are particularly suitable for tasks requiring spatial reasoning and manipulation skills. Examples of mobile manipulators include Fetch (Stanford University), iCub (Queen Mary University of London), and ShadowHand (Imperial College London).

4. Automated Instructional Scaffolding: Another type of educational robot system falls under the category of automated instructional scaffolding. These systems provide an easy interface for teachers to create and modify lesson plans while simultaneously ensuring high-quality outcomes. An example of an automated instructional scaffolding system is Snap! (MIT), which provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating lessons based on pre-defined templates. 

5. Virtual Coaches: Virtual coaches are yet another type of educational robot system that focuses on personalized support and guidance for students during examination periods. These coaches leverage data analytics to identify areas of weakness and offer individualized solutions tailored to each student's strengths and needs. Examples of virtual coaches include Vizard (Eurecat Robotics), iPads for STEM Education (California Institute of Technology), and ResearchMaster (Stanford Healthcare).

In summary, educational robotics serves as an effective tool for augmenting the physical aspects of education by adding simulations and interactive components to replace human teachers. Within each of these categories, there are specific robotic systems that function differently depending on the application, making it essential to select the most appropriate system for the task at hand. Overall, edutainment robotics represents a significant advancement in education technology development, providing opportunities for educators to access new ways of interacting with students and the world around them.
