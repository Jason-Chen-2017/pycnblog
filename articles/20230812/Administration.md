# 1.简介
  

Administration是一个分布式配置中心，基于Spring Cloud开发，可用于微服务架构中的统一管理、配置管理等功能。

本文将主要从以下三个方面展开阐述：

1. Administration基本概念
2. Administration工作原理及运作机制
3. Administration功能特点与特性

# 2. 基本概念 
## 2.1 Spring Cloud Config
Spring Cloud Config是一个用来centralize configuration of applications across multiple environments which can be easily managed and accessed by other applications using a consistent view of the configurations stored in a git repository server like GitHub or GitLab. 

It provides following features:

1. Centralized Configuration Management: The configuration files are stored in a Git/SVN repository server that all team members have access to.
2. Dynamic Property Injection: Applications can get their configuration properties at runtime from the centralized configuration repository server.
3. DRY Principle: The same set of configuration properties is used throughout the application so there is no repetition of code.

Spring Cloud Config supports different backends for storing the configurations such as local file system, Git, SVN etc. In this article we will use the local file system backend but it's also possible to use other backends.

## 2.2 Distributed Systems Architecture
A distributed system architecture usually consists of several components communicating through a network. Each component has its own role and responsibilities within the whole system. Components communicate with each other to exchange data between them and achieve coordination among themselves. This communication takes place via messaging protocols such as HTTP or TCP/IP.

In our case, the Administration service needs to coordinate various microservices and manage their configurations centrally. It does so by integrating with the Spring Cloud Config Client library that connects to the Spring Cloud Config Server. To ensure that only authorized users can access the configurations, the Spring Security framework is used to restrict user access to specific endpoints.

The overall architecture of our Administration system would look something like this:


- `Config Server` - A centralized configuration management server where all the configuration files are stored. Config client libraries are integrated into each microservice to fetch their respective configurations.
- `Microservices` - Different microservices (e.g., Catalog, Orders, Customers, Shipping) running on separate instances of Tomcat or any other java web container. They communicate with each other via RESTful APIs and communicate with external services such as database systems and payment gateways.
- `User Interface` - Any interface that allows users to interact with the Administration service. For example, a web portal or an API gateway.

## 2.3 Microservices Architecture Patterns
There are many patterns available for developing microservices architectures, some of which include:

1. Microservices architecture pattern: This is one of the earliest established architectural patterns for building scalable and reliable software systems. It involves breaking down large monolithic applications into smaller independent modules called microservices. Communication between these microservices is done over lightweight message passing technologies such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.

2. Service registry pattern: This is another important architectural pattern that helps to register and locate microservices dynamically without requiring manual intervention. Consul, Netflix Eureka, and Zookeeper are popular service registries that work together with a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of microservices.

3. Circuit Breaker pattern: This is a design pattern that prevents cascading failures and recoveries when errors occur in downstream microservices. By implementing circuit breakers, you can prevent your microservices from being overwhelmed with requests if one or more fail repeatedly due to network issues, timeouts, or other types of problems.

4. Event driven architecture pattern: This is a way of decoupling microservices by triggering events based on certain conditions rather than performing synchronous operations. Events trigger other microservices' actions based on those triggers. For example, if a new order is placed, an event can be triggered to send out notifications to customers and add items to shopping carts.

Overall, microservices architecture is growing rapidly, and adopting common patterns such as these help to create robust and scalable systems that meet the demands of modern businesses.
