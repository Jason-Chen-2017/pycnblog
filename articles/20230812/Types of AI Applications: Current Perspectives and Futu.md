# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence is a field that involves designing computer systems capable of understanding or acting like humans. It emphasizes on creating machines that can learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. Today, AI has become increasingly more advanced than ever before, thanks to the advancements in machine learning and deep learning techniques. Research and development efforts are focused on building AI systems that can perform tasks that are challenging for traditional computers. The main components of an AI system include input, processing unit, memory, output, and sensorics. Input includes sensory inputs such as vision, hearing, touch, and taste. Processing units manipulate digital information by interpreting it and using it to produce outputs. Memory stores data and instructions for the processing units to use when needed. Output provides feedback or results generated by the system. Sensorics helps capture physical activities and events that occur within the environment. There are several subfields within AI such as cognitive science, natural language processing, robotics, and artificial neural networks which interact with one another to achieve complex behaviors.

## Types of AI Applications
Now let's dive into the details about each type of AI Application.

Answers provided by question answering systems often range from simple yes/no answers to complex mathematical formulas and calculations. An example of a question answering system is Google's search engine. 

7. **Machine Translation** - Machine translation is the process of translating text from one language to another. It is widely used in online services, mobile apps, and print publications. Some of the most common machine translation tools include Google Translate and Bing Translator.

# 3.Core Algorithms and Operations
Each AI Application has its own core algorithmic approach or operations that work to solve specific problems or functions. For instance, natural language processing systems employ various algorithms such as tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and semantic role labelling to extract meaning from user input. Similarly, image analysis systems employ algorithms such as object detection, face recognition, and scene classification to identify objects and faces in images. Each type of AI application requires unique expertise and skills to implement its solution. Therefore, there is no single set of rules to follow for implementing any given AI Application. Nevertheless, here are some general guidelines on how to apply AI Technologies to real-world scenarios.

### Prerequisites
Before diving into each type of AI Application, it is essential to review some basic principles and concepts that must be understood before attempting to build solutions. Here are some prerequisite concepts that should be reviewed before delving deeper into each AI Application:

1. Data Science - Data science is the practice of extracting valuable insights from raw data. It combines statistical methods, programming languages, and modeling techniques to transform raw data into meaningful insights and predictions. Without accurate data, AI solutions may not be effective. Various data sources exist throughout the world such as databases, spreadsheets, IoT devices, sensors, and social media posts. Achieving reliable data collection is crucial to developing robust AI models.

2. Statistics - Statistical analysis is fundamental to AI development because it allows us to test hypotheses, evaluate model performance, and make predictions based on existing data. Statistical approaches include regression, correlation, clustering, and hypothesis testing. Understanding these fundamentals will greatly enhance your understanding of AI applications.

3. Deep Learning and Neural Networks - Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to train models on complex datasets. The power of deep learning lies in its ability to automate feature extraction and optimization through training on massive amounts of data. Developing deep learning models requires specialized hardware, extensive computational resources, and a well-organized network architecture. Common neural network architectures include convolutional, recurrent, and transformer networks. Each type of AI Application requires different levels of proficiency in deep learning and neural networks to be successful.

Let's now move onto exploring each type of AI Application in detail.

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
#### Introduction
The first step in enabling natural language processing in our AI systems is to acquire annotated corpora or text collections containing relevant information. Annotated data is necessary so that the system knows what kind of terms and phrases to look out for while analyzing user input. Additionally, labeled data ensures that the system can effectively train itself on known facts and inferential relationships between them. Once we have collected our dataset, we can start analyzing it using various natural language processing techniques. These techniques involve breaking down sentences into smaller chunks called tokens, determining the grammatical structure of each word, and disambiguating ambiguous words or phrases. Over time, the system learns to recognize patterns and identify useful entities, leading to better accuracy and efficiency over time. Below are the core steps involved in building a natural language processing system:

1. Corpus Collection and Preprocessing - Collecting a sufficient corpus size for our system can take up a considerable amount of time and effort. Before annotating our data, we need to preprocess it by cleaning the text by removing stopwords, punctuations, and special characters. Then we can split our dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Feature Extraction - To feed our data into the system, we need to represent it in a numerical format. We can do this using bag-of-words, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), or word embeddings. TFIDF represents each word as a vector based on its frequency across all documents. Word embeddings are learned representations of words that capture contextual and syntactic similarity. We typically choose either TFIDF or word embeddings depending on the scale of our problem. 
3. Model Training - After preprocessing our data, we can begin training our model on our labeled data. During training, the system adjusts its weights based on the error rate produced during validation. Validation tests ensure that our model does not overfit to our training data and can generalize well to new data. We can tune hyperparameters to optimize our model's performance.
4. Inference and Evaluation - Once our model is trained, we can use it to generate predictions on new data. However, we want to ensure that our model is actually making helpful predictions. We can measure the performance of our model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and ROUGE score. 

Here is a sample code snippet illustrating how to build a natural language processing system using Python's NLTK library:

```python
import nltk
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, confusion_matrix

nltk.download('punkt') # download required package if not already present
nltk.download('stopwords') # download required package if not already present

# load data
train = [...] # list of tuples containing (label, sentence) pairs for training
test = [...] # list of tuples containing (label, sentence) pairs for testing

# tokenize sentences and remove stopwords
tokenizer = nltk.RegexpTokenizer(r'\w+')
stop_words = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')

def tokenize(sentence):
    return [token.lower() for token in tokenizer.tokenize(sentence) if token.lower() not in stop_words]

X_train = [' '.join(tokenize(sentence)) for _, sentence in train]
y_train = [label for label, _ in train]

X_test = [' '.join(tokenize(sentence)) for _, sentence in test]
y_test = [label for label, _ in test]

# create TFIDF vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# train Naive Bayes classifier
clf = MultinomialNB().fit(X_train, y_train)

# make predictions and compute metrics
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = sum([int(prediction == truth) for prediction, truth in zip(predictions, y_test)]) / len(y_test)
macro_f1 = f1_score(y_test, predictions, average='macro')
confusion_mat = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Macro F1 Score:", macro_f1)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_mat)
```

In summary, natural language processing is an important technique in AI since it supports numerous applications in various fields such as customer service, product recommendation, and dialogue management. By leveraging modern statistical and machine learning techniques, we can develop highly accurate natural language processing systems that can effectively handle complex language interactions.
