Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing where a given text needs to be tagged with its corresponding named entities based on predefined categories or types of words. These entities include persons, locations, organizations, dates, times, quantities, etc., which have specific meanings or functionalities within a sentence or document. The most commonly used NER tools are part-of-speech taggers and chunkers, but they cannot identify all types of named entities accurately due to various reasons such as ambiguity, overlaps between different words/phrases, and lexical variations. Therefore, machine learning techniques have been widely adopted to improve the accuracy of NER systems by training them using large annotated data sets. 

In this article, we will explore some popular machine learning models for NER tasks and compare their performances. We will start by discussing what is an NER problem, followed by defining basic concepts such as features, labels, and evaluation metrics. Then, we will introduce four common algorithms for NER problems - logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and SVM. Next, we will explain how each algorithm works behind the scenes and apply it to a sample dataset to see if our model can correctly recognize the named entities. Finally, we will conclude this section by comparing the performances of the algorithms and suggesting future research directions.

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
## What is Named Entity Recognition?
Named entity recognition (NER) is a challenging natural language processing task that involves classifying words from sentences into pre-defined categories such as people names, locations, organization names, and so on. It has applications in many fields including information retrieval, question answering, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and automatic summarization. Within NLP, there are two main subtasks involved in performing NER - token classification and sequence labeling.

Token classification refers to assigning each word in a sentence a particular label or category based on its syntactic characteristics such as whether it is a noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, determiner, etc. Sequence labeling assigns entire phrases or sequences to one of more predefined categories depending on their semantic meaning. For example, "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii" could be assigned to PERSON -> LOCATION -> DATE. On the other hand, "I went to the park yesterday" could be assigned to PRONOUN -> VERB -> NOUN -> ADVERBIAL TIME INDICATOR. 

However, token classification suffers from issues related to ambiguities, overlapping tokens, and varying linguistic contexts. A better approach is to use supervised learning methods like deep neural networks to train the classifier on labeled data sets consisting of both texts and tags indicating the named entities present in the text. This process requires converting the raw text into a numeric representation of its constituent parts called features. Features can come from different sources such as unigram, bigram, trigram, character n-grams, dependency parsing, and contextual embeddings. Each feature maps a string of characters to a numerical value representing its properties such as frequency, presence of certain words, co-occurrence with other features, etc.

Once the features are extracted, we need to define the set of possible labels, which represents the set of categories that can be predicted by the model. Commonly used labels include PERSON, ORG, GPE, LOC, MONEY, DATE, TIME, PERCENT, QUANTITY, FACILITY, CARDINAL, NORP, LAW, PRODUCT, EVENT, LANGUAGE, WORK_OF_ART, WORK_OF_ART, LAW. Other special classes such as O (which stands for out-of-scope) are also often included to handle unknown tokens or any miscellaneous elements not covered by the standard set. Once the features and labels are defined, we can proceed to split the dataset into training and testing subsets and train the model using gradient descent optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam optimizer.

During inference time, the model takes a piece of input text and produces a probability distribution over the possible labels for that text. Based on this distribution, we can assign each token a predicted label or choose the most probable one based on the threshold criterion. If the prediction meets the expected level of confidence, then we consider the prediction successful; otherwise, we discard it. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy can help us measure the quality of the model's predictions. To increase the robustness of the system, we can deploy multiple instances of the same model and combine their outputs using majority voting or averaging strategies to reduce the impact of individual errors.

Overall, named entity recognition is a complex problem that requires a combination of statistical and computational approaches. Despite advances in technology and computing power, it remains a difficult task due to the variability in natural language syntax and semantics. Nonetheless, the success of modern machine learning models such as transformer-based architectures has led to significant improvements in NER performance, making it a worthy topic for further study.
