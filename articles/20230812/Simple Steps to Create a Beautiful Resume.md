Beautiful resume is an important piece of work in the hiring process for job seekers and recruiters alike. A well-designed resume can help improve your chances at getting noticed by potential employers and making you stand out amongst other candidates. In this article, we will discuss about what makes a great resume and how to create one that stands out from the crowd.

The first step towards creating a beautiful resume is deciding on its purpose. This means understanding why someone would want to apply for a particular position or fill a specific role. The objective behind designing a resume should be clear and concise. People looking for a job may only have a vague idea of what they are looking for, so it's essential to clarify exactly what the candidate wants before they start writing. For example: "Looking for a senior software engineer with experience in web development, experienced in working in teams, and eager to learn new technologies." These objectives must be clearly stated at the beginning of the resume. Otherwise, candidates might get lost and waste their time unnecessarily. Once these objectives are understood, the next step involves writing key skills that match those requirements and presenting them logically. Key skills include technical abilities such as programming languages, databases, frameworks, tools, etc., as well as soft skills like communication, problem-solving, teamwork, etc. By providing candidates with relevant information and experiences, the resume can establish credibility and build rapport with potential employers. 

In the second stage, the resume should also feature personal details such as name, contact information, education qualifications, professional achievements, volunteer experiences, extracurricular activities, and any additional relevant information. Personal details play an integral role in showing off your personality and credentials. Employers often look for candidates who are confident, enthusiastic, and polite. So, make sure to demonstrate all of these traits through your resume. You can add social media links, website URLs, and certifications to showcase your expertise further. Here is an example of a basic format for a resume:
