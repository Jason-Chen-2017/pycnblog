Digitalization has revolutionized the way healthcare organizations work by enabling more efficient operations, better patient outcomes, and a lower cost to care. However, it also creates new challenges in terms of safety, security, privacy, data protection, compliance with regulations, and economic viability. Therefore, integrating digital health systems into clinical practice is essential to ensure optimal patient outcomes while protecting patients’ personal information and minimizing risks associated with technology use. In recent years, various digital health solutions have been developed, but they are often isolated from each other and do not offer seamless integration across the organizational structure or improve coordination between departments within an organization. 


To address these issues, we propose developing an integrated digital health and care management system that brings together multiple digital components across different domains such as EMRs (Electronic Medical Records), physician portal, quality monitoring, analytics tools, decision support tools, and communication channels. The system will provide a central repository for all patient data, enable secure access control based on individual roles, implement high-level data sharing among institutional partners, integrate risk management measures, and enhance patient engagement through automated notifications and messaging. We believe this approach can significantly increase overall efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness in managing clinical resources and improving patient safety, satisfaction, and wellbeing. 


In addition, the proposed system should consider how best to leverage existing IT infrastructure to optimize its functionality, reduce costs, and minimize downtime. It should be designed to operate efficiently in remote offices and locations where traditional facilities cannot afford the necessary bandwidth capacity. Moreover, the system must be able to handle the massive amounts of data generated by medical devices and sensors. Finally, it should be optimized for both human and machine processing speeds, even when dealing with large datasets.

Before diving deeper into technical details of the proposed solution, let us first briefly define some key concepts and terms used throughout the article:



1. EHR( electronic health record): An electronic version of the paper-based medical records created using computer software applications. Electronic health records contain detailed information about patient's medical history, physical examination results, diagnosis, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. They are typically stored electronically on a server accessible to authorized personnel only. Commonly used EHR platforms include Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and Community Health Informatics Resources (CHIR).


2. PHR( personal health record): A digital file containing the personal information of individuals who receive primary care. This includes demographics, family history, medications taken, lab results, dental history, cholesterol levels, surgery history, vital signs, hospitalizations, disabilities, etc. Personal health records are collected, stored, and managed by healthcare providers, insurers, and payers. PHRs are typically stored electronically on cloud servers accessed via online portals or mobile apps. 


3. FHIR(Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources): A standardized interchange format for exchanging healthcare information electronically between healthcare applications and services. It defines a set of rules and formats that cover commonly shared elements such as Patient, Encounter, Observation, Condition, MedicationRequest, etc., enabling consistent data exchange across multiple jurisdictions and technologies.


4. API(Application Programming Interface): A set of protocols, routines, and tools that allow developers to develop applications without having to know all underlying implementation details. APIs help connect different applications, data sources, and third party services. Common uses of APIs include accessing medical imaging databases, payment gateways, and weather forecasting services.


5. SMART on FHIR( standards-based mutual trust framework on FHIR): An open source project that aims to establish trust between healthcare applications and healthcare professionals around the world by implementing a common set of protocols and guidelines for sharing medical data over the internet. SMART on FHIR provides secure authentication mechanisms, data access controls, audit logs, and reporting capabilities.


6. AI( artificial intelligence): A computational technique that mimics the behavior of human intelligence and enables machines to perform tasks that require advanced knowledge and expertise. Artificial intelligence is widely used in fields including robotics, image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.

7. IoT( Internet of Things): A network of connected devices that collect and transmit data at various scales, ranging from small scale consumer products to large industrial networks. Within the context of healthcare, IoT is increasingly being adopted to monitor patient vitals, manage clinical workflows, track and analyze medical data, predict disease progression, and automate diagnostic tests.

8. HL7(Health Level Seven International): A global industry association that promotes interoperable standards for healthcare information exchange. It defines several core message sets, including QUESTIONNAIRE, ORU (OBSERVATION RESULTS UPDATE), RSP (RESPONSE TO APPOINTMENT), and etc., which are critical for building an integrated digital health ecosystem.


9. OpenID Connect(OpenIDConnect): A simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows users to log in to multiple websites using a single account, ensuring consistency of user experience and reducing the need for usernames and passwords.


10. PCI DSS(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): A set of requirements established by Payment Card Industry that establishes a level of security and privacy protection for cardholder data. It includes security controls such as encryption, secure storage, firewalls, intrusion detection, logging, backups, and others.
