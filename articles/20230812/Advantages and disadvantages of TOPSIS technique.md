# 1.简介
  

The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method used in multicriteria decision-making. It has been widely adopted as an effective method for achieving better solutions than other alternatives available within the same set of criteria based on trade-off between different objectives. The method involves calculating a weighted score to each alternative that represents its degree of similarity to the ideal solution (best alternative). Different approaches have been developed to calculate the weights which vary according to the nature of the problem, such as normalization or Vikor metric approach. In this article, we will briefly discuss some advantages and disadvantages of using TOPSIS technique in multi-criteria decision making. 

# 2.背景介绍
Multi-criteria decision-making is widely known as one of the most important techniques used in modern decision-making processes. Multi-criteria problems refer to problems where multiple criteria are considered simultaneously in order to select the best option out of several possible alternatives. These problems can be classified into two types: criteria-based problems and objective-based problems. Criteria-based problems involve selecting the best options from among a group of choices based on specific criteria while considering their relative importance. Objective-based problems seek to optimize a given objective function across all the attributes involved in the decision process. Examples include business decisions involving profit, cost, revenue, quality, etc., manufacturing planning problems with raw materials selection, project scheduling optimization, medical diagnosis, etc.

One of the most popular methods for solving multi-criteria decision-making problems is called the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), also known as Sawman rank method. TOPSIS is one of the oldest and most commonly used multi-criteria decision-making method. In recent years, it has emerged as an effective and reliable method for dealing with complex decision-making problems. Many researchers, developers, and companies use TOPSIS to develop more robust decision support systems. This makes it an essential skill for anyone working in the field of software development, data science, and information technology.

In this article, we will focus on discussing the main ideas behind TOPSIS, how it works, what are its advantages and limitations, and finally demonstrate its usage on various examples to illustrate its practical utility. We hope that you find this article informative and useful. Let’s get started!

# 3.Basic concepts and terminology 
## 3.1 Types of multi-criteria decision-making problems
Criteria-based problems involve evaluating a variety of criteria to determine the preferred choice. They usually include ranking alternatives against a number of criteria. Some examples of criteria-based decision problems include sales promotion, product design, system configuration, routing, recommendation systems, and resource allocation. On the other hand, objective-based problems seek to maximize an objective function over a range of variables without any particular concern for individual criteria. Common objective-based problems include transportation routing, pricing optimization, inventory management, supply chain management, forecasting models, and asset allocation. Objectives may take the form of maximum profit, minimum loss, reduced carbon footprint, increased customer satisfaction, increased sales volume, higher work efficiency, faster delivery times, lower costs, or improved staff morale. The goal of both types of problems is to identify the optimal combination of inputs that maximizes some desired outcome. 

To solve multi-criteria decision-making problems, one typically uses a decision matrix containing numerical values representing the strength of each criterion applied to each alternative. Each row corresponds to an alternative, and each column corresponds to a criterion. An ideal solution would assign scores to every alternative along each dimension based solely on its merits alone; however, in practice, this is often not feasible due to conflicting constraints or subjective preferences. Therefore, the TOPSIS technique calculates a weighted sum of the deviations from the ideal solution to evaluate each alternative's preference. 

## 3.2 TOPSIS scoring mechanism 
The TOPSIS scoring mechanism starts by defining three ideal outcomes, or reference points, which represent the optimum performance of each criterion. For example, if there are three criteria A, B, and C, we might choose the following reference point configurations: 
 - Ideal Best  
  - A = 1
  - B = 1 
  - C = 1
 - Ideal Worst  
  - A = 0 
  - B = 0
  - C = 0  
 - Zero Sum  
In this case, A is perfectly preferred above average, followed by B and then C. Alternatively, we could define additional negative reference points in cases where one criterion dominates another, giving rise to anti-ideal outcomes. Another common approach is to randomly generate reference points, ensuring that they do not violate any constraints or preferences specified in the problem statement.  

Once we have defined our reference points, we need to compute the distances between each alternative and these reference points. The distance measure depends on the scale of the criteria and whether or not the minimization or maximization of each criterion is required. One common approach is to normalize the values so that they fall between zero and one, where zero indicates a perfect match with the reference point and one indicates a complete violation of the reference point. Alternatively, we could use a different scaling factor that takes into account any non-linearities or dependencies present in the data. Once we have computed the distances, we apply weight factors to each criterion to determine its contribution to the total distance. Weights are usually determined heuristically based on expert judgment or on mathematical optimization procedures like linear programming or genetic algorithms.

Finally, we multiply each distance by its corresponding weight and add up the results to obtain a weighted score for each alternative. Depending on the sign of the weight assigned to each criterion, the resulting scores can indicate either preference for a high value of the criterion, low value, or neutral preference. Alternatives whose scores are closest to the positive reference point are preferred first, whereas those who exceed it are preferred second. If there are ties, those who satisfy all criteria are identified as having equal rankings.

# 5.Practical Applications
Here are a few practical scenarios where TOPSIS technique is applicable:

1. Multiple supplier selection in industrial setting : Suppose a company sells products to multiple suppliers. To decide which supplier to purchase from, the company needs to consider various parameters including price, quality, service level, shipping time, etc. However, these parameters are likely to vary greatly among suppliers, hence requiring a multi-criteria decision making procedure. TOPSIS technique can help the company make an informed decision by assigning weights to each parameter and identifying the top suppliers based on their combined scores. 

2. Planning energy consumption : Energy consumption is critical to building industry. As perceived in literature, the cleanest way to reduce energy consumption is through proper load balancing. However, load balancing relies heavily on accurate metering and monitoring mechanisms, which cannot always guarantee near perfect accuracy. Hence, implementing a holistic energy planning framework requires combining multiple sources of data, ranging from weather patterns to electricity prices, and analyzing them to come up with an optimized plan. TOPSIS technique provides a powerful tool to compare and prioritize different potential plans by comparing their corresponding scores. 

3. Customer segmentation : Segmenting customers into different categories based on demographic, behavioral, and psychographic factors requires a multi-criteria approach that considers relevant metrics such as income, purchasing history, loan status, and job title. TOPSIS technique can be used to efficiently classify customers into meaningful segments based on their preferences, thus enabling market targeting and personalized offers. 

4. Product design : Manufacturers must balance several concerns when designing products. Designing features that appeal to the target audience, sustainability aspects, consumer demand, usability requirements, environmental impacts, and product dimensions. TOPSIS technique helps manufacturers analyze the relative priority of these issues, and recommend appropriate design decisions that reflect the overall priorities.
