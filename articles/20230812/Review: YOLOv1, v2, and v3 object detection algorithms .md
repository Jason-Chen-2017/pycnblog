从图像识别任务角度看，早期的目标检测方法通常由两步组成：第一步为分类器，将候选区域划分为若干类别；第二步为回归器，根据候选区域在各个位置上的形状大小、位置偏移量等信息确定物体边界框。因此，可以将目标检测分为两个子任务：分类和回归。分类器主要用于对目标进行分类，如物体的类型、人脸的种类等；而回归器则用于给出目标的精确位置，包括目标中心坐标、宽高比例等。
现有的目标检测算法大致可分为两大类：基于锚框的单发检测器和基于深度学习的多发检测器。其中，基于锚框的检测器特别简单，结构清晰，检测速度较快，但准确率不足；而基于深度学习的检测器通常采用全卷积网络（FCN）或卷积神经网络（CNN）进行特征提取，引入更丰富的上下文信息，可检测出各种复杂的目标，但需要较长的训练时间。近年来，随着计算机视觉技术的发展，基于深度学习的目标检测算法也越来越火热。
YOLO是一个典型的基于锚框的检测器，它利用单独预测边界框和置信度的特征层直接预测所有候选目标的类别和相对于其的中心位置。目前，最新的YOLOv3版本，即YOLO9000，已经可以在多个数据集上取得state-of-the-art的结果。
YOLO的网络结构如下图所示。该网络由三部分组成：前端网络（Darknet-53），输出为7×7x1024的特征层；YOLO前景网络（YOLO-FPN），将输出的特征层通过不同尺寸的卷积核转换为置信值和预测框；YOLO头部网络（YOLO-Head），将YOLO-FPN的输出经过最终的线性激活函数和softmax运算得到类别预测和置信度得分，进一步得到真实的边界框。

## 3.1 Introduction to YOLO 
The basic idea of YOLO is to detect objects in an image using a single deep neural network that can both predict where the objects are located and what those objects are by looking at the whole image only once. The first version of the algorithm was implemented by Yunho Choi et al.[1] in 2015 and has since become one of the most popular models for object detection tasks due to its efficiency and accuracy on a wide range of datasets. Therefore, we will briefly discuss the key features of this model before going into the details of each component. We also provide some analysis of the performance and limitations of the model when it comes to small objects or occlusions.

### Basic Features 
Firstly, let’s review the main components of the YOLO model:

1. Feature extractor: A convolutional neural network (CNN) like Darknet [2], which takes an input image as well as a set of hyperparameters specifying how many layers to use, filters size, strides, and activation functions, generates feature maps at different spatial scales. These feature maps help us extract useful information from our images such as edges, textures, shapes, etc., which is used later by our detector head. 

2. Region proposal module: The region proposal module proposes a set of candidate bounding boxes (regions) around potential object instances within the given image. This module can be broken down into two sub-components - Selective Search and non-maximal suppression.

a. Selective Search: In order to propose good quality regions, we utilize the fact that the visual appearance of objects is invariant to translation, scaling, rotation, and illumination changes. Thus, we can generate initial regions based on histograms of color distributions across various parts of the image with varying sizes. Based on these histograms, the algorithm generates a ranked list of likely object locations. To handle cluttered scenes, we merge nearby regions together and eliminate duplicate or redundant ones using graph theory techniques. 

b. Non-Maximal Suppression: After generating all possible regions, we apply non-maximal suppression (NMS) to select a subset of them that have high intersection-over-union (IOU) overlap with respect to any other proposed region. NMS eliminates overlapping or duplicate regions so that only distinct areas of the image contain valid proposals. 

3. Object Detection Module: Finally, after passing through our fully connected layer and softmax output, our detector head produces a probability distribution over each class label indicating the likelihood of a detected instance belonging to that particular class. Additionally, the predicted offsets along the x and y axes indicate the distance between the center point of the bounding box and the actual location of the target instance inside the grid cell. Given the estimated bounding box coordinates and dimensions, we can compute the precise position of the target instance in the original image.

Overall, the overall pipeline looks something like this:

Input Image -> Preprocess Input Image -> Extract Features -> Propose Regions -> Run Detector Head

We can now move onto discussing specific implementation details and improvements made to this model.

### Improvements Made to Original Model
As mentioned earlier, the first version of the YOLO model had several issues. One notable issue is that it did not scale very well to larger images due to its reliance on fixed sized feature maps. Another limitation is that it performed poorly on smaller objects because it struggled to capture their fine structures and local features. To address these issues, several modifications were made to the architecture of the model:

1. Better anchor selection strategy: Instead of relying solely on edge, corner, or foreground patches, we introduced the concept of anchors. Anchors represent predetermined regions within the feature map, which are associated with certain object classes. By selecting appropriate sets of anchors, we can force our model to learn more robust representations of objects regardless of their size or placement in the image.

2. Fine-tuning convolutional parameters: Since we know that some convolutional filters might be better suited for detecting certain types of objects than others, we fine-tuned the convolutional weights during training to optimize the objective function. For example, we may increase the receptive field of filters designed for detecting tall buildings or narrow streets, whereas decrease the receptive field of filters designed for detecting small objects or background noise.

3. Multi-scale prediction: Unlike traditional models that train on a single resolution, YOLO learns to perform detection on multiple scales. This allows our model to adapt to different object sizes without requiring separate networks for each size.

In summary, while there were numerous improvements made to the original model, the core principle of using a CNN for object detection still remains intact today. Despite these advances, newer versions of the model still enjoy significant popularity among researchers and developers alike, especially in comparison to traditional computer vision applications like face recognition and object tracking.
