Linear regression is a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning that allows us to make predictions based on continuous variables. The normal equation, also known as the least squares method, is an efficient way to estimate the parameters of linear models by solving a system of linear equations. 

In this article, we will discuss how to use the normal equation to solve linear regression problems efficiently. We'll start with the basic concepts such as matrix operations and gradient descent optimization algorithm before diving into the details of using the normal equation for linear regression.

Before moving forward, let's clarify some key terms:

1. Feature vector (X): A row-vector representing the input data points. Each element represents one feature value. For example, if we have two features (x1, x2), then X could be written as [x1, x2]. 

2. Target variable (y): A column-vector representing the output values corresponding to each input point. It can either be numerical or categorical.

3. Weight vector (w): A column-vector containing weights assigned to each feature when making predictions. In other words, it determines the degree to which each feature contributes to the predicted outcome.

4. Loss function (J): A measure of the error between the predicted outputs (h) and actual targets (y). It takes into account both the difference between h and y and the distance between them from their minimum possible value. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Huber loss function, and logarithmic loss function.

Now let's dive right into the article!
# 2.Background Introduction
## What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to establish relationships between a set of independent variables (features) and a single dependent variable (target variable) through a line of best fit. Essentially, it finds out the optimum relationship between the inputs and outputs so that future observations can be accurately predicted. Linear regression has many practical applications in fields like finance, marketing, healthcare, physics, and biology among others. 

Linear regression involves finding a straight line that fits the given dataset most closely. Mathematically speaking, it uses simple linear algebra to find the best-fitting coefficients that minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual outcomes. This means that the model predicts the target variable as a weighted combination of the input features. 


The formula for calculating the weight vector (w) using the normal equation is:

$$\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty $$

Where theta is the estimated parameter vector (coefficients) that minimizes the cost function J. The inverse of the XtX matrix represents the correlation coefficient between the input features and its transpose multiplied by the target variable y. By multiplying the inverse of XtX matrix with X and y, we obtain the optimal solution to our problem.

## Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithm
Gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm used to find the local minimum of a function. In linear regression, it is commonly used to optimize the cost function J by updating the weights w iteratively until convergence. The general process involves starting with random initial values for w and gradually reducing the magnitude of the gradients at each step until we reach the global minimum. Here are the steps involved in gradient descent optimization:

1. Start with an initial guess for the weight vector w.

2. Calculate the prediction h = Xw.

3. Calculate the gradient g of the cost function J relative to w:
- To calculate the derivative of J relative to w with respect to all elements of w, we need to take the partial derivatives of each term inside the cost function J with respect to each individual weight w[i], where i ranges from 1 to p (the number of features).

- Since there are multiple examples (data points), we need to compute the average gradient across these examples. Therefore, instead of taking the derivative directly, we use the chain rule to compute the total gradient of the cost function J with respect to all weights w:

$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial w_j} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h^{(i)} - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} $

Where m is the number of training examples, h is the predicted value, y is the true label, and j ranges from 1 to p. This gives us the gradient of the cost function J with respect to each individual weight w[j].

4. Update the weight vector w by subtracting a small fraction alpha times the gradient g from w:

$ w := w - \alpha * \nabla_{\beta} J(\beta)$

Alpha controls the size of the update. The higher the value of alpha, the faster the algorithm converges to the optimal solution.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence.

Once we have found the optimal weight vector w, we can use it to make predictions on new unseen data.
