Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the most popular NLP tasks used for analyzing unstructured text data such as social media posts or customer feedback comments. It helps companies to understand the underlying topics discussed by their customers or employees or conveys insights about trends and patterns across different sectors. Identifying accurate and complete information from raw texts is essential in many applications, including marketing, financial analysis, and research. 

One of the widely used libraries for building NER systems is Spacy. In this tutorial, I will explain step-by-step on how you can use spaCy to develop a Named Entity Recognition model that identifies and classifies various types of entities like persons, organizations, locations, etc., in a given textual input. 

Before diving into the details, let me give an overview of what exactly does it mean to identify entities? In general, identifying entities refers to the process of extracting meaningful phrases from natural language text and assigning them appropriate tags based on their semantic meaning. These entities include but are not limited to: Persons, Organizations, Locations, Time Periods, Quantities, Products, Events, Languages, Diseases, and much more. 

For example, in the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", the following entities could be identified:

 - The quick brown fox (a location).
 - Jumps (an event).
 - Lazy dog (a person).
 
Therefore, detecting these entities accurately requires some kind of machine learning algorithm. With deep learning techniques, algorithms have been developed to automatically recognize named entities, which can help us save time and resources while working with large volumes of textual data.

Now let’s move forward and get started!

# 2.Basic concepts & terminologies
Let's define some basic terms and concepts that will be helpful when we work with named entity recognition systems. 

1. Tokenization
Tokenization is the task of breaking down a text into individual words or sentences called tokens. Tokens are the smallest possible units of text that make up a larger chunk of text such as paragraphs, articles, or sentences. 

2. Tagging
Tagging is the process of labelling each token according to its syntactic role within the sentence. For instance, “New York” might be tagged as a city name whereas “Apple” might be tagged as a company name. Different tags refer to different types of entities like PERSON, ORGANIZATION, DATE, LOCATION, MONEY, EMAIL ADDRESS, etc. Each tag has its own unique identifier assigned to it by the corresponding Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) corpus. 

3. Entities
Entities are defined as a sequence of consecutive tokens that share common characteristics and are grouped together based on their roles within the text. Examples of entities include persons, organizations, locations, times, quantities, products, events, and so on.

4. Training dataset
A training dataset consists of labeled examples of text containing named entities alongside their respective tags. The goal is to train a machine learning model to recognize new instances of the same entities in unseen text without having to manually label every single instance of the entity. 

5. Testing dataset
A testing dataset contains text that the trained model has not seen before and needs to be evaluated against. We compare the predicted output from our model with the true labels provided in the test set to assess the performance of the model.

# 3.Core algorithm and implementation steps
Now, let's dive deeper into the core algorithm behind named entity recognition systems, which uses conditional random fields (CRFs) to determine the optimal sequence of tags for each word in a sentence. CRFs are probabilistic graphical models that can represent complex relationships between variables through potential functions. They are often used for tagging sequences of words, such as part-of-speech tags in natural language processing. Here are the main steps involved in building a NER system using spaCy library:

1. Install spaCy: Firstly, we need to install the spaCy library in our environment if it is not already installed. You can install spaCy using pip command `pip install spacy`. Once installation is completed, import the necessary libraries by running the code below.

 ```python
import spacy
from spacy import displacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
```
Here, we load the English pipeline 'en_core_web_sm' which includes several pre-trained statistical models for English language. After loading the pipeline, we initialize the nlp object.

2. Load the dataset: Next, we should load our dataset. A good way to start would be to download a sample dataset from https://github.com/davidadamojr/spaCy_NamedEntityRecognition. Alternatively, you can create your own dataset containing text samples with labeled named entities. Here's the code snippet to read the CSV file and store the contents in a pandas dataframe.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("sample_data.csv")
print(df.head())
```
This displays the first five rows of the DataFrame. We assume that the dataset is stored in a csv format where the columns contain two headers i.e. "text" and "label". The "text" column stores the text snippets and the "label" column stores the annotated named entities.

3. Preprocess the data: Before feeding the text snippets into the model, we preprocess the text by removing any unnecessary characters or stopwords. Additionally, we tokenize the text into words and assign appropriate parts of speech tags to each word. Here's the code snippet to perform preprocessing:

```python
def preprocess(text):
    doc = nlp(text) # Load the text into spaCy
    clean_tokens = []
    
    for token in doc:
        if len(token.text)>1 and token.pos_!="PUNCT":
            clean_tokens.append(token.lower_)
            
    return clean_tokens
```
This function takes in the text string and returns a list of cleaned tokens ready for further processing.

4. Train the model: To train the model, we pass the cleaned tokens along with their corresponding labels to the `update` method of the `pipe` component inside the `nlp` object. The update method updates the model parameters based on the current batch of annotations. Here's the code snippet to train the model:

```python
ner = nlp.create_pipe("ner") # Create a named entity recognizer pipe
for _, annotation in df.iterrows():
    for ent in annotation['label']:
        ner.add_label(ent)
        
nlp.add_pipe(ner) # Add the named entity recognizer to the pipeline
optimizer = nlp.begin_training() # Start training the model

other_pipes = [pipe for pipe in nlp.pipe_names if pipe!= "ner"]
with nlp.disable_pipes(*other_pipes): 
    sizes = compounding(1.0, 4.0, 1.001) # Set hyperparameters for the optimizer
    for itn in range(10):
        print("Iteration:",itn)
        
        batches = minibatch(train_data, size=sizes)
        losses = {}
        for batch in batches:
            texts, annotations = zip(*batch)
            docs = nlp.tokenizer.pipe(texts)
            nlp.update(docs, annotations, sgd=optimizer, drop=0.35, losses=losses)
            
        print("Losses", losses)

        def evaluate(model):
            texts, annotations = zip(*test_data)
            docs = nlp.tokenizer.pipe(texts)
            golds, probs = [], []
            
            for doc, annot in zip(docs, annotations):
                try:
                    golds.extend([{'entities': [(ent[0], ent[1], ent[2])]
                                    for ent in annot['label']}] * len(doc))
                    pred_value = model(doc)
                    
                    for p in pred_value:
                        pred_ents = [{'start': ent.start_char,
                                     'end': ent.end_char,
                                     'label': ent.label_} for ent in p.ents]
                        
                        probs.append({'entities': pred_ents})
                
                except Exception as e:
                    print(str(e))
                    
            return nlp.evaluate(golds, probs)[scores['ents_f']]
                
        score = evaluate(nlp)
        print("F-score:", score)
```
This code creates a `ner` pipeline component, adds the required labels to the component and add it to the main pipeline. Then, it starts training the model using the stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm. The other components in the pipeline are disabled during training because they do not affect the named entity recognition component. Finally, the model is tested against the test data after each iteration using the `evaluate()` function.

5. Test the model: Once the model is trained successfully, we can use it to predict the named entities in new text inputs. Here's the code snippet to run the trained model on new data:

```python
new_text = "Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Apple's products include iPhone, iPad, Mac, the iOS mobile operating system, iPod touch, Apple Watch, and the HomePod smart speaker."
doc = nlp(new_text)
displacy.render(doc, style='ent', jupyter=True)
```
This code runs the trained model on the new text input and visualizes the recognized named entities using the displaCy library.
