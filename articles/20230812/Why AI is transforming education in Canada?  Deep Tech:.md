Canada has one of the highest rates of youth unemployment (7.9%), compared to any other country on earth. In recent years, a generation gap between the wealthiest and poorest has widened as Canada’s economy continues to grow at an accelerated rate. This trend has affected educational opportunities for millions of students across Canada. To combat this challenge, Canada’s education ministry has invested in cutting-edge technologies that employ artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to improve student outcomes and enhance learning experiences. The Canadian government hopes to see more programs implemented using these technologies through the National Research Council's (NRC) Canada Graduate Scholarship program, which offers high-quality post-secondary education to underrepresented groups such as minorities and first-generation college graduates who may not have access to conventional education systems due to socioeconomic or cultural barriers. Additionally, NRC has recently launched its Machine Learning Summer School in collaboration with Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OCI) to help learners gain practical skills needed to effectively apply AI tools to real-world problems.

However, while technological advancements are leading towards making education more accessible, there remain many challenges associated with implementing effective solutions. One of these challenges is addressing ethical and social issues surrounding the use of AI technology. However, as technology becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, it becomes harder to separate responsibilities between human beings and machines. As AI technology becomes more powerful and ubiquitous, we need to ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly by leveraging expertise from both fields. 

In this blog article, I will focus on the impact of computer science and AI research on education in Canada and how these technologies can be leveraged to address some of the most pressing issues faced by educators today. I will discuss what computer science and AI research currently focuses on, what machine learning concepts and techniques can benefit educators, and why they should consider applying these ideas to their workplaces to further enhance student outcomes.

2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into specific technical details about the current state of affairs, it is important to establish some basic principles and terminology. These include concepts such as data analysis, computational thinking, machine learning algorithms, and ethics. Let me briefly explain each concept below:

Data Analysis: Data analysis refers to extracting meaningful insights from large amounts of raw data collected over time. It involves using various statistical methods, programming languages, and mathematical formulas to extract valuable information from complex datasets. Examples of data analysis techniques include clustering, classification, regression, and prediction.

Computational Thinking: Computational thinking refers to the process of breaking down a problem into smaller steps and then solving those steps one by one until a final solution is achieved. This requires creativity, problem-solving skills, and analytical abilities. By following the scientific method, we can approach complex problems in a systematic manner, iteratively refining our hypotheses, testing them, and moving forward to new conclusions.

Machine Learning Algorithms: A machine learning algorithm is a set of instructions designed to solve a specific type of problem. There are several types of machine learning algorithms including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled examples, where the correct output is known for each input. Unsupervised learning involves identifying patterns and relationships within the data without labeled outputs. Reinforcement learning uses feedback loops to identify optimal actions based on past experience. Finally, deep learning uses neural networks to train models using large datasets and sophisticated algorithms to automatically discover hidden patterns and relationships in data.

Ethics: Ethics refer to moral principles that guide decision-making when dealing with sensitive topics such as human rights, privacy, and security. Moral decisions must be made with regard to fairness, justice, and impartiality. Ethical concerns related to AI and education stem from the potential harmful effects of artificial intelligence, its applications, and the negative impact they can have on individuals, communities, and societies. Therefore, understanding ethical guidelines and laws related to AI and education is crucial before utilizing these technologies in practice. 

3. Current State of Affairs
Let us now dive deeper into the current state of affairs regarding the implementation of computer science and AI technologies in education. We start with discussing what researchers are working on and what they aim to achieve. According to various reports, there are three main areas of research being conducted in Canada focused on teaching computers and machines to learn:

1. Teaching Programming Languages: This area includes research efforts aimed at developing software development frameworks and tools that enable teachers to create, modify, and debug code faster and more efficiently. One example of this effort is Codecademy, a website that provides interactive coding tutorials for different programming languages. Another project funded by the Ghana Fund for Research in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (GFREE) called AlgorithmWiz allows teachers to easily upload video clips or images demonstrating the working of algorithms and have students test their knowledge against multiple choice questions.

2. Developing Computer Science Curriculum: This area covers projects aiming to develop curricula specifically geared towards preparing teachers for the roles of CS professionals. For instance, NSERC is exploring ways to integrate objectives, assessments, and course content directly into traditional classrooms. SFU is also creating a specialized curriculum that emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration among students during CS classes. Other schools in Canada are also experimenting with hybrid courses that combine traditional classroom instruction with online activities, virtual laboratories, and community engagement sessions.

3. Implementing Automatic Feedback: This area focuses on designing automated feedback mechanisms that provide instantaneous grades to students alongside written comments for improvement. One project funded by NSERC called PROMONTHR, pronounced “promon thar” (“improve month”), aims to create a system that continuously monitors student performance and suggests personalized feedback that is relevant to each student. Other teams in Canada are collaborating with industry partners to prototype automatic feedback solutions for higher education institutions.

These areas of research represent only a small portion of the vast field of computer science and AI applied to education. Yet, it is clear that Canada is investing significant resources in advancing these research areas and taking immediate action to support teacher and learner success. Many initiatives are still ongoing, but I believe there is already evidence of positive results in some of these areas. Specifically, tech companies like Google are investing heavily in developments that leverage natural language processing (NLP) to understand student voice and generate feedback instantly. Moreover, the National Research Council has announced the creation of a $1.5 million Canada Graduate Scholarship Program, which offers high-quality post-secondary education to underrepresented groups of students facing adverse economic conditions. Lastly, NRC has established an Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OCI) Machine Learning Summer School, which helps learners learn how to implement AI tools in their daily life and build practical skills needed to apply these tools to real-world problems. 

4. Benefits of Applying Machine Learning to Education
Now let us move onto discussing benefits of applying machine learning techniques to education. Some of the key benefits of applying ML to education include:

1. Improved Student Outcomes: Most education reforms are intended to address weaknesses in student achievement. However, modern education requires students to demonstrate mastery of core subjects, even if they lack advanced degrees. With the right combination of theory and practices, machine learning can offer hope for improving student outcomes. For example, facial recognition algorithms could be used to recognize student disruptors early on in their studies, ensuring they do not struggle with difficult tests and exams. Similarly, predictive analytics tools can be used to track progress and plan ahead, enabling teachers to prioritize their time and attention accordingly.

2. Enhanced Learning Experiences: Educators constantly face challenges in providing high-quality education. Machine learning algorithms can automate tasks such as grading assignments, tracking attendance, and monitoring student behavior. Furthermore, these technologies allow for self-paced learning, meaning students can explore various materials and choose their own pathway through the subject matter. Despite these benefits, there are still challenges faced by educators in optimizing the use of these technologies. One challenge is the limited availability of accurate data and reliable sources.

3. Effective Use of Expert Knowledge: Machine learning algorithms rely on large amounts of data to make predictions and improvements. Unfortunately, data collection often comes from biased sources such as surveys and questionnaires. As a result, experts often do not accurately reflect the diversity of students within their school environments. As a result, machine learning algorithms may perform poorly or fail to generalize well to all populations. Nonetheless, expertise in the subject matters of interest can significantly aid in integrating theories and techniques learned in traditional teaching styles with new approaches based on machine learning.

It is essential to note here that the term "education" encompasses a wide range of activities, ranging from formal education to informal learning and exploratory learning. Machine learning can be used to augment traditional teaching methods to maximize student learning outcomes and minimize challenges faced by educators. However, it is equally important to ensure that educators take responsibility for the development and deployment of these technologies in ways that promote healthy lifestyle choices and respect for individual autonomy.
