Big data technologies have revolutionized the world of data collection, processing and analysis. Nowadays big data storage is becoming critical in handling large volumes of data at reasonable cost with high availability and scalability. Therefore, it is essential to understand how to store, analyze and query big data effectively for achieving better business insights using big data tools and techniques. In this article, we will cover some key concepts related to big data storage along with code examples to help you get started on your journey towards building robust big data infrastructure. 

In this blog post, I am assuming that readers are familiar with various programming languages like Python, Java, Scala or R. Also, they should be comfortable working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB etc. If not, don't worry! You can find extensive resources online to learn these skills. The focus here is more on technical details rather than general knowledge around big data. We will try our best to explain everything clearly but if you feel lost anywhere then just ask me!  

By the end of this article, you will have a clear understanding of how to manage and optimize your big data storage architecture for efficient querying and analytics. Hopefully, you’ll also come across some new ideas and approaches to leverage big data storage effectively for solving complex problems faced by organizations today. Let's dive into the detailed content now! 

Note: This article assumes a basic level of understanding of database design principles, NoSQL database architectures and indexing strategies. If you're still learning about these topics, please refer to other sources for a proper understanding before continuing further. 

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminologies
## 2.1 What Is Big Data?
Big data refers to an explosion of data generated by people, machines, and automated systems over a period of time. It has become the buzzword of the modern era, with companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon using it for generating insights from their vast amounts of data. However, there are several definitions of what constitutes big data and where it comes from. Here's one common definition: "Big data is a collection of interconnected datasets that can be analyzed to provide valuable information about past events, trends, and relationships." The term "big" typically means voluminous and difficult to process. Hence, it requires specialized hardware and software to handle and analyze the enormous amount of data that arrives every day. Additionally, businesses need to understand how to make use of big data while being able to deal with its challenges. 


## 2.2 Types Of Big Data
There are three main types of big data: structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Structured data consists of data that is organized into predefined schemas i.e., tables and records with specific fields defined within them. Unstructured data includes data that does not follow any prescribed structure, such as text messages, images, videos, audio files, and social media posts. Semi-structured data comprises of a combination of both structured and unstructured data. Some examples of structured and semi-structured data include relational databases (such as MySQL, Oracle), document stores (such as MongoDB) and key-value stores (such as Redis). Examples of unstructured data include log files, emails, web traffic logs, sensors data, social media feeds and IoT devices' data streams. 


## 2.3 How Does Big Data Work?
Big data works by storing massive quantities of raw data in distributed systems. These systems gather, distribute, process, and analyze all the data simultaneously in real-time. There are four steps involved in transforming raw data into useful insights:

1. Collection - Collecting data from various sources including websites, mobile apps, IoT devices, social media platforms, email servers, file servers, and network switches.

2. Storage - Storing collected data in a distributed file system, commonly known as HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).

3. Processing - Transforming stored data by applying multiple algorithms to extract meaningful insights, which are then stored back in the distributed file system for further analysis.

4. Analysis - Analyzing processed data to identify patterns, trends, correlations, and outliers to discover hidden insights and deliver actionable results to decision makers.


## 2.4 What Are Cloud Computing And Its Advantages?
Cloud computing is a type of cloud-based service model where providers offer computing power, storage, and other services via the internet. Cloud computing offers many advantages compared to traditional IT environments due to its flexible scalability, economical costs, and ease of management. Here are some of the key benefits of cloud computing:

1. Flexibility – Cloud computing allows users to scale up or down based on demand, ensuring swift response times even during peak hours.

2. Economy – With pay-as-you-go pricing models, cloud computing provides substantial savings compared to buying expensive dedicated servers.

3. Ease Of Management – Compared to setting up and managing physical servers, cloud computing simplifies operations tasks and reduces maintenance costs.

4. High Availability – Cloud computing ensures reliable service uptime through redundant backups and failover mechanisms.

5. Scalability – Cloud computing can easily scale to meet increasing user needs without disrupting existing services.

6. Agility – Cloud computing enables organizations to rapidly adopt new technology solutions by providing quick access to products, services, and features.
