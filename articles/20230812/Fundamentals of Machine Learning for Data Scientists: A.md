# 1.简介
  

Machine learning has become a popular area in recent years as it offers many benefits such as improved productivity, accuracy, speed, scalability, etc. In this article we will focus on deep learning algorithms using neural networks which is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used today. We will cover fundamental concepts of linear algebra, probability theory, and optimization techniques that are necessary to understand the mathematical basis behind these algorithms. Specifically, we will discuss how neural networks work and how they can be trained using gradient descent algorithm. Additionally, we will cover topics like regularization and overfitting and their impact on training performance. Finally, we will explain key terms such as activation function, dropout layer, and weight initialization methods. This article aims to provide an overview of important concepts related to deep learning with code examples for beginners who want to learn about the mathematics behind them. 

# 2. 基本概念及术语
Before diving into detailed explanation, let's go through some basic concepts and terminology that you need to know before understanding what deep learning means.

## Linear Algebra 
Linear algebra refers to a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, matrices, transformations between spaces, and other topics related to vector spaces and linearity. It includes operations like addition, multiplication, scalar multiplication, matrix-vector multiplication, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, determinants, and systems of equations. You should have a good understanding of the basics of linear algebra such as vectors, coordinates, spans, bases, and projections before moving forward with the rest of the article. A brief summary would be sufficient here.

## Probability Theory 
Probability theory involves the study of random variables, their characteristics, and their properties. We use probability distributions to model real-world events and describe the likelihood of different outcomes based on our assumptions. The key concepts include conditional probability, joint probability distribution, marginal probability distribution, Bayes' theorem, and expectation. Again, a brief summary would be enough.

## Optimization Techniques 
Optimization techniques involve finding the best solution or values given a set of constraints. These techniques help us find the minimum or maximum value of a function while satisfying certain conditions. Examples of optimization problems include minimizing cost functions, finding roots of equation, and designing products. Some common optimization techniques include gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and conjugate gradient. Once again, just a few summaries would do.

## Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons. They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons, where each neuron receives inputs from its previous layer and generates outputs to its next layer. ANNs were originally developed for pattern recognition tasks but later adapted to various domains such as computer vision, speech processing, and natural language processing. Each neuron calculates an output using a weighted sum of input signals and applies an activation function to produce either a binary output (sigmoid function), a continuous output (tanh function), or a softmax output. Multiple hidden layers can also be added to make the network deeper and more complex. The weights between adjacent layers are adjusted during training using backpropagation.

A simple example of a fully connected neural network could look like this:


In this example, there are three input nodes, two hidden layers, and three output nodes. There are no connections across layers except for those within the same layer. Forward propagation starts at the input layer, passes through the hidden layer(s), then reaches the output layer. At each node, the dot product of the incoming signal and corresponding weight is calculated followed by application of the activation function. Backpropagation uses chain rule to calculate gradients at each node and update weights accordingly. Gradient descent updates the weights after each iteration until convergence or max iterations is reached. Dropout layers are commonly used to prevent overfitting. Weight initialization methods vary depending on the chosen activation function and the problem being solved. Common ones are Xavier normal, Xavier uniform, Kaiming He normal, and Kaiming He uniform.

## Regularization and Overfitting
Regularization is a technique used to avoid overfitting in neural networks. It adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages the model from fitting too closely to the training data. The goal is to reduce the variance of the hypothesis and thus increase generalizability. Two common types of regularization include L1 regularization and L2 regularization. L1 regularization encourages sparsity in the weights, resulting in less complexity in the model. On the other hand, L2 regularization encourages small weights, resulting in smoother decision boundaries. Both methods can be applied to both fully connected and convolutional layers.

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and begins to memorize rather than generalize. To mitigate overfitting, we can use techniques such as early stopping, cross validation, and augmentation. Early stopping stops the training process when the validation error stops improving, cross validation splits the dataset into train/test sets multiple times, and augmentation generates new samples from existing data.

# 3. Core Algorithm and Operations
Now let's move onto details of core algorithms involved in building deep learning models. We will start with gradient descent algorithm, which is widely used to optimize neural networks during training. Gradients represent the slope of a curve and determine whether the weights should be increased or decreased in order to minimize the objective function. The gradient descent algorithm works by updating the weights iteratively according to the negative direction of the gradient at each step. We multiply the gradient by a small learning rate to control the size of the steps taken towards the optimal solution. Similarly, momentum is another hyperparameter that helps accelerate convergence by adding a fraction of the previous gradient to the current step. Another essential component of the algorithm is the choice of loss function, which measures the difference between predicted and actual output. Popular choices include mean squared error (MSE) and categorical crossentropy (CCE). For numerical stability, mini-batch gradient descent can be used instead of batch gradient descent.

The second main component of neural networks is the activation function, which determines how the output of each neuron is computed. Common choices are sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and softmax. Sigmoid squashes the input to a range between 0 and 1, tanh maps the input to (-1, +1), and ReLU restricts the input below zero to zero. Softmax computes probabilities for each class and is often used for classification tasks. Activation functions play a crucial role in ensuring that the output of the network stays bounded and allows gradient descent to converge. Moreover, dropout layers are frequently used to prevent overfitting.

Finally, we need to initialize the weights in the network so that they are not too large or small to cause vanishing or exploding gradients. There are several approaches to initializing weights including constant, random, and xavier method. Constant initializes all weights to the same value, random initializes randomly, and xavier method scales the weights to ensure that the variance remains constant throughout training. Other aspects of deep learning models include regularization, transfer learning, and federated learning. Regularization improves generalizability by reducing the amount of overfitting, transfer learning shares knowledge learned from one task to others, and federated learning distributes computation among devices to improve privacy and security.
