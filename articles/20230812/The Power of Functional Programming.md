# 1.简介
  

Functional programming is a style or paradigm for programming that emphasizes on pure functions and immutable data structures. It allows you to write more modular code with less side effects. In this article I will show some basic concepts and algorithms in functional programming and their practical usage. And I hope it can give you inspiration and ideas for further research. Finally, I also want to share some challenges and insights from my experience in functional programming.

Let's start! 

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
## Immutability and Higher-Order Functions (HOF)
In functional programming, everything is immutable by default. That means once an object has been created, its value cannot be changed. Instead, any change should create a new object. This property makes your programs safer, easier to reason about, and efficient. For example:

```python
x = 10       # x is immutable integer number
y = x + 5    # y is another immutable integer number
z = [x]      # z is immutable list containing one element
w = z.append(9)   # w is None since we are modifying the original list instead of creating a new one
print("x:", x)     # prints "x: 10"
print("y:", y)     # prints "y: 15"
print("z:", z)     # prints "z: [10]"
print("w:", w)     # raises AttributeError because append() returns None which does not exist as attribute
```

Another important concept in functional programming is higher-order functions (also known as HOF). These are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as values. One common way to define HOF is using lambda expressions. Let's see how to use these functions:

```python
def multiply_by_two(n):
    return n * 2

add_five = lambda x: x + 5

list_of_nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled_and_added_to_five = map(lambda num: add_five(multiply_by_two(num)), list_of_nums)
print(list(doubled_and_added_to_five))  # output: [11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
```

Here `map` function takes two arguments - a function (`multiply_by_two`) and a sequence (`list_of_nums`). Then it applies the given function to each element of the sequence and creates a new sequence that contains the results. We used lambda expression to define the `add_five` function inline without having to define a separate function. Lambda expression is especially useful when you need to pass a small anonymous function like the above examples. 

## Map/Filter/Reduce
Map/Filter/Reduce are three fundamental operations in functional programming that work with sequences. They allow you to transform a collection of elements into a different form while filtering out unwanted elements and aggregating information across all elements. Here are some examples:

### Map
The `map()` function applies a function to every element of a sequence and returns a new sequence with the transformed elements. You can use it for many purposes such as transforming numbers, strings, objects etc. Here is an example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)   # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In the above example, we passed a lambda function that squares each number to `map()`. Then we converted the resulting iterator back to a list using `list()` so we could print it. Note that if we did not convert it back to a list, then `map()` would have returned an iterator.

### Filter
The `filter()` function filters out certain elements from a sequence based on a condition specified by a predicate function. It returns a new sequence with only those elements that satisfy the condition. Here is an example:

```python
numbers = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
positive_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, numbers))
print(positive_numbers)   # Output: [1, 2, 4]
```

In the above example, we passed a lambda function that checks if a number is positive to `filter()`. Then we converted the resulting iterator back to a list using `list()` so we could print it. Again, note that if we had not converted it back to a list, then `filter()` would have returned an iterator.

### Reduce
The `reduce()` function reduces a sequence to a single value by applying a binary operation to pairs of elements at each step. Here is an example:

```python
from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
product = reduce((lambda x, y: x*y), numbers)
print(product)   # Output: 120
```

We imported the `reduce()` function from the built-in `functools` module and passed a lambda function that multiplies two numbers together to it. The first argument `(lambda x, y: x*y)` specifies the binary operator we want to apply. The second argument `numbers` is the input sequence. Then we printed the result.
