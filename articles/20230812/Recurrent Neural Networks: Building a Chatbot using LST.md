Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been gaining popularity in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In this article, we will explain how to build chatbots using an RNN called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), perform sentiment analysis using LSTMs, create songs using LSTMs, classify real-time stock market data using LSTMs, and build a language model using LSTMs. We will also explore some advanced techniques like attention mechanisms, beam search, and memory networks. 

Before starting any project or writing code, it is essential to understand the basic concepts and terminologies used by recurrent neural networks. This will help you choose appropriate architectures for your problem statement, design efficient training algorithms, and avoid common pitfalls while building complex deep learning systems. So let’s dive into each area separately! 

1. Background Introduction: What are RNNs?

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that operates on sequential data such as text, speech, time series, etc. It can remember past information and use it along with current inputs to predict future outputs. The key feature of an RNN is its ability to process variable-length sequences without having to pad them with zeros beforehand. 

However, unlike standard feedforward neural networks, RNNs suffer from two main problems when applied to long sequences: vanishing gradients and the exploding gradient problem. These issues make it difficult to train large RNNs effectively. Over the last few years, several researchers have proposed various solutions to address these challenges, which include skip connections, layer normalization, and gating mechanisms such as GRU and LSTM cells. 

Additionally, there exist many variations of RNN structures, including Elman RNNs, Gated RNNs, and Jordan RNNs. Each of these has different properties and advantages depending on the specific task at hand. Let's discuss about what these variants mean in detail later on.

2. Basic Concepts & Terminology: How does RNN work?

Let’s start with explaining some fundamental terms and ideas behind RNNs.

1. Time Steps: An RNN processes input one element at a time through time steps. At each step, the RNN receives both the previous output and the input at that timestep, and produces an output. 

For example, consider the following sequence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." If we want to apply an RNN to this sequence, we need to break it down into individual elements first: 

The q u i c k b r o w n | f o x j u m p s o v e r t h e l a z y d o g. 

Now, imagine that we are applying our RNN to learn the relationship between words and their neighbors. For instance, if we see the word 'quick' next to the word 'brown', then we might infer that the word 'fox' probably comes next. 

2. Hidden State: At each time step, the RNN stores state information in its hidden state vector. This includes not only the most recent output but also all of the intermediate computations performed so far. The state vector remains constant across all timesteps until a new set of inputs arrive.  

3. Cell State: Unlike the hidden state, the cell state is modified every time step according to a mathematical function based on the incoming inputs, the previous cell state, and other factors such as the activation functions applied to the gate variables. The cell state ultimately becomes part of the final output computed by the RNN.

These three components together form the basis of the Recurrent Neural Network architecture. Every unit within an RNN uses these three states to generate its own output. Below is a simplified illustration of an RNN with multiple layers:  


In this figure, we show a simple version of an RNN architecture with four layers: input, hidden, cell, and output. Each layer contains units that interact with their corresponding state vectors throughout time. The input layer takes in the initial input sequence, passes it through a non-linear transformation (e.g., a Tanh activation function), and feeds it to the first hidden layer. The second hidden layer takes in the output of the first hidden layer at each time step, applies another non-linearity, and combines it with the internal cell state generated during the previous time step to produce the output at the current time step. Finally, the output layer produces the final output prediction.

Using these three components, the RNN learns to map sequential input patterns to continuous output values. Since it maintains state information across timesteps, it can capture long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Although vanilla RNNs cannot handle very long sequences due to the vanishing gradients issue, newer versions such as LSTM and GRU introduce advanced techniques to mitigate this limitation. These advancements enable RNNs to handle more complicated tasks and make them competitive with even larger deep neural networks.

We hope this brief overview was helpful! Now let’s move on to detailed explanations of the core algorithms and operations involved in building chatbots, performing sentiment analysis using LSTMs, creating music using LSTMs, classifying real-time stock market data using LSTMs, and building a language model using LSTMs.
