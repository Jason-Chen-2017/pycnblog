## 3.1 前向传播与反向传播
### 3.1.1 前向传播：输入层 -> 隐藏层 -> 输出层 -> loss function -> backpropagation loop (iteration) -> weights updated (gradient descent) -> new input data fed into the network again until convergence is reached or a stopping criterion is met. The process repeats itself for each training example in the dataset, and this forms one epoch of training. Multiple epochs are performed to improve model performance and generalization capabilities on unseen data samples during testing phase(test set). This entire process is called "training" or "learning" of neural networks by machine learning algorithms such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning etc.. Training involves adjusting weights based on error signals generated from comparing predicted outputs with actual outputs obtained from ground truth labels provided during training phase(train set). These errors are propagated backwards through layers using chain rule of calculus which gives rise to name "backpropagation". Hence, it's clear that neural networks learn by minimizing some cost function defined over prediction errors between predicted output and true output values for all training examples in dataset under consideration at any given time instance t=0,t=1,...,t=n−1 where n denotes total number of training examples present in current dataset being used for model building purposes via iterative optimization techniques like gradient descent methodology applied herein below: $$ J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2 $$ Here,$$\theta$$ represents parameters of our neural network model including biases and weights;$$\theta$$ can be vectorized form too if required;$$x^{(i)}$$ denotes input feature vector belonging to class i;$$y^{(i)}$$ signifies corresponding target/output value associated with respective class i; m denotes total number of training instances present within current dataset being utilized herein below; h$$\_θ$$(x)$$(θ)$ refers to hypothesis function implemented via our trained neural network model which takes input feature vector x as argument along with its associated parameter vector $$\theta$$ ; finally,(h$$\_θ$$(x)$$(θ))−y$$(i))^2 term signifies squared prediction error computed between predicted output value h$$\_θ$$(x)$$(θ) and true output value y$$(i)$ respectively for each individual training instance i = {1,...,m} present within current dataset under consideration at any given time instance t = {0,...,n − 1}. Now let's move onto next step involving backward pass where we calculate gradients w.r.t parameters $$\theta$$ using chain rule applied over cost function J($$\theta$$) defined above: $$ \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=0 $$ Solving this equation yields optimal solution for our parameter vector $$\theta^*$$ which minimizes cost function J($$\theta$$). Once we have found optimal solution for parameter vector $$\theta^*$$, we update our initial guesses about weights and biases accordingly so as to minimize prediction errors furthermore during subsequent iterations till convergence criteria met or stopping conditions satisfied thereafter leading us towards final trained neural network model ready for deployment purposes on real-world applications such as image recognition tasks etc.. In essence, forward pass computes predictions while backward pass adjusts parameters based on those predictions made earlier during forward pass stage resulting in overall improvement in accuracy/performance metrics observed across entire test set comprising unseen data samples drawn randomly from underlying population distribution characterizing real-world scenarios encountered frequently nowadays due rapid advancements witnessed across various domains ranging from healthcare sector to finance industry among others...
