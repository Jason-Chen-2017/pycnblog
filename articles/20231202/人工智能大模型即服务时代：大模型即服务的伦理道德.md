尽 management and successful companies have consistently places at a rapidly advancing depthisation problem when the ability to leverage big models to build dynamic algorithms and services for end users, we need to ensure that the potential benefits outweigh the risks to address various moral and ethical issues, which is the core of our discussion.

In this context, large models referring to complex neural networks that use large datasets are not essentially mythical as they provide various degrees of computing capability to enable higher levels of generalization ability, while also using different techniques to deal with potential security and privacy hurdles, including differential privacy, copyright information protection, and other mechanisms possible. graduated a large number of successful models, including OpenAI and other such organizations Displaying offering various forms of public programs and technologies, including GPT, DALL-E, and many others.

Finally, a common challenge that arises throughout the various industries that purport to take part in such new practices is the proceduralization of the development and deployment of large AI models. This is why AI ethics and regulations have also become increasingly mainstream issues, which require a variety of professional practices, comprehensive management methods, and computational maturity to manage and address. Thus, we discussed the three concepts of "Model Development", "Model Debug", and "Model Governance" to ensure the safe and effective use of this new technology.

## Upcoming Trends and Challenges

Due to the rapid development of this category of new scientific thinking and computing capabilities, a large number of complex and interconnected problems arise, including global power control, regulatory framework management, data anomaly detection, reusability and reliability methods and other aspects of costly and complex challenges are facing, and the industry has huge challenges. To name a few of the most critical challenges:

### The AI Governance Gap

As large-scale AI models reach wider use, they raise important governance questions. While the use of such models is increasing, if these models are too easily infected with bias and error, the cost of misuse could be massive.

### Scaling Responsibility

Distributing responsibility for AI system outputs is particularly challenging, and current best practices may be inefficient and seat-of-the-pants arrangements. For example, in scenarios with human-AI collaboration model, humans are challenged with responsibilities that are difficult to delineate.
Note that the same situation may occur in auto-scheduling, or even fixed-rule administration. When it comes to responsibility, the chain of liability becomes ambiguous.

Lastly, regardless of the industry, the moral dilemma and ethical philosophies cannot be ignored when it comes to utilizing the power of large AI models, and quite a number of physical and digital Turing tests must be passed before this power can be seamlessly integrated into daily work.
