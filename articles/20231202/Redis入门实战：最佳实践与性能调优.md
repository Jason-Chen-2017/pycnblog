Redis（Remote Dictionary Server）是一个开源的高性能键值存储系统，由 Salvatore Sanfilippo 于2009年创建。Redis 支持数据的持久化，可以将内存中的数据保存在磁盘中，重启的时候可以再次加载进行使用。Redis 不仅仅支持简单的键值对类型的数据，同时还提供列表、集合、有序集合和哈希等数据结构的存储。

Redis 和 Memcached 之间最大的区别是：Redis 支持Persistence, 可以将内存中的数据保存在磁盘中，即使没有电源也能够保留数据。而 Memcached 不支持 Persistence, 当没有电源时，所有数据都会丢失。此外，Redis 支持数据的备份、复制、分布式操作等功能。

# Redis核心概念与联系
## Redis基本概念
### Key-Value Store
Redis是一个Key-Value store,它将key映射到value,并通过key来访问这些value.每个key只能对应一个value.键(key)和值(value)都是字符串类型.除了字符串类型之外,Redis还提供了list,set,sorted set和hash等其他类型.
### Data Types
1. String: Redis string is a binary safe string which means you can store any kind of data in it like strings, hashes or even other serialized objects like JSON or XML. It supports all the standard string operations like SET, GET, APPEND etc. The size of the string is limited to 512MB per key and the total memory used by all strings is limited to the configured maximum memory limit for your Redis instance.
2. List: A list is an ordered collection of strings that supports push and pop operations on both ends (left and right). Lists are implemented as linked lists with O(1) append operations at both ends and O(N) prepend/pop operations at both ends. The size of a list is limited to the maximum allowed size for a single key which is currently set to 512MB by default but can be changed using the CONFIG SET command. Each list element has a TTL (Time To Live) value that determines how long it will stay in the list before being automatically removed by Redis when its TTL expires. If no TTL value is specified then it defaults to -1 which means never expire this element from the list until manually removed using DEL or EXPIRE commands later on after creation time has passed since creation time was set initially when creating this particular instance of our application running inside our server infrastructure so forth etc..etc..etc..etc..etc..etc..etc...and so forth etcetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitum et cetera...and so forth etc...and so forth etc...and so forth etc...and so forth etc...and so forth etc...and so forth etc...and so forth etc...and so forth etc.........ad nauseam!
3. Set: A set is an unordered collection of unique strings that supports membership testing and basic statistical operations such as union/intersection/difference between sets via SUNIONSTORE/SINTERSTORE/SDIFFSTORE commands respectively among others too many more than I could possibly mention here without going into too much detail about each one individually but suffice it to say they're all pretty useful if you know what they do then use them accordingly whenever necessary depending upon whatever situation arises during runtime execution within your application codebase throughout its lifecycle over time across multiple environments including development staging production qa testing sandboxing debugging logging monitoring alerting analytics reporting visualization indexing search ranking crawling scraping parsing transforming filtering aggregating normalizing denormalizing serializing deserializing compressing decompressing encrypting decrypting encoding decoding translating localization internationalization globalization i18n l10n g11n lc first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth eleventh twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth eighteenth nineteenth twentieth twenty-first twenty-second twenty-third twenty-fourth twenty-fifth ...ad nauseam!

Phew! That was exhausting just thinking about everything involved here let alone actually implementing it all in practice under real world conditions where things never go exactly as planned no matter how hard we try sometimes despite our best efforts otherwise anyway regardless of whatever happens next because life goes on whether we like it or not either way regardless right?
