Despite being an important and useful component in many programming projects, creating and maintaining a framework's documentation and examples is often overlooked as a first-class deliverable. The benefits of providing thorough and maintainable documentation and examples are plentiful, ranging from improved communication with users, developers, and clients, to providing a useful reference for users or potential contributors.

Unfortunately, many framework authors focus on programming-related details and give little consideration to documenting their frameworks. In this article, I will discuss practical ways that you can document your frameworks, including some examples from existing frameworks I have worked with.

## 2.核心概念与关系
### 2.1文档与示例的定义与区别
 Framework documentation is a comprehensive set of documents that describes a framework, including its design and architecture, features and APIs. This document also provides examples of code usage that demonstrate how this framework can be used to build applications.

 Samples, on the other hand, refer specifically to example code that customers or other developers can use to build applications that work. Examples should include code for different scenarios, as well as relevant code for different platforms or versions of the framework.

### 2.2文档与示例的关系与联系
 Framework documentation and examples are closely related. Ideally, the examples should be included in the documentation and vice versa.

 Documentation can be used to introduce examples easily, while examples can be used to develop and improve documentation. This symbiotic relationship ensures that readers gain a more comprehensive understanding of the framework and can more easily apply the framework to their own issues.
