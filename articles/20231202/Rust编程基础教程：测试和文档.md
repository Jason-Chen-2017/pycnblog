Rust是一种现代系统编程语言，它具有内存安全、并发原语和类型系统等特点。Rust的设计目标是为高性能、可靠和安全的系统级软件提供一个强大的工具。在这篇文章中，我们将深入探讨Rust编程的基础知识，特别关注测试和文档方面的内容。

## 1.1 Rust的核心概念

Rust的核心概念包括模式匹配、所有权系统、类型检查和生命周期。这些概念使得Rust能够实现内存安全、并发原语和类型系统等特点。下面我们分别介绍这些概念：

### 1.1.1 模式匹配

模式匹配是Rust中用于解构数据结构的方法。通过模式匹配，我们可以从一个数据结构中提取出特定的值或引用。例如，对于一个元组（i32, String），我们可以通过模式匹配来分离出整数部分和字符串部分：
```rust
let (x, y) = (5, "Hello"); // 使用模式匹配从元组中提取值
println!("{}", x); // 输出: 5
println!("{}", y); // 输出: Hello
```
### 1.1.2 所有权系统
所有权系统是Rust中最重要的一部分之一，它确保了内存安全。所有权规则 dictates that each value in Rust has a single owner at any given time and the owner can always access the value or transfer ownership to someone else. In other words, there can only be one writer but potentially many readers for a value. This ensures that memory is properly managed and avoids common issues like use-after-free or double-free errors that plague languages like C and C++. The ownership of a value is transferred by moving it from one variable to another, rather than by copying the value itself. This means that when you pass a variable as an argument to a function or assign it to another variable, the ownership of the value is transferred to the new location, and the original location no longer has access to it. For example:
```rust
let s = String::from("hello"); // create a String and give it to s variable which owns it now let t; // declare t variable without initializing it t = s; // move s into t so now t owns s instead of s owning itself println!("{}", s); // error! because s no longer owns itself println!("{}", t); // works fine because t now owns what used to be owned by s println!("{}", s); // still an error because even though we can see what used to be owned by s via t, we don't have direct access anymore since we don't own it anymore let u = t; // move ownership again from t back into u so now u owns what used to be owned by both u and then later only by t println!("{}", u); works fine because u now directly owns what was moved out of both old versions of itself previously println!("{}", t); error! because we don't have direct access anymore since we don't own anything anymore"}; ```
