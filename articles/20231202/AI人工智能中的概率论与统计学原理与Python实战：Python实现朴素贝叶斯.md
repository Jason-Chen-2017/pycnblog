 welcomed by so many expert programmers, experts in deep learning, Big Data, AI, machine learning is becoming more and more popular in the technology industry, due in part to its powerful performance and broad application areas. As we have noted, Python is an intelligent and straightforward programming language, making it easy to learn and master.

At the same time, there are many beginners whose interest in deep learning, official equivalents, and statistical methods is overnight, causing a significant increase in the number of online learning learners. At the same time, friends who have learned deep learning, official equivalents, and statistical methods for a long time are actively converting knowledge through disclosure.

In this context, if we do not use the insights gained from learning programming to our advantage, then learning deep learning and machine learning is vain. The above software code also demonstrates the absurdity inherent in all computer code.

But in the software code, there is nothing wrong with adding "reference, indicator, consistency, traceability, syntax consistency, one-click conversion, crossbeam and meaningless thought". Instead, it reveals that we are in a state of being overwhelmed and worried - an emergent phenomenon.

In understanding programming language, we should face the language at the lowest level, not just stop at:

Now I have to learn a few fundamentals `-LRB-` basic BASIC programming knowledge `-RRB-`.

If you want to understand machine learning, start with understanding Python. Can artificial intelligence alone be called in this way? Maybe you all know that **Gauss and Bayes are the founder and standard of machine learning**.

At present, the rising popularity of machine learning and deep learning is considered to be come from WeChat two types of questions:

1.  Post sorting. WeChat groups have always been full of competitions, and the selection of algorithms, tools, languages ​​and frameworks is becoming more and more tense. To be honest, using random keywords and contributorsTitle to select forums is far from the best.

2.  Crazy training practices. A lot of people use "Let the Great Tang build the real kingdom in the land of glory. One day of training, one day of wine and food" (in fact, it is not so) and corresponding qualifications. Some idiots use their spiritual power to force themselves to lose, all for the ultimate goal of bringing "I am so good" to others.

So try to avoid these two areas as much as possible, and go to original WeChat.

You all know that the mathematics and methods of Bayes principles come from the probability theory that La place put forward to reveal the uncertainty.

SUBMIT TO CHAOS THE PREDICTABLE.

Things around us are evil. We analyze these things with data, including the credibility of the data itself. It is difficult to solve these things through Bayesian principles. The main reason is that it takes a lot of data to solve them, and if there is any abnormality in the data, it will lead to the wrong result. In fact, we have already put this problem into a deeper problem: how to solve large data problems. How to apply Bayesian principles to the problem does not necessarily mean that everything is guaranteed to be good? We have already stripped this problem off. Machine learning comes here. Machine learning is a complex problem involving combination Bayesian principles and inductive learning. That is, in addition to time, you need a lot of data.

> 相信我，经过我的简化，你本来不知道 Golden Rule will still be Golden Rule, so simply abstract such a method as Bayesian Inference to data analysis in the machine learning field, and this method is called t-distribution and z-distribution.

Through this motivation, we will be more familiar with the probability methods mentioned above.
