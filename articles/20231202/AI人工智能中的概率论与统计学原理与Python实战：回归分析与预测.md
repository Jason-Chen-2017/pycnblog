Probability theory, along with its relation to statistics, has become an essential component of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This is primarily due to the random nature of the factors encountered in academic fields such as economics, finance, psychology, and education. With the growing importance of Big Data, there's been an increasing demand for specialists in artificial intelligence, programming, and computer systems engineering. For this reason, I have chosen to write a comprehensive guide for AI professionals, as well as teachers and students in the fields of programming, data analysis, computer engineering, mathematics, and physics, featuring an in-depth discussion of probability theory and statistical analysis in the context of regression and prediction tasks.

## 4.1 Regression Equation and Residuals
In simple linear regression, we can calculate the expected value y of y according to the regression equation $$\begin{align*}y &= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x$$y=\beta0+\beta1x

The residual $$\epsilon$$ is the difference between the expected value y and the observed value y: $$\begin{align*}\epsilon &= y - y\end{align*}\epsilon=y-y

## 4.2 Calculating R-Squared

R^2 is a method encounter in statistics that estimates the degree to which one or more predictor (independent) variables can determine the effects of the criterion (dependent) variable. The R^2 ranges between 0 and 1. The closer R^2 is to 1, the closer the best fitsthe line is to the data points, indicating a strong relationship between the predictor and criterion variables; conversely, the closer R^2 is to 0, the closer the line to zero, indicating poor ability of prediction.

The R^2 for the overall model is:

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum(y - \overline{y})^2}{\sum(y - \overline{y})^2}$$ $R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum(y - \overline{y})^2}{\sum(y - \overline{y})^2

The R^2 for each predictor added to the model is:

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum(y - y)^2}{\sum(y - \overline{y})^2}$$ $R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum(y - y)^2}{\sum(y - \overline{y})^2

The partial R^2 for each group of predictor variables included in the model is calculated by subtracting the R^2 of the model without the group in question from the R2 of the model that includes all predictors:

$$R^2\_partial = R^2 - R^2$$ $R^2_partial = R^2 - R^2

R^2 tells us if predictors are important or not by observing the changes in R^2 when the predictors are added into the model. Statistically, R2 increases by $R^2\_{partial}$ and Nelson adjusted $R^2$ for N.

$R^2\_adjusted = 1 - \frac{N - 1}{N - K}\left(1 - R^2\right)$$R^2\_adjusted = 1 - \frac{N - 1}{N - K}\left(1 - R^2\right)$

Adjusted $R^2$ should be used when the sample size is larger than the number of predictors; otherwise, the accuracy of the model prediction will be overestimated, resulting in a leading situation and abandoning the objective of building the model. Attention should be paid to the adjusted $R^2$.

The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used to compare different models:

$$AIC = -2LL + Kk + K$$$AIC = -2LL + Kk + K

The Schwarz Information Criterion (BIC) is often used to compare regression models:

$$BIC = -2LL + k\log(N)$$ $BIC = -2LL + k\log(N)$.
