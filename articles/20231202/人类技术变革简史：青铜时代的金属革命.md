人类科技变革的起点和突破点不是现代计算机技术或技术发明发展的 peak 时代，而是人类开始钢制器ajor tool fabrication的诞生。由于自然石头脆 fragile 和具有文化含义的石器偶语质量Couldn't retort Poor Quality natural stone, human civilization has been in chronic shortage of stone-made essential tools. After humans made copper tools through direct reduction by percussion materials, human beings ushered in a new peak of technological development.

In a word, the birth and development of human civilization closely followITER  metal material technology. For example, human beings ushered in the Renaissance of Europe with the birth metal. Afterwards, human civilization also developed into industrial society with the emergence metal machineEngines.

In the next round of development, metals is the keystone, metal significance is the essence, human civilization 9龟are 贡献 of metal and the contribution of metal, metal is the branched  the keySupport.

In this paper, we aim to open up another meta-level developmental path for improving the advantages of metal legend, based on the current peak of computerand information technology, so as to reach a more in-depth and meaningful development.

Verse 88 says, "Life is like a water wave, there is a successive sequence." This is especially true for the development of human civilization and technological progress. It's like this colorful kaleidoscope, rotating evenly and mysteriously.

This paper will dig into the conventional and essential metal ideas in human civilization, explore and develop their internal relationship, and explain the innovative and self-evolving characteristics of metals in these relationships. In a word, we can see that this outlined technology path must be associated with various scientific origins and inherit the core concepts of metal and craft.

At the same time, this paper will illustrate how to understand this history of knowledge as another historical epoch in human development, so that we can reach a deeper understanding of its intrinsic accumulation mechanisms.
