# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the technical details of deploying Redis, let's first understand the basic concepts and terminologies associated with it.

2.1 Redis Architecture
Redis is often referred to as a key-value store but underneath, it actually consists of two components – a key-value storage engine and a master-slave replication mechanism. The key-value storage engine stores key-value pairs which are stored in memory using a hash table approach. Each value is replicated among multiple nodes in a Redis cluster called slaves where each slave has a copy of all the keys and values from the primary node (the master). All writes to the Redis instance are propagated to all the slaves in real time via the asynchronous replication model. 
The master keeps track of updates made to the dataset and assigns them unique sequence numbers. The slaves receive the updates and apply them to their local copies. If any node fails, one of the remaining slave nodes becomes promoted to become the new master. The master then sends the updates to the newly elected master to maintain consistency between the replicas. 

2.2 Redis Master & Slave Replication Model
Master-slave replication is a common architectural pattern for implementing distributed systems. In Redis, the role of the master and the slave nodes plays a crucial role in maintaining the reliability and availability of the system. There are three types of replication models available - synchronous, asynchronous and semi-synchronous replication. Synchronous replication ensures that every write operation is applied to both the master and the slave before returning success to the client. Asynchronous replication provides faster performance than synchronous replication but does not guarantee strict consistency between the master and the slaves. Semi-synchronous replication uses a combination of synchronous and asynchronous replication to balance tradeoffs between consistency and performance. It provides higher durability and availability at the expense of reduced throughput due to the slower synchronization. 
2.3 Redis Cluster
Redis cluster is designed to meet the demands of high availability, horizontal scalability and strong consistency in large-scale applications requiring automatic partitioning and rebalancing of data across multiple Redis nodes. A Redis cluster is composed of shards (logical partitions) each containing multiple Redis nodes. When a cluster is created, it automatically creates a few redis masters and redis slaves per shard. A read request is sent to the appropriate shard based on the requested key. If the corresponding Redis node is down, the request is forwarded to another healthy node within the same shard without affecting the overall performance. To add more capacity to the cluster, additional Redis nodes can be added to existing shards or new shards can be created. The number of shards in a cluster depends on the size requirement of the application. Once the cluster reaches full capacity, further shards can be dynamically created by splitting smaller ones or merging larger ones together. Since a Redis cluster is loosely coupled, failure detection and recovery mechanisms need to be implemented separately. Redis clusters support multi-key operations and transactions while achieving high availability and fault tolerance through its ability to tolerate certain types of failures including network partitions, machine crashes, software errors, power outages and hardware failures. 

2.4 Redis Sentinel
Redis sentinel is a highly-available and distributed systems management tool that monitors Redis instances in a Redis deployment and manages failover if one of the instances fail. Redis sentinel works in tandem with the Redis master/slave architecture to achieve high availability and maintains consistency between the Redis nodes. It periodically checks the status of the monitored Redis nodes and triggers automatic failover actions in case of failures. Redis sentinel also acts as a notification channel, forwarding messages about failed master events to clients subscribed to the notifications stream. Clients can subscribe to the notification streams to get notified whenever there is a change in the state of the Redis cluster.

2.5 Redis Persistence
Redis persistence enables Redis instances to save their data on disk so that they can continue running in the event of a sudden crash or restart. Redis supports four different persistence strategies - RDB, AOF, SAVE and APPEND ONLY MODE. RDB saves the entire dataset on disk at periodic intervals while AOF logs all the changes to the dataset. RDB is preferred over AOF as RDB provides better performance under normal workloads compared to AOF which guarantees data consistency during downtime periods. However, AOF provides better durability in case of disaster scenarios. SAVE command allows users to manually trigger the snapshot creation of the current dataset. APPEND ONLY MODE only persists commands executed against the database, i.e., all reads and writes performed after enabling AOF mode are persisted. While this feature may seem simple, it offers considerable benefits in terms of durability, flexibility and ease of backup and restore.

2.6 Redis PubSub Messaging Pattern
Redis pubsub messaging pattern enables publishers to broadcast messages to subscribers who wish to receive those messages. Subscribers connect to a publisher’s channel to receive messages published to that channel. Subscriptions are non-durable, meaning that subscriptions are lost upon disconnection of the subscriber. Publish-subscribe messaging pattern is useful in many situations such as providing real-time information to clients, delivering notifications to users, and managing real-time workflows in web applications.

2.7 Redis Commands
Redis provides a rich set of built-in commands for performing various tasks such as inserting, retrieving, manipulating and aggregating data. Some commonly used commands include SET, GET, HSET, HGET, LPUSH, RPUSH, LPOP, RPOP, INCR, DECR, EXPIRE, SELECT, DEL, FLUSHALL, FLUSHDB, KEYS, EXISTS, SCAN, MOVE, COUNT, SORT, PUBSUB, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, MIGRATE, CLUSTER, MONITOR, WAIT, CONFIG, INFO, LATENCY, CLIENT LIST, SWAPDB, DEBUG, TRANSACTIONS, WATCH, UNWATCH. These commands cover most of the essential functions of Redis and form the basis of its powerful features.

3.1 Redis Configuration Settings
There are several important configuration settings that must be considered before deploying a Redis instance in a production environment. They range from optimizing memory usage to ensuring data integrity and security. Let us discuss each of these settings in detail.

3.1.1 Memory Management
Redis can consume a lot of memory depending on the size of the dataset and number of keys being stored. To optimize memory consumption, it is important to configure Redis with the right amount of memory allocated to it. For example, setting maxmemory to 1GB means that Redis will stop accepting writes once the total memory consumed exceeds 1GB. Under heavy write loads, it is possible that Redis starts rejecting incoming requests because it cannot keep up with the writing rate. Therefore, it is recommended to increase maxmemory gradually until it meets the actual memory needs of the workload. Setting maxmemory-policy to volatile-lru or allkeys-lru prevents Redis from evicting expired items too aggressively, resulting in longer access times. With default Redis configuration parameters, a maximum limit of 256MB is allowed, though this limit can be increased by modifying the redis.conf file. 

3.1.2 Data Integrity and Security
Redis has built-in protections against certain types of attacks such as buffer overflow attacks and denial of service attacks. However, there are still risks associated with unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Redis. Therefore, it is important to secure Redis instances by restricting access to the necessary ports and IP addresses and securing SSH connections. Password authentication can be enabled to require clients to authenticate themselves before accessing Redis. Also, SSL/TLS encryption can be configured to encrypt communication between Redis clients and the server.

3.1.3 Data Partitioning and Sharding
When scaling a Redis instance horizontally, adding more nodes requires balancing the load across them. One way to do this is to distribute the data across multiple Redis nodes using consistent hashing or similar algorithms. Consistent hashing maps each key to a predefined number of buckets based on their hashed values. By distributing the keys across multiple nodes, we reduce the risk of hotspots and improve performance. Another approach is to use Redis clustering or sharding, where the data is split into logical partitions (shards) and each shard is assigned to a subset of nodes. This reduces the likelihood of conflicts between keys belonging to different shards and improves scalability and resilience. 

3.2 Redis Deployment Strategies
Deploying Redis involves selecting the correct infrastructure provider, configuring virtual machines, installing Redis and establishing relevant network connectivity. Depending on the scale of the Redis deployment, it may involve designing a high availability solution involving redundancy, backups, monitoring and alerting, and tuning performance parameters to optimize throughput and latency. Below are several general strategies for deploying Redis on various cloud platforms and container orchestration platforms.

3.2.1 Single Server Deployment
A single server deployment is suitable for smaller Redis deployments and development environments. It involves launching a new EC2 instance with Redis preinstalled and configuring it according to the desired use case. Single server deployments have lower cost, offer easy scalability, and allow for testing and experimentation. However, they lack fault tolerance and are prone to single point of failure in the event of hardware failure. 

3.2.2 Cluster Setup
Cluster setup involves launching multiple Redis instances in a cluster topology and configuring them to synchronize with each other. This approach provides higher availability and fault tolerance than a standalone Redis installation. Multiple Redis instances can be launched in different availability zones or regions to minimize inter-region traffic impact. Cluster setups typically consist of three or five master nodes and an arbitrary number of replica nodes. The master nodes handle all read and write requests, whereas the replica nodes serve as backups to ensure high availability in case of node failures. Additional configurations like sharding and auto-sharding can be used to further distribute the workload across multiple nodes and improve performance.

3.2.3 AWS ElastiCache for Redis
Amazon Web Services Elasticache for Redis is a managed service provided by AWS that simplifies the deployment and management of Redis instances. It is highly available and cost-effective alternative to self-managed Redis installations. The service offers replication, auto-failover, backups, patching and metrics reporting features making it well suited for mission-critical Redis deployments. Access control policies can be easily controlled using IAM roles.

3.2.4 GCP Memorystore for Redis
Google Cloud Platform Memorystore for Redis is a fully managed service provided by GCP that offers a high availability, geographically distributed and regionally redundant Redis deployment option. It provides faster read and write latencies compared to typical on-premises deployments. It is ideal for applications that require low latency and high availability. Access control policies can be controlled using IAM roles.

3.2.5 Azure Cache for Redis
Microsoft Azure Cache for Redis is a fully managed service provided by MSFT that offers a fast, scalable and highly available Redis deployment option. It comes with dedicated resources for each cache and helps meet SLAs without any SPOF. It supports clustering, high availability, back-up and restore functionalities making it a good choice for mission-critical Redis deployments. Access control policies can be easily controlled using RBAC.

3.2.6 Dockerized Redis Deployment
Redis can be dockerized to simplify the deployment process and automate the configuration process. It takes care of downloading the latest version of Redis and creating the necessary Dockerfile. Using containers makes it easier to manage and update Redis instances without affecting the host system. Containers can be scheduled using Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc., allowing for easy deployment and management of distributed Redis environments.

3.3 Performance Tuning Techniques
To obtain optimal performance, it is important to tune the following parameters: maxclients, tcp-backlog, daemonize, rdbcompression, rdbchecksum, slowlog-log-slower-than, notify-keyspace-events, hash-max-ziplist-entries, hash-max-ziplist-value, list-max-ziplist-size, list-compress-depth, set-max-intset-entries, zset-max-ziplist-entries, zset-max-ziplist-value. Here are a few tips to improve Redis performance:

3.3.1 Configure Maxclients Parameter
By default, Redis sets the maximum number of simultaneous client connections to 10,000. However, increasing this value may lead to connection timeouts and other related problems. The value can be adjusted using the "maxclients" parameter in the redis.conf file. A rule of thumb is to set the maxclients parameter to no less than twice the expected peak concurrent connections.

3.3.2 Disable TCP NoDelay Option
TCP_NODELAY option disables Nagle algorithm, which delays small packets to combine them into larger frames, leading to improved throughput. However, disabling this option may cause significant performance degradation under heavy write loads. To disable it, modify the /etc/redis/redis.conf file and set "tcp-nodelay yes". 

3.3.3 Enable Linux Swap On Disk
Swapping occurs when the system runs out of physical memory, causing the contents of memory pages to be moved to swap space on disk. Without enough swap space, the kernel will start killing processes randomly, leading to decreased throughput. Enabling swap on disk can significantly improve Redis performance by temporarily storing frequently accessed data in RAM rather than swapping it to disk. Check the free and used amounts of swap space using the "swapon -s" command. To turn on swap on disk, run the "sudo dphys-swapfile swap[on]" command. Modify "/etc/fstab" to add a line that specifies the location and size of the swap partition. Restart the computer to activate the changes.

3.3.4 Configure Slow Log Threshold
Slow log threshold limits the duration for which a command is logged to the slow log. Any command exceeding this threshold is logged regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. The default threshold is zero seconds, indicating that no logging is done. Setting the threshold to a reasonable value, say 1 millisecond, can greatly reduce the overhead caused by frequent slow queries.

3.3.5 Use Faster CPUs
Using faster CPUs can significantly improve Redis performance. Newer Intel processors have numerous optimizations like Turbo Boost technology that enable CPU cores to run faster than rated in order to attain increased performance. Furthermore, modern CPUs usually come with multiple cores, allowing Redis to take advantage of parallel processing opportunities.

3.3.6 Use Better Network Hardware
Modern network hardware, specifically gigabit ethernet interfaces, can significantly improve Redis performance. Besides improving bandwidth, newer interface cards like ConnectX-5 provide high packet rates and low jitter, improving Redis performance by reducing round trip times (RTT) and congestion.

4.1 Running Redis Instances Locally
Installing and running Redis locally can be challenging especially for beginners. However, it can be helpful in testing and debugging purposes. Follow these steps to run a local Redis instance on your machine:

1. Download and extract the latest stable release from https://redis.io/download. Select the appropriate binary distribution based on your operating system and processor architecture.

2. Copy the downloaded binary to a folder such as ~/bin/. Make sure that this folder is included in your PATH variable so that you can execute the redis-server executable from anywhere on your machine.

3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the binary files. Start the Redis server by typing the following command:

   ```
   $./redis-server
   ```

4. Verify that the Redis server started successfully by checking the output in the console window. You should see the following message indicating that Redis is ready to accept connections:

   ```
   19051:C 01 Aug 2020 21:09:07.257 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo
   19051:C 01 Aug 2020 21:09:07.257 # Redis version=5.0.7, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=19051, just started
  ...
   ```

5. Install a Redis client library if needed. Many programming languages have official Redis drivers and bindings that can be installed using package managers like pip or npm. Alternatively, you can download third-party clients such as RedisInsight or Redis Commander from the official website.

6. Create a Redis client object and connect to the local Redis server by specifying the port number:

   ```
   import redis
   conn = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
   ```

   This connects to the default Redis instance running on localhost, listening on port 6379. If you want to connect to a remote Redis instance instead, specify the hostname or IP address and port number accordingly.

7. Now you can interact with the Redis server using the client methods. For example, to set a key-value pair:

   ```
   conn.set('mykey','myvalue')
   ```

   And to retrieve the value later:

   ```
   value = conn.get('mykey').decode()
   print(value)   # Output: myvalue
   ```

8. If you encounter any issues with the local Redis installation, refer to the troubleshooting section on the Redis website for solutions.

4.2 Configuring Redis Security
Securing Redis requires careful attention to security-related configuration settings and procedures. The following points highlight some best practices for securing Redis:

1. Limit Access to Local Host Only
By default, Redis accepts connections only from trusted clients on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1). If external clients need to access Redis, it is recommended to bind it to a public IP address or disable the loopback binding completely. Do this by editing the "bind" directive in the redis.conf file and setting the address to "*" (all IPv4 addresses) or "::1" (all IPv6 addresses) respectively.

2. Require Password Authentication
Password authentication can be enabled by setting the "requirepass" directive in the redis.conf file. This setting is optional but highly recommended to prevent unauthorized access to Redis. All clients connecting to Redis must present a password before accessing it.

3. Secure Communication Channels
SSL/TLS encryption can be configured to encrypt communication between Redis clients and the server. Set the "ssl-cert-file" and "ssl-key-file" directives in the redis.conf file to specify the paths to the certificate and private key files. Clients connecting to Redis must also validate the server certificate by either trusting a CA certificate bundle or verifying the server hostname.

4. Monitor Redis Activity
Monitoring Redis activity is critical to detect any suspicious activities and potential threats. Redis includes several built-in tools for monitoring activity, including client list, info command, latency command, slowlog command and pubsub channels. The client list command displays a list of connected clients along with their IP addresses and idle times. Info command displays a variety of runtime statistics, including memory usage, persistence, replication, network, and command statistics. Latency command reports the average response time of Redis commands. Slowlog command records all commands exceeding a specified execution time threshold, which can be useful for identifying slow queries or abnormal behavior. Pubsub channels can be used to receive notifications about events occurring in the Redis cluster.

5. Backup Redis Data
Regular backups of Redis data are essential to recover from data loss or corruption. Redis provides several backup options including RDB snapshots, AOF rewrite logs, and manual dumps. Snapshots are saved at regular intervals and contain the complete dataset, including keys and values. Rewrites append every write operation to the AOF log, which allows for much faster rollbacks in case of crashes. Manual dumps can be taken at any point in time and restored later. Ensure that your backup strategy is appropriate for your business requirements.
