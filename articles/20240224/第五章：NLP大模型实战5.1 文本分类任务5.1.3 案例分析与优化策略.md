### 5.1 Background Introduction

Text classification is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which assigns predefined categories or labels to text data. With the rapid development of deep learning, various large models have been widely used in text classification tasks and achieved impressive results. In this chapter, we will introduce the practice of NLP large models in text classification tasks, analyze a specific case, and propose optimization strategies.

#### 5.1.1 Overview of Text Classification

Text classification has numerous applications, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic identification, and text categorization. The basic idea is to train a model with labeled text data, where each text belongs to one category or label. During the training process, the model learns to extract features from text and map them to corresponding labels. After training, the model can predict the category or label of new coming text data.

#### 5.1.2 Development of Text Classification

Traditional text classification methods mainly include Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and n-gram. However, these methods heavily rely on feature engineering and lack the ability to capture semantic information. With the emergence of deep learning, word embeddings, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer have been applied to text classification tasks and significantly improved the performance.

### 5.2 Core Concepts and Connections

Text classification involves several core concepts, including text representation, neural network architectures, attention mechanisms, transfer learning, and fine-tuning. We will introduce these concepts and their connections in this section.

#### 5.2.1 Text Representation

Text representation aims to convert text data into numerical vectors that can be fed into machine learning algorithms. Common text representation methods include Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, word embeddings, and character-level representations. BoW and TF-IDF are based on the frequency of words, while word embeddings and character-level representations capture the semantic information of words and characters.

#### 5.2.2 Neural Network Architectures

Neural network architectures are essential components of large NLP models, including CNN, RNN, LSTM, and Transformer. These architectures can effectively extract features from text and capture the dependencies between words.

#### 5.2.3 Attention Mechanisms

Attention mechanisms allow the model to selectively focus on important parts of input data and improve the performance of text classification tasks. There are different types of attention mechanisms, such as self-attention, multi-head attention, and query-key-value attention.

#### 5.2.4 Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning

Transfer learning and fine-tuning are techniques for reusing pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Pre-trained models are trained on massive amounts of data and can capture general language patterns and semantics. By fine-tuning these models on specific tasks, we can leverage their knowledge and achieve better performance than training from scratch.

### 5.3 Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps

In this section, we will introduce the algorithm principles and operational steps of text classification based on large NLP models.

#### 5.3.1 Text Preprocessing

Before feeding text data into the model, we need to perform text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming, lemmatization, and padding. Tokenization is the process of splitting text into words or subwords. Stopwords removal is to remove common words that do not contain much information, such as "the", "a", and "an". Stemming and lemmatization aim to reduce words to their base or root form. Padding is to ensure that all text data have the same length by adding special symbols at the beginning or end.

#### 5.3.2 Text Embedding

Text embedding is the process of converting text data into dense vectors that can capture semantic information. Common text embedding methods include Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT. Word2Vec and GloVe are based on shallow neural networks and generate word vectors based
