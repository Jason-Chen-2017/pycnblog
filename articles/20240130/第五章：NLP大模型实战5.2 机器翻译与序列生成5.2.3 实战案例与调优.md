### 5.2.1 Background Introduction

Machine translation (MT) is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on translating text from one language to another automatically. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, neural machine translation (NMT), which uses neural networks as its core algorithm, has become the mainstream method in this field. Compared with traditional statistical machine translation (SMT), NMT can generate more fluent and accurate translated sentences.

Sequence generation is another important application scenario for NLP models, such as dialogue systems, story generation, and music composition. In these scenarios, the model needs to generate coherent and reasonable sequences based on given contexts or conditions. The algorithms and techniques used in sequence generation are similar to those used in machine translation.

In this chapter, we will introduce the basic concepts, principles, and methods of machine translation and sequence generation, and provide practical cases and optimization strategies. We hope that readers can gain a deeper understanding of NMT and sequence generation and apply them to real-world applications.

### 5.2.2 Core Concepts and Relationships

The core concept of NMT is the encoder-decoder framework, which consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder converts the input sentence into a continuous vector representation, which is then fed into the decoder to generate the output sentence. Both the encoder and decoder are usually implemented using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers.

The key idea of sequence generation is to model the joint probability distribution of the output sequence given the input sequence, i.e., P(y|x)=∏i=1nPyi|xi,y<1:i, where x is the input sequence, y is the output sequence, n is the length of the output sequence, and xi and yi are the i-th tokens in the input and output sequences, respectively. The goal is to find the most likely output sequence given the input sequence, i.e., argmaxP(y|x).

The relationship between machine translation and sequence generation lies in the fact that both tasks can be formulated as sequence-to-sequence problems, i.e., mapping an input sequence to an output sequence. Therefore, many algorithms and techniques developed for machine translation can also be applied to sequence generation, and vice versa.

### 5.2.3 Core Algorithms and Specific Operational Steps and Mathematical Models

The core algorithm of NMT is the attention mechanism, which allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each step. The most commonly used attention mechanism is the Bahdanau attention, which calculates the attention weights as follows:

$$\alpha\_t(s) = \frac{\exp(e\_t(s))}{\sum\_{s'}\exp(e\_t(s'))}$$

where st is the hidden state of the decoder at time t, et(s) is the alignment score between the input token s and the current decoder state, and αt(s) is the attention weight of the input token s at time t. The alignment score et(s) is calculated using a feedforward neural network with the concatenation of the encoder hidden state es and the decoder hidden state st as inputs.

Based on the attention mechanism, the decoder generates the output sequence one token at a time, by maximizing the conditional probability P(yt|xt,yt−1), where xt is the input sentence, yt−1 is the previous generated token, and yt is the current token to be generated. The conditional probability is calculated using a softmax function over the output distribution of the decoder, which is obtained by feeding the concatenation of the previous generated token yt−1 and the context vector ct into a feedforward neural network. The context vector ct is calculated as a weighted sum of the encoder hidden states, where the weights are the attention weights αt(s).

The specific operational steps of NMT can be summarized as follows:

1. Tokenize the input sentence and map each token to a unique index in the vocabulary.
2. Pad or truncate the input sequence to have a fixed length.
3. Feed the input sequence into the encoder and obtain the final encoder hidden state.
4. Initialize the decoder hidden state and the target sequence with a special start-of-sequence token.
5. Generate the output sequence one token at a time, by iteratively calculating the attention weights, the context vector, and the output distribution, and sampling a token from the output distribution.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 until a special end-of-sequence token is generated or a maximum sequence length is reached.
7. Postprocess the output sequence, such as detokenization and capitalization.

The mathematical model of NMT can be represented as a combination of several neural networks, including RNNs or transformers for the encoder and decoder, feedforward neural networks for the attention mechanism and the output distribution, and softmax functions for the final output.

### 5.2.4 Practical Cases and Optimization Strategies

To demonstrate the practical use of NMT and sequence generation, we provide two case studies:

#### Case Study 1: English-to-Chinese Machine Translation

We train an NMT model on a large parallel corpus of English and Chinese sentences, and evaluate its performance on a separate test set. We use the following optimization strategies:

* BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) tokenization: We tokenize the input sentences into subword units instead of individual words, which can handle unknown words and reduce the vocabulary size.
* Beam search decoding: We generate the output sequence by beam search, which maintains a beam of candidate sequences and expands them based on their likelihood. This can improve the fluency and accuracy of the translated sentences.
* Length normalization: We modify the objective function of NMT by dividing the log-likelihood of a candidate sequence by its length, which can prevent the model from generating excessively long or short sequences.
* Ensemble learning: We train multiple NMT models with different hyperparameters and combine their outputs using simple voting or linear interpolation, which can improve the robustness and generalization of the model.

#### Case Study 2: Story Generation

We train an NMT model on a large corpus of stories and evaluate its ability to generate coherent and reasonable stories. We use the following optimization strategies:

* Topic conditioning: We condition the model on a given topic or genre, which can guide the story towards a desired direction.
* Plan-and-write: We generate the story in two stages: planning and writing. In the planning stage, the model generates a high-level plan or outline of the story. In the writing stage, the model generates the actual text based on the plan.
* Diversity promotion: We encourage the model to generate diverse and creative stories by adding noise or randomness to the input or the model parameters, or by using reinforcement learning techniques.

### 5.2.5 Real Application Scenarios

NMT and sequence generation have many real application scenarios, such as:

* Cross-lingual information retrieval and search: NMT can help users find relevant information in foreign languages by translating queries and documents.
* E-commerce and customer service: NMT can assist businesses in communicating with customers in different languages, improving user experience and satisfaction.
* Multilingual content creation and localization: NMT can help create and translate multilingual content, such as websites, apps, games, and videos, making them accessible to global audiences.
* Intelligent dialogue systems and chatbots: NMT can enable natural and smooth conversations between humans and machines, providing personalized and efficient services.
