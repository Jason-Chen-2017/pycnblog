# 1.背景介绍


## 数据分析及挖掘的定义
数据分析（Data Analysis）或称数据挖掘（Data Mining），是指从大量数据中提取有价值的信息、建立预测模型、发现模式、改进系统的过程。数据分析的任务通常包括以下三个方面：
1. 数据获取：对原始数据进行收集、整理、转换等，形成结构化的数据集。
2. 数据清洗：通过数据过滤、消歧、补充、归类、关联等方式对数据集进行处理，去除噪声、提高质量。
3. 数据分析：对数据集进行分析，识别规律、建立模型，产生报表、图表、模型结果等输出。

数据分析的关键在于理解业务背景、选择合适的分析方法、利用统计模型、机器学习算法进行有效的挖掘分析，通过挖掘信息洞察商业、科技或组织现状，提供更加可靠的决策依据。一般来说，数据分析流程主要由四个阶段组成：获取、清洗、分析和总结。
## 大数据的定义
大数据是指海量的数据集合，来源广泛，具有多样性、动态性和复杂性特征，需要新型的处理手段和分析技术来对其进行建模、管理和应用。它包含两个主要特点：Volume(体积) 和 Variety (多样性)。大数据通常被分为结构化数据和非结构化数据两大类，结构化数据通常有固定的模式和字段，而非结构化数据则没有统一的标准，需要对其进行解析、处理才能获得有价值的结果。
## Hadoop的定义
Apache Hadoop 是一种开源框架，是一个分布式计算平台，用于存储、处理和实时分析大型数据集。它能够同时将数据存储到磁盘和内存上，支持离线和实时分析，并提供高容错性。Hadoop 的功能主要有：分布式文件系统（HDFS）、资源调配和排队（YARN）、MapReduce 框架。由于 Hadoop 在不同领域都得到了广泛应用，如数据采集、数据分析、搜索引擎、推荐系统等，因此也被称为“大数据堆栈”。
## HDFS的定义
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) 是一个开源的分布式文件系统，它能够存储超大文件的块（Block），并通过 copy-on-write 方法来避免读写冗余数据，它可以部署在廉价的机器上，提供高吞吐率的数据访问。HDFS 以流式访问方式处理文件，并提供了水平扩展能力，允许集群中的节点随时加入或者离开。HDFS 主要用途如下：
1. 批处理：适合于那些执行离线分析或实时数据交互的任务；
2. 大数据存储：HDFS 可以在不受限的硬件条件下存储和处理大量的数据；
3. 数据分析：基于 MapReduce 框架的 HDFS 可用于实时数据分析、汇总统计和数据挖掘。
## YARN的定义
Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN) 是 Hadoop 生态系统中的一个重要子项目，它是 Hadoop 2.0 的基础架构。它是一个轻量级的资源管理器，可以管理 Hadoop 集群的资源，包括 CPU、内存、磁盘等。YARN 将 Hadoop 分布式计算框架中的资源抽象为 Container。Container 是 YARN 中的最小资源单位，它封装单个作业所需的资源（如内存、CPU、磁盘等）。Container 是独立运行的，并可以在不同的节点上运行，以便充分利用集群的资源。
## MapReduce的定义
MapReduce 是 Hadoop 中最著名的分布式编程模型。它是一个编程范式，它将大数据集分割成独立的块，并将块映射到不同的数据集上。然后，它使用函数式编程模型（例如 map 和 reduce 函数）来处理这些数据集，即先将输入块映射到键值对上，再进行聚合运算，最后输出结果。在此过程中，MapReduce 使用了可靠的分布式数据传输协议（如 TCP/IP 或 RDMA）来确保高效的数据共享。
# 2.核心概念与联系
## 什么是 Big Data？
Big Data is a term that describes the explosion of large datasets and encompasses various sources such as social media, IoT devices, online retail transactions, etc., with ever growing sizes. It refers to the collection, storage, analysis, and interpretation of huge amounts of structured or unstructured data using computational methods like machine learning algorithms for better decision making in various industries including finance, healthcare, energy, transportation, manufacturing, telecommunications, and others. 

Big data technologies are revolutionizing different industries by enabling companies to gain insights into their customers, products, and business strategies through big data analytics. They have also transformed the way businesses collect, store, analyze, and interpret data, resulting in breakthroughs across many industries such as banking, insurance, e-commerce, marketing, supply chain management, technology, retail, and education. 

## What is Hadoop? 
Apache Hadoop is an open source framework used for storing, processing, and analyzing large datasets on clusters of commodity hardware. Hadoop provides high scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization while addressing issues such as high availability, data locality, security, and performance. 

It consists of several components that work together:

1. The Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): This is a distributed file system that stores files on commodity machines in a cluster and supports scaling horizontally. It provides high availability through replication and automatic failover capabilities. 

2. The Apache Hadoop YARN Application Scheduler: This component schedules and monitors containers on nodes in the Hadoop cluster based on user requests. It handles failures gracefully and optimizes resources usage.

3. The Apache Hadoop MapReduce Framework: This is a programming model used to process and analyze large datasets by breaking them down into smaller chunks and mapping these chunks to various nodes in the Hadoop cluster. The results from each chunk can then be aggregated and processed further for final output. 

4. The Apache Hadoop Common Utilities: These include libraries common to all Hadoop components, such as command line interfaces, input/output formatters, and configuration parameters. 

## What is HDFS?
HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System which is a distributed file system designed to scale up to handle large volumes of data across multiple servers, providing high throughput access to big data. HDFS was first developed at the University of California, Berkeley as part of Google's GFS project. In Hadoop 2.x, it has become the core Hadoop storage layer and replaces the original Namenode and Datanode architecture. 

The primary features of HDFS are:

1. Scalable Architecture: HDFS is highly scalable and fault tolerant. It can easily manage petabytes of data and thousands of clients without any single point of failure. 

2. Block Size and Replication: Files in HDFS are split into blocks of fixed size and replicated over a configurable number of copies. This ensures that even if a node fails, the data is still accessible. 

3. Data Locality: HDFS delivers low latency reads and writes by keeping data in the same physical location. This improves data transfer speed and reduces network traffic. 

## What is YARN?
Yarn is the next generation of Hadoop's resource negotiation layer and is responsible for managing cluster resources and scheduling jobs across multiple nodes. It manages both shared resources and exclusive resources, allowing multiple applications to share a single instance of a service when necessary. Jobs submitted to YARN run inside containerized environments called Containers, which provide isolation and encapsulation for processes and resources. The key features of YARN are:

1. Job Scheduling: YARN assigns resources efficiently based on workload demand and available resources. It prioritizes jobs based on priority and fairness policies, ensuring optimal use of resources. 

2. Node Management: With YARN's advanced scheduler, administrators can control how tasks are assigned to individual nodes, giving greater control over resource allocation. 

3. Service Integration: YARN offers integration with services such as HBase, Kafka, Hive, Spark, Presto, and Impala, simplifying development and deployment of complex applications. 

## What is MapReduce?
MapReduce is one of the most commonly used frameworks for handling big data in Hadoop. It is built around two main functions - Map and Reduce. Map takes input data and produces intermediate key-value pairs. Then, they are sorted and partitioned by key. The intermediate values are then passed on to the reducer function, which performs aggregation operations on the intermediate key-values. Finally, the reduced result is written back to disk or printed out for display purposes. The key features of MapReduce are:

1. Easy Programming Model: MapReduce enables developers to write programs quickly and easily by abstracting away much of the complexity of distributed computing. 

2. Fault Tolerance: MapReduce automatically recovers from failed tasks during job execution, ensuring reliable processing of large datasets. 

3. Scalability: MapReduce is designed to handle very large datasets and scales well with increased processing power.
