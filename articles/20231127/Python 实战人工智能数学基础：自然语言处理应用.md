自然语言处理（NLP）是机器学习、自然语言生成、以及语言理解等领域的基础研究。随着深度学习在文本处理上的突破，NLP也进入了一个新的阶段——文本处理中基于深度学习的技术也越来越多。许多高质量的NLP工具已经被开发出来，如Google的TensorFlow Hub中的BERT、XLNet，Facebook的ParlAI，微软的LUIS等等。本文将采用现代化的方法对传统的NLP任务——词性标注、命名实体识别、文本摘要、问答匹配等进行实战的讲解。

NLP任务包括但不限于以下几个方面：

1. 词性标注：即给每个单词（或句子）确定其词性标签，如名词、动词、形容词等。

2. 命名实体识别：从文本中抽取出人名、地点、组织机构、时间等具体实体。

3. 情感分析：通过分析语句的情绪、态度、喜好等特征进行判断。

4. 抽取式文本 summarization：根据原始文本，自动生成一份简洁版本。

5. 生成式文本 completion：根据用户提供的信息补全文字。

6. 对话系统 Dialogue System：一种具有交互性、体验优良的自然语言处理技术。

7. 文本匹配：用来查找相似文本或分类文本类别。

8. 文档相似度：衡量两个文档间的内容相似度。

9. 推荐系统：针对用户兴趣建模，给用户推荐合适的信息。

10. 拼写纠错：自动对拼写错误的文本进行纠正。

在本文中，将主要探讨词性标注、命名实体识别以及文本摘要这三个任务的实现。希望读者能够藉此了解这些任务背后的数学原理以及深度学习框架的实际应用。
# 2.核心概念与联系
## 2.1 词性标注
词性（Part of Speech）通常是一个词的基本语法关系。不同词性对应不同的词义，例如：形容词“美丽”可以指明一个事物的外观，但是也可能用来表示名词“美女”。因此，对每一个词赋予相应的词性标签是NLP任务中最基础的工作之一。下面是英语词性标记规则的例子：

- noun (名词) : person, place, book, company, country, etc.
- verb (动词) : eat, run, study, sleep, work, etc.
- adjective (形容词) : beautiful, tall, happy, sad, clean, etc.
- adverb (副词) : very, often, always, here, now, etc.
- pronoun (代词) : he, she, it, this, that, these, those, etc.
- determiner (限定词) : the, a, an, his, her, its, my, your, their, our, etc.
- conjunction (连词) : and, but, or, yet, so, because, while, if, then, unless, afterward, when, as, until, since, before, whenever, although, whatever, whereas, wherever, whether, why, whatsoever, how, therefore, necessarily, inasmuch, instead, consequently, besides, particularly, likewise, by comparison, hence, instead of, nevertheless, still, anyway, despite, rather than, meanwhile, though,
