# 1.背景介绍


Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning approach that combines supervised and unsupervised techniques to learn from partially labeled data, allowing the algorithm to leverage both positive and negative information. This allows for more accurate predictions by taking into account partial knowledge about the problem domain. 

Over the past few years, semi-supervised learning has emerged as an increasingly popular technique in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, it remains difficult to understand how different methods work, which makes choosing the right method challenging for newcomers. In this review article, we will attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of existing semi-supervised learning algorithms and their advantages/disadvantages along with a detailed explanation of each algorithm's core concepts and mathematical models. We will also present concrete examples of applying these algorithms using real-world datasets, highlighting its ability to improve model performance and accuracy compared to conventional supervised learning approaches. Finally, we will explore future research opportunities and challenges related to semi-supervised learning.

This article will be useful to anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of what semi-supervised learning is all about and why it is so effective. It can also serve as a reference guide for researchers and developers looking to implement or extend existing techniques within a particular application area. Additionally, it provides a platform for discussion among experts on different topics related to semi-supervised learning, offering insights and inspiration for further exploration and development. 

 # 2.Core Concepts and Connections
In order to fully grasp the working principles behind semi-supervised learning, we need to first cover some basic background concepts and ideas. These include:

1. **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**: The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning lies in whether there are pre-defined labels assigned to training data or not. Supervised learning requires labeled data where the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on known relationships. On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require any labeled data, instead relying solely on the input structure to make inferences about hidden patterns in the data.

2. **Label Propagation:** Label propagation refers to the process of passing label information from one node to another in a graph based on similarity measures between nodes' features. Nodes with similar features are assumed to belong to the same class and propagated throughout the network until they reach a consensus on the most likely classification.

3. **Ensemble Methods:** Ensemble methods combine multiple models together to produce better results than individual ones. One example of ensemble method used in semi-supervised learning is the Co-training algorithm, which trains two classifiers simultaneously while minimizing disagreement between them through carefully selected pairwise combinations of labeled and unlabeled samples.

4. **Active Learning:** Active learning involves selecting informative queries to ask the user beforehand rather than relying entirely on labeled data. There are several strategies available such as uncertainty sampling, margin sampling, or committee sampling, which select the most valuable queries to ask at each iteration.

5. **Transfer Learning:** Transfer learning involves reusing previously learned representations from a fixed source task (e.g., image classification) for a target task (e.g., sentiment analysis). The goal is to adapt the representation to the new task without requiring extensive fine-tuning or retraining of the model.

6. **Negative Transfer:** Negative transfer refers to when a model trained on one set of tasks performs well on another but fails miserably on newly encountered out-of-distribution (OOD) test cases. To address OOD scenarios, negative transfer uses auxiliary losses to push the model towards generalization beyond seen domains. Examples of negative transfer methods include generative adversarial networks (GANs), VAT (virtual adversarial training), and DANN (domain adaptation neural network).

These concepts and ideas play a crucial role in the design and evaluation of semi-supervised learning algorithms. Understanding their interrelationships helps us develop intuition and improve our overall understanding of the field.
