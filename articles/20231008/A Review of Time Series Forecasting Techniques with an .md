# 1.背景介绍


Time series forecasting is a very important problem in various fields such as finance, economics, and weather forecasting etc. The goal of time series forecasting is to predict future values of the dependent variable (or target) based on historical observations. It has many applications ranging from demand prediction in retail industry to price prediction for stocks or commodities, traffic flow prediction for transportation sector, solar energy production planning, medical diagnosis etc. In this review article, we will focus on techniques used by healthcare organizations. 

Healthcare organizations face multiple challenges including shortage of resources, high costs, and uncertainty. One common approach towards solving these challenges is using machine learning algorithms to develop models that can accurately predict the future behavior of patients’ health status. These predictions help them make informed decisions about patient care and resource allocation, leading to improved efficiency and profitability. Various types of time-series data are commonly used in healthcare organizational settings. They include clinical measurement data collected from hospital systems, physical measurements such as blood pressure and temperature recorded during routine lab tests, imaging data captured during diagnostic procedures like X-rays and MRI scans, and vital signs recorded every minute or second by health monitoring devices installed around hospitals. Therefore, it becomes essential to have efficient forecasting tools that can effectively utilize all available information to provide accurate and reliable predictions.

In recent years, numerous researchers have proposed several different methods for time series forecasting in healthcare. This includes classical methods such as Arima model, ETS model, TBATS model, VAR model, and deep neural networks, which use traditional statistical approaches to extract relevant features and build models. On top of these, modern approaches incorporate advanced deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and generative adversarial networks (GAN) that are capable of capturing complex temporal patterns within the data. Additionally, some techniques specifically targeted at healthcare domain also exist such as self-supervised learning, multi-task learning, and transfer learning. However, most of these techniques rely heavily on labeled data and performances may not be optimal when dealing with sparsely labelled datasets or limited computational resources. Thus, there is a need for further investigation into developing new techniques that can improve the performance of current time series forecasting models while utilizing more unlabeled data and leveraging computing power for faster predictions. 

# 2.Core Concepts and Related Techniques
## Basic concepts
The basic concepts involved in time series forecasting include:

1. Trend – describes how the value of the time series changes over time. It can be either increasing or decreasing and can last for several days or months without any clear pattern.

2. Seasonality - describes periodic fluctuations that occur over a fixed period of time such as daily seasonality, weekly seasonality, monthly seasonality, quarterly seasonality, yearly seasonality.

3. Cyclicity – represents repeating patterns that repeat themselves over a finite number of cycles such as annual cycles, semiannual cycles, trimester cycles, quaterly cycles, monthly cycles, weekly cycles, daily cycles. 

4. Noise – random variations in the time series that cannot be explained by trend, seasonality, cyclicity. There could be noise due to systematic errors or natural variance in the data.

These basic concepts are closely related to four main categories of time series forecasting techniques:

1. Linear Model – This technique involves fitting linear regression models to the past data points to capture the overall trend and cyclical patterns. Other than simple moving average and weighted moving average, other popular methods included Moving Average (MA) model, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES).

2. Non-linear Methods – This category comprises various non-linear models such as AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, and Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model. These models capture non-linear relationships between variables by modeling their dependencies through lags and leads.

3. Deep Learning Models – This category of techniques uses deep neural networks to capture complex relationships among time series data. The key idea behind deep learning models is to learn abstract representations of raw data using layers of nonlinear functions applied sequentially until convergence. Popular examples of deep learning models in this area include Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).

4. Hybrid Models – This technique combines both linear and non-linear models to achieve better accuracy and flexibility. For example, Holt-Winter’s exponential smoothing method is a hybrid of SES and ARIMA where both linear and non-linear components are combined to capture the underlying dynamics of the time series data. Similarly, N-BEATS is a combination of RNN, CNN, and transformer architecture that learns long range dependencies in the time series data and captures intermittent events.

## Comparison and Selection Criteria
Various criteria are used to compare and select the best forecasting technique for a particular dataset. Some widely adopted criteria include:

1. Accuracy – Measures the degree of closeness between actual values and predicted values. Lower accuracy indicates lower quality of the model.

2. Computational Cost – Indicates the amount of time required to generate predictions using a given model and computational resources. Higher computational cost requires higher level of expertise and equipment investment.

3. Flexibility – Determines whether the model is able to adapt to changing conditions and handle unexpected events well.

4. Scalability – Describes the ability of the model to process large amounts of data efficiently and quickly.

5. Stability – Evaluates the consistency of the results obtained from running the same model multiple times. If the results vary greatly across runs, then the model is said to be instable.

Overall, selecting the best forecasting technique depends on factors such as nature of the data, level of expertise in the field, desired accuracy and scalability requirements. Ultimately, the choice should be driven by the specific needs and constraints of the healthcare organizations.
