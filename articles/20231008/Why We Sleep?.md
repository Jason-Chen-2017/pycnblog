# 1.背景介绍


How many hours of sleep do you get each night? Doctors typically recommend seven to eight hours of moderate-intensity sleep per day, but research has found that people can actually fall asleep for longer or shorter periods depending on their mood and context. 

While the optimal number of hours of sleep varies from person to person and depends on factors such as lifestyle choices, medications taken, genetics, physical activity level, and age, it is important to maintain a healthy balance between restfulness and recovery during your slumber. Research suggests that getting more than four hours of uninterrupted sleep per night improves overall wellbeing and reduces stress levels.

But how does our body's natural circadian rhythm work? What are some key mechanisms that contribute to this cycle and how can we improve our sleep habits through these principles? And what types of medical interventions could be effective in enhancing our sleep cycles? These questions will be addressed in detail throughout this article. 

Let’s start by understanding why we sleep!

# 2.核心概念与联系
The sleeping brain requires at least two distinct stages of wakefulness before falling asleep: NREM (non-rem sleep) and REM (rem sleep). During NREM sleep, the brain prepares for sleep by processing information and building up its memory systems. During REM sleep, the brain enters a state of relaxation where the cerebral autonomic nervous system (CNS) undergoes recruitment and refinement, enabling the production of signals essential for maintaining homeostasis. This involves coordinating the body’s hormonal systems and regulating the electrical flow throughout the brain. The amount of time spent in REM sleep ranges from one minute to several hours per night.

To understand why we get less sleep when we feel happy or sad, let us consider the effects of increased oxygen concentration within the cells of the brain. In humans, neurons generate electrical signals that carry oxygen to other parts of the body including blood vessels and muscles. As we increase our heart rate and breathing frequency, our metabolism produces more insulin which helps to control glucose levels. If our blood sugar levels remain high even after increasing both our heart rate and breathing frequency, our bodies may continue to use those resources excessively. However, if we fall asleep while tired and don't have enough oxygen to properly process our thoughts and emotions, then our body won't be able to properly communicate with the outside world. Consequently, our brains enter an additional phase called AWAKE INTERMITTENT REM sleep, where our CNS remains responsive yet temporarily deprived of necessary signaling to support normal functioning. This condition is thought to occur following the transition back into REM sleep, during which much of the brain remains activated.

In conclusion, our physiology contributes significantly to maintaining the optimal balance between restfulness and recovery during our slumber. Our mental health and physical fitness play significant roles in promoting regular and productive sleep patterns, thus improving our ability to think clearly and function optimally. Nonetheless, there are numerous ways to address challenges associated with poor sleep quality and develop strategies for achieving better sleep hygiene practices. For example, having a balanced diet and exercise routine combined with appropriate nutrition can help to reduce feelings of discomfort or dissatisfaction caused by oversleeping. By taking a moderately low intake of caffeine daily, we can promote a more even distribution of sleep across our body, reducing oddities like rapid eye movements. Lastly, being mindful of our surroundings and exercising can also enhance our sleep. Understanding and managing our sleep behaviors can lead to improved outcomes for both individuals and organizations.

The main objective of NREM/REM sleep cycle is to restore our brain functions in preparation for waking up. To achieve this goal, the CNS undergoes dynamic recruitment and refinement. Recruitment refers to the activation of new neurons, whereas refinement refers to the improvement of existing ones. When we begin sleeping, our body releases certain chemical messengers known as neural-gated ion channels (NGICs), which stimulate the release of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and choline, which act as negative feedback loops to keep our body alert and ready to respond quickly to external stimuli. At the same time, our eyes close to prevent drowsiness and aches and pains. Meanwhile, our central nervous system paralyzes any movement involving the limbs to avoid sudden movements that might trigger seizures. Additionally, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contracts, causing tissue damage that weakens the parasympathetic nervous system. Once these early steps are completed, our body transitions to a phase of slow wave sleep (SWS), during which the CNS maintains its base level of functionality. Over the course of SWS, the CNS makes incremental adjustments to ensure optimal brain activity, allowing it to recover from any perturbations or disturbances in the environment that could cause its loss of communication or performance. Finally, once our body is fully alert, it enters deep-sleep, where no further signals are sent to the brain.

However, not all aspects of our sleep cycle are controlled equally. Some cellular processes like DNA repair, apoptosis, and melatonin synthesis require continuous or sporadic input from our neurotransmitters. Other components like endocrine pancreatic insulin secretion and myogenesis are dependent on repeated inputs from sleep. Therefore, long-term recordings of our sleep cycle allow us to identify and monitor changes in individual components of the circuitry responsible for controlling different phases of sleep. One particular component of the circuitry involved in controlling SWS is the sympathetic ganglion cells (SGCs), which receive input from both somatosensory and autonomic nerve fibers and contribute to generating REM waves. These cells produce periodic bouts of fast-wave activity, which together create complex waves known as awakenings. Each awakening lasts for approximately 50 milliseconds, and consists of multiple synaptic events, which propagate along electrochemical pathways to innervate downstream SGCs. Although there are differences in the way each type of SGC reacts to various types of stimulus, they form connections with similar molecules within the organism, enabling them to communicate effectively amongst themselves. Overall, the human body uses a variety of cell types and molecular mechanisms to coordinate its sleep cycle, and clinical studies have shown that the most common issues related to sleep are related to altered neuronal firing patterns or abnormal postural behavior.

In summary, to gain a deeper understanding of our sleep cycle, we need to look beyond basic biology and focus on how our body coordinates the activities of different cell types involved in maintaining homeostasis and delivering sensory and motor signals critical for successful navigation during sleep. Understanding the role of each component and identifying potential causes of disruption or deficiency in our sleep cycle can provide valuable insights into how to optimize and improve our sleep hygiene practices.
