# 1.背景介绍


Text classification is one of the fundamental tasks of natural language processing where a piece of text must be classified into predefined categories based on its content or context. In this article, we will see how to perform text classification by applying various machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest and Neural Networks in Python. The following steps are followed while performing text classification:

1. Data Preprocessing - This step involves cleaning the dataset and preparing it for further use. Various preprocessing techniques like stemming, lemmatization, stop words removal etc., can be used here.
2. Feature Extraction - After data preprocessing, features should be extracted from the text documents. We extract these features using bag-of-words model which means each document is represented as a vector consisting of word frequencies. We then convert the corpus to a matrix with rows representing different documents and columns representing unique words.
3. Model Training and Evaluation - We train our models on the training set and evaluate them on the validation set. We choose an appropriate metric to measure the performance of the classifier. Some commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc.
4. Prediction and Testing - Finally, we make predictions on new unseen test instances using our trained model. Based on the predicted classes, we evaluate the performance of our classifier and also analyze the results.
We will now proceed towards discussing about core concepts and algorithms involved in text classification process using above mentioned machine learning techniques.<|im_sep|>

# 2. Core Concepts And Algorithms
In order to classify texts into various categories, we need some basic understanding of the terms related to text classification and their relationship with other concepts. Let’s have a look at those concepts below:

## Term 1: Corpus
A corpus refers to a collection of texts that contains a large number of documents and their corresponding metadata. Each document represents an instance of a text. For example, in the case of news articles, a single article might correspond to multiple documents if there were comments made under that article. A corpus typically consists of millions or billions of individual documents. 

## Term 2: Document
A document refers to a sequence of characters or symbols that captures all the relevant information associated with a particular topic, event, or subject. Documents usually contain text, images, sound clips, or video footage, among others. Examples of individual documents may include books, research papers, blog posts, movie reviews, tweets, online forum discussions, customer feedback, medical records, emails, and more.

## Term 3: Bag-Of-Words
The Bag-Of-Words (BoW) approach represents a document as a sparse vector of word frequencies. Each element of the vector corresponds to a specific term in the vocabulary and has a count equal to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the document. The BoW representation provides a simple way of capturing the semantic meaning of the document without considering any syntactic structure or grammar relationships between the words.

For example, consider the sentence “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”. Here, the vocabulary would consist of the distinct words “quick”, “brown”, “fox”, “jumps”, “over”, “lazy”, and “dog” and the corresponding BoW vectors for each document would be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The first vector shows that both the words "quick" and "brown" occur once, whereas "jumps", "over", "lazy", and "dog" do not appear in the document and therefore they have a value of zero. Similarly, the second vector shows that only two occurrences of the words "brown" and "fox" occurred in the document.

## Term 4: Vocabulary
The vocabulary refers to the entire list of possible words that can occur in the corpus. It includes every word that occurs at least once in the corpus, regardless of whether it appears only once or many times. It defines the size of the feature space of the documents.

## Term 5: Class Labels/Categories
Class labels refer to the predetermined categories into which the documents can be categorized. These could be things like topics, events, sentiments, emotions, ratings, etc. Each document belongs to exactly one category out of the given set of categories. There can be multiple documents belonging to the same category. For example, in the News Article classification problem, the categories could be politics, sports, entertainment, business, technology, health, science, and so on.

## Term 6: Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning technique where the algorithm learns from labeled examples provided during training. During supervised learning, the algorithm learns to predict the output variable of interest based on input variables that are already known. The algorithm uses the labeled examples to learn the mapping function that maps inputs to outputs. Supervised learning problems involve regression, classification, and clustering. Regression problems aim to predict continuous numerical values, while classification problems aim to predict categorical outcomes. Clustering problems group similar objects together into clusters based on certain criteria.

## Term 7: Training Set & Test Set
Training sets are the subset of data that the algorithm trains on. They represent the data that was initially collected to build the model. The remaining part of the data is split into testing sets that the model is tested against after it is trained. The goal is to estimate the generalization error of the model on new, previously unseen data. If the estimated error rate on the testing set is high, it indicates that the model may not be robust enough to handle new data well. Therefore, hyperparameter tuning needs to be performed before deploying the model into production.

## Term 8: Overfitting & Underfitting
Overfitting happens when a model becomes too complex and starts memorizing the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. The model tends to perform very well on the training set but poorly on new, previously unseen data. This phenomenon is called bias-variance tradeoff. To prevent overfitting, regularization techniques like Lasso Regularization, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and Dropout are often used.

Underfitting happens when the model is too simple and cannot capture important patterns in the data. This leads to low variance and high bias in the model. To fix underfitting, we need to increase the complexity of the model by increasing the capacity of the network or adding additional layers to the neural network. However, if the added complexity doesn't help improve the performance of the model, we need to try alternative approaches like selecting better features, reducing noise in the data, or using ensemble methods.
