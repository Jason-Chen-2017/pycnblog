# 1.背景介绍


Interpretability refers to the ability of machine learning models to provide an explanation about their predictions and behavior. It is a crucial aspect in building trustworthy AI systems that can be used for decision-making or automated decision-support tools. 

Neuron relevance propagation (NRP) is a recent approach to interpreting neural network models by identifying the input features that contribute most strongly to the output of individual neurons in the model. The authors propose two modifications to traditional backpropagation algorithm which are:

1. Strengthening each connection based on its relevance score with respect to the final classification label predicted by the model. 

2. Normalizing all the weights across different layers to make them comparable among themselves.

The first modification stretches the importance of connections that have high relevance scores with respect to the prediction while weakening those with low ones. This ensures that only important features are considered while making decisions at each node of the model.

The second normalization technique helps to compare and analyze the relative contributions of nodes from different layers. Without it, there would not be any sense of the overall contribution of each feature in the entire network, as they may have vastly different scales depending on how many other features interact with them.

In this paper, we will demonstrate the benefits of incorporating these two techniques into state-of-the-art deep neural networks like BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa, both in terms of performance metrics and explainability abilities.

Our experiments show that NRP achieves significant improvements over various existing interpretability methods such as LIME and SHAP, especially when it comes to explaining black-box models like BERT, which often rely heavily on complex interaction between multiple features to produce accurate results.

Finally, our work provides a new methodology for analyzing and understanding complex NLP models, which opens up the possibility of developing more transparent and human-friendly NLP products and services.

## 2.1 Interpretability in Machine Learning
Interpretability refers to the ability of machine learning models to provide an explanation about their predictions and behavior. It is a crucial aspect in building trustworthy AI systems that can be used for decision-making or automated decision-support tools. In general, three types of explanations are commonly provided by machine learning algorithms -

### Local Explanation (LE): Explains how each individual data point or instance is classified by the model. These explanations describe why the model made certain predictions and what influences contributed towards it. Examples include random forests, support vector machines, and linear regression models. LE has the advantage of being easy to understand but it does not capture the interactions between features. Also, local explanations do not give insights into global structure of the dataset and cannot help identify causal relationships between variables. Therefore, LE is typically less useful than Global Explanation (GE).

### Global Explanation (GE): Captures the interactions between features and explains how they combined to form a particular prediction. GE shows how each component of the input contributes to the final outcome, providing a comprehensive picture of how the model arrived at its conclusion. GE uses gradient descent optimization or attention mechanisms to generate the explanations, which makes it slower and less interpretable compared to LE approaches. Examples include neural networks like convolutional neural nets (CNN), recurrent neural nets (RNN), and transformers. GE gives us a complete view of the dataset and its relationship with the target variable, but it requires careful interpretation because it treats every pair of features independently without considering the contextual relationship within a sentence.

### Counterfactual Explanations (CE): Provide alternative scenarios where a change in one or more inputs might lead to a different outcome instead of the current one. CE allows users to consider counterfactual cases where different choices could have been taken by different stakeholders to arrive at the same end result, rather than just focusing on the single current scenario. CE is particularly helpful for designing fairer policies and outcomes by allowing analysts to evaluate tradeoffs between potential impacts of different actions. However, CE has limitations since it assumes a specific set of assumptions regarding the nature of the changes and who was responsible for causing them. Additionally, CE requires computationally expensive simulations or approximation algorithms to generate explanations, making it difficult to scale well to large datasets.
