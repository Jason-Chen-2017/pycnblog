# 1.背景介绍


Data analysis refers to the process of extracting meaningful insights from large datasets by analyzing patterns and relationships among data points. In this book we will learn how to use the powerful Python libraries pandas and numpy for effective data manipulation, cleaning, processing, visualization, modeling, and machine learning tasks. We will start our journey with an introduction to basic concepts in data science such as data structures, types, and formats. We will also understand the importance of choosing the right tools for the job before diving into more complex topics like time series analysis, clustering, classification, and regression models. 

This book is aimed at data scientists who are familiar with programming languages such as Python or R but new to working with big data. The book assumes that readers have some familiarity with basic statistical concepts such as probability distributions, descriptive statistics, correlation and covariance, and hypothesis testing. It should be helpful for anyone interested in developing their technical skills and understanding fundamental principles behind data-driven decision making processes. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive reference guide for advanced users looking to develop specific domain knowledge and apply industry best practices.


# 2.核心概念与联系
## 1.Python数据结构
- Series: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
- DataFrame: A two-dimensional size-mutable, tabular data structure with columns of potentially different types.
- Panel: A three-dimensional labeled, array object that stores heterogeneous dataPanels are more rarely used than DataFrame objects. However, they offer similar functionality and can be useful when dealing with multi-level structured data sets.

## 2.NumPy数据类型
NumPy offers several built-in numeric data types: int, float, complex, bool, and datetime64. Each of these corresponds to its respective C language counterpart. The most commonly used integer data type is int, which corresponds to signed 32 bit integers on modern CPUs. The default floating point data type is float, represented using double precision arithmetic in C. Other numerical data types include unsigned ints (uint), longs (int64), floats (float32), complex numbers (complex64), booleans (bool), and datetimes (datetime64). Datetime64 represents dates and times in nanosecond resolution.

In addition to the above data types, NumPy has the following compound data types:
- Structured arrays: Arrays with compound data type where each element contains fields of different types.
- Record arrays: Similar to structured arrays but allows for named fields and multidimensional arrays within each field.
- Masked arrays: An extension of NumPy's core ndarray class that allows for masked values based on conditional masks.

## 3.Pandas数据结构
Pandas is a popular open source library for handling and analyzing tabular data. Its primary data structures are Series and DataFrame. Both structures are designed to handle missing data and have flexible size and shape. A key feature of both structures is that they provide easy-to-use indexing and labeling functions. They are ideal for working with messy data that may have irregular or inconsistent formatting, especially when combined with other libraries such as NumPy and Scikit-learn. For example, if you have a dataset consisting of multiple CSV files, Pandas makes it easy to concatenate them into a single dataframe and perform various operations across all rows and/or columns.

### 3.1 Series
A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type. It is analogous to a column in a spreadsheet. You can create a Series from a list, dict, or scalar value. If you pass a dictionary, the keys will be used as labels. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'age': [27, 32, 29], 'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']}
df = pd.Series(data)

print(df['age']) # Output: 27
                 #        32
                 #        29
print(type(df))   # Output: <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
```

You can access individual elements of the Series by specifying the index label inside square brackets. Alternatively, you can use boolean indexing to select specific values. 

```python
ages = df[df > 30]      # Returns only those entries greater than 30
names_with_a = df[df.str.contains('a')]    # Returns names containing "a"
```

### 3.2 DataFrame
A DataFrame is a tabular data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it as a spreadsheet or SQL table with rows and columns. You can create a DataFrame from a dictionary of lists or NumPy arrays, or directly from a file. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'age': [27, 32, 29], 'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'gender': ['F', 'M', 'M']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df['age'])            # Outputs: 0    27
                           #         1    32
                           #         2    29
                          # Name: age, dtype: int64

print(df[['age', 'name']])  # Outputs:    age        name
                        # 0      27    Alice
                        # 1      32      Bob
                        # 2      29  Charlie

print(type(df))             # Output: <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
```

You can access individual elements of the DataFrame by specifying the row and column indices or labels inside square brackets. Alternatively, you can use boolean indexing to select specific subsets of the data.

```python
male_names = df[(df['gender'] == 'M') & (df['age'] >= 30)]['name']

print(male_names)           # Outputs: 0    Bob
                            #         1    John
                            # Length: 2, dtype: object
```

### 3.3 Missing Values
Missing values in Pandas are represented by NaN ("Not a Number") values. There are several ways to handle missing values:

1. Drop Rows with Missing Values: Use `dropna()` method to drop entire rows with missing values.
2. Fill Missing Values: Use `fillna()` method to fill missing values with a specified value.
3. Impute Missing Values: Use imputation methods to estimate missing values based on available information.

Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'age': [27, None, 29],'salary': [50000, 75000, 60000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)                     # Output:
                                 age salary
                            0   27   50000
                            1  NaN   75000
                            2   29   60000

print(df.isnull())            # Output:
                               age  salary
                        0  False   True
                        1   True  False
                        2  False   True

print(df.dropna())            # Output:
                               age  salary
                        0   27   50000
                        2   29   60000

filled_df = df.fillna(value=0) # Fills missing values with zeroes
imputed_df = df.fillna(method='ffill') # Uses forward filling method to fill missing values
```
