# 1.背景介绍


Microwave ovens have been used since ancient times to cook meals and brew drinks in large quantities. Nowadays they are often employed as a tool for scientific research on heat generation processes by heating molecules or liquids at high temperatures. 

In recent years there has been an increased interest in microwaves technology due to its ability to generate strong electric fields that can be harmful for living organisms. Therefore, it is important to understand how quantum mechanics plays a role in these devices. This article focuses on understanding the basics of microwaves using concepts and terminology from quantum mechanics.

## 2.1 Atoms and electrons 
Atoms contain both coulomb interactions between them (between their nuclei) and weak interaction through their electrons (negatively charged particles). When atoms move towards each other electrons repel one another with electrostatic force while nuclear attractions pull them together like springs. 

Similarly, when we use microwave radiation we produce an electric field that acts on electrons, causing them to accelerate towards the direction of the source of energy. This acceleration gives rise to frequency shift which causes an alternating current flowing in the device. The movement of electrons also creates a magnetic field near the surface of the material where the magnetization increases leading to the creation of localised spin-orbital coherence states, known as spins. 



Electronic structure of an atom is determined by the number of valence electrons (electrons with unpaired protons) present in the system. Each orbital contains one doublet of electrons with opposite spins. These electrons occupy two distinct but complementary pairs of quantum numbers: l and m, corresponding respectively to the principal quantum number $l$ and the azimuthal quantum number $m$. The choice of values of these quantum numbers determines whether the state is ground, excited, singlet or triplet. In order for an atom to exist, there must always be some levels of occupation available along each axis.

The core electron, the electron that belongs to the innermost shell, is called the active electron and acts as the center of the nucleus during the motion of the nucleus. It acquires a positive charge because it is negatively charged compared to neighboring electrons. 

## 2.2 Quantum Mechanical Approach 
Quantum mechanics provides us with mathematical framework for describing nature of matter. We can decompose any physical system into smaller parts such that the constituents behave independently of each other. For example, if we consider a single electron, then its behavior can be described using Bloch's sphere representation. This approach allows us to derive the probability distribution functions associated with different electronic configurations. 


This configuration represents all possible ways of arranging the electron within its atomic shell. On this sphere, the color shows the orientation of the plane containing the electron. Blue points indicate spin-up orientations, while red points represent spin-down. The size of the point indicates the magnitude of the corresponding wave function. 

To obtain more precise results, we need to perform many measurements and determine the probabilities of observing certain configurations over time. However, this method becomes increasingly complicated as we increase the dimensionality of our model. Therefore, we turn to classical computing techniques to solve this problem efficiently. Classical computers simulate quantum mechanical models using algorithms such as Monte Carlo simulations and Metropolis algorithm. 

## 2.3 Resonance Effect
The resonance effect occurs when multiple emission lines of the same frequency appear simultaneously at a particular point in space. As a result, a beamsplitter is formed inside the device causing selective absorption of light in specific directions. Although the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon remains elusive, it is believed that it is caused by the way electrons interact with the vibrational modes of the surrounding air molecules. 

By studying the frequency spectra of various types of molecules, scientists have been able to identify several promising candidates for microwave devices. One promising candidate is the silicon dioxide, whose fundamental frequency is around 133 GHz. Other types of materials include gold, silver, copper, aluminium, iron, lead, and zinc oxide. These materials show significant promise as microwave devices that could transform science, engineering, transportation, healthcare, and other areas.
