# 1.背景介绍


Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep neural network that uses convolutional layers to extract features from input data, often used in image recognition tasks such as computer vision. The main advantage of CNNs over traditional feedforward networks like Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) is their ability to handle spatial relationships between pixels in an image or volume. They are commonly applied to analyze sequences of video or time series data. CNN models can also be easily fine-tuned for specific applications by adjusting hyperparameters during training. This article presents an example implementation of a CNN model using NumPy library with the help of the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known database of handwritten digits. 

In order to implement the CNN architecture, we will follow these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries and load the MNIST dataset.
2. Preprocess the data by normalizing pixel values and splitting it into training and testing sets.
3. Define the CNN model architecture.
4. Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
5. Train the model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
6. Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the test set.
7. Make predictions on new input data.

We will start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the MNIST dataset. After that, we will preprocess the data and define the CNN model architecture. Finally, we will compile the model, train it on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set. At the end, we will make some predictions on new input data. Let’s get started!

First, let's import the necessary libraries and check if they are installed correctly. If any module fails to install, please refer to the official documentation for installation instructions. 

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

Now, we need to download and prepare the MNIST dataset. Keras provides built-in functions to do so. Here, we will use `mnist.load_data()` to retrieve the dataset. It returns two tuples - `(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test)`. Each tuple contains 60,000 and 10,000 examples respectively, where each example represents an image of a handwritten digit along with its label. Note that X stands for "features" and Y stand for "labels". 

Let's split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`. We will reserve 20% of the data for validation. During training, we will update the weights of the model after each batch of training samples. Since we have less than one million samples, we will set the batch size to 128. We will repeat the process for at least three epochs before stopping.  

Finally, we will reshape the input data to match the expected dimensions required by the CNN architecture. Specifically, we will convert each sample into a grayscale image with width=height=28 and depth=1. We will also normalize the pixel values to lie between 0 and 1. This step is important because it helps speed up gradient descent convergence and reduces the risk of vanishing gradients.
