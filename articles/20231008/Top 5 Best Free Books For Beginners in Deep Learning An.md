# 1.背景介绍


Deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the way we work with machines to solve problems that were previously impossible or very time-consuming for humans. A large number of books are available on deep learning, including textbooks like "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al., which provide an excellent introduction to DL algorithms and techniques. In this article, I will be sharing a few of my favorite free books that can help beginner programmers learn more about DL and AI concepts, algorithms, and applications. The five books cover different aspects of DL and AI from theoretical foundations to practical implementation and application.

The first book is called "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", by <NAME>. It provides a good foundation for understanding how neural networks work, along with various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. This book also includes detailed explanations and visualizations of mathematical formulas used in machine learning algorithms. 

The second book is called "Python Machine Learning", written by <NAME> and <NAME>, and published by Packt Publishing. The book covers advanced topics such as clustering, regression analysis, and dimensionality reduction, using Python programming languages. It includes interactive code examples and clear explanations of the algorithms being implemented. 

The third book is called "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow", by <NAME> and <NAME>. The book explains the fundamentals of machine learning through hands-on coding activities. Each chapter starts with an overview of what the chapter aims to achieve, followed by step-by-step instructions on how to implement each algorithm in Python. The book uses Scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries for implementing machine learning models. 

Finally, the fourth and fifth books are called "Deep Learning with PyTorch: Quick Start Guide" and "Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch: An Introduction", respectively. These two books aim to introduce the readers to PyTorch, a popular library for building deep neural networks in Python. The former focuses on teaching PyTorch's basic functionality while the latter teaches reinforcement learning concepts through sample codes and exercises. Both books use PyTorch version 1.x. 

Overall, these five books should serve as a good starting point for any programmer who wants to get started with deep learning and artificial intelligence technologies. They offer solid foundational knowledge and intuitive explanations that allow developers to understand the core concepts behind the technology and apply them effectively in their projects. Additionally, they contain clear and well-written code samples that make it easy for developers to replicate and modify existing implementations or build new ones based on their specific needs. Overall, these books will help beginners gain a deeper understanding of how to develop complex AI systems and optimize them efficiently.

In order to fully grasp the content and capabilities of these four books, you need to have a strong background in mathematics, linear algebra, probability theory, and programming. The second and third books are highly recommended if you want to dive into deep learning and data science more deeply. Here's a quick summary of key concepts related to deep learning:

1. Neural Network - This is a type of supervised learning model where inputs are mapped to outputs via multiple layers of interconnected nodes called neurons. Neurons receive input signals, process them, and send output signals to other neurons within the network. The connections between neurons determine the direction of information flow and the strength of the signal passing from one layer to another.

2. Activation Function - This function takes the weighted sum of inputs from previous layers and passes it through a non-linear activation function that converts the output into a value within a certain range. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, softmax, and elu. 

3. Loss Function - This measures the error between the predicted output and the actual output values. The loss function quantifies the difference between the predicted and actual output values, so that the optimization algorithm knows how much to change the weights and biases in the network to minimize the loss. Commonly used loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), cross entropy, and binary cross entropy. 

4. Optimization Algorithm - This is the technique used to update the parameters of the neural network during training. Commonly used optimization algorithms include gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam, and AdaMax. 

5. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - CNN is a type of neural network architecture developed specifically for computer vision tasks. It consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, similar to traditional neural networks. The main differences are in the structure and operation of the layers, making them ideal for handling complex images or videos.

6. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - RNN is another type of neural network architecture designed specifically for sequential data, such as text or audio. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNN cells maintain a memory state that can store long-term dependencies between past inputs. RNNs are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, and time series prediction tasks.

7. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - LSTM is an extension of the standard RNN cell introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber in 1997. It adds a forget gate that allows the network to selectively remove information stored in the memory state. LSTM has been shown to perform significantly better than standard RNNs in a wide variety of sequence modeling tasks, such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, and speech synthesis.

These books explain the fundamental concepts behind deep learning and machine learning algorithms, but they don't always go into great detail. The following sections give a brief review of some of the most important concepts and operations used in the machine learning and deep learning domains. 

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This book provides a comprehensive explanation of how neural networks work, including their history, construction, and applications. It starts with an introduction to perceptrons, then moves on to modern neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Finally, the authors discuss several common issues in applying neural networks to real-world applications, such as overfitting and vanishing gradients.

## Python Machine Learning
This book introduces machine learning algorithms and tools using Python programming languages, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), clustering, and dimensionality reduction. The book includes interactive code examples and clear explanations of the algorithms being implemented, allowing readers to quickly master the methods without having to spend too much time reading dry materials.

## Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow
This book presents a complete guide to the field of machine learning using Python libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The book begins by explaining the basics of machine learning, including feature extraction, classification, and clustering. Next, the reader learns how to implement each algorithm in Python, using hands-on coding activities and clear explanations of how each step works. The final chapter discusses how to evaluate the performance of the learned models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

## Deep Learning with PyTorch: Quick Start Guide and Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch: An Introduction
Both books teach PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework in Python, from scratch. The first book starts with an introductory section on its purpose, installation, and basic usage. The author walks through creating a simple neural network from scratch, optimizing it using SGD, and deploying it for inference. The second book introduces reinforcement learning, discussing Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Q-learning, and shows how to create a simple agent using PyTorch and OpenAI Gym. Both books cover essential concepts such as tensors, modules, autograd, and callbacks, enabling readers to build upon the knowledge gained throughout the tutorial.
