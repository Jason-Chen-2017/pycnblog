# 1.背景介绍


Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as two separate fields over the past several decades with various applications in areas such as healthcare, finance, transportation, security, etc. As a result, this article provides an overview of AI and ML history from its birth to today's latest developments. 

# Introduction 
Machine learning is based on the concept that computer programs can learn by themselves from data without being explicitly programmed for it. It allows machines to recognize patterns, make predictions, and take actions on their own, thus enabling humans to interact more effectively with complex systems. In addition, artificial neural networks are used extensively in deep learning algorithms, which allow them to extract features from large amounts of unstructured or noisy data. This field has been gaining momentum in recent years due to widespread use cases in domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, recommendation systems, etc.

The term "artificial intelligence" refers to the development of machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, including reasoning, perception, problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity. The definition of AI includes knowledge representation, knowledge discovery, planning, reasoning, learning, and acting. While there exists some overlap between these topics, they are not mutually exclusive and complement each other closely. Overall, AI research encompasses many subfields including cognitive science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, knowledge engineering, robotics, philosophy, psychology, ethology, neuroscience, mathematics, statistics, and linguistics. 

# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the ability of computers to understand and manipulate human languages. Within NLP, we have text analysis, information retrieval, sentiment analysis, chatbots, entity recognition, topic modeling, named entity recognition, summarization, machine translation, and automatic question answering.

In general, natural language processing involves two main steps: tokenization and parsing. Tokenization splits the sentence into individual words or phrases, while parsing identifies the relationships between words within the sentence. For example, if you were given the sentence "I went to the store yesterday," tokenization might produce the tokens ["I", "went", "to", "the", "store", "yesterday"]. By analyzing the relationships between the tokens, parsing would identify that the verb "went" is modifying the noun "store." These techniques enable us to build sophisticated models that can process vast quantities of unstructured text and perform useful tasks like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, keyword extraction, document classification, spam detection, and topic clustering.


## Image Recognition
Image recognition involves identifying visual objects in images and classifying them according to predefined categories. A few popular examples of image recognition include facial recognition, object recognition, logo recognition, traffic sign recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous driving. Traditionally, image recognition systems involve handcrafted feature extraction, such as texture analysis, color histograms, and corner detection. However, modern approaches leverage deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and autoencoders, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of applications.


## Speech Recognition
Speech recognition involves transforming sound waves into text. Traditionally, speech recognition was performed using manually designed algorithms, but with the advent of deep learning techniques, we now rely on end-to-end architectures that jointly train acoustic models, language models, and decoding algorithms to improve accuracy. Some of the most commonly used speech recognition technologies include hidden Markov models (HMM), shallow feedforward networks (SFN), long short-term memory units (LSTM), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). 


## Robotics and Control Systems
Robotics involves building intelligent machines that mimic behaviors of animals, humans, and machines. Developing effective control systems for such robots requires advanced techniques such as model predictive control (MPC), reinforcement learning, optimization, and probabilistic inference. Robotics also plays a crucial role in medical imaging, industrial automation, and manufacturing. There are numerous applications in different fields such as logistics, construction, exploration, manufacturing, medicine, surveillance, drones, and automotive systems.


Overall, the combination of NLP, image recognition, speech recognition, and robotics offers a robust suite of tools for processing unstructured and structured data, extracting insights, and making decisions under uncertainty.
