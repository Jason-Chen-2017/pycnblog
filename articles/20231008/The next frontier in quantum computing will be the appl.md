## Quantum Computing and its potential for Cryptography and Security Applications
Quantum Computing is a promising technology that promises to revolutionize many fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Finance, Physics, Biology, and Chemistry. It offers significant advantages over traditional classical computing methods by taking advantage of the laws of quantum physics known as quantum superposition and entanglement. This creates new possibilities in machine learning, pattern recognition, molecular simulations, chemistry research, medicine development, finance, and energy industry. However, one big challenge lies in implementing quantum algorithms efficiently on large-scale systems and scaling them up with increased computational power. In this context, Cryptography and Security Applications are emerging areas where quantum technologies have great potential for enhancing security through advanced computation and parallelism techniques. These include secret key encryption schemes using public-key cryptography, blockchain consensus protocols, and secure multiparty computations. However, while there has been much progress made towards developing quantum algorithms for these applications, it remains an open question how effective they can be used in practice. Despite all the benefits brought forth by quantum computing, practical implementation challenges remain unresolved.

In view of the above situation, I am writing this article to explore the potential of quantum computers and their use cases in various cryptographic and security applications. The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive review of existing works related to quantum computing applied to cryptosystems and security applications and highlight current bottlenecks and future directions in applying quantum computers to enhance cryptographic security and efficiency. The articles will provide insights into the inner workings of quantum algorithms, explain how they can be used in specific cryptographic and security scenarios, demonstrate practical implementations, and discuss future directions in using quantum computers in real world applications. 

This work provides an opportunity for researchers, developers, and policymakers to better understand the implications of quantum computing in the field of cryptography and security applications and explore feasibility of leveraging the capabilities offered by quantum devices to address critical security concerns faced today.


# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
## What is Quantum Computing?
Quantum Computing refers to a subfield of computer science dedicated to modeling and simulating physical systems at the nanosecond scale. It uses concepts from quantum mechanics, including qubits (quantum bits), to perform calculations that cannot be achieved using digital computers alone. A quantum computer consists of quantum bits or qubits arranged in a quantum circuit, which can interact with each other in a quantum state called a superposition. The behaviors and properties of this system allow quantum circuits to carry out mathematical operations that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive for classical computers. Quantum computing has several potential applications ranging from artificial intelligence to biology and finance. Some notable companies that offer quantum hardware services range from Google’s X lattice, D-Wave Systems Inc., IBM Quantum Computers, and Rigetti Computing Platform. These devices enable quantum algorithms to solve problems that were previously thought impossible or too complex for classical machines. 

## Why is Quantum Computing useful in Cryptography and Security Applications?
As mentioned earlier, quantum computing offers several potential advantages over classical computing. One of the most exciting features is that it allows us to simulate quantum phenomena, such as spin states and electrons, which appear during the interactions between particles and interference. We can use these effects to design more efficient and reliable cryptographic algorithms. For example, Grover's Algorithm, which was first proposed in 1996, makes it possible to search very large databases with high probability. By optimizing our algorithm based on the properties of quantum superpositions, we can significantly improve performance compared to classical approaches. Similarly, Shor's factorization algorithm, also introduced in 1994, relies on the exponential nature of modular exponentiation to break integer factorization problems quickly even when dealing with large prime numbers. Using quantum computing, we can take advantage of both these techniques to construct more secure and scalable encryption schemes. Additionally, quantum cryptography may help pave the way for quantum communication networks that could potentially unlock breakthroughs in wireless communication, security systems, and data storage. Overall, quantum computing holds immense promise for addressing the fundamental challenges associated with information security and cybersecurity. 

## How Does Quantum Algorithms Work?
In order to implement quantum algorithms efficiently and effectively, we need to understand how they actually work. Quantum algorithms rely heavily on quantum mechanics and math concepts like tensor products, matrix multiplication, and quantum gates. Let’s go over some basic principles behind quantum algorithms: 

1. Superposition: In quantum computing, a superposition occurs when two or more states of a system are partially overlapping, giving rise to an intermediate state that represents all possible combinations of those individual states. Mathematically, if we write down multiple pure quantum states separated by a line, the resulting superposition looks different but mathematically identical. 

For instance, let’s say Alice wants to send a message consisting of three binary digits to Bob via teleportation. She needs to choose her own random bit string $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$. If she chooses $b_1=0$, $b_2=1$, and $b_3=0$ then the entire quantum state of Alice is $\alpha|0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are unknown parameters representing the amplitudes of the two possible pure states that make up her superposition. Similarly, if she chooses $b_1=1$, $b_2=0$, and $b_3=1$, then the entire quantum state becomes $\gamma|001\rangle + \delta|010\rangle + \epsilon|100\rangle + \zeta|111\rangle$, where each parameter represents another possible combination of four possible outcomes. 

2. Entanglement: Entanglement is defined as the property of two or more quantum bits being in superposition together. Mathematically, the act of creating an entangled pair of qubits results in them having the same quantum state, effectively encoding two pieces of information into a single entity. In other words, entanglement involves quantum information spreading throughout a network of quantum bits, rather than being isolated in independent systems. 

3. Measurement: Once a quantum gate is implemented on a set of qubits, measurement is performed on one of them. This changes the overall state of the system because measurements collapse the wave function, causing any non-measured modes to disappear, leaving only the measured mode(s). From this point forward, the system is described entirely in terms of that particular basis state. 

Now that we have covered some basics behind quantum computing, let’s move onto understanding what types of algorithms exist for quantum computers and their applications in cryptography and security.

## Secret Key Encryption Schemes Using Public-Key Cryptography
Secret key encryption schemes, also referred to as symmetric key encryption, are widely used in modern cryptography. They involve the use of a shared key to encrypt and decrypt plaintext messages. There are several varieties of these encryption schemes depending on the level of security required and the underlying mathematical assumptions. Here are some common examples: 

1. Data Encryption Standard (DES): DES is a block cipher encryption scheme that was designed in 1977. It offers 56-bit keys, which meets the requirement of strong encryption standards. It is vulnerable to attacks such as brute force and differential cryptanalysis, but it is commonly used due to its widespread acceptance and ease of implementation.

2. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): AES is a variant of DES that is more secure than older ciphers and offers higher levels of encryption strength. It operates on blocks of 128-bits, making it faster and more resistant to timing attacks. Its main component is the Rijndael block cipher, which is optimized for speed and effectiveness.

3. RSA: RSA is a public-key encryption scheme based on the difficulty of factoring large integers. It splits the key into two parts – a public key and a private key. The sender uses the public key to encrypt the plaintext, and the receiver uses the corresponding private key to decrypt it. The process requires careful generation of primes, public/private key pairs, and handling of padding.

These encryption schemes rely primarily on arithmetic operations, which is why they are relatively fast and easy to execute on classical computers. However, using quantum computers to increase the security of these encryption schemes is still an active area of research. 

## Blockchain Consensus Protocols
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that stores transactions in chronological order across a peer-to-peer network. In addition to storing transaction details, blockchains also maintain cryptographic proof of authenticity, integrity, and validity of the chain. Consensus protocols define how nodes reach agreement on the correct sequence of blocks and create a record of valid transactions within the network. Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol for achieving consensus amongst miners, whereas Ethereum uses PoS (proof-of-stake) protocol for building smart contracts and tokens on the platform. Both of these protocols operate under the assumption that participants hold certain amount of cryptocurrency stake to vote on valid transactions. Although these protocols are based on classic computer science principles, they can leverage quantum computing for increasing throughput and reducing latency, leading to faster confirmation times for transactions and lower transaction fees.  

## Secure Multiparty Computation
Secure multiparty computation (MPC) is a technique that enables multiple parties to jointly compute secrets without revealing their inputs. It combines cryptographic tools such as public-key encryption and homomorphic encryption to achieve privacy and security guarantees. There are several MPC protocols developed to support different types of applications such as linear regression, social choice functions, and electronic voting. Formal verification techniques are essential for ensuring the correctness of these protocols. While MPC is still considered experimental in these days, the recent advancements in quantum computing, cloud computing, and novel programming models are pushing the boundaries of what can be done with these techniques.
