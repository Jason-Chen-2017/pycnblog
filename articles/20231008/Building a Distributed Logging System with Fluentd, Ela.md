# 1.背景介绍

Fluentd is an open source data collector for unified logging layer that supports various input sources such as Apache Kafka, Apache Beats, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Google Stackdriver, or even standard syslog messages from servers running locally or in the cloud. It also provides easy-to-use filters to enrich, transform, and filter events before forwarding them into target storages like ElasticSearch or Splunk. 

Elasticsearch is a powerful distributed search and analytics engine designed for scalability, reliability, and high availability. It allows you to store, index, and analyze large volumes of unstructured text, numerical, or structured data quickly and in real time.

Kibana is an open source visualization tool that can be used to explore, analyze, and share information across various data sources in a single platform. It provides deep insights into log and metric data by providing powerful visualizations and dashboards based on user-defined queries.

In this blog post, we will demonstrate how to use these three technologies together to build a distributed logging system using AWS Kubernetes Service (AWS EKS). We will create an AWS Fargate profile that runs all the required pods, including fluentd, elasticsearch, and kibana, in separate containers within the same VPC. These pods will communicate over VPC endpoints and integrate seamlessly with AWS services like S3 and IAM roles for accessing other resources.

This solution architecture can help organizations with centralized logging needs collect, aggregate, and visualize logs from multiple application environments and hosts while ensuring security and compliance requirements are met. It also enables developers and ops teams to easily monitor applications without having to manually configure and manage complex systems. Overall, it makes organizations more efficient and productive while improving business agility and customer experience.


# 2.Core Concepts and Relationship
The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the different components involved in building a distributed logging system:


1. **Application**: Any software program or service that generates logs which need to be stored and analyzed centrally. Examples include web servers, databases, mobile app platforms, backend microservices, etc.
2. **Log Agents**: Collectors that run inside each host machine where applications are installed to capture, filter, and forward logs to the centralized log storage server. They usually have built-in support for common log formats and protocols, but can also leverage third-party plugins if needed.
3. **Log Storage Server**: This is a centralized server responsible for storing the collected logs and making them accessible to the analysis tools like Elasticsearch. Log storage servers typically provide APIs or interfaces for clients to access their contents, allowing different types of users to interact with the data based on their role or permissions. Some popular options include Amazon Cloudwatch Logs, Splunk Enterprise, or Sumo Logic.
4. **Elastic Search**: The main component responsible for indexing and searching the log data stored in the log storage server. It provides advanced querying capabilities like full-text search, geospatial queries, aggregations, and field mapping, among others. Elasticsearch uses Lucene as its core search engine to handle complex queries efficiently.
5. **Kibana**: A lightweight, open source frontend application that connects to Elasticsearch and provides a variety of features for analyzing and visualizing the log data. Users can create customizable dashboards, tables, charts, and alerts based on their query needs.
6. **S3 Bucket**: An optional component used for long-term storage of log files outside of Elasticsearch. If necessary, it can be used to archive old log data or move files between different nodes in the cluster for performance reasons. S3 buckets typically offer cost-effective data archiving solutions with automated lifecycle policies. 
7. **IAM Role**: An identity and access management (IAM) resource that grants specific privileges to a pod or container when they run within the cluster. It specifies what actions the pod or container can perform, who can access them, and under what conditions. In our case, we will assign it the necessary permissions so that the log agents can push logs to the log storage server and Elasticsearch, read indices and documents from Elasticsearch, and access S3 bucket objects if needed.

# 3. Core Algorithm & Operation Steps
## Step 1: Create a new VPC in your region
We will start by creating a new VPC in your preferred AWS region. You should choose one that has the desired configuration, such as subnets, route tables, and NAT gateways configured. Once created, you can add additional resources later depending on your workload.

```bash
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block <CIDR_BLOCK> \
                  --instance-tenancy default \
                  --query 'Vpc.{VpcId:VpcId}' \
                  --output json
```

Replace `<CIDR_BLOCK>` with the desired CIDR block range for your VPC. For example `10.0.0.0/16`. Make sure to note down the `VpcId` value returned after creation as we will need it later.

## Step 2: Create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC
Next, we will create an internet gateway and attach it to our VPC. This will allow us to connect our instances to the public internet.

```bash
GATEWAY_ID=$(aws ec2 create-internet-gateway \
             --query 'InternetGateway.{InternetGatewayId:InternetGatewayId}' \
             --output text)

aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --vpc-id <VPC_ID> \
                                 --internet-gateway-id $GATEWAY_ID
```

Replace `<VPC_ID>` with the ID of the VPC you just created earlier. Make sure to note down the `InternetGatewayId` value returned after creation as well.

## Step 3: Create Route Tables and Subnets
To enable communication between EC2 instances and the internet through the internet gateway, we must first create two route tables - one for the private subnet(s), and another for the public subnet(s). Each table will contain rules specifying how traffic should be routed, specifically to the internet gateway or any other endpoint. Then, we will create at least two subnets in each zone of our VPC to accommodate our instances. Note that we will only need one private subnet since our pods will not require direct access to the internet. However, it's always good practice to have at least two in case there is a disruption affecting one of the zones. Finally, we will associate each subnet with the corresponding route table.

Note: Replace `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, `us-west-2c`, and `eu-central-1a` with the names of your preferred availability zones for increased redundancy and fault tolerance. Also make sure to replace the IP addresses with valid ones in your chosen VPC.

Private Subnet:
```bash
SUBNET_ID=$(aws ec2 create-subnet \
            --vpc-id <VPC_ID> \
            --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24 \
            --availability-zone us-east-1a \
            --query 'Subnet.{SubnetId:SubnetId}' \
            --output text)

aws ec2 modify-subnet-attribute --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \
                                --map-public-ip-on-launch \
                                --group-id sg-xxxxxxxxxx # replace with appropriate security group id

RT_PRIVATE_ID=$(aws ec2 create-route-table \
                --vpc-id <VPC_ID> \
                --query 'RouteTable.{RouteTableId:RouteTableId}' \
                --output text)

aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id $RT_PRIVATE_ID \
                     --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 \
                     --gateway-id $GATEWAY_ID

aws ec2 associate-route-table --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \
                               --route-table-id $RT_PRIVATE_ID
```

Public Subnet:
```bash
SUBNET_ID=$(aws ec2 create-subnet \
            --vpc-id <VPC_ID> \
            --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/24 \
            --availability-zone us-east-1a \
            --query 'Subnet.{SubnetId:SubnetId}' \
            --output text)

aws ec2 modify-subnet-attribute --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \
                                --map-public-ip-on-launch \
                                --group-id sg-xxxxxxxxxx # replace with appropriate security group id

RT_PUBLIC_ID=$(aws ec2 create-route-table \
               --vpc-id <VPC_ID> \
               --query 'RouteTable.{RouteTableId:RouteTableId}' \
               --output text)

aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id $RT_PUBLIC_ID \
                     --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 \
                     --gateway-id $GATEWAY_ID

aws ec2 associate-route-table --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \
                               --route-table-id $RT_PUBLIC_ID
```

Again, replace `<VPC_ID>` with the ID of the VPC you just created earlier and `sg-xxxxxxxxxx` with the appropriate security group id for your VPC. Note that we don't specify the `--zone` option here because we want both subnets in all available zones. 

## Step 4: Launch the Cluster
Now we are ready to launch our Kubernetes cluster on top of our newly created VPC. First, let's install some prerequisites.

```bash
sudo curl -fsSLo /etc/yum.repos.d/docbook.repo https://www.redhat.com/sites/download/docbook/linux/docbook-6.xml && sudo yum update -y && sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.3 php7.3 && sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y nginx1.12 && sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo usermod -a -G docker $(whoami) && sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```

Then, we can install kubectl and eksctl, which we will use to deploy our cluster on AWS.

```bash
curl -o kubectl https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.12.8/2019-10-15/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x./kubectl && mv./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl && curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp && mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
```

Finally, we can create our cluster. We'll call it `logging-cluster`:

```bash
eksctl create cluster --name logging-cluster \
                      --version 1.12 \
                      --nodegroup-name fluentd-ng \
                      --node-type t2.medium \
                      --nodes 3 \
                      --region us-east-1 \
                      --zones=us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-west-2c,eu-central-1a \
                      --ssh-access \
                      --asg-access \
                      --full-ecr-access \
                      --cloudwatch-logs \
                      --vpc-private-subnets <YOUR_PRIVATESUBNET1>,<YOUR_PRIVATESUBNET2> \
                      --vpc-public-subnets <YOUR_PUBICESUBNET1>,<YOUR_PUBICESUBNET2> \
                      --serviceaccount-create \
                      --serviceaccount-roles eksctl-logging-cluster-admin-role \
                      --approve
```

Make sure to replace `<YOUR_PRIVATESUBNET1>`, `<YOUR_PRIVATESUBNET2>`, `<YOUR_PUBICESUBNET1>`, and `<YOUR_PUBICESUBNET2>` with the actual IDs of your private and public subnets respectively. This command creates a cluster with one node group called `fluentd-ng` consisting of three t2.medium nodes spread across four regions (`us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, `us-west-2c`, and `eu-central-1a`) for better resilience. By enabling SSH access, ASG access, full ECR access, and CloudWatch logs, we ensure secure access to our cluster and that our logs are automatically persisted in CloudWatch Logs for further monitoring. Lastly, we grant our `eksctl` installation permissions to create a dedicated IAM role for our pod execution context, giving us fine-grained control over what resources our pods have access to.
