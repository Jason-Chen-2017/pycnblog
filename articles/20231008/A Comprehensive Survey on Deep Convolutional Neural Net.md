# 1.背景介绍


Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is a powerful tool in medical image analysis field to extract valuable information from large amount of data and provide more accurate diagnosis or prognosis. This survey article will be helpful for researchers and engineers who are interested in applying deep learning methodology in biomedical imaging domain. 

Medical image analysis refers to the application of computer vision techniques to clinical and scientific domains such as radiology, pathology, and medicine. The goal of this research is to develop artificial intelligence-based algorithms that can identify patterns and features within medical images, accurately classify different types of diseases, predict patient outcomes based on their histories, and automate healthcare processes. Traditional approaches have been limited by processing speed and accuracy issues associated with traditional image processing methods. With the development of deep learning models like DCNNs, significant advances in image processing capabilities were made possible due to their ability to learn complex relationships between spatial structures and pixel values in raw digital images. 

In recent years, several deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architectures have shown impressive performance in various applications including object detection, semantic segmentation, and natural language processing. However, there has not been much attention given to how these networks work underneath the hood and what makes them so effective in solving medical imaging problems. In addition, it would also help to understand the key challenges faced by medical imaging researchers and developers and suggest future directions to improve the quality of life for patients. Therefore, in this article, we aim to provide an extensive review of the state-of-the-art DCNN architectures for medical image analysis and discuss important concepts behind them, explain how they operate and achieve high accuracy levels, and explore potential improvements. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of proposed solutions, we propose using public datasets for training and validation purposes. We will also use standard evaluation metrics like sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Together, this will allow us to quantify the generalization performance and compare different model configurations at test time. Additionally, we will use visualization tools to better understand how each model operates in real-time. Finally, we will conclude with some recommendations for researchers and developers who want to apply deep learning methods in medical imaging industry.

# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
Before diving into technical details, let’s first take a look at some fundamental concepts related to medical image analysis and DCNNs. Some of the core concepts include:

1. What is medical image analysis?
   Medical image analysis involves the use of various techniques involving computer science, mathematics, physics, and biology to analyze and interpret medical images. It helps to diagnose disease states, make predictions about future clinical outcomes, and optimize treatment strategies. 

2. Types of deep learning in medical imaging
    There are three main categories of deep learning techniques used in medical imaging domain – supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 

    Supervised learning involves labeling individual pixels or regions of interest in medical images with known characteristics like tumor cells or abnormal findings. These labeled data points serve as input to train machine learning models which learn to recognize similar patterns throughout the dataset.

    Unsupervised learning allows the algorithm to discover patterns in data without any prior knowledge of the target variable. Clustering algorithms like K-means clustering are widely used for identifying groups of similar examples in unstructured data like text or audio.

    Reinforcement learning enables agents to interact with environments through actions and obtain rewards. RL algorithms are used in virtual environments where an agent learns to balance between exploration and exploitation during decision making process. It is widely used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving domains.

    Overall, the need for expertise in biology, physical sciences, computer science, and mathematical operations is critical to implement successful medical image analysis solutions. 

3. Types of DCNN architectures
   Depending on the type of problem being addressed, DCNN architecture could vary from simple feedforward neural nets to complex deep networks with skip connections. Commonly used architectures include VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, and U-Net. Each of these architectures offers unique strengths and weaknesses depending on the nature of the task. Here's a brief overview of the most commonly used DCNN architectures for medical image analysis tasks:

   VGG Net: It is a lightweight and computationally efficient CNN architecture developed by Oxford University and uses multiple stacked 3x3 filters to perform feature extraction. Its design was inspired by the neurological visual cortex structure.

   ResNet: Residual blocks are built upon residual functions that act as additional layers added to a base function to reduce the complexity of the activation function, thus preventing vanishing gradients. They enable deeper networks while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem by adding non-linearities directly after each layer.

   DenseNet: DenseNet builds upon ResNet but introduces new modules called bottleneck layers that compress the number of channels instead of increasing the depth of the network. It reduces the memory consumption and computational requirements compared to other architectures.

   U-Net: An extension of the classic CNN concept, the U-Net combines fully connected layers with convolutional layers for improved localization and encoding features at multiple scales. It consists of two subnetworks - encoder and decoder.

4. Activation Functions
    Activation functions play crucial role in determining whether a neuron fires or not in a neural network. Different activation functions behave differently according to the properties of the problem being solved. Some popular activation functions for medical imaging are Sigmoid Function, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Leaky ReLU, Softmax Function, Exponential Linear Unit (ELU), and Tanh Function.

5. Data Augmentation Techniques
    One of the biggest concerns in medical image analysis is overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model fits the training data too well resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Regularization techniques like dropout regularization, weight decay, and early stopping are used to address overfitting. Another technique to deal with overfitting is data augmentation. Data augmentation is a strategy to increase the size of existing dataset by creating synthetic samples that mimic the variations present in the original data distribution. Popular techniques include rotation, scaling, shearing, horizontal flip, vertical flip, noise injection, blurring, and contrast stretching.

# 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
Now that you know the basics of medical image analysis and DCNNs, let's dive deeper into how these networks work. Let's start by understanding the basic building block of a DCNN architecture – convolutional layers.

1. Convolution Layer 
    The purpose of a convolutional layer is to extract features from the input image by convolving the image with a set of filters. Specifically, the output of a convolutional layer is computed as follows:
    
    Output = (Input x Filter) + Bias
    
    Where Input is the input tensor, Filter is the filter tensor, and Bias is the bias vector. 
    
    For example, if the input tensor has dimensions [BatchSize, Height, Width, Channels] and the filter tensor has dimensions [Height, Width, Channels_in, Channels_out], then the output tensor will have dimensions [BatchSize, Height, Width, Channels_out]. If BatchSize=1, then the notation simplifies further to [Height, Width, Channels_in, Channels_out].
    
    Intuitively, a convolution operation calculates the dot product between every region of the input tensor and its corresponding filter and adds up all the results. By doing so, it produces a multidimensional feature map where each element represents a particular pattern or feature detected in the input image. By stacking many of these convolutional layers, the network becomes capable of capturing multi-scale features.
    
2. Pooling Layers 
    Pooling layers downsample the feature maps generated by convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality and the amount of parameters required in subsequent layers. Two common pooling techniques are max-pooling and average-pooling. Max-pooling takes the maximum value inside a patch of the feature map and outputs the resultant feature map. Average-pooling takes the mean value inside a patch of the feature map and outputs the resultant feature map.
    
3. Fully Connected Layers
    The final stage of a DCNN architecture is the fully connected layer(FCN). FCN converts the flattened feature maps obtained by the previous stages of the network into a single dimensional output vector. Commonly, softmax function is applied before the output layer to convert the predicted probabilities into class labels.
