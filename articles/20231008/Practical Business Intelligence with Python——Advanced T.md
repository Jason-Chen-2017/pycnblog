# 1.背景介绍


Time series analysis (TSA) is a key technique for analyzing, forecasting, and modeling financial time-based data. It has various applications including stock market prediction, economic indicators monitoring, demand analysis of products or services, sales forecasting, fraud detection, etc. The practice of TSA requires proficiency in statistics, mathematics, and programming languages such as Python, R, MATLAB, etc. In this article, we will explore several popular packages in Python for time series analysis including Statsmodels, Prophet, and Pyflux. We will demonstrate how to apply these packages on real world problems to achieve effective business intelligence.
We assume that the reader has basic understanding of TSA principles and techniques, specifically linear regression models, ARIMA models, and VAR models, but not necessarily deep knowledge of statistical concepts and algorithms used by the packages. We also expect readers have some experience using Python and its scientific computing libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc., but no prior knowledge about specific statistical models and methods used by these packages. 

In summary, our goal is to provide practical guidance on applying advanced TSA techniques to real-world problems through examples and code samples using open source Python packages. By doing so, we hope to assist organizations looking to leverage their analytics expertise to improve decision making processes and deliver more accurate insights into their businesses and markets.
# 2.核心概念与联系
Before jumping into technical details, let’s quickly review the core concepts involved in time series analysis:

1. Time series: A sequence of observations recorded at regular intervals over time.

2. Stationarity: An observation at time t does not depend on previous values, but only depends on the trend and seasonality of the series up to time point t. This property makes it easier to identify and model the underlying dynamics of the series. 

3. Seasonality: A recurring pattern in data that repeats itself every year, quarter, month, week, day, hour, minute, second, etc. Common seasonal patterns include daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, hourly, and minute-by-minute patterns.

4. Trend: A gradual increase or decrease in the value of a variable over time. This can be positive, negative, or even increasing exponentially. Trend affects all types of time series, including those without any seasonality.

5. Autocorrelation: A measure of how closely related two variables are to each other. If two time series show high correlation, then they tend to move together. High autocorrelation indicates stronger dependency between nearby points in both time series. Low autocorrelation means there is less similarity between nearby points, indicating sparse temporal correlations.

6. Partial autocorrelation: A statistical measure of the correlation between a time series with a lagged term and the residual error obtained after removing the effect of the lagged term from the original series. It provides an alternative way to assess the significance of individual lags within the time series.

7. Stationary: A stochastic process is said to be stationary if its mean and variance do not change over time. Non-stationary processes exhibit varying behavior, which implies non-constant variance and covariation over time. To analyze non-stationary data, we need to make use of transformation techniques such as differencing, logarithmic transformation, Box-Cox transformation, and Fourier transform.

8. AR(p): AutoRegressive model refers to a class of statistical models where a variable depends linearly on past values of the same variable, i.e., Yt = a + bYt-1 + et, where a is the intercept, b is the slope parameter, e is white noise, and p represents the number of lagged terms included in the model. These models represent the most commonly used time series models and capture the strength of the recent past in the dependent variable yt.

9. MA(q): Moving Average model captures the influence of the future values of the dependent variable onto the present value of the variable, i.e., Xt = a + btXt-q+1 + e, where X is the dependent variable, t is the current period index, a is the intercept, b is the slope parameter, e is white noise, q represents the number of lagged errors included in the model. MA models are typically used to remove the effect of shock events on the dependent variable.

10. ARCH(p,o): ARCH model stands for “conditional heteroskedasticity”, where o is the order of integration. ARCH models capture the volatility of the dependent variable conditional on the level of the independent variable. They are often used when the normal assumption of homoscedasticity fails due to unstable levels or variances.

11. GARCH(p,o,q): GARCH model is similar to ARCH model except it includes the autoregressive component of the volatility equation. Its formulation allows us to incorporate complex relationships among the uncertainty and error terms in the time series.

12. Vector Autoregression (VAR): Vector Autoregression model (VAR) uses multiple input predictors to estimate the parameters associated with each input predictor, allowing us to capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between them. VAR models provide better forecast accuracy than standard linear regression models especially in cases of multicollinearity and structural changes in the input variables over time. Various implemetations of VAR models exist including fixed effects, mixed effects, and principal components.
