# 1.背景介绍


Biodiversity is a fundamental aspect of the natural environment that plays an important role in shaping human health and well-being. The biodiversity protection initiative has attracted global attention as it aims to preserve ecosystems for future generations by promoting conservation practices and using diverse sources of resources such as water, air, and soil to meet human needs. In this article, we will focus on evaluating the impact of biodiversity on human health and well-being through quantitative methods. We will use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to explore the factors influencing biodiversity’s effects on humans. The objective of our research is to identify the causes and mechanisms behind the emergence of health disparities caused by biodiversity. Our approach can help scientists and policymakers understand how biodiversity interventions work, their potential benefits, and how they can contribute to achieving sustainable development goals. To enable effective decision-making and planning, scientific findings must be supported by evidence from field studies, large-scale datasets, and real-world examples.
Biodiversity has become a crucial resource for various sectors like climate change mitigation, agri-food security, and animal welfare, but there are concerns about its negative impact on human health. Over the years, many researchers have tried to identify key drivers of biodiversity-related harmful effects on people's health, ranging from pollution levels to violent conflicts to malnutrition, diseases and disorders, even suicide risk. However, none of these studies had a comprehensive evaluation framework with which to measure the scale and magnitude of biodiversity harm to people's health. Therefore, efforts need to be made to develop an integrated assessment framework for biodiversity-induced health disparities, capable of measuring both individual-level outcomes and population-level patterns of health disparity across different geographical locations.
In view of the above challenges, we propose a systematic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of biodiversity interventions against harmful effects on human health and wellbeing. Based on rigorous methodological principles, we first define the concept of biodiversity harm and prioritize the most relevant factors to include those that influence the growth and survival of plants and animals, as well as human health and productivity. Then, we outline a detailed protocol for conducting meta-analysis to assess the relative importance of each factor towards the occurrence of biodiversity-related harm to human health. Within this meta-analysis, we employ hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) technique to account for multi-factor interactions and obtain results in terms of standardized mean difference scores. Finally, based on our findings, we discuss potential ways to integrate biodiversity into current policies and programs aimed at reducing harmful effects on human health and wellbeing.

## 2.1 Conceptual Background
### What is Biodiversity?
Biodiversity refers to the variety or abundance of life forms and their associated characteristics that exist within certain areas or habitats. It includes all living organisms including microbes, fungi, viruses, bacteria, and animals, as well as their variation and abundances. Biodiversity serves as a valuable resource to support ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, nutritional quality, and pollination. Although biodiversity plays a vital role in supporting human wellbeing, there are several risks associated with its overuse. These risks range from destruction of biological diversity due to pesticides, industrial practices, and pollution levels to human health problems such as infectious disease, neurodegenerative conditions, and obesity.

### Why Do We Care About Biodiversity?
We care about biodiversity because it protects us from harmful effects on our health. Whether it comes from a single species or multiple species that interact with one another, biodiversity affects every aspect of our lives. Its effects may vary depending on the context in which it occurs, but they often include:

1. Preserving the natural habitats where biodiversity is present
2. Improving local ecosystem functions and services
3. Maintaining the balance between wildlife and human populations
4. Promoting conservation and restoration activities

However, while the effects of biodiversity on human health and well-being remain evolving, some studies have identified specific factors that exert positive or negative effects on human health and well-being. These include:

1. Population size – A larger population increases the likelihood of encountering more complex forms of disease, leading to increased mortality rates and chronic disease states.
2. Risk factors - Genetic variations, exposure to chemical and radiation hazards, access to medical care and other social networks, etc., can all increase the likelihood of developing serious diseases.
3. Life style – People who live longer tend to experience greater longevity than those who live shorter, resulting in greater health benefits.
4. Environmental conditions – Pollution, noise, high temperatures, extreme weather events, and storms can cause acute or chronic health problems.
5. Geographic distribution – Widespread urbanization, particularly in cities, leads to faster urbanisation and spread of new pathogens and diseases.

### Types of Biodiversity Harm
There are numerous types of biodiversity-related harm that may occur to humans, but here are three common categories:

1. Degradation of Ecosystems – This involves the removal or damage of habitat features such as trees, forests, lakes, rivers, and soil. Changes in land cover can also lead to changes in the structure and function of ecosystems, which can result in declining biodiversity and diminishing habitat quality. 
2. Damage to Living Organisms – This typically involves the contamination or destruction of organisms that cause illnesses or injuries. Examples of harmful organisms include mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, slugs, and termites.
3. Alteration of Human Behavior – This category focuses on changes in individuals' habits, behaviors, or mental health. Diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer have been linked to alterations in biodiversity, especially in temperate regions such as North America and Europe.

The exact nature and magnitude of the health implications of any particular type of biodiversity-related harm varies greatly, making it difficult to predict them precisely. Nevertheless, biodiversity-related harm can directly affect individuals, groups, or countries, and many countries worldwide have adopted measures to reduce their impact. 

For instance, the US National Park Service recently implemented the “Clean Air Act” in response to increasing numbers of ozone-depleting gases emitted during summer months. Similarly, Canada has implemented legislation to regulate fisheries to prevent plastic pollution, sea level rise, and habitat destruction. Both countries have also taken steps to minimize the harmful effects of biodiversity on human health.

## 2.2 Quantitative Approach
To measure the effects of biodiversity on human health and wellbeing, we need to address two main challenges. First, we need to establish a clear understanding of what constitutes biodiversity-related harm to humans, and second, we need to collect and analyze large amounts of data from different perspectives, cultures, and contexts. Here is a general workflow for designing a quantitative approach to evaluate biodiversity-related harm to human health and wellbeing:

1. Understand the Definition of Biodiversity-Related Harm and Prioritize Relevant Factors
    Before performing any measurements, it is critical to clearly define what constitutes biodiversity-related harm to humans. This requires analyzing existing literature on the topic, identifying key factors related to human health and wellbeing that can cause harm, and prioritizing the ones that are likely to have the greatest direct impact on the target population. For example, genetics, exposure to chemical and radiation hazards, access to medical care, and longevity among healthy individuals can all be considered factors that can cause harm to people's health. 

2. Conduct Meta-Analysis to Assess Relative Importance of Each Factor
    Once we have established the definition of biodiversity-related harm and defined the priority factors, we move on to perform the actual measurement. One way to do this is by conducting a meta-analysis, which compares the occurrences of harmful traits in different populations under different scenarios of biodiversity management. Meta-analyses allow us to combine information from multiple sources, incorporate prior knowledge, and control for biases introduced by subpopulations.

    In order to carry out a meta-analysis, we first gather the necessary data. In addition to data on the demographics, behavior, and health of the target population, we need to collect data on biodiversity status, management strategies, and other factors that may influence the rate and severity of biodiversity-related harm. The collected data should represent a wide range of cases, cultures, and environments, and ensure that we capture differences across different ethnicities, sexes, age groups, and socioeconomic positions.

    Once we have collected the data, we next formulate the null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis for each factor. The null hypothesis represents the absence of harmful effects, whereas the alternate hypothesis represents the presence of such effects. Based on these hypotheses, we calculate the standardized mean difference score (SMD) for each factor to determine whether it has a significant association with biodiversity-related harm. SMDs provide a standardized metric to compare the magnitude of the relationship between a given factor and the occurrence of biodiversity-related harm. We then rank the factors according to their significance values to highlight the factors that are most likely to have a significant effect on human health.

3. Use Statistical Modeling Techniques to Identify Key Drivers of Biodiversity-Related Harm
    While meta-analysis provides a broad overview of the relative importance of factors, it does not identify the underlying mechanism(s) responsible for these associations. Thus, we need to apply statistical modeling techniques to identify the underlying causal relationships between factors and biodiversity-related harm. Common approaches for doing so include regression analysis, machine learning algorithms, and network analysis. These methods provide additional insights into the mechanistic basis of the associations found via meta-analysis, allowing us to isolate and potentially address the root causes of the observed phenomena.

4. Integrate Biodiversity-Related Measures into Policy and Programmes
    Finally, once we have identified the key factors driving biodiversity-related harm to human health and wellbeing, we can begin integrating them into policy and programmes to achieve long-term societal benefit. We need to address the root causes of the observed patterns of health disparity, identify novel treatments and therapies, and test and refine the interventions accordingly. By implementing effective programs and policies to manage biodiversity, we can create lasting benefits for all involved stakeholders, including local communities, international organizations, and governments.
