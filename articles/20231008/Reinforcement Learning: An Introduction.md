# 1.背景介绍


Reinforcement learning (RL) is a class of machine learning algorithms where an agent learns to make decisions in the face of uncertainty and reward signals. The goal of RL is to learn how to map situations to actions that maximize long-term rewards by interacting with its environment. The reinforcement learning problem can be solved using various methods such as value iteration, Q-learning, policy gradient, actor-critic, model-based, etc., which differ based on their underlying assumptions about the system dynamics or control policies. In this article, we will introduce the basic concepts behind the reinforcement learning and related terminology. We will then present the key ideas and algorithms used for solving different types of problems, including Markov decision processes, dynamic programming, temporal difference learning, deep reinforcement learning, and others. Finally, we will discuss some challenges and future directions in reinforcement learning research.

## 2.1 Agent & Environment
The central idea behind reinforcement learning is to design agents that can interact with environments to solve tasks while taking into account feedback from their actions. These interactions are characterized by two entities called the agent and the environment. 

An agent is anything that perceives and takes action in an environment. It could be a physical robot, a virtual agent, or a person who takes actions through their minds. The agent's perception of the environment includes any sensory input such as visual images, sound, touch, temperature, proximity, etc. The agent's behavior is determined by its internal state variables, which may include things like knowledge, preferences, reactions, goals, beliefs, emotions, and intentions. Actions performed by the agent affect the state of the environment and influence the outcome of subsequent actions.

The environment is the world in which the agent exists and interacts with other agents and objects. The environment could be anything ranging from a simple gridworld to a complex three-dimensional scene that requires spatial reasoning and language comprehension. The environment provides feedback to the agent by signaling changes in its state, such as finding new objects, accepting user inputs, detecting obstacles, and receiving rewards. Examples of feedback mechanisms include perceptual sensors such as cameras or microphones, actuators such as motors or speakers, and feedback loops that involve communication between multiple agents or parts of the environment.

It is important to note that there are many subtleties involved in building realistic environments and agents, but they fall outside the scope of this introduction. Instead, we focus on the core ideas and principles of reinforcement learning and provide pointers to resources for more detailed discussions.

## 2.2 Rewards and Returns
In reinforcement learning, each time step provides the agent with information about its current state, what action it took, and what reward it received. This sequence of observations, actions, and rewards forms a trajectory known as a "episode". The objective of the agent is to maximize the sum of all rewards obtained during the episode. The reward function specifies the numerical amount of reward given at every timestep to the agent depending on the chosen action. Reward can take several forms, including negative or positive values, binary (win/lose), non-negative continuous functions, and delayed or sparse returns.

For instance, consider an environment in which an agent controls a car driving around a city street. At every timestep, the agent receives a penalty if it deviates from the center line of the road, or a positive reward when it successfully drives past the intersection. Given these rewards, the goal of the agent would be to drive smoothly and efficiently across the entire city without incident. By following a policy derived from trial and error, the agent can discover the optimal way to achieve its objectives over the course of training.

Note that maximizing rewards in this way does not necessarily mean that the agent will always choose the best possible action at every stage. Rather, it focuses on making incremental progress towards achieving a higher cumulative reward than before. In contrast, there are also cases where it may be better for the agent to delay a few steps and accumulate large penalties instead of choosing the wrong action early on and losing out on potential rewards later down the road. All of these aspects make up the complexity of the reinforcement learning problem.

## 2.3 Policies and Value Functions
A policy defines the strategy followed by the agent during decision making. In general, a policy maps states to actions, specifying the distribution over possible actions at each state. A greedy policy chooses the action that has the highest expected return given the current state. A random policy selects an action uniformly at random from all available actions. Some policies may have additional constraints such as avoiding collisions or ensuring safety.

Value functions represent the level of expected reward that the agent expects to receive starting from a particular state and taking a specific action. They enable us to evaluate the goodness of a policy, determining whether it should update its parameters or explore alternative options. The value function is typically defined recursively as the maximum discounted future reward achieved starting from the current state and performing a specific action. The discount factor represents the degree to which immediate rewards should be discounted in the calculation of future rewards.

The value function plays a crucial role in reinforcement learning because it enables the agent to make sense of the rewards provided by its interaction with the environment and to devise strategies that effectively guide its behavior toward achieving high rewards. When trained correctly, the agent can adaptively adjust its policy to exploit the most valuable behaviors or tradeoffs among competing alternatives until it reaches the point of optimally solving the problem.

## 2.4 Model Free vs. Model Based Approaches
Model free approaches attempt to learn directly from experience by simply analyzing raw data generated by the environment. One example of this approach is Q-learning, which uses a table of Q-values to estimate the expected future reward for each pair of state and action. Another example is policy gradients, which use stochastic gradient descent techniques to optimize the parameters of a policy network to match the expected returns experienced by the agent. On the other hand, model based approaches build models of the environment using domain knowledge and physics simulations, enabling them to simulate the effects of actions and identify suitable next states. For example, planning algorithms often rely on precomputed plans, or model predictive control algorithms use linearization techniques to generate predicted trajectories and imitate them to improve performance.

Both model free and model based approaches offer distinct advantages and drawbacks, but it is essential to understand the fundamental differences so that one can select the appropriate toolbox for a particular application. Overall, the core ideas and terminology introduced here form the basis for a deeper understanding of reinforcement learning.
