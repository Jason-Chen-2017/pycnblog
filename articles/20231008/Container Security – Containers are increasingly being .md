# 1.背景介绍


Containers have emerged as a popular technology over the past few years as part of modern application development, deployment, and management workflows. They offer significant advantages in terms of flexibility, ease of use, and rapid provisioning of resources compared to virtual machines (VMs). The ability to package applications together into small, lightweight containers has revolutionized how we approach software development, testing, and production deployments. 

However, one aspect that hasn’t received much attention from developers and system architects alike is securing them. In a world where every container run in its own isolated environment and potentially accessible by any other process or user on the host machine, it becomes essential to ensure that containers are secure and protected against potential threats such as malware exploits, unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, etc. 

To achieve this level of security, organizations typically adopt various technologies and policies that focus on container security. Some commonly used tools include Linux capabilities, AppArmor, SELinux, and Docker Content Trust (DCT) to name a few. These approaches provide basic level of isolation between different containers but do not guarantee complete protection due to their weaknesses and limitations. Therefore, even though containerization helps reduce costs, it also introduces new security concerns and challenges that should be addressed before moving to higher environments or hosting more sensitive workloads.

In recent times, there have been several research papers, reports, white papers published on the topic of container security. This includes security benchmarks, hardening guides, and vulnerability assessments of open source projects running within containers. However, these articles often focus only on the technical aspects of securing containers and leave out the broader context and implications that apply to any type of cloud-based infrastructure such as microservices architectures deployed using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes clusters. In this article, we will explore some core concepts related to container security, discuss key ideas behind various defense mechanisms such as privilege separation, rootless containers, and image signing/verification, and identify common pitfalls when implementing these principles in real-world scenarios. We will also discuss best practices and recommendations for securing Docker Swarm and Kubernetes based microservices environments.

 ## 2.1 What is Microservices Architecture?
Microservices architecture refers to an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each running in its own process and communicating through well defined APIs. It promotes creating systems that are easier to develop, modify, deploy, and scale. There are many ways to implement microservices including both centralized and decentralized architectures. Centralized architectures have a single monolithic codebase responsible for handling all business logic while decentralized architectures split up functionality across multiple teams. Centralized architectures can lead to large, complex codebases and slower release cycles whereas decentralized architectures allow for faster iteration and smaller, specialized teams working on specific areas of the application. Microservices architecture plays an important role in today's increasingly dynamic IT landscape where distributed, independent components communicate with each other via standard protocols. The concept of microservices and their communication patterns make them ideal candidates for implementing robust and resilient container-based solutions.


## 2.2 What is Container Security?
The term "container security" refers to the practice of protecting containers from intrusion attempts, attacks, and vulnerabilities. While traditional server-based operating systems provide various measures to improve security, containers introduce novel security challenges. One of the main issues is that they are typically ephemeral and short lived, making traditional OS security models less relevant. To address these challenges, many organizations rely on additional layers of security enforcement mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), auditing tools, and authentication protocols to prevent unauthorized access, tampering, and modification. Additionally, organisations may implement security controls like runtime restrictions, least privilege access control, and network segmentation to further enhance security posture. All these security mechanisms must be implemented correctly to maintain high levels of confidence in the security of containers.

In addition to traditional OS security features, containers also present unique security concerns like side channels, resource exhaustion, escalation of privileges, and credential exposure. These security concerns must be considered and mitigated accordingly to avoid breaches, compromise, and data leakage. Within the scope of this article, we will cover three key areas of container security: image integrity, runtime security, and attack surface reduction.


## 2.3 Key Ideas Behind Defense Mechanisms
### Privilege Separation
Privilege separation is an effective mechanism to isolate processes and restrict the actions that processes can perform. This involves dividing a computer system into separate categories of users according to their roles and responsibilities, ensuring that a malicious attacker cannot gain unauthorized access to certain parts of the system without gaining sufficient privileges. Typically, privilege separation is achieved through techniques such as strong UID/GID assignment, limiting file permissions, and mount namespaces. Even though privilege separation ensures that an attacker does not have total access to the entire system, it still needs to be combined with other security measures such as hardened configurations, input validation, and error checking to minimize the risk of exploitable vulnerabilities. 

To enable better privilege separation for Docker containers, organizations can leverage user namespaces, groups, and filesystem ACLs to limit the resources available to individual containers. User namespaces enable containers to have their own UIDs and GIDs, while group and filesystem ACLs help restrict what files and directories each container can access. For example, if an attacker manages to escape a container and obtain root privileges inside it, they would not be able to access the underlying host system, but could still interact with the container itself. Similarly, privileged containers also pose a risk since they give full access to the host system and can lead to serious consequences if compromised.

By default, Docker runs containers with elevated privileges (root) under certain conditions, so organizations should take steps to mitigate the risks associated with granting containers excessive privileges. One way to do this is to set strict resource limits and quotas for containers, monitor and detect abuse, and utilize a tool like Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce customizable policies that define who can execute what commands and what containers can access what resources. Organizations can also consider deploying slimmer base images that do not contain unnecessary packages and binaries to reduce the overall attack surface of containers.

Additionally, organizations can choose to run containers with non-root privileges and configure them to delegate specific tasks to trusted helper programs rather than relying solely on the container engine to provide isolation. Examples of such helper programs include SSH daemons, NTP clients, and syslog collectors that help keep the container logs organized and free of potential attack vectors. Finally, organizations can deploy container engines such as Docker Compose or Kubernetes that automatically handle task delegations and other advanced security features, reducing the burden of manual configuration and maintenance.

Overall, privilege separation provides a critical layer of defense to prevent unauthorized access, tampering, and modification of containerized applications. By carefully designing security policies and combining with other security measures, organizations can create secure and reliable container platforms that meet the demands of modern cloud-native environments.


### Rootless Containers
Rootless containers refer to the ability of containers to run with reduced privileges, effectively eliminating the need for dedicated root accounts. Unlike normal containers that require full administrative rights to operate, rootless containers can run with minimal privileges and only those privileges required by the processes executed inside the containers. Moreover, rootless containers don't require changes to the host system and can be controlled fully by user-level processes.

To enable rootless containers, organizations can use tools like Podman or Buildah that support running containers without requiring root privileges. Moreover, most distros now come preconfigured with user namespaces enabled, meaning that containers launched with Podman or Buildah can still enjoy reduced privileges if needed. Alternatively, organizations can deploy container runtimes such as runc directly on top of existing host systems instead of relying on traditional container managers. By leveraging kernel features like user namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, and apparmor, these runtimes can implement their own privilege separation mechanisms without needing modifications to the container platform.

As mentioned earlier, however, rootless containers come with their own set of security concerns. Among them, one major issue is the potential for escalation of privileges, especially in cases where containers are configured to run with elevated privileges. Since regular users cannot manage rootless containers directly, it can become difficult to troubleshoot and fix issues if a privilege escalation occurs. Furthermore, container breakouts that bypass the container runtime or host system usually involve obtaining direct shell access to the container, circumventing any mitigation strategies such as disallowing root logins. Nonetheless, by following best practices and using appropriate security controls, organizations can build secure rootless container platforms that are resistant to attacks and vulnerabilities.


### Image Signing & Verification
Image signing and verification are two complementary security mechanisms that complement each other. Image signing relies on digital signatures to verify the authenticity of an image and establish trust. This can be done through various methods, including public-key cryptography, message digest algorithms, and a combination of both. On the other hand, image verification relies on third-party trust stores to validate the signature of the image and check whether it has been signed by a known entity. If the signature is valid, then the image is deemed trustworthy and can be trusted to run safely on a host system.

Both image signing and verification play an important role in container security because they can provide assurances about the origin and provenance of containers. An invalid or manipulated image can easily go unchecked until it is discovered during runtime, leading to potential security risks such as container breakout and privilege escalation. To address these risks, organizations can employ image signing mechanisms such as Notary or Cosign to sign container images and distribute them securely to consumers. At the same time, consumer systems can verify the integrity and provenance of the images before running them to mitigate potential risk. 

Moreover, image verification can be integrated with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the process of verifying and distributing trusted images. CI/CD pipelines can be configured to scan container images and report any failures to stakeholders. For example, if a new version of an image breaks backward compatibility or presents unexpected behavior, stakeholders can quickly react and request a rollback to a previous version. Overall, image signing and verification constitute crucial elements in securing container platforms and delivering consistent and safe containerized solutions to customers.
