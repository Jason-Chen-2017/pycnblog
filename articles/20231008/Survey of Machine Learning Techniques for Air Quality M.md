# 1.背景介绍


## Air quality is one of the most critical public health issues in recent years. It affects millions of people around the world, including children under five, elderly people, and others with respiratory diseases or asthma. In order to meet national air quality standards, governments have taken numerous measures such as increasing the number of ventilation units, improving insulation, and installing more sensitive sensors to monitor ambient air quality. However, accurate monitoring and prediction of air quality are still limited by various challenges. Some researchers believe that artificial intelligence (AI) can help improve the accuracy and reliability of air quality monitoring systems through its ability to learn patterns from large amounts of data. 

In this survey paper, we will explore various machine learning techniques related to air quality monitoring and prediction. We first define some key concepts and explain how they relate to air quality monitoring and prediction. Then, we present four main types of AI algorithms: regression, classification, clustering, and forecasting. Finally, we discuss the potential impacts of these algorithms on different aspects of air quality, including economic benefits, environmental costs, human health consequences, and societal concerns. By analyzing their advantages and limitations, we hope to provide a comprehensive guideline for choosing appropriate AI methods for air quality monitoring and prediction in various scenarios. 

To summarize, our aim is to provide an overview of current state-of-the-art approaches to address air quality problems using machine learning technologies. We understand that there are many challenges associated with developing real-world applications, but the advancement of AI technology could help overcome them to offer practical solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm before applying them to specific domains. Our study also includes open research questions that require further investigation to develop effective tools for measuring and predicting air quality. 

# 2. Core Concepts and Relationships
## Air quality monitoring system
The following diagram shows the general architecture of an air quality monitoring system. The system consists of three main components: sampling stations, data collection devices, and centralized air quality monitoring center. Sampling stations collect raw data from pollutants at different locations, such as buildings, cars, traffic streams, etc., while data collection devices measure parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, rainfall intensity, etc., at fixed time intervals. These measurements are collected centrally by the air quality monitoring center and stored in cloud databases for analysis and visualization.

The goal of the air quality monitoring system is to continuously assess the overall air quality status and identify areas with high concentrations of air pollutants. This information can be used for planning and control purposes, as well as for providing feedback to citizens and decision makers regarding the severity of air pollution conditions. 

## Types of Pollutants
There are several categories of air pollutants that affect human health and the environment negatively. Examples include ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter (PM). Each category has distinct physical properties such as density, composition, and emission rates. 

### Ozone
Ozone forms when a heavier atom bonds to two lighter atoms in the atmosphere. Its presence leads to acid rain and increases mortality risk among older adults. Several studies suggest that reducing the levels of ozone may reduce the burden of PM2.5 pollution and enhance air quality in urban areas. However, the effectiveness of ozone reduction strategies is dependent on other factors such as climate change, geographical distribution, population age structure, and cultural practices. 

### Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important component of industrial fuel combustion processes and contributes to climate change due to its affinity with CO2 in the air. Several decades ago, scientists found that burning wood caused increased production of CO which eventually led to the rise of low level CO in the atmosphere. Since then, industries have been faced with severe risks of breathing inhalation, lung inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and reduced mental functioning due to its acute effects on humans. Consequently, research into mitigation strategies for CO is ongoing and promising results have already been achieved. 

### Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) play a vital role in influencing global warming and damage to ecosystems. They are generated by various sources including biomass burning, car exhaust fumes, power plants, aviation industry, and automobile exhaust gasses. NOx poses serious health hazards such as asthma attacks, heart disease, and kidney failure. To reduce the levels of NOx, governments should focus on enhancing air quality through better engineering design, upgrading infrastructure, and adopting policies that promote air pollution prevention. However, proper attention needs to be paid to manage the harmful effects of elevated NOx levels, such as rising sea levels, land use changes, erosion, soil contamination, and water pollution. 

### Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)
Sulphur dioxide (SO₂) forms during the decomposition of organic compounds, such as petroleum refineries, coal mines, and oil and gas drilling operations. It reacts violently with oxygen in the atmosphere leading to acid rain and methanol formation. Although the direct effect of SO₂ on human health cannot be measured directly, indirect effects such as elevated blood pressure, headaches, and increased LDL cholesterol levels can be observed. A long term effort is required to control the release of SO₂ into the atmosphere, particularly in cities where SO₂ concentrations are high. Policy makers should support initiatives that encourage energy efficiency and minimize SO₂ emissions, while maintaining safe drinking water supply chains and protecting against foodborne particles. 

### Particulate Matter (PM)
Particulate matter refers to non-methane volatile organic compounds that form in the natural air around us, primarily through volcanic activity and the combustion of fossil fuels. PMs can cause wide range of health impacts, including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and lung diseases. PM10 accounts for 30% - 50% of total PM mass. To mitigate PM pollution, government agencies need to prioritize sealing off high population density areas, introducing new technologies to capture and treat PM, and developing awareness programs and education campaigns. However, efforts towards controlling PM emissions globally must be accompanied by targeted interventions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from synthetic fertilizers and heavy metals.
