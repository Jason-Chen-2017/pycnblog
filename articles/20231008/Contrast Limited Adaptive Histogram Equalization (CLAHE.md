# 1.背景介绍


In digital imaging, contrast enhancement is an important step in many applications like medical imaging, industrial photography, sports photography etc. Enhancing the contrast of an image helps improve its visibility and readability for human eyes. 

One of the most commonly used methods for enhancing contrast in digital images is CLAHE (Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization). In this method, we first divide the input image into small regions called "tiles" or "windows". Then, we calculate the normalized frequency distribution of each tile using the global histogram of the entire image. We then apply contrast limiting techniques on these tiles based on their own frequency distributions. Finally, we combine the modified tiles back together to obtain the enhanced output image. 

The contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm has several advantages over traditional thresholding approaches like Otsu's binarization method. It provides better control over the final result compared to other algorithms because it considers the local variations in the input image while preserving the overall structure and visual features. Also, the normalization factor used by CLAHE makes it robust against changes in illumination conditions and noise levels. Overall, CLAHE is widely used for enhancing the contrast of images in various domains like computer vision, signal processing, and medical imaging. 


However, there exist some limitations of CLAHE algorithm which require further research:

1. Non-uniform illumination conditions: Since we use individual histograms per tile, the resulting contrast differences may not be uniform across the whole image due to different illuminations. To handle this problem, we need to employ additional techniques such as windowed smoothing or atmosphere correction before applying CLAHE.

2. Bias towards high intensity pixels: While CLAHE performs well when dealing with highly textured or bright areas, it tends to create unwanted artifacts near the borders of objects due to its bias towards high intensity pixels. To address this issue, we need to introduce regional contrast enhancement mechanisms such as spatial filtering or morphological operations to reduce the impact of artifacts.

3. Complexity and computational overhead: Because CLAHE involves multiple steps including global histogram calculation, contrast limiting, and tile combination, it requires more computation time than simpler thresholding techniques. Furthermore, the complexity increases exponentially with the size of the input image, making it impractical for real-time systems or embedded devices. Thus, we need to develop faster alternatives that can achieve comparable results but run faster even on smaller platforms.

This article will discuss in detail about the above mentioned problems and provide solutions for them through the implementation of a fast version of the original CLAHE algorithm called CFastCLAHE. This algorithm uses CUDA GPU acceleration to perform the necessary computations much faster than previous implementations. Moreover, this article will also explain how our proposed solution addresses the shortcomings of the original CLAHE algorithm, leading to significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.

## Grayscale Images and Color Images
In digital imaging, two types of images arise - grayscale and color images. A grayscale image contains only one channel whereas a color image contains three channels for red, green, and blue colors respectively. In general, grayscale images have higher resolution compared to color images. However, color information adds extra dimensions to the picture and gives rise to depth perception in humans. 

## Contrast Limitation
When you see a very bright object, your eye perceives it as very bright, almost blinding. When you see an extremely dark area, your brain immediately turns off since it cannot make out the details. This phenomenon is known as the "Contrast Limiting" effect.

As explained earlier, if the contrast between adjacent pixels in an image is too low, the edges of objects become visible. Therefore, we need to increase the contrast of the image without distorting any meaningful content. One way to do this is by increasing the dynamic range of the image. There are several ways to increase the dynamic range of an image, including linear scaling, power law scaling, gamma correction, logarithmic scale stretching, and histogram equalization. All these techniques aim to increase the contrast of the image without affecting its shape.

Histogram Equalization is a popular technique that achieves good contrast improvement by dividing the lightness spectrum into several bins and distributing the pixels in the image amongst these bins accordingly. By doing this, we ensure that the lightest parts of the image get darker, whilst the darkest parts get brighter, thus producing a uniformly enhanced contrast.

However, histogram equalization relies heavily on the assumption that the underlying data follows a normal probability density function (PDF), which may not always hold true for real world scenarios. Additionally, the performance of histogram equalization decreases significantly for images with large texture or high degree of smoothness. For instance, consider the following image:
