# 1.背景介绍



20世纪70年代，随着计算机科学的飞速发展、应用领域的广泛拓展、个人计算机的普及以及互联网的迅速崛起，人们越来越认识到程序设计语言应当兼顾性能、灵活性和可维护性，从而提出“面向对象”(Object-oriented，OO)的编程理念。1987年，在贝尔实验室的John McCarthy教授将“面向对象”引入了计算机领域，其主要特点包括：数据抽象、继承和多态、动态绑定等。近几十年间，“面向对象”作为一种新的编程范式得到了越来越广泛的应用。由于其复杂性、庞大的标准库和工具集以及严谨的语法和语义，导致开发人员在日常工作中往往难以完全理解并掌握这种方法。本文通过阅读《精通Java》一书，对面向对象编程进行全面的理论讲解，旨在帮助读者更好的理解、掌握面向对象编程的基本知识、技巧和理念。

# 2.核心概念与联系

1. Class（类）—— A class is a blueprint or prototype for creating objects that contains the common characteristics and behaviors of all objects of its type. In other words, it defines what an object can do and how it behaves in terms of data and behavior.

2. Attribute（属性）—— An attribute is a variable associated with each instance of a class. Attributes define the state information about an object. They store some information about the object such as name, age, address, etc.

3. Method（方法）—— A method is an operation that can be performed by an object. Methods are used to modify the attributes of an object or get the values of the attributes.

4. Constructor（构造器）—— A constructor is a special method which is called when an object of a class is created. It initializes the initial state of the object.

5. Inheritance（继承）—— Inheritance allows one class to acquire all the properties and methods of another class. The new class is called derived class or subclass, while the original class is called base class or superclass. By deriving from the base class, we can reuse the code and save time on writing similar classes.

6. Polymorphism（多态性）—— Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take different forms or act differently under different conditions. It enables us to write programs that work with multiple types of objects at once.

7. Encapsulation（封装）—— Encapsulation is the process of binding data and functions together into a single unit called a class. This prevents direct access to the internal details of an object from outside the class definition.

8. Abstraction（抽象）—— Abstraction is the process of hiding complex details of a system and presenting only essential features to the user. Abstraction helps developers think independently and focus on higher level concepts instead of worrying about low-level implementation details.

9. Interface（接口）—— An interface is a collection of abstract methods provided by a class without providing any implementation. Interfaces enable communication between different classes without having to know their underlying implementations.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

1. Data abstraction（数据抽象）—— Data abstraction means breaking down large amounts of data into smaller manageable chunks and managing them separately. We use various programming constructs like classes, objects, inheritance and polymorphism to achieve this task.

2. Information hiding（信息隐藏）—— Hiding information involves restricting access to certain variables within a program so they cannot be accessed directly by others. This reduces errors due to incorrect usage of those variables. In OOP languages like Java, we use encapsulation to implement information hiding.

3. Inheritance (继承)—— Inheritance is the mechanism where one class inherits the properties and methods of another class. It makes code reusable and saves development time. It also promotes modularity, flexibility, and extensibility in software design. 

4. Polymorphism (多态性)—— Polymorphism means being able to perform different operations using a single function call. It simplifies our code by reducing redundancy. In OOP languages like Java, we use polymorphism extensively to handle different objects dynamically.

5. Encapsulation (封装)—— Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and functionality together inside a single entity known as a class. Encapsulation provides security through separation of concerns and protects data integrity. Classes provide better control over the data and prevent accidental modifications or misuse of resources.

6. Abstraction (抽象)—— Abstraction refers to exposing only necessary details to the user. It hides unnecessary complexity and focuses on important aspects of a problem. Abstraction promotes conceptual clarity and improves maintainability. In OOP languages like Java, we use interfaces and abstract classes for implementing abstractions.

7. Dynamic Binding (动态绑定)—— Dynamic binding is a feature in OOP languages that allows runtime polymorphism. With dynamic binding, the compiler checks the type of reference variable at run time and binds the method call to appropriate method based on the actual type of the object pointed by the reference variable. 

# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

1. Example of Class Implementation:
   ```java
    public class Car {
      private String make;
      private String model;
      
      // Constructor
      public Car(String m, String mo) {
        make = m;
        model = mo;
      }

      // Getter & Setter
      public void setMake(String make) {
        this.make = make;
      }

      public String getMake() {
        return make;
      }

      public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
      }

      public String getModel() {
        return model;
      }
      
      // toString method
      @Override
      public String toString(){
        return "The car's make is "+this.getMake()+" and model is "+this.getModel(); 
      } 
    } 
   ```
   Here we have defined a `Car` class which has two attributes - `make` and `model`. Also there are getter and setter methods to manipulate these attributes. Finally, we have overridden the default `toString()` method to print the object in a readable format.

2. Example of Inheritance Implementation:

   Lets say we want to create a new class named `SportCar` which is a subtype of `Car` but also adds more specific attributes related to sports cars. To inherit all the properties and methods of `Car`, SportCar should extend the `Car` class. Then we add additional fields and methods specific to Sport Cars.<|im_sep|>
