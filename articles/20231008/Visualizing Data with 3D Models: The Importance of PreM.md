# 1.背景介绍


In recent years, 3D modeling and visualization techniques have become increasingly popular in various fields such as scientific research, industry, medicine, etc. Although there are numerous software packages available for generating 3D models, it is still a challenging task to create realistic virtual environments that can capture the complexity and richness of complex data sets accurately and effectively. To address this issue, we need to understand how to select an appropriate pre-modelling technique that can help us represent our data on a three-dimensional (3D) surface without any loss of information or distortion. Furthermore, we also need to understand its impact on the quality and efficiency of rendering algorithms used in visualizing these 3D models. In this article, I will explain some key concepts related to creating high-quality 3D models using pre-modelling techniques, including level-of-detail (LOD), viewpoint factorization, simplification, and texture mapping. 

To begin with, let's define what exactly is meant by "pre-modelling"? As per Wikipedia, pre-modelling refers to a step in computer graphics where modeling operations before rendering take place. These steps include things like LOD selection, camera position optimization, lighting calculation, texture mapping, shading, and rasterization. By doing these pre-processing steps early in the process, we can achieve better results down the line when rendering the model. The goal is not only to improve the final image but also ensure optimal performance during the rendering stage. 

Now, let’s move onto understanding each concept mentioned above. 

# Level-of-Detail (LOD)
Level-of-Detail (LOD) stands for the reduction in detail level of objects based on distance from the viewer. It helps in reducing the amount of processing power needed while rendering a scene by choosing between simplified and detailed versions of models at different stages of the pipeline. This is achieved through several methods such as triangle strips, subdivision surfaces, alpha-tested transparency, and tessellation. One common approach is to use a progressive lod system where multiple levels of details are created gradually as the object nears the viewer. However, selecting the correct LOD parameters may require careful consideration depending on the specific scenario. Some examples of LOD parameters include vertex density, number of polygons, and resolution.

# Viewpoint Factorization
Viewpoint Factorization involves splitting the view frustum into smaller sections, called views, which improves rendering speed by allowing more work to be distributed across parallel processors. The main idea behind this technique is to reduce aliasing artifacts caused by undersampling the original images. When the view points are split into smaller parts, the blurring effect introduced by interpolation is reduced and thus, less noise is produced resulting in smoother edges and textures. Moreover, since fewer samples are generated, the computational cost required for rendering becomes lower than if all the pixels were sampled together. Another benefit of using this technique is that it allows the renderer to focus on areas of the screen that are likely to contain important features instead of wasting time sampling irrelevant regions. Therefore, it is essential to choose the right set of views based on the type and size of the target scene.

# Simplification
Simplification is another method used to reduce the geometry complexity of models. It involves reducing the number of vertices and faces present in the model so that they can be rendered faster on a smaller display device. The basic principle behind this technique is that only those parts of the object visible to the current viewing angle should be drawn. Other parts can be discarded. There are several ways to perform this operation. For example, quadric error decimation (QED), radial basis function (RBF), boundary conformal map (BCM), and loop subdivision frameworks (LSF) are commonly used methods. Additionally, smoothing filters such as Laplacian smoothing, Gaussian smoothing, and Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces can also be used. Despite their importance, however, choosing the best level of simplification requires careful tuning and experimentation.

# Texture Mapping
Texture mapping is one of the most crucial components in creating a realistic 3D model. It maps an image onto the surface of an object so that colors and other visual characteristics of the object appear natural and realistic. A simple way to do this is to associate color values with mesh elements based on the coordinates of each point within the texture map. Since the texture map is mapped directly onto the surface, it affects both appearance and shading of the model. Several texture mapping techniques exist, including planar, cylindrical, spherical, and Cubic mapping. Planar mapping uses two-dimensional patterns such as bricks or tiles and applies them to the surface of an object. Similarly, Cylindrical and Spherical mappings apply repeating patterns along circular or spherical domains respectively. Finally, Cubic mapping creates smooth interpolation between four nearest neighbor texels around each sample point. Thus, selecting the correct texture mapping technique is crucial to ensuring accurate representation of the underlying data.

Pre-modelling techniques are central to achieving effective 3D modeling and visualization. They provide a powerful tool for handling large volumes of complex data, improving the overall visual fidelity and speed of rendering, and enabling users to explore and analyze data interactively.
