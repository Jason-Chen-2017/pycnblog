# 1.背景介绍


Metabolic disease (MD) refers to any type of disease that affects the body’s ability to produce nutrients for energy or other metabolic processes. It is one of the most common diseases in the world with an estimated 75 million cases each year, making it a global health concern. Within MD there are three main categories: cardiovascular disease (CVD), immune system disorder (ISD), and endocrine system disease (ESD). 

In CVD, impaired insulin secretion can lead to hypoglycemia, which leads to increased blood sugar levels that damage the heart muscle and cause arrhythmias. In ISD, antibodies produced by tissues can trigger autoimmunity, leading to the development of multiple chronic conditions such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. ESD involves dysfunctions of the hormonal balance, leading to deficiencies in proper functioning of the body’s glucosins and insulin-producing pancreas.

To overcome these disorders, many medications have been developed targeting specific genes involved in their pathogenesis. However, all treatments face unique challenges and require different approaches depending on the condition being treated. To further reduce the burden and improve patient outcomes, new genetic therapies using molecular engineering techniques may be able to cure some of these diseases at lower costs than conventional medicines. Nevertheless, existing treatments still remain largely effective at treating individual patients, but they do not address the heterogeneous nature of the various diseases and the role of multifactorial interactions between genetics, environment, microbiology, and host factors to affect disease progression and outcome. Therefore, the key question remains how to combine these diverse sources of information and make optimal use of available treatments to avoid complications and delays in disease management.  

Recent advances in personalized medicine and genomic technology have led to unprecedented opportunities for integrative drug design that targets multiple disease mechanisms simultaneously. One example is the Anti-PD1/PD1 Ligand Therapy (APLT), which uses engineered anti-pd1 and pd1 receptors to enhance thyroid function and prevent vascular degeneration associated with vascular disease. Another approach is through multi-omics technologies that integrate diverse types of data including genetics, gene expression, epigenetics, and metabolomics into predictive models that identify candidate biomarkers for complex diseases. Yet another approach is through machine learning algorithms that leverage clinical, biomedical, genomic, and imaging data to automate diagnosis and treatment decision-making. These approaches offer exciting possibilities for developing personalized medicine that addresses the complexity and heterogeneity of MD. However, the technological advancement and computational power required to realize these advanced treatments will likely create new risks and challenges for patient safety, quality of life, and cost effectiveness.

In this article, we focus on exploring the convergent mechanisms underlying the genesis, pathophysiology, treatment response, and long-term outcome of various types of metabolic disorders, specifically immune system disorders, endocrine system disorders, and combined immunodeficiency (CDI). We discuss recent findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other omics datasets that highlight the genetic correlates of these diseases across the spectrum of healthy individuals. Based on our analyses, we propose a conceptual model of the interplay between several biological mechanisms contributing to these diseases, and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies that could target these pathways directly. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to the development and application of such integrated solutions. Our work provides a comprehensive overview of current knowledge about the consequences of these diseases, offers critical thinking towards novel personalized treatments that can deliver improved health outcomes, and encourages research teams to explore more efficient ways of combating these diseases using new computational tools and perspectives.
