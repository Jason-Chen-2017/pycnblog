# 1.背景介绍


Quantum computing has been gaining immense popularity over the past few years as it offers a formidable challenge to traditional computer architectures and computations that are limited by their classical nature. As quantum computers become increasingly powerful, they will continue to evolve in ways that make them far more capable of solving real-world problems than any previous technological advancement. However, before we dive into why quantum computing is different from classical computing, let's first take a look at some key differences between these two technologies.

Classical computing involves digital logic elements such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors arranged in layers to process input data or control electronics. These components operate on analog signals, which means they only work with numbers in binary format (e.g., ones and zeros). In contrast, quantum computing uses quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and interference to manipulate digital bits and transform information stored digitally. The physical reality of quantum states can also be modeled using mathematical equations called quantum circuits. Unlike classical computers, whose state is entirely determined by its current inputs, quantum systems can exist in a superposition of many possible configurations simultaneously. This makes quantum computing fundamentally different from classical computing because it requires new algorithms, protocols, and techniques for manipulating this complex set of possibilities. 

One fundamental difference between classical and quantum computing lies in how they manage memory. In classical computing, programs manipulate static data values stored in memory locations where each bit represents either a zero or a one. These locations are addressed by an index value known as a memory address. Each memory location can store a single piece of data, making it easy to access but less flexible compared to modern day storage devices like hard drives. On the other hand, quantum memory allows for unlimited amounts of information to be stored and managed efficiently without affecting program execution. Instead of relying on individual memory cells to hold individual pieces of data, quantum memory stores entire quantum states in quantum registers. These registers can contain multiple qubits (quantum bits) packed together and behave like individual variables in programming languages. These properties make quantum memory much more versatile and useful for applications requiring large amounts of persistent and ephemeral data. Moreover, quantum memory enables quantum algorithms to exploit entanglement inherent in quantum systems, making them able to perform tasks beyond those achievable with classical algorithms alone.

Another critical distinction between classical and quantum computing is in hardware architecture. Traditional computers rely heavily on clocked electrical signals to execute instructions, while quantum computers use continuous quantum states instead. This leads to radically different types of hardware design, including circuit boards featuring microwave integrated circuits (MCUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and quantum annealers. While classical computing relies on discrete components made up of transistors, resistors, and capacitors, quantum computing relies on the laws of quantum physics applied to logical operations performed within a quantum circuit, rather than directly on the physical layout of transistors and memories. Therefore, there is no "conventional" way to implement quantum algorithms and hardware designed for quantum computers must incorporate novel features such as quantum communication channels and error correction codes.

To summarize, the main reasons behind the breakthrough in quantum computing relate to advances in algorithmic techniques, scalability, precision, speed, and efficiency. With these advantages come increased computational complexity and higher requirements for specialized hardware, including highly efficient simulation methods and high-speed networking technology. Overall, quantum computing promises to revolutionize our understanding of computing and offer untapped potential for transformative scientific discoveries and industrial applications.

Before diving into the specific details of quantum computing, let's briefly review the basic concepts behind both classical and quantum computing.

**Classical computing**: Classical computing refers to the study and development of theoretical models for the behavior of electrons and magnetic fields used to store and manipulate data. The primary purpose of classical computing is to simulate the operation of quantum systems in a deterministic fashion through the manipulation of classical bits and wires. By modeling quantum effects and interactions using classical principles, researchers have developed models that can predict outcomes of experiments and give insights into the underlying mechanisms responsible for quantum phenomena.

In general, classical computing is characterized by efficient processing power and deterministic behavior. It operates on data represented as sequences of zeros and ones, thus enabling fast calculations and comparisons based on patterns found in the data. Examples of classical computing include standard central processing units (CPUs) and graphics cards used in personal computers, as well as cloud servers used to handle massive datasets.

**Quantum computing**: Quantum computing refers to the use of quantum mechanical phenomena and algorithms to solve computationally difficult problems. Quantum computing leverages quantum principles to create superpositions, entanglement, and quantum noise to increase performance and accuracy. To do so, quantum computing employs quantum processors, which consist of quantum circuits arranged in layers that represent various aspects of quantum mechanics. A quantum processor can encode and decode classical information into quantum states, allowing for quantum algorithms to be implemented. Examples of quantum computing platforms include IBM Q, Google's Quantum Computer, D-Wave Systems, and Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit.

In general, quantum computing is characterized by near-infinite computational resources and non-deterministic behavior. It allows for faster simulations of quantum systems due to the fact that quantum mechanics does not require consistent results across all possible outcomes. Examples of quantum computing applications include simulations of molecules, solving search problems, optimization problems, cryptography, and machine learning.
