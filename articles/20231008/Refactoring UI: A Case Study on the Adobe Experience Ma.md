# 1.背景介绍


With rapid development of website technologies, design and user interface (UI) has become a critical aspect in today’s digital world. Increasingly complex websites demand high-quality designs that are intuitive, engaging, responsive, mobile-friendly, and visually appealing to users. However, even with all these requirements, the traditional approach of writing HTML/CSS code can quickly lead to chaos and complexity. This is where modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular come into play. They offer a better way of structuring web applications by breaking down complex tasks into smaller components and making them reusable. Additionally, they have embraced Web Components as an industry standard for building modular and extensible UI elements. 

However, while adopting front-end frameworks is well received by developers, it requires significant investment from engineering teams when building new features or upgrading existing ones. At Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), we use Adobe's latest front-end framework called Coral UI. It provides a range of robust UI components designed specifically for AEM, including forms, cards, tables, buttons, modals, tabs, etc. We want to see how well this refactoring process impacted our ability to develop AEM-specific UI components and maintain consistent styles throughout the site.

In order to explore this issue further, I conducted a case study on the AEM website codebase to understand its current architecture and identify potential areas for improvement. Specifically, I examined the following aspects:

1. The overall structure of the codebase and the relationships between different files such as scripts, stylesheets, templates, etc. 

2. Our naming conventions for CSS classes and selectors and their usage across the codebase. 

3. The frequency and distribution of used typography and color schemes throughout the website. 

4. The use of BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) notation and its implementation across the codebase. 

5. The organization and size of individual component files and patterns within the project. 

Based on my findings, I propose a refactored version of the AEM website UI using the Coral UI library along with best practices for creating consistent and scalable UI components. These changes will not only improve the user experience but also make it easier for engineers to collaborate and contribute to the project over time. By improving the consistency and quality of the UI, we can reduce the burden of maintenance costs associated with AEM websites, thereby increasing productivity and profitability for AEM users.

To complete this article, I would need your input and support to refine and expand upon the proposed solution. Feel free to provide feedback on any parts of the proposal below or suggest additional topics you would like me to explore! 

Thanks again for reading! If you have any questions or comments please let me know. Until next time...:)




2. Core Concepts & Contact
The key concepts involved in the refactoring process include:

Web Components: A set of W3C standards developed by Google and Mozilla that enable the creation of custom, reusable HTML tags, which encapsulate certain functionality and styling. 

BEM Notation: A methodology for writing HTML and CSS class names that follows a specific syntax and philosophy. It encourages dividing markup into blocks, elements, and modifiers based on common properties or behaviors.

Scalability: The capacity of a system to handle increasing traffic and load without becoming unstable or slow.

Consistency: The degree to which different elements within a design system adhere to a common look and feel, brand voice, and behavior. Consistency reduces cognitive overload and makes the design more predictable and cohesive.

3. Algorithm & Code Implementation
1. Overall Structure of the Codebase

The AEM website codebase consists of multiple projects and repositories that interact with each other through shared libraries and services. Here are some important directories and files that constitute the AEM website codebase:

 - ui.apps: The primary repository for AEM's frontend application code. Contains page templates, dialogs, clientlibs, JS modules, sling models, servlets, and HTL scripts. 

 - ui.content: The repository containing content types, pages, assets, configurations, and workflows definitions.

 - ui.config: The repository containing global configuration settings such as workflow models, search index definitions, replication agents, etc.
 
 - ui.frontend: The repository containing the compiled JavaScript and CSS source code for the AEM website. 

 - ui.tests: The repository containing test cases for the AEM website. 
 
 - packagemanager-ui: An optional submodule that contains the UI for managing packages and bundles within the AEM admin console.
 
 - appinventor: Another optional submodule that includes the App Inventor integration layer for AEM.

 - dependencies: A directory that contains various dependency jars required by the build tooling and runtime environment.

2. Naming Conventions for CSS Classes and Selectors

To ensure consistency and scalability, we should use meaningful, descriptive and semantic class names for our CSS styles. Incorporating BEM notation helps us achieve this by dividing our styles into three categories: block, element, and modifier. Below is an example of what this looks like:

```html
<div class="block__element--modifier">
    <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

Here, "block" refers to the main entity being styled, "element" refers to child entities inside the block that may require variations, and "modifier" adds special modifications depending on context. This enables us to easily target and modify specific elements without affecting others accidentally. For example, if we wanted to change the background color of all "page-header" elements, we could simply add the "bg-color-primary" modifier to the selector:

```css
/* Before */
.page-header {
    /* Some styles here */
}

/* After */
.page-header--bg-color-primary {
    /* Some updated styles here */
}
```

By utilizing BEM notation, we can create reusable components that allow us to apply consistent styles across the entire site. This significantly lowers the barrier of entry for new contributors who can quickly understand the purpose and structure of the codebase.

3. Frequency and Distribution of Used Typography and Color Schemes

One area of concern during the refactoring phase is ensuring that we don't inadvertently introduce inconsistent typographic and color scheme choices throughout the site. The team was able to identify several instances where the default text sizes, colors, fonts, and layout were either outdated or not attractively matching the rest of the design. To address this, we consulted with visual designers and created a unified design language that incorporates the desired tone, contrast, and spacing guidelines. This ensures that all text and graphical elements follow a uniform look and feel that reinforces the brand's identity.

4. Use of BEM Notation and Its Implementation Across the Codebase

We switched to using BEM notation extensively during the refactoring process, implementing it in line with our prescribed convention. While this does increase the verbosity of our CSS class names, it allows us to create clearer and more readable code. Furthermore, since all styles are grouped together under one hierarchy, it becomes much easier to navigate and manage the site's appearance and behavior.
