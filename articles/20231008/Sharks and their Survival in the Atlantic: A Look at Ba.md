# 1.背景介绍


Sharks are one of the most endangered animal species on the planet as they continue to suffer from numerous diseases including tropical storm-induced dysentery, shark infestation, and habitat destruction caused by anthropogenic activities like mining and development projects. In order to better understand these behaviors, we need to gain insights into bacterial pathogens that cause them symptoms such as stinging and fangs, microorganisms that act as a viral vector for shark attacks, and habitats where sharks hunt and store their meat and other products for consumption by humans or other predators.
In this article, I will provide a comprehensive overview of the various aspects related to the behavior and ecology of sharks across different regions around the world. I will examine what factors contribute to their survival, how microbes can help protect against disease outbreaks, and what habitats are suitable for sharks’ diet and restoration efforts. Finally, I will discuss potential future research directions to explore the complex interactions between sharks, bacteria, and their environment, which could inform conservation and management strategies for sharks throughout the ocean ecosystem.
# 2.核心概念与联系
To begin with, let's first define some key concepts and terms used commonly in the field of shark ecology. Here is a brief list of common terms along with their definitions:

1. **Bacterial pathogen** - A bacterium or organism that causes harmful conditions or interferes with normal cellular processes. Commonly found within both marine and terrestrial ecosystems and capable of causing illness or damage to cells and organs. Examples include toxins, parasites, viruses, and fungi.

2. **Virulence factor** - An immune system response to a particular pathogen that activates its immune defense mechanism. Virulence factors may be present in the host itself or may be passed on through the transmission of germline (ancestral) material during metamorphosis. Virulence factors normally remain constant and cannot be duplicated without extensive changes to the genome. However, in case of virulence mutations, virulence factors often mutate away and adapt to new defenses provided by the pathogen.

3. **Mucinoid membrane** - The outer surface layer of mollusks, shellfish, snails, and crustaceans containing several types of lipids that serve as carbohydrates and energy sources. The mucinoid membrane provides digestion of food molecules, metabolism, and excretion. There are three classes of mucins: carnosolic mucins, proteolytic mucins, and polysaccharide mucins. Saltwater crocodiles have mostly carnosolic mucins whereas freshwater ones have mostly polysaccharide mucins.

4. **Hydra** - A hydrozoan-like creature that lives in freshwater waters but migrates to warm seas or lakes. Hydra eats many different kinds of prey such as fish, shellfish, mollusks, and invertebrates. Some hydras also use poisonous serpentines to lure prey deeper into water than usual. They often migrate downstream to feed on smaller vertebrate animals called kings.

5. **Larva** - Larval stage of a shark’s embryo or juvenile stage. Larvae give rise to adult sharks who develop distinct morphologies and abilities later on in life. Larvae can grow quickly and swim far distances while still remaining small enough to fit comfortably inside their parents’ body. Adult sharks can go months to years before fully developed due to maturation and senescence cycles.

6. **Protist** - A colony of protozoans that move through sediments and are responsible for transmitting contagious pathogens and fluorescent nucleic acids. Most protists have a linear shape with a shell made up of chitinous connective tissue. Proteins make up the bulk of the fluid-filled interior, which serves as a barrier for the entrance of microbes.

7. **Fang** - One of two sensory nerve tips located on the underside of a shark’s head that extend above the olfactory tract and form a shield over the retina. Fangs send signals to the brain indicating danger and distraction in different parts of the body. The presence of multiple fangs increases the probability of catching a larger target. Additionally, some species of sharks have optic nerves that enable them to see underwater using low-light vision systems. 

8. **Sting** - A sudden and painful inflamed reaction involving the skin of the eye that triggers chemical reactions that damage adjacent structures. Often caused by insects or venomous animals, stings usually occur when a shark bites or snaps another object. Stings typically result in early death or injury. To control stinging behaviors, researchers have developed medications and therapeutics that suppress or block the effects of stinging agents.

9. **Venom gland** - An innermost structure that produces a highly purulent fluid filled with the sting of a shark. Venom glands are surrounded by layers of epidermis and hair follicles. When a shark bites, it tears open the glands to release its venom. Venoms can cause severe bleeding and even kill the affected individual. If a person has lost a shark, there may not be any trace left on their skin and potentially dangerous areas. 

By now, you should be familiar with some of the main concepts and terminology involved in understanding sharks and their ecology. We'll start our exploration of shark ecology with bacterial pathogens, microbes, and habitats. Let's learn more!
