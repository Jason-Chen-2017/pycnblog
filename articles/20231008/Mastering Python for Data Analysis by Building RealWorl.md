# 1.背景介绍


Python is one of the most popular programming languages in data analysis today. It has a wide range of libraries and frameworks available that help us to perform various types of tasks like data cleaning, machine learning, statistical modeling, etc. In this article, we will be covering how to use these tools effectively by building real world applications using python. We will also discuss about best practices and common pitfalls while working with python. 

By completing this article you can gain an understanding on how to work with different libraries and packages like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn, Statsmodels, Tensorflow, Keras, etc. and implement them efficiently for solving your data related problems. Additionally, you will have learned some advanced concepts like decorators, iterators, generators, context managers, metaclasses, and others along the way which are commonly used in production level codebases. This article assumes basic knowledge of Python syntax and programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, classes, objects, modules, and exceptions.


# 2. Core Concepts & Relationship
In order to master Python for data analysis, it's important to understand its core concepts and their relationship to each other. Here are some key concepts:

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm where programs are designed around objects or instances of classes. Classes define what attributes or properties they possess and methods they provide. Objects created from these classes are said to inherit all of those characteristics, making it easier to create reusable software components. OOP makes it easier to organize our code into logical units and make it more modular, maintainable, and extensible. Some popular object-oriented programming languages include Java, C++, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, etc. The Python language supports both procedural and object-oriented programming styles, making it easy for beginners and experts alike to learn.

## Functional Programming
Functional programming is a style of programming where programs are composed solely of mathematical functions without any side effects. Functions take inputs and return outputs but do not modify external state or variables outside themselves. Functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, Clojure, Scala, F#, Erlang, and Elm. These languages emphasize immutability, recursion, and higher-order functions, making it easy to reason about code and debug issues.

## Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are small anonymous functions that can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions. They are often used as short, throwaway functions that don't require a name or declaration. A lambda function expression consists of the keyword `lambda`, followed by zero or more parameters separated by commas, then a colon `:`, and finally a single expression that returns the result. For example:

```python
square = lambda x: x ** 2 # creates a lambda function that squares input value
print(square(3)) # prints "9"
```

Lambda functions can be used anywhere in Python where a function is required. They are especially useful when passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions such as map() or filter().

## Iterators vs Generators
Iterators and generators are two distinct concepts in Python. An iterator is an object that implements the `__next__()` method, which produces the next item in a sequence. Once there are no more items left, the iterator raises a StopIteration exception. Examples of built-in iterables in Python that are also iterators include lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and files. On the other hand, a generator is a special type of iterable that produces a stream of values over time rather than producing them all at once. When called, a generator yields a new value instead of returning it. Instead, it remains suspended until the next call. Examples of built-in generators in Python include list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and generator expressions.

## Decorators
Decorators are essentially a powerful tool in Python that allow us to modify the behavior of functions or class methods dynamically. A decorator takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it, thus allowing us to wrap existing functionality without having to copy and paste it. Some popular built-in decorators in Python include `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`.

## Context Managers
Context managers are a mechanism in Python that allows us to allocate and release resources precisely when needed. They are typically implemented using the __enter__() and __exit__() methods. A typical usage of a context manager is ensuring that file handles are closed after they are used, avoiding resource leaks and making sure that I/O operations are done properly.

## Metaclasses
Metaclasses are a fundamental concept in Python that allow us to create classes at runtime based on a given template. A metaclass is a class whose instances are classes, i.e., it is itself a class. Every class in Python inherits from the `type` class, which is a metaclass. Therefore, every class in Python is actually an instance of a metaclass. Common uses of metaclasses in Python include creating database ORM models, implementing plugin systems, and automatic creation of factory classes.
