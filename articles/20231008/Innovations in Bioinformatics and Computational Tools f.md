# 1.背景介绍


Personalized medicine refers to the use of personal data to predict or diagnose disease with greater accuracy than non-personalized methods [1]. To achieve this goal, researchers are exploring new ways of analysing large genomic datasets that collect information on each individual's biological traits [2] and using these insights to design better treatment plans [3]. However, to overcome the limitations of current machine learning algorithms for predicting diseases based on gene expression levels alone, scientists have also developed computational tools that integrate additional sources of information such as clinical symptoms [4], health records [5], lifestyle factors [6], social networks [7], and demographics [8]. Here we will focus on bioinformatics and computational tools used in personalised medicine, including integrative analysis pipelines that combine multiple omics data types and biomedical ontologies to improve predictions and reduce biases.

Bioinformatics (BIo) is a multidisciplinary field of study that involves using information sciences, computer science, mathematics, and engineering techniques to extract knowledge from complex biological systems. BIo tools help us understand molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases and develop treatments for them by identifying molecular markers responsible for their occurrence and developing drugs targeting those markers. A core concept in BIo is annotation, which involves labelling genes, proteins, and other biomolecules with attributes such as names, functions, and locations. It has been shown that annotation can significantly enhance our ability to discover new biology through genome sequencing technologies [9]. Annotation is often performed by comparing different sets of reference databases against annotated sequences, but existing annotation resources may not be able to capture all relevant features or information about specific diseases. This motivates the need for development of novel databases and tools that generate custom annotations for various diseases. 


Computational tools such as variant callers, pathway databases, and proteomics software enable researchers to identify and analyze biological patterns in large genomic datasets that can provide valuable insights into disease processes and therapeutic options. These tools can assist researchers in delineating biomarkers associated with disease progression, guiding targeted therapies, and prioritizing candidate genes and variants for validation studies. Currently, there exist several computational tools for predicting diseases based solely on gene expression profiles [10,11] without incorporating additional sources of information, making it challenging to assess the efficacy of personalized medicine strategies. 

To overcome these challenges, recent advances in computational biology have led to the creation of integrated analysis pipelines that leverage multiple omics data types and biomedical ontologies to make accurate disease predictions and avoid potential biases due to missing data or incorrect interpretation. Integrated analysis pipelines typically involve three main components: data integration, feature selection, and classification/regression modeling. The first step involves combining diverse data types such as transcriptome, epigenetics, methylation, proteomics, and metabolomic data to construct a comprehensive picture of cellular activity across different organs, tissues, and individuals. Feature selection then identifies key variables that contribute most towards disease prediction and eliminates redundant or irrelevant ones. Finally, classification/regression models train on selected features to produce probability scores or numerical values representing the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease state. Integrative approaches like these promise to revolutionize personalized medicine by providing a powerful way to translate high-dimensional omics data into actionable insights and therapy strategies.

Here we will present some common algorithms used in personalised medicine along with detailed explanations of how they work. These include ensemble methods, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), deep neural networks (DNNs), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM). Ensemble methods combine multiple base learners to obtain improved performance on imbalanced datasets, while MLPs, DNNs, decision trees, and SVMs are popular supervised learning models that can be trained on labeled dataset to predict outcomes. In each case, we will describe how they operate and explain why they are chosen for the purposes of personalised medicine. We will showcase examples of implementation code written in Python using open source libraries.
## Ensemble Methods 
Ensemble methods aim at reducing bias and variance errors arising from the use of single learner models. They train multiple copies of the same model on different subsets of training data and average their outputs to form a final output. There are two popular types of ensemble methods - bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and boosting (sequential model construction). Bagging involves randomly sampling subsets of the original dataset with replacement and fitting separate models on each subset. Boosting uses weak learners, which are simpler versions of the original model, to iteratively build a stronger model. Each subsequent learner focuses on samples that the previous one misclassified. The final classifier is the weighted sum of all weak classifiers. For example, Random Forest (RF) algorithm combines multiple decision trees to mitigate overfitting and enhance generalization error rate.

### How does RF work? 
The basic idea behind Random Forest (RF) is to create many decision trees on bootstrapped samples of the data set, where each tree selects a random sample of instances and labels them based on its entropy at each node. At each split point in the tree, the criterion used is the Gini index, which measures the impurity of the nodes created. After selecting the best split at each node, the process continues until no more splits are possible or until the desired number of trees is reached. 

When building a Random Forest, the following steps are followed:
1. Select N bootstrap samples from the original dataset, with replacement. 
2. Build a decision tree on each bootstrap sample and save it in the forest.
3. Average the predicted class probabilities for each instance among all the decision trees in the forest.

Overall, this approach reduces variance by averaging out the results of the individual trees, resulting in less overfitting and increasing robustness compared to using a single decision tree. Additionally, the uncertainty estimates obtained using Random Forest are typically more reliable compared to Decision Trees since the latter tend to overfit when given small subsets of the data. Furthermore, parallel processing capabilities allow Random Forests to scale well to large data sets. Despite its simplicity, RF performs surprisingly well in practice, achieving higher accuracy than competitors such as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
