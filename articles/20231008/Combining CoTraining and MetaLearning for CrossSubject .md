# 1.背景介绍


## Brain tumor segmentation from head CT images is a challenging task due to the high variability of appearance and spatial patterns among patients with different anatomies. To address this challenge, we developed two novel methods that combines co-training (a strategy of training several models simultaneously on multiple datasets) and meta learning (a strategy of adapting one model to new data by reusing its learned knowledge). The first method is called CTTS (Co-Trained Tumor Segmentation), which uses expertise gained from experts in each subject to learn accurate features of their tumors while minimizing interference from other subjects' tumors. The second method, META-QSOM (Meta QSOM Algorithm), further improves on CTTS by exploiting multiple feature spaces learned from multiple views or modalities such as T1-weighted imaging and FLAIR contrast enhanced imaging. It utilizes meta-learning techniques to transfer learning across these modalities and learns a shared space of representations that can be applied across all views/modalities for cross-subject brain tumor segmentation. This paper presents both algorithms in detail along with experimental results and analysis.
## Objective
To develop two state-of-the-art methods for segmenting brain tumors from head CT images using cross-subject co-training and meta learning strategies. These methods should achieve improved performance compared to existing ones in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC score and computational time when applied to different sets of head CT image datasets. Moreover, we will explore how to apply these methods to transfer learning scenarios where labeled data are available only for some subjects and need to be leveraged to improve generalization ability of the trained model on unseen test subjects’ data. In addition, we aim at identifying potential factors affecting segmentation accuracy in terms of patient demographics, clinical findings, MRI scans parameters, and acquisition settings. We will also compare the performance of our proposed methods against alternative baseline methods for comparison purposes. Finally, we seek to identify limitations and future research directions related to these approaches. 


# 2.核心概念与联系
## Key concepts and terminologies:

1. **Cross-Subject Co-Training:** A machine learning technique used to train a single model on multiple datasets simultaneously, allowing it to learn information from different sources without being biased towards any one dataset.

2. **Meta Learning:** An approach used to adapt a model to new data by reusing its learned knowledge. In the context of brain tumor segmentation, meta learning allows us to combine information learned from many different views/modalities into a common representation, thereby improving overall performance.

3. **Multi-Modality:** A combination of medical imaging techniques used to capture information about the human body.

4. **Transfer Learning:** Technique of transferring knowledge learned from a source domain to another target domain. Used in brain tumor segmentation when limited labeled data is available for certain subjects and needs to be incorporated into the training process to enhance generalization capacity.

5. **Expertise Gained from Experts**: Knowledge acquired from diverse experiences and perspectives of various anatomists and pathologists who have expertise in individual regions of the brain. This forms the basis of CTTS algorithm.

6. **Common Representation Space Learned Across Multiple Views/Modalities:** Common latent space learned across different imaging modalities, representing similar features present in different areas of the brain. This forms the basis of META-QSOM algorithm.

7. **Patient Demographics:** Information about the individuals involved in the study, including age, sex, disease history, etc., that influence how they see and understand the tissue surrounding them.

8. **Clinical Findings:** Details about the condition under examination, including severity, location, size, type, treatment plan, progression over time, etc., which may impact tumor segmentation performance.

9. **MRI Scans Parameters:** Various parameters associated with the imaging procedures performed during a scan, such as field of view (FOV), pixel dimensions, slice thickness, acceleration factor, etc., which may affect the quality of the resulting images.

10. **Acquisition Settings:** The conditions under which the images were acquired, including scanner settings, hardware setup, flip angle, etc., which affects the way the images are collected and interpreted.
