# 1.背景介绍


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the world in many ways, such as enabling people to work more efficiently and effectively by automating tasks, providing personalized recommendations, or suggesting answers to complex questions. However, despite their tremendous potential, there are still challenges associated with implementing an AI system in real-world scenarios that go beyond simply processing data and using algorithms. These challenges can be broken down into two main categories - knowledge engineering and reasoning.

Knowledge engineering refers to the process of designing and developing a logical and structured representation of knowledge from different sources such as text, images, videos, and sensors for use in building intelligent systems. It involves extracting valuable information from raw data and transforming it into a form that is easy to understand and manage. For instance, consider building a chatbot application for answering customer queries based on FAQs. Before we begin building this system, we need to extract relevant information from a set of FAQs stored in a database. This requires us to parse through these documents and identify key terms and sentences that may provide helpful responses. Once we have extracted all the relevant information, we need to structure them into a logical format that makes it easier for our model to learn patterns and make predictions.

Reasoning is closely related to the ability of machines to infer new facts from prior observations and evidence. In simpler words, reasoning involves taking inputs, applying rules, and producing outputs based on those rules. The goal of reasoning is to find correlations between observed events, interpret incomplete data sets, and predict future outcomes based on current conditions. Traditional expert systems rely heavily on handcrafted rule-based programming techniques like if-then statements and decision trees to solve such problems. However, recent advancements in machine learning techniques like deep neural networks and reinforcement learning are making progress towards achieving human-level accuracy in solving such complex problems. 

To implement an effective AI system, we need to combine both knowledge engineering and reasoning capabilities to create a powerful and accurate model. Knowledge engineering enables us to build a robust foundation of concepts, relationships, and logic that allow our model to generalize and acquire new knowledge over time. On the other hand, reasoning allows our model to apply its learned knowledge to new situations and problem domains, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, combining both areas of AI technology will enable us to develop sophisticated models that can handle large volumes of data and offer users intuitive and contextual interfaces that they can easily interact with.

In summary, knowing how to apply knowledge engineering principles and reasoning techniques together can help you to successfully develop intelligent applications that can perform various tasks and services effectively and efficiently. By leveraging the latest advances in AI technologies, expert systems can now play a crucial role in creating advanced solutions that can improve life quality, enhance economic opportunities, and save lives across the world. To fully embrace the power of artificial intelligence, you must master both knowledge engineering and reasoning skills and become an expert in both fields so that you can build successful AI systems capable of delivering value at scale. Therefore, I hope that this article helps you gain a better understanding of AI expert systems and provides a solid roadmap for further exploration and education.



# 2.核心概念与联系

Before diving into the details of the core algorithm used for building an AI expert system, let’s first define some important terms and concepts that we need to know beforehand. Here is a brief overview of what each term means:

1. Knowledge base: A collection of facts about a given domain that our model uses to make decisions or predictions. Facts could include attributes and values associated with objects, relations between entities, or examples that demonstrate the behavior of certain actions and outcomes.

2. Expertise: The capacity of an agent to accurately and concisely represent and communicate its knowledge to others. An expert can take on multiple roles within the same domain, depending on the level of proficiency required. 

3. Rule-based systems: Systems that utilize a set of predetermined rules to solve problems. Examples of rule-based systems include expert systems, decision trees, and case-based reasoning.

4. Statistical learning: Algorithms that use statistical modeling techniques to learn and make predictions based on historical data. Some common types of statistical learning include regression, classification, clustering, and association analysis.

5. Neural networks: Artificial neural networks are computing systems inspired by the neurons found in the brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or units, which receive input, process it, and generate output. Commonly used neural network architectures include convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory networks, and recurrent neural networks.

6. Reinforcement learning: Machine learning technique that learns through trial and error. It works by training an agent to select actions that lead to desired outcomes, while receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Commonly used reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning, policy gradient methods, and deep Q-networks.

7. Probabilistic inference: A mathematical framework for representing uncertainity in probabilistic models. We can use probability distributions to quantify the uncertainty inherent in our models and estimate their certainty level.

8. Bayesian inference: Methodology for performing probabilistic inference using prior beliefs and data. Prior beliefs capture our initial thoughts and assumptions about the world and update over time using new data. 

9. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Method for sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions that require efficient computation. MCMC approximates the posterior distribution by generating samples from the likelihood function. 

Now that we have introduced the basic concepts behind expert systems, we can move on to discuss the specific algorithm used for building one – Propositional Logic Theorem Prover (PLTP).

Propositional Logic Theorem Provers (PLTP) are automated theorem provers that operate under the assumption that the user knows the language of propositional logic. They verify the correctness of hypotheses provided by the user by applying various procedures, including pattern matching, resolution, forward chaining, backward chaining, and deduction. PLTPs are commonly used in the field of computer science, mathematics, linguistics, philosophy, and other fields where formal reasoning and proof is necessary.
