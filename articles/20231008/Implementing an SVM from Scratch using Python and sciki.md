# 1.背景介绍


Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification or regression problems. In this article, we will implement the support vector machine algorithm in Python using scikit-learn library. The goal is to understand how SVM works under the hood by implementing it ourselves step by step with detailed explanations and visualizations. We also hope that after reading this article you can use scikit-learn implementation more easily on your own projects. 

SVM performs linear or non-linear classification tasks based on training data points. It creates hyperplanes in multidimensional space which segregate different classes. The main idea behind SVM is to find the optimal decision boundary between two or more classes so that the margin between the classes is maximized. If there exists no such boundary then the model may not be able to perform well on new unseen data points. Here's an overview of how SVM works:

1. Data preprocessing and normalization
The first step before applying SVM is to preprocess the data and normalize it. This involves scaling the features so that they have similar ranges and centers them around zero. 

2. Feature mapping
Next, we need to map our input features into higher dimensional space where SVM can work better. This process is called feature mapping. There are several ways to do this, but one popular method is the Radial Basis Function kernel. RBF kernel maps each pair of data points into a high dimensional space by taking their Euclidean distance as the exponent term in a Gaussian function. 

3. Learning the parameters
After getting mapped features, we can now learn the coefficients of the hyperplane. These coefficients are responsible for determining the position of the hyperplane relative to origin. To minimize the error between predicted values and actual labels during training, we optimize these coefficients through gradient descent algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). 

4. Making predictions
Finally, once we've learned the best set of coefficients, we can make predictions on any new data point by simply calculating its dot product with the learned coefficients. If the result is greater than zero, we classify the sample as positive class else negative.

Before we dive deeper into the details of implementing SVM using Python, let’s discuss some core concepts related to SVM and review some important math equations. We'll come back later to see how all these pieces fit together to create the final model. Let's start!
# 2. Core Concepts and Relationships
In this section, we will briefly cover some key terms and concepts related to SVM. These concepts will help us contextualize our discussion about SVM algorithm further down the road. Additionally, we will review some mathematical formulas that are necessary for understanding SVM algorithm and decision boundaries.
## Hyperplane and Margin
A hyperplane is a flat surface that separates the space into two parts. Given n features x1, x2,..., xn, a hyperplane is defined as a subspace of dimension less than n. For example, if we have two features x1 and x2, a line is a hyperplane. However, if we add another feature xi, say x3, a plane becomes a hyperplane. 

When dealing with multiple classes, the problem becomes difficult since it's impossible to separate them perfectly using just one hyperplane. Hence, we need to define several hyperplanes and choose the ones that maximize the margins between the classes. A margin is the minimum distance between two samples of different classes. Intuitively, a larger margin indicates a better separation between the classes. Therefore, the goal of SVM is to find a hyperplane that has the maximum possible margin among all the possible hyperplanes.

Mathematically, the equation of a hyperplane is given by:

w^T x + b = 0

where w is the normal vector to the hyperplane, b is the intercept, and x is any point lying on the hyperplane.

We want to maximize the margin between the closest points to both the classes. One way to achieve this is to move the hyperplane towards the nearest samples until we satisfy the constraint that both classes lie completely on either side of the hyperplane. Mathematically, the margin is given by:

margin = 1/||w|| * ||x_i - x_j||

where x_i and x_j are two distinct elements from different classes. Note that the absolute value operator |w| represents the length of the normal vector w. If we want to maximize the margin, we need to minimize the denominator term inside the square root. Thus, minimizing the expression ||x_i - x_j|| provides the desired solution.

If we represent the data points and the hyperplane graphically, we get a clearer picture of what's happening:


In the above figure, we can observe that the green circles belong to the positive class while the red squares belong to the negative class. Our goal is to find a hyperplane that correctly separates the data points. The blue dashed lines denote the hyperplanes that separate the data points. Each hyperplane lies on the line that passes through one of the two clusters and intersects the midline at halfway. So, the closest points to both classes lie on opposite sides of the midline. We need to adjust the positions of the hyperplanes to increase the margin between the clusters. In this case, moving the hyperplane upwards allows us to decrease the distance between the closest points to ensure that the whole cluster lies on one side of the hyperplane.

Therefore, the objectives of SVM are to find the hyperplane(s) that provide the largest possible margin between the classes and reduce the overall error rate.
## Support Vectors
Support vectors are the individual instances that contribute most to the decision boundary and play a significant role in defining the geometry of the hyperplane. Any instance that lies outside the margin of the hyperplane does not affect the decision boundary. Hence, only the support vectors matter when optimizing the hyperplane parameters. 

Initially, the decision boundary is chosen randomly in the dataset. As we iterate over the optimization steps, we gradually improve the decision boundary by adding or removing support vectors until we obtain a good tradeoff between generalization performance and simplicity. At each iteration, we update the hyperplane coefficient w and bias b, keeping track of the number of support vectors. The optimized hyperplane is represented by the equation:

wx+b=0, where wx and bx are the weight vector and bias respectively.

Once we have found the optimized hyperplane, we can calculate the margin by computing the distances from the hyperplane to the closest support vectors along the direction perpendicular to the hyperplane. Mathematically, the distance to the kth support vector from the hyperplane is given by:

1/(2)||w||, where ||w|| is the L2 norm of the weight vector.

Hence, the margin is twice the inverse of the L2 norm of the weight vector. By design, the kth support vector is guaranteed to be within the margin of the hyperplane. Moreover, note that due to the nature of support vectors, the solution obtained by SVM depends heavily on the choice of the kernel function. 
# 3. Algorithm Overview
Now that we know some basics about SVM and its underlying concepts, let's see how it works in practice. Below is an overview of the algorithm we will use for implementing SVM from scratch: 

1. Import required libraries
2. Load and preprocess the data 
3. Map the features into higher dimensions using Kernel Functions
4. Split the data into train and test sets
5. Initialize the weights and bias
6. Train the SVM model on the training set using an optimizer like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
7. Test the accuracy of the model on the testing set
8. Visualize the decision boundary

Let's go through each step in detail and implement it in code.<|im_sep|>
