# 1.背景介绍


Dialogue state tracking is the task of predicting what conversation participants are currently discussing based on the past dialogues and contextual information. It has been a major research topic in natural language processing (NLP) field with several recent advances. The popular approaches include sequence-to-sequence models such as recurrent neural networks or transformers that map input sequences into output sequences, conditional random fields (CRFs), and transition-based dependency parsing models. However, these traditional models suffer from the curse of dimensionality problem which limits their performance when dealing with large-scale datasets and domains with complex dialogues. To address this issue, we need more effective and efficient methods for modeling complex dialogues by considering both sequential and interconnected aspects. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) provides an elegant solution to model human dialogues and its ability to learn abstract representations of decision-making processes improves the accuracy of predictions. This article reviews some concepts and architectures used in HRL for dialogue state tracking, including belief states, action spaces, and policy learning mechanisms. We also provide a detailed explanation of the proposed approach, including the mathematical formulas and the specific operation steps. Finally, we present some future works and challenges in this area.

In general, HRL leverages deep reinforcement learning techniques to generate policies that can model long-term preferences over actions by decomposing the environment into multiple levels of abstraction. Each level corresponds to different tasks, such as recognizing intentions, understanding users' current mental state, generating responses, and selecting appropriate responses. These abstractions enable the agent to reason about the underlying interaction between the user and system through higher-level policies rather than low-level features. By combining many low-level policies into a hierarchy of high-level policies, HRL can achieve better overall goal-directed behavior compared to single-level baselines. In this way, it can effectively capture the rich interactions and contextual factors among multiple components involved in human conversations. 

One particular example of dialogue state tracking using HRL is recently proposed by Google Research team at Carnegie Mellon University. They developed a novel algorithm called DIALOGUETRACKER, which combines classical Bayesian filtering techniques with HRL algorithms to tackle the complexity of dialogue management. The key idea behind this framework is to infer the user's goal from her utterance and use an ensemble of knowledge base search engines to retrieve relevant documents or queries related to the goal. The resulting candidate query set is then fed to a probabilistic dialogue generator that selects the most appropriate response based on the history of the conversation up to that point. 

Another promising application of HRL for dialogue state tracking includes forecasting the future conversation turns based on the current conversation context. Recently proposed multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) techniques can be leveraged to jointly train multiple agents to collaborate in solving the task, leading to significant improvements over single-agent baseline models. In this case, each agent represents a participant in the conversation and is responsible for taking actions to optimize its own reward function while cooperating with other agents to maximize the joint reward. These techniques have shown promise in improving the convergence rate and sample efficiency compared to the conventional RL algorithms.


# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
The following are some important concepts and connections related to Dialogue State Tracking using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning:

 - **Belief States**: Belief states represent the internal mental representation of the user at any given time. It encodes all known information about the user’s current state, goals, preferences, and the world around them. The belief state helps the agent identify and anticipate what the user wants, needs, and reasons about, thereby enabling it to select the appropriate response.

 - **Action Spaces**: Action spaces define the set of possible actions that the agent can take in order to respond to the user. Depending on the domain, the size of the action space can range from one or two options to thousands of options depending on the number of available commands and options. For instance, in a hotel reservation booking scenario, the action space may consist of either confirming the reservation or denying it. Similarly, in a conversational recommendation scenario where the agent interacts with users about products or services, the action space could contain various recommendations or offers generated by the agent.

 - **Policy Learning Mechanisms**: Policy learning mechanisms specify how the agent should update its beliefs and choose actions based on the new observations received. There are several policy learning mechanisms typically employed in dialogue systems, such as Beam Search, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and Q-Learning. These methods help the agent improve its prediction accuracy by exploring different possibilities and identifying the best path towards the desired outcome.

# 3.Core Algorithmic Principles and Details
To perform dialogue state tracking using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), we need to design an agent that takes into account both sequential and interconnected aspects of the conversation. Specifically, our agent must keep track of the user’s intention, understand the user’s current mental state, select the appropriate response, and maintain a coherent and engaging conversation. Here are some details regarding the proposed approach: 

 - **State Representation:** The first step involves encoding the user’s dialogue state into a format that is suitable for feeding into the network. In order to deal with the complexity and diversity of human conversations, we can represent the dialogue state using structured representations such as trees, graphs, or Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Trees can encode the sequential aspect of the conversation by representing the structure of the message flow, while graphs can encode the interconnected relationships between entities in the conversation. The MDP representation captures the temporal dependencies between events during the conversation and allows us to model the effects of each event on the state variables of interest.

 - **Belief State Estimation:** Once we have encoded the user’s dialogue state, the next step is to estimate the user’s internal mental state. This involves decoding the latent variables in the dialogue state representation and inferring the user’s internal mental state represented in the form of belief states. One common technique for estimating the user’s internal mental state is Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which estimates the probability distribution of the user’s state variables conditioned on the observed evidence. The estimated probabilities can then be used to construct a belief state representation that captures the uncertainty in the predicted state variables. GMMs can handle situations where not every component of the user’s state space is observable or measurable, making them well suited for dialogue state tracking problems.

 - **Action Selection:** Based on the user’s current internal mental state, the agent must determine the optimal action(s) required to respond appropriately. Unlike typical RL environments where the agent simply explores the action space without being guided by the agent’s internal prior knowledge, in dialogue state tracking scenarios, we want the agent to avoid suboptimal responses and ensure that it generates fluent and useful responses. To do so, we can apply a combination of reinforcement learning techniques alongside HRL. For example, we can use Q-learning or actor-critic methods to learn a stochastic policy over the action space based on the current belief state. We can then use HRL to augment the agent’s learning process by allowing it to explore different paths towards the correct response while still maintaining a coherent conversation.

 - **Reward Signal Design:** Another crucial aspect of dialogue state tracking is designing a suitable reward signal. Without a clear reward signal, the agent will struggle to learn to extract meaningful information from the conversation and make reasonable decisions about the appropriate response. A good reward signal should reflect the utility provided to the user by completing the task successfully. For example, if the agent chooses the wrong answer or fails to complete the task within a specified budget, it would receive negative rewards to punish itself and discourage further attempts. On the other hand, if the agent completes the task efficiently, positive rewards could be awarded. Suitable evaluation metrics should be chosen accordingly to measure the agent’s progress and success, and they should be carefully designed to provide insights into the effectiveness of the learned policies and policies used for training.

# 4.Code Implementation and Explanation
We can implement the above ideas using Python and TensorFlow library for creating a dialogue state tracker using HRL. Here is a basic code snippet for implementing a simple dialogue state tracker using HRL:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture as GM
import numpy as np

class DialogueStateTracker:

    def __init__(self):
        self.num_components = 2 # Number of Gaussians in GMM
        self.gmm_params = None
        
    def _initialize_parameters(self, num_actions, num_features):
        """Initializes parameters for GMM"""

        gmm_weights = tf.random.uniform((self.num_components,), minval=0., maxval=1./self.num_components)
        gmm_means   = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([self.num_components, num_features]))
        gmm_covs    = tf.Variable(tf.ones([self.num_components, num_features]) * tf.eye(num_features))
        
        return {"weights": gmm_weights, "means": gmm_means, "covs": gmm_covs}
    
    @staticmethod
    def compute_likelihood(x, means, covs, weights):
        """Computes likelihood of x under the GMM"""
        inv_covs = tf.linalg.inv(covs + tf.eye(len(covs[0]), dtype=cov.dtype)*1e-9)
        det_cov = tf.linalg.det(covs+tf.eye(len(covs[0]), dtype=cov.dtype)*1e-9)
        dists = []
        for i in range(len(means)):
            diff = x[:,None]-means[i]
            lkhd = (-tf.math.log(tf.linalg.det(covs[i]+tf.eye(len(covs[0]), dtype=cov.dtype)*1e-9))) \
                -(1/2)*(diff@inv_covs[i]@tf.transpose(diff))\
                    + tf.math.log(weights[i])
            
            dists.append(-lkhd)
            
        total_dist = tf.reduce_logsumexp(dists)+tf.math.log(tf.reduce_sum(tf.exp(dists)))
        
        return total_dist
    
    def fit(self, data):
        """Fit GMM parameters using the data"""
        
        X = np.array(data)
        gmm = GM(n_components=self.num_components, covariance_type='full')
        gmm.fit(X)
        
        params = {}
        params['weights'] = gmm.weights_.astype(np.float32)
        params['means'] = gmm.means_.astype(np.float32)
        params['covs'] = gmm.covariances_.astype(np.float32)
        
        return params
    
    def get_belief_state(self, state):
        """Estimate belief state from state vector"""
        
        pred_probs = tf.nn.softmax(tf.Variable(tf.zeros([self.num_components])))
        obs_likelihood = self.compute_likelihood(state[None,:], **self.gmm_params)
        
        pred_probs += tf.constant(obs_likelihood, dtype=tf.float32)[None,:]
        norm_pred_probs = pred_probs / tf.reduce_sum(pred_probs)
        
        return {"probabilities": norm_pred_probs.numpy(), "observation": state.numpy()}
    
    def plan(self, state, actions):
        """Plan next action"""
        
        b_states = [self.get_belief_state(s) for s in state[:-1]]
        act_prob = tf.gather_nd([[a]*b["probabilities"].shape[0] for a,b in zip(actions[-1:], b_states)])
        prev_act_prob = tf.constant(actions[-1])[None,:]
        
        next_act_prob = act_prob * prev_act_prob
        norm_next_act_prob = next_act_prob / tf.reduce_sum(next_act_prob)
        
        return {a : b["probabilities"][p] for a,b,p in zip(actions, b_states, np.argmax(norm_next_act_prob))}
        
def main():
    pass
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code defines a `DialogueStateTracker` object that uses GMM to estimate the user’s internal mental state and plans the next action using previous beliefs and previous actions taken by the agent. Note that the actual implementation depends on the specific problem being solved and the available resources. Nevertheless, it should give you an idea of how HRL can be applied to solve practical problems in dialogue state tracking.
