# 1.背景介绍


Facial expression recognition (FER) is one of the most important tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition area that can help machines understand human emotions from facial expressions. FER systems use a variety of techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep learning algorithms and feature engineering to automatically identify emotions expressed by human faces. CNN-based FER systems have achieved impressive performance on various benchmark datasets, including AffectNet, JAFFE, CK+, etc., which are widely used in research fields related to affective computing and biometric authentication. However, there exist challenges when applying these methods to real-world applications, especially in challenging scenarios where lighting conditions, pose variations, and occlusions become more common than those encountered in the training set. To address this issue, we present an approach called Face-Averaging using Convolutional Neural Network (FaceACNN) based FER system. The key idea behind our proposed method is to learn discriminative features at multiple spatial scales instead of relying on handcrafted filters or patterns. In particular, we propose a novel architecture consisting of two CNN blocks followed by a weighted summation to compute the final facial expression prediction. By stacking several parallel CNN blocks with different receptive field sizes and downsampling factors, our network can extract high-level features from both low-level visual cues and higher-order semantic features. We evaluate our method on three popular benchmark datasets including CASIA-B, JAFFE, and Oulu-NPU, achieving state-of-the-art results among other competitors. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can be applied to face recognition in practical scenarios.
In this article, we will introduce the general concept and principles of CNN-based FER systems, explain their key components, discuss the limitations and potential solutions when dealing with practical issues specific to real-world scenarios, present an overview of our FaceACNN FER system, compare it with existing state-of-the-art methods, and finally provide some guidelines for practical usage. Overall, our work aims to inspire further research in this interesting but still underexplored area of facial expression recognition and provides valuable insights into practical applications of deep learning models for facial expression analysis.

CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) is a type of artificial neural network that uses convolutional layers to process and recognize patterns in image data. It has been shown to achieve impressive results on various machine learning problems, including object detection, image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Similarly, CNNs can also be employed in facial expression recognition (FER) systems to automatically infer the underlying emotional state displayed by the subject's face. 

Therefore, before delving deeper into the details of our FER system, let us first define some fundamental concepts and relationships between them:

1. Emotion: The term "emotion" refers to an experience of feeling something good, bad, happy, sad, etc. Emotions can occur over time and space, making up the complex social, cultural, and psychological experiences that make up our lives. 

2. Visual Cues: Different aspects of the external world that convey information about the person's emotion include the appearance of the face, body posture, clothing styles, and expression. These cues enable observers to quickly perceive and interpret the mental and physical states of the people they observe.

3. Feature Extraction: Despite being crucial elements of understanding emotions, visual cues alone cannot fully capture all of the relevant factors involved in emotional expression. Therefore, additional non-visual cues must be incorporated into the model to effectively capture contextual clues. This task falls within the domain of Computer Vision (CV). CV involves the extraction of meaningful features from digital images or videos to improve the accuracy of subsequent processing steps. One commonly used technique for feature extraction in the FER community is called "facial landmark detection". The goal of this technology is to locate unique regions of interest in the face image that exhibit distinctive characteristics like corners, nose bridge, mouth corners, and eyes. Another example of feature extraction approaches includes Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH).

4. Classification: Once we obtain a set of extracted features, we need to classify them into one of the pre-defined classes, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc., depending on what the corresponding emotion is. Typically, FER systems utilize supervised learning techniques to train their classifiers. Some of the most commonly used algorithms include Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest.

5. Benchmark Datasets: A set of test datasets and evaluation metrics are essential to ensure the quality and reliability of any FER system. There are many publicly available datasets used for evaluating FER systems, such as AffectNet, CK+ and JAFFE. Each dataset contains a diverse collection of facial video clips recorded in a wide range of emotions, lighting conditions, poses, and camera angles. Since each dataset may have its own unique challenges and constraints, it is necessary to carefully select appropriate datasets for evaluation purposes.

6. Transfer Learning: Transfer learning refers to the transfer of knowledge learned from one task to another similar task. In FER systems, transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models trained on large-scale datasets to speed up the development of new models. For instance, we can take advantage of a pre-trained CNN model trained on ImageNet dataset to reduce the amount of required labeled data and computational resources while fine-tuning it to adapt to our target emotion recognition task.

Now that we have defined some basic terms and concepts, let us dive deeper into the design and implementation of our FaceACNN FER system.
