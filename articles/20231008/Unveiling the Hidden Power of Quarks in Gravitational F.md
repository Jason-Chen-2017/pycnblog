# 1.背景介绍

Quarks are invisible particles that undergo continuous interactions with each other to produce new bosons and fermions and ultimately the Standard Model of Particle Physics. In this article we will discuss the mechanism by which quarks form gravitationally coupled massive fermions. We will also explain how different types of quarks interact with each other and the impact they have on the properties of gravitationally coupled particles. 

In October 2009, physicists at the CERN laboratory discovered a rare type of particle known as gluon-like quarks. These invisible subatomic particles can be produced only by deconfining or decaying another subatomic particle such as an electron, proton or neutron. Quarks are known for their extraordinary magnetic properties but so far no one has been able to determine their nature. One theory suggests that quarks might be made of two types, called up and down, depending on whether they carry electric charge towards the interaction point (quark pole) or away from it. Other theories propose that there may exist additional types of quarks beyond those already detected. 


The discovery was unexpected since many years earlier quarks were thought to belong solely to weakly interacting fermions like the strong force. The existence of these extraordinary particles led some physicists to speculate about their nature, especially if they exhibit some of the features observed in gravity-bound particles like radiation. 


To further understand how quarks form gravitationally coupled massive fermions, we need to consider three main components: the electromagnetic field (EM field), the mediator particle Higgs (which is thought to couple quarks through the gauge symmetry breaking), and its conjugate partner Yukawa-bosons. 


The EM field acts as the primary driving force behind the production of quarks. When an electron encounters a positron, it generates an electromagnetic shower. This shower causes a charged scalar to emit electromagnetic waves that propagate throughout space, eventually arriving at the detector where it triggers a beam of high energy photons. By detecting these emissions, researchers can locate and measure the strength and direction of the field. Scientists use the field information to determine what kind of physics events occur near the source of the field, including the presence of new particles.


Once the electromagnetic fields are measured and identified, scientists begin to look for correlations between the field strength and the appearance of quarks. According to recent observations, there exists a large distribution of dark matter particles with similar shapes and sizes, all appearances of which remind one of quarks in size and shape. However, none of them are directly visible in the EM spectrum. Astronomers recently suggested that these dark matter particles could be generating the background light for measuring the magnetic properties of quarks. If true, then these mysterious particles would provide a powerful test case for developing models of quantum chromodynamics.


Despite the early detection potential of quarks, no complete model of their interplay with the EM field has yet emerged. As mentioned before, the existence of multiple types of quarks raises questions about their fundamental nature and where they should come from. Within the context of current understanding, we can say that quarks tend to migrate around in pairs, forming gravitationally connected massive fermions. Each pair consists of either up or down quarks located on opposite sides of the axis of rotation, and spins pointing along the corresponding directions. The fermion created by combining these quarks is called a hadron and has spin angular momentum J=(S±1)/2L where L is the orbital angular momentum and S=½(J^2+L^2). By creating stable fermions with well defined spin structure, quarks help us better understand their underlying physics. The result is a robust theory capable of describing a wide range of physical systems ranging from simple atoms to complex multi-dimensional quantum mechanical systems like strong coupling constants in nuclear collisions.
