# 1.背景介绍

Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing and computational linguistics techniques to identify and extract subjective information from text data such as customer feedbacks, social media texts, online reviews, or product reviews. The goal is to determine if a piece of text expresses positive, negative or neutral sentiment towards some topic, entity, or person. It can be used in various applications such as sentiment tracking, brand reputation management, opinion mining, review analysis, and many more. 

In this article, we will learn how to perform sentiment analysis on tweets using Python. We will also cover popular machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis like Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. We will implement these models in Python with detailed explanations along with examples and case studies.

This article assumes that you are familiar with basic concepts of programming, data structures, and statistical modeling. If not, I recommend going through some basic tutorials before proceeding further.

Let's get started!<|im_sep|>
2. Core Concepts
Sentiment analysis involves extracting subjective features from textual data such as positive/negative words, emoticons, or sentiment lexicons. Here are few core concepts that should be understood while performing sentiment analysis:

1. Vocabulary: A vocabulary is the set of all unique words present in the dataset. To ensure consistency across different datasets, it is essential to remove stopwords, punctuations, and special characters from the entire corpus. 

2. Bag-of-Words Model: The bag-of-words model represents each document as a vector containing the frequency count of each word in the document. This representation simplifies the process of counting the occurrence of individual words but loses the order and context of the words. Therefore, it may miss important relationships between words within a sentence. For example, "I love pizza" and "Love pizza makes me happy" would have very different representations depending on their structure.

3. Word Embeddings: Word embeddings represent words as vectors which capture semantic meaning by considering the context in which they appear in the sentences. There are two ways of creating word embeddings - Static and Continuous. In static embeddings, the embedding is fixed for each word. In continuous embeddings, the word embeddings are learned during training based on the cooccurrence patterns among words. These embeddings capture syntactic and discourse-level properties of words. 

4. Corpus: The corpus is the collection of documents on which sentiment analysis needs to be performed. Each document must contain the feature vector representing its content and class label indicating whether it belongs to a positive or negative category.

5. Lexicon: A lexicon is a manually created list of phrases and their associated sentiment scores. They help to correct the errors caused by variations in speech patterns and personal style.

6. Feature Extraction: The feature extraction step converts raw text into numerical features that can be used for classification tasks. The most common feature extraction technique is bag-of-ngrams where n refers to the number of words included in each gram. Other techniques include TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.  

Now let’s move forward to learn about various Machine Learning Algorithms.<|im_sep|>
3. Popular ML Algorithms for Sentiment Analysis 
Before implementing any algorithm, let’s understand why do we need them? Well, there are several reasons why we require multiple algorithms when performing sentiment analysis. Let’s see what each algorithm does:

1. Naïve Bayes Algorithm: Naïve Bayes Classifier is simple yet effective algorithm for text classification task. It uses the probability of word occurrences within a given document to make predictions. It assumes that all features are independent of each other. So it performs well even when a small subset of features dominate the decision boundary. However, since it assumes independence, it doesn't handle sparsity issues effectively. 

2. Support Vector Machines: SVM is powerful classifier for text classification problem. It works great for complex non-linear problems. The main idea behind SVM is to find the best hyperplane that separates classes with maximum margin. Its objective function is optimized via kernel trick, making it scalable to large datasets. However, SVM requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.  

3. Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is another type of linear classifier widely used in sentiment analysis. It computes the log odds ratio of an observation, i.e., the logarithm of the likelihood ratio of the class membership. Thus, it is similar to SVM except that it estimates probabilities directly instead of margins. It has been shown to perform better than Naïve Bayes and SVM on imbalanced datasets. 

4. Random Forests: Random forests is one of the most commonly used ensemble methods for text classification. It combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It generates decision trees using random subsets of features and samples, reducing correlation among them. Overall, it outperforms other traditional classifiers. 

We now know the basics of sentiment analysis and the four popular machine learning algorithms available for sentiment analysis. Let's implement some code!
