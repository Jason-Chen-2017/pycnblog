# 1.背景介绍


Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning approach that enables an agent to learn from experience by trial-and-error. It refers to the problem where an agent interacts with its environment through actions, receives rewards for those actions, and learns how to choose the best action based on these interactions. In this way, it can improve its performance over time as it explores more complex environments. The most common algorithm used in reinforcement learning is Q-learning, which approximates the state-action values function using a neural network model. However, there are several challenges when applying deep neural networks to large problems such as Atari games or Go. Therefore, many researchers have proposed alternative approaches, including policy gradient methods, actor-critic methods, and MCTS (Monte Carlo tree search). We will briefly discuss each method and their advantages and disadvantages compared with other algorithms. 

The MCTS (Monte Carlo tree search), also known asUCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees), is a popular algorithm used in artificial intelligence field for solving complex decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional methods like minimax or alphabeta pruning, MCTS does not rely on any heuristics or expert knowledge. Instead, it relies solely on simulation and exploration, making it computationally efficient even for complex problems. Each node in the game tree represents a possible move or action in the game. During simulations, we roll out each path randomly until the end of the game. Based on the outcome of each simulation, the algorithm backtracks and updates the probabilities of different moves at each node. This process continues recursively until the root node, where the final result of the game is determined. By averaging the probabilities of different paths at each node, the algorithm can converge towards the optimal strategy. One advantage of MCTS is that it can handle stochastic policies well, unlike the tabular case where one-step lookahead only works under deterministic policies. Another advantage is that it can efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces by dividing them into smaller subspaces. Finally, MCTS has been shown to perform better than all existing RL algorithms on various board games, video games, and real-world applications.

However, although MCTS is considered to be one of the most powerful techniques in AI, it still faces some limitations when applied to certain types of problems. For example, MCTS cannot directly optimize for continuous or multi-objective functions, nor can it apply to imbalanced scenarios where one kind of action may lead to better results compared to others. Additionally, MCTS may take longer to train due to its exploratory nature, especially if it needs to simulate multiple games per iteration. To address these issues, new variants of MCTS such as AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero have been developed, but they typically require significantly larger computational resources to achieve competitive results. Moreover, they often fail to provide clear insights into why the agents make decisions, which makes them less interpretable and harder to debug.

In summary, while MCTS is a powerful technique for solving complex decision-making problems, its applicability and effectiveness need further investigation to be fully utilized. There exist many variations and combinations of MCTS, both theoretical and empirical, that can help us understand its strengths and weaknesses and adapt it to solve various types of problems more effectively.

## 2.1 Game tree
Firstly, let's talk about the game tree, which is a visual representation of a game scenario. Suppose we want to play chess and create a game tree for the opening book, then the game tree would show all possible positions of the pieces on the board along with their valid moves and resulting positions. Here's an example:

```
       A
     B   C
   D E F G H
1 r K.... 
2 n..... 
3 n. P p p. 
...       ...
    a b c d e f g h
```

The above figure shows the position of the kings and pawns on the standard chessboard. The letters represent squares on the board, and numbers indicate ranks. A single dot represents an empty square. All possible moves for white (K and P) and black (k and p) are indicated by arrows pointing away from the piece. If a king or pawn is threatened, it is highlighted in red. The node colors indicate whether the current player has made a legal move.

Game trees are represented as a series of nodes connected by edges. Each edge indicates a move performed during the game, and connects two nodes representing the initial and terminal states of the game. Each node contains information such as the total number of visits, average reward, and expected value.

## 2.2 UCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees) Algorithm
Next, let's talk about the core concept behind MCTS called Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT). This algorithm was introduced in 1979 by George Sutton and named after his colleague J.C. Roth in his paper "A Survey of Monte Carlo Tree Search Methods". The goal of UCT is to find the next best action given the current state of the game. It uses random selection to explore new paths, and explores areas with higher uncertainty using the formula $Q + \sqrt{\frac{2\log N(s)}n}$, where $N$ is the total number of times visited from state s, $n$ is the total number of visits of the parent node, and $\log N(s)$ is the logarithm base $e$ of the sum of the squared values of children visits.

As the name suggests, the confidence bound (the part inside the sqrt sign) controls the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. As $n$ increases, the exploration term becomes small, while as $N$ increases, the exploitation term becomes significant. Thus, the algorithm balances the exploration and exploitation process to ensure convergence to the maximum likelihood solution. 

Once the algorithm finds the best action, it selects one randomly from among the available actions based on the probability distribution computed by the algorithm. Finally, it performs the selected action and updates the statistics accordingly before repeating the process. Since the algorithm traverses the entire game tree in the worst case, it takes exponential time to compute the correct output. Therefore, MCTS requires careful optimization and parallelization to enable it to scale up to large games.

Overall, UCT provides a framework for searching in decision trees and tackles the exploration vs exploitation issue in MDPs. The key insight is to balance the exploration and exploitation process to avoid getting stuck in local maxima, leading to poor overall performance.
