# 1.背景介绍


As businesses and organizations continue to scale their operations and develop complex software systems that need to handle large volumes of data within short periods of time, they are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with the increased demand for reliable and efficient services. The rise in cloud computing has made the development and management of distributed applications easier than ever before, but at the same time comes a new set of challenges related to messaging queues and serverless computing.

In this article we will explore how to build complex systems using messaging queues and serverless computing on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We will also discuss best practices for designing robust and scalable solutions and how AWS tools can help you meet these goals. 

This is an intermediate-level level topic suitable for developers who have some experience building enterprise-grade web applications and/or APIs. 

# 2.核心概念与联系
1. Messaging Queues: A messaging queue or message broker allows different components of a system to exchange messages asynchronously through a message queuing service. These messages are stored in a queue until a consumer retrieves them from the queue and processes them. 

2. Serverless Compute: Serverless computing refers to the practice of running application logic without provisioning or managing servers explicitly. Instead, the platform automatically allocates and scales resources as needed based on workload. This approach offers significant cost savings, making it ideal for processing high volumes of workloads where capacity planning and maintenance overhead becomes overwhelming. In this context, serverless compute platforms like AWS Lambda provide a flexible way to run small bits of code without worrying about infrastructure management.

3. Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS): SQS is a managed messaging service provided by AWS that supports FIFO and standard queues. Standard queues support delivery guarantees while FIFO queues guarantee exactly once processing. It provides both a RESTful API and client libraries available for multiple programming languages to integrate into your applications.

We can use SQS to implement a publish/subscribe pattern between different parts of our application that need to communicate asynchronously. For example, we might use SQS to notify subscribers when certain events occur, such as order fulfillment updates or stock prices changing.

4. Amazon Elastic Transcoder: Elastic Transcoder is a media transcoding service provided by AWS that can convert audio and video files into formats required by various devices, websites, and mobile apps. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and cost-effective, enabling users to quickly and easily transform their digital content into a variety of formats that can be viewed on a wide range of devices.

5. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams: Kinesis Data Streams is a fully managed real-time data streaming service offered by AWS that can ingest large amounts of data records in real-time. Unlike traditional data streams that require strict ordering of data events, Kinesis Data Streams provides unbounded, high throughput ingestion of data records at very low latency. Applications can use Kinesis Data Streams to process real-time analytics, continuously analyze social media feeds, or deliver real-time gaming events.

Kinesis Data Streams integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, including AWS Lambda functions, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon Kinesis Analytics applications, to create powerful data pipelines that transform and route data in real-time.

6. AWS Step Functions: AWS Step Functions is a serverless workflow service provided by AWS that makes it easy to coordinate distributed tasks across multiple services. With Step Functions, you can define a series of steps that describe a business process, and AWS Step Function manages the execution of each step, ensuring consistency and reliability throughout the entire process.

Using Step Functions, you can automate the orchestration of messaging activities, data processing workflows, and human decision-making tasks, all within the same state machine definition. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, reusable pieces, you can reduce overall complexity and ensure consistent behavior.

1. Architecture Overview

The following diagram outlines how messaging queues and serverless compute can be used together to build highly scalable and resilient complex systems:


2. Publish-Subscribe Patterns

Publish-subscribe patterns enable one component of an application to send a message to many interested parties without requiring those recipients to actively participate in the communication. This ensures loose coupling among components, which simplifies implementation and increases flexibility.

To achieve asynchronous communication via messaging queues, an application needs to first register itself as a publisher with the messaging queue, then start publishing messages to the queue whenever there is something interesting to share. When a subscriber wants to receive messages from the queue, it needs to subscribe to the relevant topic(s) and pull any pending messages off the queue.

For example, consider an e-commerce website that wants to offer instant notifications to customers when orders are shipped. To do so, the website could publish a message indicating that an order has been shipped using SNS, and subscribers could then listen for these messages using SQS. Other components of the website may wish to know when new products become available, so they could broadcast a notification to subscribed customers using another topic in SNS and configure SQS to poll this topic for incoming messages every few seconds.

3. Batch Processing

Batch processing involves sending a group of messages to be processed simultaneously by a batch worker function, rather than waiting for individual requests. This can greatly improve performance, especially for tasks that involve expensive I/O operations. On AWS, serverless compute platforms like AWS Lambda make it simple to deploy batch workers that can consume messages from an SQS queue and perform the necessary computation.

Once a batch worker finishes processing a batch of messages, it can return control back to the original requester and move on to process the next batch if necessary. If there are no more messages left in the queue, the batch worker can exit gracefully.

# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

Code samples:

1. Implementing a Message Broker Using SQS:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('sqs')

queue_url = 'https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<account id>/<queue name>'

response = client.send_message(
    QueueUrl=queue_url,
    DelaySeconds=10,
    MessageBody='Hello World!'
)

print(response['MessageId'])
```

2. Consuming Messages From an SQS Queue and Performing Transcoding:

```python
import json
import base64
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    
    sqs = boto3.resource('sqs')
    queue = sqs.get_queue_by_name(QueueName='<queue name>')

    for record in event['Records']:
        
        # Decode the binary message body
        message = base64.b64decode(record['body'])
        
        # Extract the source bucket and key from the message attributes
        attrs = record['attributes']
        src_bucket = attrs['SourceBucket']
        src_key = attrs['SourceKey']

        print("Received message:", message)
        
        # Convert the image file format using Elastic Transcoder
        transcoder = boto3.client('elastictranscoder')
        result = transcoder.create_job(
            PipelineId='<pipeline id>',
            Input={
                'Key': src_key,
                'FrameRate': 'auto',
                'Resolution': 'auto',
                'AspectRatio': 'auto',
                'Interlaced': 'auto',
                'Container': 'auto'
            },
            Outputs=[{
                'Key': '<output path>/',
                'ThumbnailPattern': '',
                'Rotate': 'auto',
                'PresetId': '1351620000001-200010',
                'SegmentDuration': '10.0'
            }]
        )

        job_id = result['Job']['Id']
        
        # Wait for the Elastic Transcoder job to complete
        waiter = transcoder.get_waiter('job_completed')
        waiter.config.delay = 10   # Check status every 10 seconds
        waiter.config.max_attempts = 10*60 // 10  # Timeout after 10 minutes
        waiter.wait(Id=job_id)
        
        # Delete the original object from the source bucket
        s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
        obj = s3.Object(src_bucket, src_key)
        obj.delete()
        
```

3. Orchestrating Multiple Workflows Using Step Functions:

```json
{
  "Comment": "Workflow Sample",
  "StartAt": "StepA",
  "States": {
    "StepA": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "<lambda ARN>",
      "Next": "ChoiceB"
    },
    "StepB": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "<lambda ARN>",
      "End": true
    }
  },
  "Version": "1.0"
}
```
