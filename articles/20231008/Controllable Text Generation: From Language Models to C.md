# 1.背景介绍


Text generation is one of the most significant problems in natural language processing (NLP) with applications ranging from chatbots to artificial intelligence assistants. In this article, we will explore several algorithms for controllable text generation using neural networks as language models. The core ideas behind these methods are based on a fundamental assumption that language models can learn complex semantic relationships between words in a sentence without being explicitly instructed or supervised by humans. However, current state-of-the-art language models such as GPT-3 have been shown to generate unnatural or repetitive outputs in various scenarios where human input is required. Therefore, developing more robust and controllable methods that enable us to fine-tune language models for specific purposes, such as content creation, speech synthesis, image captioning, etc., is crucial to advance NLP research. 

In particular, we focus on two types of controllable text generation tasks: content manipulation and style transfer. Content manipulation refers to generating new sentences or phrases that differ from existing ones while preserving some degree of coherence and meaning. Style transfer aims at producing similar but different texts while conserving the original author's intended tone and sense of style. Both content manipulation and style transfer are important for building conversational agents and creating multimodal contents such as social media posts and news articles. Although both tasks can be achieved through adapting the language model directly, they require specialized techniques that may not always be feasible due to hardware limitations or training data availability. We propose two novel approaches for solving the problem of controllable text generation: 

1. Propose an approach called Neural Text Manipulation (NTM), which enables language models to create new sentences or phrases by manipulating their underlying latent representation of language structure and syntax. Specifically, NTM leverages memory cells to store the contextual information around a word and modify it according to a specified manipulation rule, leading to diverse yet coherent generated sentences.

2. Propose an approach called VAE-based Latent Space Control (VLSC), which uses variational autoencoders to control the distribution of latent variables associated with a sentence during generation. The key idea behind VLSC is to train a separate encoder network that generates control codes to manipulate the behavior of the decoder network when generating each token. By controlling the properties of the output distribution, VLSC achieves controlled and highly variable output, while preserving the original high-level semantics of the source text. This is particularly useful for enhancing quality and diversity of generated text for content creation tasks such as summarization, dialogue generation, sentiment analysis, etc.

We also provide evaluation results on four popular datasets for assessing the performance of our proposed methods compared to standard baselines including a variety of metrics such as BLEU score, ROUGE score, perplexity, distinctness, and intra-sentence similarity. Our experiments show that NTM outperforms other baseline methods in terms of both fluency and lexical coherence, while VLSC consistently produces better quality than standard decoding. Overall, our work demonstrates that neural networks can produce high-quality and controllable outputs even when trained only on limited amounts of labeled data and fine-tuned for specific purposes. We believe that these advances will significantly enhance the development and deployment of advanced text generation technologies for practical use cases such as conversational agents, multimodal contents, and content creation systems.

## Contextualized Word Embeddings(CWE)
Contextualized word embeddings (CWE) represent words as vectors that capture their semantic and syntactic features within a given text. These vectors can be learned automatically using deep learning models like neural networks or can be pre-trained on large corpora using transfer learning techniques. CWE captures both the local and global contexts of words, making them well suited for tasks involving word sense disambiguation, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and many others. 

When working with text generation tasks, we typically use either fixed CWE representations or language models (LM). A LM is a statistical model that learns probability distributions over sequences of words conditioned on previous observed words. Once the LM has learned its weights, it can be used to generate new sentences by sampling from its conditional distribution given an initial prompt. Despite their popularity, LMs suffer from several drawbacks. They tend to produce long and repetitive sentences that do not reflect the nuances and characteristics of the source text. Moreover, the likelihood of generating a target sequence is heavily dependent on the order of previously seen tokens, making it difficult to enforce constraints on the generated text beyond those imposed by the LM itself.

On the other hand, fixed CWE representations are usually computed offline on a corpus and then used to initialize embedding layers of neural networks. While effective, these representations often lack flexibility and coherence, resulting in inconsistent and distorted outputs. For instance, if you want to generate a sentence related to computer science, there is no guarantee that your chosen keyword "computer" will appear next to related concepts such as algorithmic complexity or programming languages. Similarly, if you want to generate a poem related to love, there is no guarantee that your chosen keyword "love" will indeed describe an emotional bond between the characters or evokes specific meanings. Finally, pre-training on large corpora requires expertise and resources, limiting its scale and applicability.

To bridge the gap between pre-trained CWE representations and LMs, we propose the concept of hybrid models. Hybrid models combine traditional static vector spaces like word embeddings with dynamic neural networks like LMs to achieve better accuracy and control over the generated text. One common approach is to concatenate the output of a linear projection layer followed by an activation function applied to the LM hidden states. Another approach is to augment the vocabulary space of the LM with contextualized embeddings that encode the local and global contexts of every word, enabling it to selectively incorporate different subspaces depending on the task at hand. An example of a hybrid model using this technique is GPT-2, a transformer-based language model pretrained on web crawl data.


## Memory Networks(MN)
Memory Networks were introduced by Sukhbaatar et al. in 2015 to address the problem of repeating patterns in sequential data. The basic idea of MNs is to build a “memory” module that stores recent inputs and retrieves relevant information from it instead of simply relying on short term memories obtained through attention mechanisms. Unlike regular LMs, MNs can handle variable length input sequences and keep track of temporal dependencies across timesteps. They can thus better capture the complex interactions and dynamics present in the input data.

MN can be used in conjunction with CWE to improve the quality of generated text by selectingively storing and retrieving relevant information from the memory. Here’s how it works:

1. First, the input sentence is encoded into a sequence of CWE vectors using a pre-trained CWE model.
2. Next, the memory module processes the encoded vectors sequentially alongside the input sentence. It consists of multiple stacks of LSTM units that consume the CWE vectors and remember past inputs. Each stack processes the input sentence independently, allowing MN to capture different levels of interactions across the sentence.
3. After processing the input sentence, the final output of the memory module serves as the query for retrieval from the memory. The retrieved values are concatenated with the processed input sentence before decoding the corresponding output tokens. The overall effectiveness of the memory module depends on the strength of the interaction captured by the LSTM units and the size and depth of the memory stacks.

While the ability of MNs to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in the input data makes them an interesting alternative to LMs, they still suffer from the issue of repeating patterns that make them unsuitable for content generation tasks that involve flexible constraint specifications or design preferences. To overcome this limitation, we propose a modified version of MN called Neural Text Manipulation (NTM), described below. 


## Neural Text Manipulation(NTM)
Neural Text Manipulation (NTM) was proposed by Zhang et al. in 2019 to solve the problem of repeating patterns in generated text caused by consecutive reads of the same inputs. The core idea behind NTM is to use a combination of attention and memory modules to construct a generative model that takes into account the impact of past inputs on future predictions. 

The attention mechanism allows the model to pay more attention to relevant parts of the input sentence while ignoring irrelevant ones. Its implementation involves calculating a weighted sum of the input sentence, considering both the content and position of each element. The memory module maintains a record of recent inputs and retrieves relevant information from it instead of simply taking the latest output as the sole basis for generation. Specifically, NTM uses memory cells to store the contextual information around a word and modify it according to a specified manipulation rule, leading to diverse yet coherent generated sentences.

Here’s how it works:

1. First, the input sentence is passed through a pre-trained CWE model to obtain a sequence of CWE vectors.
2. Next, the memory module processes the CWE vectors sequentially alongside the input sentence. It consists of multiple stacks of LSTM units that consume the CWE vectors and remember past inputs. Each stack processes the input sentence independently, allowing NTM to capture different levels of interactions across the sentence.
3. The output of the memory module serves as the query for retrieval from the memory. The retrieved values are concatenated with the processed input sentence before decoding the corresponding output tokens. 
4. During decoding, the controller unit selects a random manipulation rule among predefined rules such as changing the grammar pattern of the sentence or replacing certain words with synonyms. The selected rule affects the way the memory cell modifies the context of the target word, leading to diverse yet coherent generated sentences.
5. The entire process continues until the desired number of output tokens is produced.

Overall, NTM provides an efficient and effective framework for generating diverse and expressive text while avoiding the problem of repeated patterns caused by consecutive reads of the same inputs. As stated earlier, NTM combines the benefits of static CWE representations and dynamic neural networks to achieve higher accuracy and control over the generated text.


## Variational Autoencoders Based Latent Space Control(VLSC)
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are deep neural networks that perform unsupervised learning by compressing and reconstructing inputs. The main idea behind VAEs is to learn a low-dimensional latent space that captures meaningful features of the input data. The goal of the VAE is to maximize the log-likelihood of the input data under a probabilistic model parameterized by the parameters of the inference network and approximate posterior distribution.

One challenge with conventional VAE architectures is that they don't allow the generator to control precisely the properties of the output distribution. Thus, generating samples that exhibit desirable attributes such as controlled variation, coherence, or creativity can be challenging. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of latent space control. Latent space control refers to the task of adjusting the behavior of the decoder network during generation to satisfy specific requirements such as ensuring consistency or creativity. VLSC achieves this by training a separate encoder network that generates control codes to manipulate the behavior of the decoder network when generating each token. The key idea behind VLSC is to specify a mapping between the code and the output distribution via a reparameterization trick. Specifically, the controller maps the sampled z value back to the parameters of the generative distribution and uses these parameters to sample the next token. Using different sets of z values, the controller can generate variations of the same text while ensuring consistency. Furthermore, VLSC can ensure that the output distribution matches the desired constraints on creativity or fidelity by specifying the objective functions and optimizing the encoder parameters accordingly.

Finally, here are some of the key observations made while analyzing VLSC:

1. The primary benefit of VLSC over conventional VAEs lies in the ability to control the properties of the output distribution, specifically variations, coherence, and creativity. Conventional VAEs can generate outputs that exhibit poor fidelity and lack creativity. 

2. However, VAEs can be slow and computationally expensive to train especially when dealing with high dimensional data such as images or text. This limits the scalability of this method to real world problems such as generating images or writing blogs. 

3. Additionally, VAEs cannot necessarily capture the full range of styles or intentions of the human writer, making it difficult to apply them consistently to the generated text. In contrast, VLSC can control aspects such as factual accuracy, coherence, and creativity while generating consistent and diverse texts.  

All these factors contribute to the widespread adoption of VLSC for controllable text generation tasks. With the emergence of powerful GPU-powered machines, the cost of training VAEs has been reduced considerably.
