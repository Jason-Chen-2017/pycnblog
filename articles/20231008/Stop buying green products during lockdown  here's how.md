# 1.背景介绍


Lately, there has been a lot of noise about the continued growth and rollout of COVID-19-related technologies that are promoting social distancing measures. One such technology is wearing masks to prevent the spread of the virus. However, it may be easy for people to forget this crucial aspect of social distancing when they buy essential groceries or medical supplies. As many as half (44%) of UK adults have already bought at least one green product during lockdown in March and April alone, according to the latest data released by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). 

It’s important to note that the use of these products does not necessarily mean that one is “green” per se but rather whether the items themselves contain chemicals known to cause infectious diseases if ingested. The Defra data also reveals that on average, consumers spend around £65 on green products per week – an increase of over three times compared to pre-lockdown levels of only £15. This could be due to increased purchasing willingness among individuals who previously didn't care much about mask-wearing.

However, despite all the interest in personal hygiene products being used to protect against the spread of the virus, research shows that individual behavior plays a key role in determining their risk profile. A recent study found that healthy behaviors can lead to reduced likelihood of contracting the virus, which means that following healthy routines should not negatively impact our wellbeing. Therefore, while it would be prudent to continue practicing good health habits during lockdown, particularly those related to wearing a face covering and avoiding smoking, it remains worthwhile exploring ways to encourage less conscientious individuals to adopt appropriate safety practices. 

One possible way could involve identifying less conscientious individuals who are likely to shop for green products during lockdown based on demographics and shopping behaviour patterns, and then reminding them that doing so could put them at risk of contracting the virus and encouraging them to follow safety measures like using disposable gloves and sanitising frequently touched surfaces after use. Overall, reducing the proliferation of green products will help keep the number of deaths caused by the novel coronavirus low, and hopefully contribute to achieving the goal of reversing the damage caused by previous lockdown measures.

## Likelihood of contracting the virus
In order to measure the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, we need to understand what constitutes a high risk event. We can break down the risk into different factors including age, underlying health conditions, exposure history and symptoms. However, since it is currently unknown exactly why some individuals show higher levels of illness than others, it’s difficult to provide exact guidelines for diagnosing COVID-19 cases without more information. Nonetheless, various studies suggest that individuals with underlying mental or physical conditions, such as depression or obesity, tend to have higher rates of developing severe symptoms, which suggests that these patients could present at higher risk of getting seriously ill from the disease.

Another factor that contributes to higher mortality rates is loneliness and isolation. While social distancing helps limit the spread of COVID-19, it also increases the chances of becoming isolated and feeling lonely, making it harder to seek medical attention. People living alone can experience diminished sense of self-esteem leading to lower motivation to exercise or maintain normal activities. Additionally, economic hardship and job losses are associated with higher rates of loneliness and isolation, further exacerbating the situation.

Overall, the likelihood of contracting the novel coronavirus can vary greatly depending on several factors such as demographic characteristics, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, mental health, etc., making it difficult to provide definite guidance. Nevertheless, understanding the factors that influence the risk profile of each person can provide valuable insights into developing targeted interventions to minimize risks and enhance outcomes.
