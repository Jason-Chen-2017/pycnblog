# 1.背景介绍


Deep learning is a powerful technique that has revolutionized many fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, deep neural networks often suffer from overfitting or underfitting problems due to high complexity in training data. The dropout technique is an effective way to reduce these problems by randomly dropping out some neurons during training, which forces the network to learn more robust features instead of relying on single neurons. 

In this article, we will explore how dropout works by applying it to three popular types of neural networks: fully connected (FC) networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We will then discuss why dropout improves the performance of deep learning models, its advantages, limitations, and potential applications in real-world scenarios. Finally, we will use Python code examples to illustrate the concept of dropout.

Dropout is a regularization method used in machine learning that helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out units during training. The core idea behind dropout is to train a large number of independent models on different subsets of the training set and average their predictions to obtain better generalization performance than could be achieved from a single model. Specifically, at each training step, each unit (neuron or connection) of the layer being trained is either kept active with probability p or dropped out with probability 1−p, where p is typically set between 0.5 and 0.8. This means that only a small fraction of the network’s neurons are actually updated during each iteration, leading to substantial reduction in the size of the weight matrices while still retaining enough representational power to capture complex relationships within the dataset. Additionally, dropout can improve the stability of the model by reducing the dependence on any one feature, ensuring that adjacent nodes do not rely solely on one another for accurate predictions. Together, these factors make dropout a powerful tool for improving the generalizability and interpretability of deep learning models.

There are several variations of dropout available depending on the type of network being applied. For instance, FC networks have simpler structure and fewer parameters compared to CNNs and RNNs, making them easier to experiment with and debug. Here, we will focus on explaining dropout techniques for FC, CNN, and RNN architectures.

Fully Connected Networks (FCN): In traditional feedforward neural networks (such as FCNs), the input samples are processed through multiple layers of interconnected nodes (or "neurons") to produce outputs. Each node takes the weighted sum of all inputs received from other nodes, passed through a non-linear activation function (e.g., ReLU), and optionally followed by a bias term. All neurons are fully connected to every other neuron in the previous layer, resulting in a densely connected graph of nodes. During training, dropout drops out individual connections between nodes, effectively breaking up the dependency amongst the remaining nodes, allowing the network to learn more robust features that can handle variations in the training set without overfitting.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification. They consist of alternating convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers, similar to FCNs but with additional operations such as max-pooling and zero-padding to increase local receptive field sizes and control overfitting. While conventional approaches may perform well when datasets are relatively small or have simple geometric shapes, CNNs show promise in larger and more complex datasets because they exploit the spatial nature of images to extract features at different scales and locations. 

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and gated recurrent units (GRUs) are two types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) widely used for sequence modeling tasks such as natural language processing and speech recognition. These networks process sequences of data by maintaining an internal state that depends on previously seen elements in the sequence. At each time step, the network receives an input vector and produces an output vector based on both the current state and the input. During training, dropout masks some of the hidden states at each time step, forcing the network to avoid relying on specific features learned earlier in the sequence, thereby enabling the network to learn more robust representations of the underlying data.

## Dropout for Fully Connected Networks
For FCNs, the dropout mechanism involves randomly dropping out individual connections between nodes during training. Let's consider a particular example using a 2-layer fully connected network:


Assume that the input $x$ to the first layer has dimensions $(D_1, N)$, where $D_1$ denotes the dimensionality of each sample and $N$ denotes the total number of input neurons. Similarly, assume that the output $y$ from the last layer also has dimensions $(D_L, M)$, where $D_L$ represents the dimensionality of the target variable(s) and $M$ represents the total number of output neurons. Note that the intermediate layers have the same dimensions throughout our discussion below.

During training, we compute the forward pass of the network using the following equations:

$$z^1 = W^1 x + b^1 \\ 
a^1 = \sigma\left(\frac{z^1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)\\
z^2 = W^2 a^1 + b^2\\
a^2 = \sigma\left(\frac{z^2}{\sqrt{M}}\right) $$

where $\sigma$ refers to the activation function (e.g., sigmoid or tanh). Now let's apply dropout to the weights of the second layer before computing the forward pass:


The key observation here is that we should drop out connections between consecutive nodes rather than individual nodes themselves. This ensures that we retain dependencies between pairs of nodes, which is crucial for capturing the complexity of the relationship between the input and output variables. Moreover, since we want to randomly selectively drop out connections during training, we need to maintain separate sets of mask vectors for each pair of neurons that connects them, so that the same dropout rate applies to all pairs. That is, given a weight matrix $W$, we would create two sets of binary mask vectors $M_{ij}$ and $M_{kl}$, where $j$ and $k$ index different rows of $W$.

Now we modify the computation of $z^2$ to include the application of the dropout mask to each element of $W$:

$$z^2 = M_{ij}W^{2}_{ij} a^1 + M_{kl}W^{2}_{kl} a^1 + b^2\\ 
a^2 = \sigma\left(\frac{z^2}{\sqrt{M}}\right)$$

where the $M$ terms indicate whether the corresponding entries in $W$ should be included (i.e., retained) in the forward pass or discarded. Given the binary mask vectors, the probabilities $p$ of keeping a connection across iterations are simply the mean values of those mask vectors. Intuitively, if we keep most of the connections across epochs, the network should be able to learn more robust features that are less dependent on any single neuron. On the other hand, if we severely prune off some connections, the network might become too specialized and difficult to adapt to new patterns. Therefore, we can tune the dropout rate to achieve the desired balance between convergence and specialization.

Note that even though the dropout rates in the above formulas are the mean value of the dropout masks, this does not necessarily ensure that every neuron has been completely eliminated from the network, particularly when the dropout rate is close to 1. Instead, it is common practice to further scale down the weights of pruned neurons by multiplying them by a factor $\alpha$ called the complementary dropout rate:

$$\hat{W}_i' = (\frac{\lambda}{1-\rho})M_iw_i \quad i=1,\ldots,n$$

where $\rho$ is the dropout rate, $\lambda$ is the scaling parameter, and $M_i$ is the binary mask vector for the $i$-th row of $W$. When $\rho$ goes to 1, we get the original weights back, whereas as $\rho$ decreases, we start to see effects of competing neurons (specifically, ones that share weights with pruned neurons). Thus, we can adjust the strength of the competition between surviving neurons by tuning the complementary dropout rate $\lambda$. Overall, dropout allows us to trade off variance and bias to construct more robust and flexible models that can cope with uncertainty in the training data.

## Dropout for Convolutional Neural Networks
For CNNs, dropout is used after each convolutional layer and immediately before each nonlinearity. During training, we randomly drop out certain filters (corresponding to individual neurons in an individual layer) using a hyperparameter $\theta$, which determines the proportion of neurons to be dropped. A typical choice is $\theta=\frac{m}{K}$, where $m$ is the smallest allowable filter size and $K$ is the total number of filters. Specifically, at each training step, we sample a subset of $K$ filters from the entire set, and remove the corresponding activations using the dropout mask $M$. Then, we apply the masked weights $M w$ to the remaining filters to update their weights, giving rise to the following modified formula:

$$Z^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\frac{(M w^{(l)})X^{(l)}}{\sqrt{K}}\right)$$

Here, $w^{(l)}$ and $b^{(l)}$ refer to the weights and biases of the linear transformation performed on the output of the $l$-th convolutional layer, respectively. We follow the same approach as in the case of FCNs to generate the dropout mask. After generating the mask, we multiply it with the filtered input tensor $X^{(l)}$ to obtain the activated output tensor $A^{(l+1)}$. By repeating this procedure for each convolutional layer and subsequent linear layer, we build up an abstract representation of the problem space defined by the input tensors.

One advantage of dropout in CNNs is that it provides a unified strategy for incorporating structured heterogeneous data into the model architecture itself, obviating the need for manual feature engineering. Another benefit is that it prevents overfitting by encouraging diverse representations to emerge from the training set. Despite its simplicity, dropout remains effective in achieving good performance on various tasks, especially in high dimensional spaces like images.

## Dropout for Recurrent Neural Networks
For RNNs, dropout can be implemented differently depending on the type of RNN cell being used. LSTM cells typically employ dropout on the forget gate and output gate separately, while GRU cells place the dropout on the input, reset, and output gates simultaneously. Specifically, for each layer of the RNN, we define a dropout mask $M$, whose values are sampled from Bernoulli distributions with probability $p$ at each timestep. Next, we multiply the input tensor $H_{t}^{(l)}$ by the dropout mask $M$ to obtain the processed tensor $H_{t}^{(l)*}$. During inference, we don't apply the dropout operation at test time. This method introduces stochasticity into the model, which is useful for dealing with uncertain inputs at test time. It also helps stabilize the training process by preventing the contribution of any single element in the sequence to significantly impact subsequent updates.
