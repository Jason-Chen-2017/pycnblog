# 1.背景介绍


Structured programming is a coding methodology in which the program is structured into statements and blocks that define logical structure. It allows for more modular and reusable code, making it easier to maintain and modify programs as they grow larger and more complex.

Imperative programming languages are those based on instructions that change the state of data or the flow of control (e.g., if-else statements). They typically have powerful features like loops, conditional branching, and data structures such as arrays and lists, but can be less flexible than structured programming due to their rigid syntax rules. 

However, there are advantages to structured programming over imperative programming language because of its modularity and flexibility:

1. Better Modularity - Structured programming encourages greater modularity by separating functionality into smaller units that interact with each other through well defined interfaces. This makes it easier to reuse components within your program or even separate them into different modules or libraries that you can reuse in future projects. 

2. Easier Maintenance - Because structural elements are separated from implementation details, changes made to one part of the program do not affect the rest of the code. As a result, maintenance is much simpler since only the parts that need to be modified will require attention. Additionally, this approach reduces the risk of introducing bugs that could cause issues during execution. 

3. Improved Scalability - Structured programming offers better scalability compared to imperative programming languages when dealing with large or complex systems. With the use of functions, subroutines, and modules, the complexity of the system can be broken down into manageable pieces that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently without impacting the rest of the codebase. 

4. Flexibility and Performance - The increased modularity and flexibility provided by structured programming make it ideal for applications where reliability and performance are critical. Applications that rely heavily on processing power or network bandwidth may benefit from using a structured programming model. For example, games, high-performance computing, and real-time systems often involve intensive computations or network communication that require efficient and reliable programming models. 

In summary, structured programming provides many benefits that make it an attractive alternative to traditional imperative programming languages, including better modularity, ease of maintenance, improved scalability, and flexibility and performance. In conclusion, although both approaches work well for certain types of software development, structured programming has become increasingly popular among developers due to its enhanced modularity, simplified maintenance, scalability, and flexibility. Therefore, it is essential for any developer to understand how the two methods differ and choose the best option depending on the specific needs of the project. 

This article provides a brief overview of why structured programming is beneficial and what advantages it brings to modern software development. By breaking down the concept and comparing it with traditional imperative programming techniques, we hope to provide additional insight and practical guidance for anyone seeking to improve their programming skills while working with complex software systems.
2.核心概念与联系
Structured programming 是一种代码结构化方法论,通过将程序分割成语句块的方式进行编码。它使得程序更加模块化、可重用性强、易于维护与修改。其核心思想是通过对程序的逻辑结构进行定义和分组,从而简化程序的编写。如此一来,开发人员就可以更容易地对程序进行扩展或重用,使得软件项目具有更好的可读性和可维护性。

相对于命令式编程语言(即命令式编程语言所采用的命令式的方法)而言,命令式编程方法更倾向于一步步地执行指令,并直接操作数据或控制流。这些命令式的编程语言通常拥有功能强大的循环、条件判断等特性,但也因此可能缺乏灵活性。另一方面,结构化编程则是基于模块化及模块化编程原理,提出了一套新的方法论,使程序员能够高效地编写出结构清晰的代码,同时又能方便地维护与改动。

可以看到,结构化编程与命令式编程之间存在一些不同之处。命令式编程关心的是数据的变化和控制流,并直接操纵它们,但这种方式过于低级而难以理解。而结构化编程则注重程序的逻辑结构和模块化的设计,其主要特点是通过语句块的方式划分程序的结构,从而使程序更加容易阅读和维护。

以下是结构化编程的一些基本原理与术语:

- Block: 在结构化编程中,一个块就是一段代码构成的一个独立单元。每个块都有一个入口和一个出口。在进入块之前,所有的变量状态都是一致的,退出块之后,所有的变量状态也是一致的。
- Procedure: 过程是一个类似函数的结构,它由一个或多个语句块构成,用来实现特定功能。可以在任意地方调用,也可以作为参数传入另一个块当作子程序使用。
- Module: 模块是一个封装了相关代码的集合,可以被其他模块引用。模块内部的数据和代码只能被本模块内的代码访问。模块通常提供一系列功能,使得代码组织更加清晰。
- Data abstraction: 数据抽象是指隐藏内部实现细节的过程。通过封装数据和行为,客户端不必了解内部的处理过程,只需关注功能需求即可。
- Input/Output: I/O是指输入输出相关的功能。结构化编程语言一般都提供了标准的I/O接口,使得开发人员不用重复造轮子。

由于本文涉及的内容比较复杂,这里将给出算法的一些概括,方便读者理解文章中的具体操作。

4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明
Here's an example Python function that sorts a list of integers using selection sort algorithm:

```python
def selection_sort(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if nums[j] < nums[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        # Swap the minimum element with current element
        nums[i], nums[min_idx] = nums[min_idx], nums[i]
```

The above `selection_sort` function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list. We start by initializing a variable `n` to store the length of the input list. Then, we loop through each integer in the list using a for loop and keep track of the index of the smallest remaining unsorted integer using another nested for loop (`for j in range(i+1, n)`). If we find an integer that is smaller than our current minimum, then we update `min_idx` to point to that integer. Finally, we swap the minimum element with the current element using tuple unpacking `(nums[i], nums[min_idx])`. This process repeats until all elements have been sorted.

To test the function, we can create a sample input list and call the `selection_sort()` function:

```python
>>> nums = [9, 7, 5, 3, 1]
>>> selection_sort(nums)
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

As expected, the output list contains the same numbers in ascending order after being passed through the selection sort algorithm. However, here are some additional notes about the algorithm:

1. Time Complexity Analysis: The time complexity of selection sort depends on the number of swaps needed to put the smallest element in its correct position. The worst case scenario requires n^2 comparisons and n swaps. On average, however, selection sort performs better than O(nlogn) sorting algorithms, especially when the array is partially sorted. However, selection sort does perform slightly worse than bubble sort and insertion sort in terms of speed. Overall, selection sort remains a decent choice for small to medium size inputs. 
2. Space Complexity Analysis: Selection sort uses constant amount of extra space proportional to the input size (in addition to the original input list), so it satisfies the space complexity requirement.
