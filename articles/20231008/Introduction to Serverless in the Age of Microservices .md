# 1.背景介绍


Serverless computing has been gaining traction since it was first introduced as a way to scale up cloud applications without managing infrastructure and service provisioning manually. The rise of microservices architectures coupled with serverless technologies has revolutionized how developers can build scalable cloud-native applications while reducing operational costs. However, for those who are not familiar with this new technology or its application, understanding their advantages and limitations may prove challenging at times. In order to help address these challenges and make the transition into serverless more accessible to all, we have written an introduction to serverless that is divided into two parts: this article covers the basics of what serverless is and why it’s different from traditional cloud architecture. We will also provide insights on when to use serverless solutions based on various criteria such as ease of management, cost optimization, fault tolerance, and developer productivity. 

In this part, we will cover the following topics:

1) What Is Serverless Computing?
2) Benefits Of Using Serverless Architecture Over Traditional Cloud Infrastructure Management Approaches
3) When To Use Serverless Architectures For Building Applications
4) How Does It Work With Microservices And Other Types Of Application Architecture Patterns?
5) Challenges Of Developing Serverless Applications
6) How Can You Get Started With Serverless Development Today?
7) Summary And Conclusion

## What Is Serverless Computing?
Serverless computing refers to a cloud computing model where cloud providers offer a platform that automatically manages the allocation and scaling of resources as needed by the code being executed. This means that developers no longer need to worry about sizing servers, maintaining them over time, and dealing with any underlying infrastructure issues. Instead, they just focus on writing code that runs as-needed without having to manage anything other than their function logic. The exact nature of the execution environment is determined by the provider's runtime environment. Some popular serverless platforms include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions (GCF). Additionally, many serverless providers support custom runtime environments like Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc., which allow developers to run functions written using the respective programming languages. 

In summary, serverless computing offers developers the ability to write highly scalable and high-performance apps without having to deal with low-level infrastructure details. Developers can simply deploy their code and let the cloud provider handle the rest—saving both time and money. But there are some considerations to keep in mind before adopting serverless approaches, including security, performance, and economics. 

## Why Should I Use Serverless Architecture?
To understand why developers should choose serverless computing instead of traditional cloud infrastructure management approaches, let’s break down the main benefits of serverless architecture over traditional cloud deployment models. 

1) Flexibility & Cost Optimization
Serverless computing allows developers to easily scale up and down as demand dictates by adjusting the amount of resources allocated to each individual function instance or container depending on the chosen platform. This frees up resources for processing data, enabling organizations to optimize costs and ensure peak performance under varying loads. Moreover, serverless services typically offer pay-per-use pricing structures that encourage developers to only use the necessary resources when needed. 

2) Better Resource Utilization
Developers do not have to worry about managing servers or clusters of virtual machines. As a result, less resources are required overall, leading to better utilization of available capacity. Furthermore, serverless platforms often automate hardware provisioning, software patching, and system maintenance tasks, further improving efficiency and resilience of systems. 

3) Improved Developer Productivity
The development process becomes simpler and faster because there is no need to provision or maintain servers or configure infrastructure. All the configuration and setup can be automated via tools provided by the serverless platform, making it easier for developers to get started quickly. Additionally, serverless platforms offer integrated tools for monitoring, debugging, and logging, allowing developers to troubleshoot errors more efficiently. 

4) Rapid Onboarding of New Teams
As serverless platforms provide built-in auto-scaling capabilities, teams can start developing features rapidly and iteratively, saving valuable time and resources compared to traditional methods of DevOps implementation. Overall, serverless computing offers numerous benefits that simplify cloud deployments and reduce overhead, promoting agility, flexibility, and scalability across organizations. 

## When To Use Serverless Architectures For Building Applications
Now, let’s discuss when to use serverless architectures for building applications according to several factors, such as team size, project scope, and business goals.

1) Small Team Size
If your organization has a small number of developers working on projects that require constant updates and enhancements, serverless could be an ideal solution. Serverless platforms enable developers to build out features quickly and at low cost, with minimal involvement from operations staff. Additionally, serverless platforms typically charge per-execution rather than fixed monthly rates, providing flexible pricing options.  

2) Large Project Scope
For large projects requiring multiple collaborators or stakeholders to work together closely, serverless might be a good fit due to the increased speed and flexibility afforded by the platform. By abstracting away the underlying infrastructure management requirements, serverless enables engineers to focus on creating value for customers faster.

3) Business Goals
Many businesses today face challenges around scalability, availability, and security. Serverless provides a reliable solution that addresses these concerns, while still retaining control over critical components such as user authentication and data storage. Customers benefit from reduced costs, improved efficiency, and flexibility, while leaving full responsibility for maintenance and upgrade responsibilities to the cloud vendor.

## How Does Serverless Work With Microservices And Other Types Of Application Architecture Patterns?
Microservices architectural pattern encourages splitting monolithic applications into smaller modular pieces called microservices. Each microservice performs one specific task, interacting with other microservices through well defined APIs. While microservices architectures can be beneficial in terms of portability, modularity, scalability, and reliability, they can also add complexity to the overall application structure and increase the risk of cross-microservice communication errors.

Serverless computing comes into play here when used in conjunction with microservices architectures. Since serverless takes care of resource provisioning and scaling, developers don't need to explicitly create and manage instances or containers for each microservice. Instead, they can declare the desired behavior through the cloud provider's API and trust that they'll receive the appropriate compute resources when needed. This approach reduces the effort needed to develop and operate complex microservices-based applications.

However, even though serverless computing plays an important role in microservices-based applications, there are other types of application architectures patterns that may benefit from serverless as well, such as event-driven architectures, stream processing, and IoT integration. These cases highlight the potential benefits of using serverless alongside existing architectures.
