# 1.背景介绍


Facial landmarks are important in many applications such as face recognition and pose estimation. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been widely used for facial feature detection because of its high performance and efficiency. However, although there exist several algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect facial landmarks, they still suffer from accuracy issues due to the limitation of CNN architecture and domain knowledge. Therefore, we propose a novel approach named FANet to address these problems with a simple yet effective network architecture which can be trained end-to-end using only facial images without any manual annotation. 

FANet is a multi-task deep learning framework consisting of three modules: (i) spatial pyramid pooling module, (ii) attention guided convolutional block, and (iii) facial landmark localization module. The proposed method first applies a global average pooling layer followed by two fully connected layers to learn discriminative features for all possible locations at different scales. Then, it uses an attention mechanism to selectively focus on informative regions around each detected facial landmark point. Finally, a regression model learns the final coordinates of each predicted landmark using local coordinate regression scheme. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various datasets including COFW, WFLW and AFLW. It also provides competitive results in terms of speed and accuracy compared to previous approaches when tested under real-time constraints.

## Face Detectors
The process of detecting faces in images involves multiple steps involving various computer vision techniques like feature extraction, object classification, region proposal, etc. We can classify face detectors into two categories - Static and Dynamic ones. 

Static Face Detectors work well on images where lighting conditions remain constant over time or static environments but they do not perform well in dynamic scenarios where objects move fast or change in size quickly. They work best when subject is stationary or background is consistent. Some examples include Haar Cascade Classifiers, DPMs, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), SVM, AdaBoost, RNN/LSTM, RetinaNet, and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector). These detectors use pre-trained models to detect faces but require fine tuning if new data set comes along.

Dynamic Face Detectors are less accurate than static detectors but their ability to handle dynamic scenes makes them useful in practical applications. They work by analyzing motion cues or external factors like vibrations or illumination changes. Examples include Deep sort, KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filter), YOLOv3, Mask RCNN, and CenterNet. These detectors require more computational resources but provide better accuracy.

## Feature Extractors
Feature extractors extract valuable information from raw image pixels, mostly focusing on the presence and location of particular patterns. This includes both color distribution and texture analysis, among others. There are numerous feature extractor architectures available today. Some popular ones are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Keypoint Detectors like SURF, BRIEF, ORB, FAST, STAR, BRISK, AKAZE, and GFTT, among others. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the context of application.

We need to make sure that we choose the right feature extractor to match the characteristics of the task at hand. For instance, while traditional visual descriptors like LBP and HOG are efficient for low level tasks like matching keypoints between images, CNNs offer more powerful representation power for higher level tasks like facial recognition or object detection. Furthermore, some feature extractors may require specialized hardware like graphics cards or special libraries to achieve high processing throughput. 

## Regressor Network
A regressor network takes extracted features from the feature extractor network and produces one or more outputs representing the position and shape of a specified target entity in the scene. Depending on the nature of the output, we can categorize them into Regression Networks and Classification Networks. 

Regression Networks produce continuous values indicating the x, y positions of the target entity. Some popular regression networks are Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCN), Pixel Deformable Convolutional Networks (DCNN), Region Based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN), Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), Anchor Free Methods like FCOS, TTFNet, and Detr, and Keypoint Detectors like Part-based CNNs like Poselets and Hourglass, among others.

Classification Networks produce discrete labels indicating whether a specific pattern exists within the image. Some popular classification networks are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Shallow Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Attention Mechanisms like Squeeze-and-Excitation Layers (SELayers), among others.

In general, while regression networks often produce more precise estimates, they may be computationally expensive. On the other hand, classification networks may offer faster execution times at the cost of reduced precision. Hence, it's essential to balance the needs of the task at hand with the appropriate type of network.
