# 1.背景介绍


Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by an abnormal accumulation of bacteria and viruses within the alveolar space, which results in inflammation and scarring of the airways. Stroke is one of the most common causes of COPD, leading to deterioration of pulmonary function and complications such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Approximately 7% of all adults develop COPD over the age of 65 years and it can lead to lung failure or death. The majority of patients experience symptoms after a stroke and require long-term treatment. Therefore, there is a critical need to improve post-stroke functionality in COPD patients to restore normal circulatory functions and enhance their quality of life. Despite numerous research efforts focused on the prevention and management of stroke, very limited attention has been paid to improving functional outcomes following stroke in COPD patients. This paper presents a review of relevant literature in the field of airway management techniques for improving post-stroke functionality in COPD patients. Key areas discussed include respiratory support mechanisms, therapeutic options, software tools, physiological correlates, clinical outcomes, patient education programs, surgical interventions, etc. In addition, future directions are suggested for further research in this area.

## Respiratory Support Mechanisms
Airway management includes a number of key steps to ensure optimal post-stroke functionality: breathing support, oxygen supply, central ventilation, mechanical ventilation, and intubation/extubation if necessary. These measures help maintain an airway clearance and promote inspiration and expiration to relieve sharpness and balance any arrhythmic changes due to the injury. Breathing support mechanisms may involve positioning the affected limb(s) at different positions throughout the body, balancing breathing between upper and lower airways, exerting extra effort during deep inspiration/expiration cycles, increasing spinal flexibility and reducing swelling, or using antiperspirants or peritoneal dialysis. Oxygen delivery may be provided via nasal infusion, suction, or tracheostomy. Central ventricle (CV) mediated ventilation uses high pressure ventilators inserted into the thoracic cavity and provides oxygen to the lungs through the nose. Cannula driven ventilation removes carbon dioxide from the environment and directly brings oxygen to the affected regions. Intubation is used when the underlying cause of COPD remains unclear or cannot be prevented; extubation involves removal of the restricting chest wall and filling the lungs back up to the desired volume. All these measures aim to stabilize the affected lung, increase oxygen flow, prevent coagulopathies, and improve airway smoothness. However, not all patients receive appropriate care for their needs and therefore more studies are needed to identify the best ways to manage post-stroke CPAP use.

## Therapeutic Options
COPD patients usually have mild symptoms and do not require immediate medical treatment. A combination of medications and exercise can help treat many COPD cases. Some commonly used treatments include antibiotics, beta blockers, nebulizers, and psychoactive drugs like valium, haloperidol, tranquilizers, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Long-acting agents like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen may also be helpful in treating certain types of COPD. However, given the complex nature of COPD and its variability across populations, thorough testing and monitoring is recommended before considering additional medications or therapies. Researchers still lack consensus about the optimal combination of medications to effectively manage COPD symptoms and impairing progression. Additional research is needed to better understand how different medications interact with each other and what factors influence their effectiveness. Furthermore, psychological aspects related to copd, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and withdrawal, can interfere with medication-based management strategies. To address these issues, various educational programs for patients, family members, and healthcare professionals are required to improve patient understanding and provide guidelines on how to manage COPD effectively.

## Software Tools
Software tools for managing post-stroke COPD functionality can assist clinicians in identifying patterns of deterioration, creating risk profiles, predicting response times, assessing potential hazards, and evaluating recovery success rates. Many software applications exist for managing COVID-19 patients including telehealth systems, virtual visits, video conferencing, online diaries, and mobile apps. They offer features such as alert notifications, report generation, emergency assistance, and voice messaging that enable real-time communication among stakeholders and improves workflow efficiency. Other software tools may specifically target specific types of COPD symptoms, such as asthma or sleep apnea. By integrating them into routine clinical workflows, they can help reduce time spent on manual tasks and improve overall efficiencies. For example, an AI model trained to detect hospitalization signals or heart rate variations could be incorporated into a telehealth system to provide swift interventions when a serious case arises. Alternatively, automated systems could analyze screening reports automatically and flag symptomatic cases for further evaluation. Another example is a computerized cardiac diagnostic tool that alerts physicians to problematic CT scans based on CT scan pattern matching algorithms or metrics derived from prior scans. Such tools would greatly simplify analysis of large amounts of data and save valuable resources. However, accuracy, reliability, and availability of existing software tools varies widely depending on the individual’s technical expertise and institutional infrastructure. Moreover, these tools often lack contextual knowledge that users may need to make informed decision-making regarding airway management approaches.

## Physiological Correlates
Several physical indicators have been reported to predict poor post-stroke functional outcome in COPD patients. These indicators include increased blood pressure, decreased capillary refill rate, reduced venous return, hypoxia, hyperventilation, elevation of total pH, rales holes, and distension of the femoral vein. While some of these indicators seem straightforward and intuitive, others, particularly those concerning venous return and cycling, remain elusive. Most studies only focus on precipitating symptoms while missing crucial clues of what pathological processes contribute to the deficit. Nonetheless, recent evidence suggests that the effects of stroke on the lung cannot be completely understood without deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms. Future studies will address these gaps by performing larger animal models of varying stresses and conditions under diverse environments, enabling more comprehensive investigation of the role of fluid transport, inflammation, cellular activity, metabolism, electrical activity, and immune responses in restoring the normal functionality of the lung.

## Clinical Outcomes
In general, the vast majority of COPD patients recover quickly and without complications, but there are significant challenges associated with achieving full functional recovery. Recovery rates may vary significantly according to individual characteristics, age, comorbidities, and baseline conditions. Progression rates decline in patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy, but accelerate towards a peak around 5–10 years after acute ischemic attack (AIS). Survival following partial recovery ranges from less than five months in young children to two years in older patients. Clinical findings vary according to severity of symptoms and extent of airway damage, which can range from severe to moderate. Evaluation of post-stroke recovery requires careful consideration of multiple variables, including temporal resolution, spatial resolution, biomechanical markers, and outcomes beyond survival.

## Patient Education Programs
One important aspect of effective management of COPD is providing education to patients and families to help them understand their condition and the importance of caring for their lung. Educational programs should address both basic science and clinical concepts, emphasizing the roles of medication, exercise, social support, and mental health services in managing COPD symptoms and maintaining good health outcomes. It is essential to establish safe and effective precautions against infection, stress incontinence, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and other toxins that can affect lung function. Developing standard operating procedures and working with specialists in occupational health and dental settings can also be crucial for achieving successful recovery. Interdisciplinary teams involving students, physicians, and nurses can collaborate on developing educational materials and designing activities that cover a wide range of topics. Finally, community engagement campaigns can help spread awareness about the importance of self-care, social support, and healthy living styles.

## Surgical Interventions
Another option for improving post-stroke functionality in COPD patients is surgery. Surgery can potentially reverse the damage caused by the stroke and restore normal lung function. Several surgeries have been performed on COPD patients, but none of them have resulted in complete recovery. Treatment outcomes, however, suggest that surgery may be the next step in the management of COPD. Hydroceles, mass tissue resection, and targeted incision procedures, along with advanced intervertebral disc placement, are currently being tested as new methods for managing COPD symptoms. However, early detection, identification, and correction of the underlying cause of the stroke are essential components of successful surgical intervention in COPD patients. More research is needed to evaluate whether current and future technologies can accurately diagnose and track the cause of stroke in patients and predict post-intervention functional outcomes. Ultimately, it is essential to reach consensus on best practices for managing post-stroke functionality in COPD patients and build trust in the practice by promoting collaboration and supporting scientific advancement.
