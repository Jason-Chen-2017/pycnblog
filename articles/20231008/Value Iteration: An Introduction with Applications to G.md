# 1.背景介绍


Value iteration is a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning that allows us to find the optimal policy for Markov decision processes (MDPs). It works by repeatedly evaluating the utility of each state until convergence to an optimal solution. The value function represents our current beliefs about the reward distribution over future states. At each step, we update this estimate based on what happens if we take different actions from the current state, using a bellman equation that takes into account both immediate rewards and discounted future rewards. By iterating between these updates, we can build up our understanding of the MDP as well as any associated policies or strategies. In many ways, value iteration is like the Swiss Army knife of RL algorithms, but it's also worth noting that there are several subtly different versions depending on how you approach the problem and the specifics of your particular environment. This paper will focus on one such version called linear programming value iteration. Linear programming VI consists of solving a large set of linear programs at each iteration, which may be computationally intensive, making it less efficient than other techniques like temporal differences or Q-learning when applied to large MDPs. Nonetheless, its simplicity and speed make it popular among researchers and practitioners due to its intuitive interpretation, ease of implementation, and ability to handle some classes of MDPs that might otherwise be challenging. We'll discuss two applications of linear programming VI in games and planning: puzzle solvers and multiagent pathfinding.

## Markov Decision Processes(MDPs)
A Markov decision process (MDP) is a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, R, \gamma)$ consisting of:

1. States $\mathcal{S}$: A finite set of states.
2. Actions $\mathcal{A}(s)$: A function taking a state $s$ and returning a set of possible actions.
3. Transition probabilities $\mathcal{T}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+^|\mathcal{S}|$: A function giving the probability of transitioning from state $s$ under action $a$ to some new state $s'$ with non-zero probability, and with certain conditions on whether or not the transition is legal according to the dynamics of the system.
4. Rewards $R: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$: A function assigning a numerical reward to taking an action in a given state.
5. Discount factor $\gamma \in [0, 1]$: A discount rate used to balance immediate vs. long-term rewards in the calculation of expected returns. 

The goal of an agent interacting with an MDP is to learn a strategy or policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time while avoiding degenerate solutions or getting trapped in a local optimum. The optimal policy $\pi_*$ determines the best sequence of actions to take starting from any state $s$, i.e.,

$$ \pi_*(s) = \operatorname*{arg\,max}_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} R(s,a). $$

This is known as the Bellman equations in reinforcement learning.

## Value Function Approximation
We can represent the value of each state as a vector $\mathbf{v}$, where $\mathbf{v}(s)$ gives the expected return if we start from state $s$. To do so, we need to define a loss function that measures the difference between actual and predicted values. One common choice is the mean squared error (MSE), which reads

$$ L(\mathbf{w}) = ||\mathbf{v} - \hat{\mathbf{v}}||^2.$$

Here, $\mathbf{w}$ denotes the weight parameters of our model, and $\hat{\mathbf{v}}$ is the predicted value vector obtained through a forward pass through the network. We want to minimize this loss function by adjusting $\mathbf{w}$ so that our predictions match the true values closely. Intuitively, we want to learn good representations of the value functions that can generalize well across different initializations of the weights. Common choices include neural networks and kernel methods, both of which involve finding approximate solutions to the optimization problem above. However, since computing gradients through complex models is expensive, we often use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to update the weights after computing a mini-batch of samples.

## Policy Iteration
In standard reinforcement learning settings, we assume that the agent has access to a perfect model of the MDP dynamics. That is, we know all the transition probabilities and rewards exactly. However, in practice, we usually have limited knowledge of the world and must rely on approximations instead. Therefore, we can solve an approximation version of the Bellman equations using value function approximators instead of exact ones. Specifically, let $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ be our parameterized policy function that maps states to probabilities of selecting each available action. Then, we can define the approximation of the Bellman operator as follows:

$$ v_{\pi_\theta}(s) \approx \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)}\pi_\theta(a|s)\left[R(s,a) + \gamma\sum_{s'}\mathcal{T}(s'|s,a)[v_{\pi_\theta}(s')]\right]. $$

This means that we're approximating the expected return for state $s$ under the policy $\pi_\theta$, using only our learned representation of the value function for future states. We then iterate between updating our policy function and estimating the value function until convergence. Formally, the policy iteration algorithm involves the following steps: 

1. Initialize the policy function $\pi_0(a|s) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}(s)|}$.
2. Repeat until convergence:
   * Evaluate the value function $V_{\pi_\theta}$ for the current policy $\pi_\theta$.
   * Improve the policy function $\pi_\theta$ by greedily selecting actions that maximize the value function improvement: 
   
    $$ \pi_\text{new}(a|s) = \frac{\exp\{Q_\pi(s,a)\}}{\sum_{b \in \mathcal{A}(s)}\exp\{Q_{\pi_\theta}(s,b)\}}. $$
   
   Here, $Q_\pi(s,a)$ refers to the estimated Q-value under policy $\pi_\theta$. Note that this formula depends on the specific definition of $\pi_\theta$.
   
    * If the updated policy is very close to the old one within a tolerance threshold, stop the iterations early.

Note that policy iteration requires an explicit policy evaluation step before the policy improvement step. Evaluating the policy typically entails computing an expected return for each state using sampled trajectories generated by executing the policy. Since this can be computationally expensive, modern RL systems use approximate value function evaluations instead, such as VFA, Q-learning with eligibility traces, or TD(λ). The details of these approaches are beyond the scope of this article, but they differ in how much exploration they allow during training and how they trade off bias and variance in the estimate of the value function. Nevertheless, all of them require reasonably accurate estimates of the value function to work correctly.

## Linear Programming Value Iteration
Linear programming value iteration (LPVI) replaces the explicit search over policies with an equivalent optimization problem. Let $p(s',r | s,a)$ be the conditional probability distribution of transitioning to state $s'$ and receiving reward $r$ under action $a$ conditioned on being in state $s$. We can express the objective function $c^{\pi}(s)=\mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\gamma^{t} r_t]$, which gives the expected total reward collected starting from state $s$ under policy $\pi$, as follows:

$$ c^{\pi}(s) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)}\pi(a|s) R(s,a) + \gamma\sum_{s'}\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s')}\pi(a|s)p(s',r|s,a)V^{\pi}(s'), $$

where $V^\pi(s)$ is the linear program solver we introduced earlier. The term inside the sum is the weighted average of the next state values under policy $\pi$, where the weights correspond to the probabilities of taking each action in the current state. Moreover, LPVI implicitly defines a recursive relationship between states via the terminal states. Specifically, if $s$ is a terminal state, then $V^\pi(s)=0$; otherwise, $V^\pi(s)>0$. Finally, note that the existence of a unique fixed point is guaranteed under some technical assumptions, making LPVI amenable to theoretical analysis and experimentation. Despite their limitations compared to more advanced techniques, LPVI remains a highly effective methodology for large scale problems involving continuous state spaces and high dimensional MDPs with low entropy distributions.
