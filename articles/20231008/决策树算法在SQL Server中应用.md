# 1.背景介绍


Decision Tree (DT) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems in machine learning. It builds a tree-like model by recursively splitting the data into smaller subsets based on certain decision rules. The goal of using DT is to create an output that is most likely to satisfy the given set of input variables. A decision tree can be regarded as a flowchart where each branch represents a possible outcome, while the leaf nodes represent the actual outcomes or classes. Decision trees are widely used in fields such as medicine, finance, marketing, and industry. 

Decision Trees have been successfully applied to various domains like computer science, finance, banking, insurance, medical care, etc., with high accuracy rates. In this article, we will discuss how we can use Decision Trees in SQL Server environment to solve complex business scenarios. We will demonstrate the process of building a decision tree classifier from scratch using T-SQL scripting language, along with its implementation using open source libraries in R and Python programming languages. 

In SQL Server, the DT algorithm can be implemented through the OPENJSON function and JSON_VALUE function. These functions enable us to extract information from JSON formatted text files and apply them to our Decision Tree models. Moreover, Microsoft has released several advanced features in recent versions of SQL Server which make it easier to implement DT algorithms including Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs). Therefore, it's essential to understand these advanced features before applying DT to any real world problem.  

In summary, the main focus of this article is to explain how we can build a decision tree classifier in SQL Server environment and also identify some of its advantages over other popular methods like logistic regression and KNN. Also, we will provide practical examples demonstrating how we can use both the SQL and non-SQL programming languages such as R and Python to train and deploy DT models in a variety of applications.

In general, decision trees can be classified into four types: 

1. Classification: Decision trees are typically used for classification problems where the target variable takes categorical values, i.e., discrete classes. An example would be predicting whether an email is spam or not based on its characteristics, e.g., sender, subject, content, time stamps, and attachments.

2. Regression: Decision trees are also commonly used for regression problems where the target variable takes continuous values, i.e., numerical values. For instance, prediction of house prices based on their attributes could fall under this category.

3. Clustering: Decision trees can also be used for clustering tasks, where objects are grouped together based on similarities between their feature vectors. This task involves partitioning a dataset into groups where members of one group differ significantly from those of another group.

4. Density Estimation: Finally, decision trees can be used to estimate densities of probability distributions. These density estimates help in identifying regions in the input space that are highly probable, thereby enabling clustering or classification of new data points.

The basic idea behind decision trees is to divide the input space into multiple rectangles or regions based on the value of a selected feature, until we reach a stopping criterion. At each node, we evaluate the impurity of the subset of samples based on the selected feature and select the best split point among all possible splits that minimize the impurity measure. After selecting a split, we move down to the child nodes and repeat the process recursively until we have reached the desired depth or encounter a stopping criteria. Once we have constructed the complete tree, we can classify a new sample based on the majority label in the corresponding leaf node.

Let’s take a closer look at the key steps involved in implementing a decision tree classifier in SQL Server environment:

1. Data preparation: First, we need to prepare the training data by removing missing values and converting categorical variables into numeric form. We can do this using SQL statements involving SELECT, WHERE, ISNULL, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN, SUM operators. 

2. Feature selection: Next, we should select the relevant features that may affect the classification result. This can be done either manually or automatically using techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information score, and Chi-squared test.

3. Training phase: In this step, we construct the decision tree by repeatedly splitting the data into two smaller subsets based on the value of a chosen feature, until we have reached the maximum allowed level of recursion. During each iteration, we calculate the impurity of the current subset of samples based on the selected feature. To find the best split point, we consider all possible thresholds for the selected feature and choose the threshold that results in the minimum impurity. After finding the optimal split point, we move to the left child node if the selected feature value is less than the threshold and right child node otherwise. We continue this process recursively until we have reached the stopping criterion (either a pre-defined number of levels or minimum impurity reduction), whichever happens earlier.

4. Model validation: As part of the training phase, we can validate the performance of the trained model using different metrics, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Gini index. To achieve better results, we can fine-tune the parameters of the model, such as setting the maximum level of recursion, choosing different impurity measures, or tuning hyperparameters like alpha or lambda for GBM algorithms.

5. Deployment: Once the model is validated, we can deploy it in production systems to predict the class labels of new incoming data records. Here again, we can use SQL statements involving OPENJSON, JSON_VALUE, and CASE functions to extract information from JSON formatted text files and apply them to our Decision Tree models. We can also store the final model in a table for future use or deployment.  

Now let’s talk about the mathematical basis of decision trees:

Suppose we have a binary classification problem with N training instances {x(1), x(2), …, x(N)} and binary target variable y(i), where y(i) = +1 for positive cases and y(i) = -1 for negative cases. Let Z be a binary random variable indicating whether an instance belongs to the positive class (+1) or negative class (-1). Then the objective is to learn a decision stump, which is a simplified version of a decision tree consisting only of a root node and two child nodes.

A decision stump consists of three pieces of information:

1. A splitting attribute zj, which divides the input space into two disjoint regions: the left region contains all instances whose zj attribute is false or null, and the right region contains all instances whose zj attribute is true. If no appropriate splitting attribute exists, then the entire input space is divided equally, creating a single leaf node.

2. A threshold tj, which separates the two regions based on the value of the jth attribute.

3. A confidence level ρ, which quantifies the quality of the decision stump. The higher the value of ρ, the better the decision stump performs in terms of minimizing the expected error rate on the training set.

To find the best decision stump, we start by iterating over all possible splitting attributes zj and calculating the weighted average cost of misclassifying each instance using the decision rule defined by zj and tj. We also keep track of the total weight of instances in each region and update them after computing the cost of misclassification. Based on these costs, we choose the attribute and threshold pair resulting in the lowest weighted average cost of misclassification. If there are ties, we break the tie randomly.

Next, we compute the confidence level ρ of the resulting decision stump as follows:

ρ = P(+|D) / P(-|D), 
where P(+|D) and P(-|D) are the probabilities of belonging to the positive and negative class respectively when D is drawn uniformly from the input space containing the training instances with target value +1 and -1 respectively.

The expected error rate E[err] is given by:

E[err] = Σw * err^w * (1-err)^(1-w), 
where w is the weights assigned to each training instance during training and err is the fraction of incorrect predictions made by the decision stump on the training set. The sum above represents the average loss incurred by the decision stump on the training set due to incorrect predictions.

Finally, we compare the confidence level of each candidate decision stump across the range of acceptable errors ε. If the confidence level ρ falls below ε, we accept the decision stump and terminate the search process; otherwise, we discard the candidate and try the next one. When there are many candidates remaining, we prefer ones with lower confidence levels because they perform better on the training set.

In practice, we usually stop searching early once the improvement in the confidence level becomes negligible or reaches a specific tolerance limit. By default, the maximum recursion depth is limited to 10 but can be increased if necessary. The choice of impurity measure depends on the distribution of the target variable and the relationship between the available attributes. Common choices include entropy and Gini index. Additionally, decision trees can be extended to handle multi-class classification tasks by assigning a separate decision stump to each possible target class or incorporating additional decision criteria such as minimum number of observations in a node or information gain.
