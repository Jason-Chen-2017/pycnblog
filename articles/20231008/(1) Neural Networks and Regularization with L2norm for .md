# 1.背景介绍


Sparsity is a common problem that occurs in many areas of machine learning such as computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, etc. The main idea behind sparsity is to reduce the number of nonzero elements or features in a matrix or tensor by setting them to zero. In deep neural networks, we often encounter sparse connections between neurons resulting from feature selection or low dimensional representations. This poses an optimization challenge because it can significantly reduce the model size while still achieving good accuracy. Therefore, techniques have been developed to reduce the redundancy and noise in these weights using regularization techniques like L1/L2-norms, dropout, or other methods. However, there are several limitations of existing approaches: 
1. They do not effectively handle sparsity directly within the network architecture. Sparse connections require specialized algorithms at every layer such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, etc. Moreover, the connection pattern may vary across different layers making it difficult to apply similar pruning strategies over the entire network architecture. 
2. These pruning methods typically focus on reducing the absolute magnitude of the weight values but ignore the relative importance or significance of individual weights during training. To address this issue, some researchers use indirect pruning techniques like gradient based compression or structured pruning which remove small portions of weights altogether without changing their sign. Despite their effectiveness, however, they cannot guarantee global sparsity if multiple layers are interconnected.
3. Most pruning techniques work at the output level rather than the input level leading to redundant information being propagated through the network leading to more false positives due to noisy gradients or incorrect weights. 
4. Current pruning methods suffer from slow convergence and long training times when applied to large scale models due to iterative updates required to prune each weight individually. These factors limit the practical application of these methods to real world applications.
To summarize, there is a need for efficient and effective methods for handling sparsity directly within the neural network architecture itself and optimizing the performance of sparse neural networks without affecting their generalization ability.

2.Core Concepts and Connections
The central concept underlying most sparse deep learning techniques is the L2-norm regularization. It encourages the network to minimize the weighted sum of squared errors between the predicted output and the actual target y, where the weights are constrained to lie within a certain range determined by the strength of the regularization parameter λ. A larger value of λ will lead to stronger regularization and smaller weights, whereas a smaller value of λ will result in weaker regularization and larger weights. Intuitively, the greater the strength of the regularization term, the more important it becomes to preserve only the significant weights and discard all irrelevant ones. Mathematically, the L2-norm penalty is defined as follows:


where θ are the parameters of the network, W are its weights, x is the input, y is the desired output, and ε is a small constant added to avoid dividing by zero. When solving a regression task, we define the loss function as the mean squared error: 


However, applying this regularization technique globally to all the weights results in suboptimal solutions since the relevant weights tend to cluster together, i.e., share high correlation coefficients with one another, resulting in a bias towards preserving all those weights instead of focusing solely on the most informative ones. As a consequence, many sparse deep learning techniques introduce two complementary ideas: 

1. Local sparsity constraint: Instead of penalizing all the weights uniformly throughout the network, we can assign a separate sparsity coefficient to each weight depending on its relevance to the prediction objective. For example, we can set a higher penalty for weights corresponding to rare events occurring less frequently or causing unusual behavior.

2. Network decomposition: We can decompose the overall network into multiple subnetworks whose weights are separately subjected to sparsity constraints. Each subnetwork corresponds to a specific feature space that can be considered independently for classification purposes. By doing so, we can control the tradeoff between the total network sparsity and the degree of feature reuse achieved by the network.

In summary, the key challenges faced by sparse deep learning techniques involve selecting appropriate sparsity levels and managing dependencies among the layers. The L2-norm penalty provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for introducing sparsity into deep neural networks. Researchers continue to develop novel techniques to address these issues, including stochastic pruning methods, improved initialization schemes, and joint sparsity-regularization techniques.
