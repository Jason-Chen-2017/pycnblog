# 2.Core Concepts & Connections
The basic concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is based on building machines capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intervention. In contrast, deep learning uses large sets of training data to learn complex patterns in data without being explicitly programmed to perform specific actions. Neural networks are one type of deep learning algorithm that forms the foundation of current deep learning systems. These networks consist of layers of connected nodes that pass values forward and backward between themselves. Each node represents a function applied to the input data. The connections between nodes define the flow of information through the network, allowing it to gradually adjust itself to map inputs to outputs. Over time, the network learns how to extract meaningful features from the data and improve its performance over time.


In order to get started with deep learning, you need to first understand some core concepts and terms. Here's a brief overview of some key ideas and definitions:


**Input Data:** Input data refers to any piece of data provided to a system for analysis or prediction. For example, images, text documents, audio signals, and sensor measurements are all examples of input data. The amount and complexity of input data varies widely depending on the application being solved.


**Feature Extraction:** Feature extraction involves identifying useful patterns and relationships within the input data. Traditional feature extraction approaches involve hand-crafted features or mathematical transformations that capture meaningful aspects of the data. However, developing high-quality feature representations using deep learning techniques offers several advantages. Firstly, unlike traditional approaches, deep learning models automatically learn effective feature representations based on complex interactions between different levels of the network. Secondly, feature extraction can be performed end-to-end during training, which means the model directly applies learned features to new data rather than requiring pre-processing steps. Thirdly, deep learning models can capture non-linearities present in the underlying data, leading to better generalization and robustness against noise.


**Model Training:** Model training refers to the process of feeding input data into a machine learning model and updating its weights until it produces accurate predictions. During model training, the goal is to minimize the error between predicted values and actual values, often referred to as the loss function. There are many types of loss functions available, including mean squared error (MSE), cross-entropy, and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Depending on the problem being addressed, appropriate loss functions may need to be selected to optimize the model's performance.


**Hyperparameters:** Hyperparameters are parameters that are set prior to training a deep learning model. They control various properties of the model architecture, training procedure, and optimization methodology. Examples include the number of hidden layers, activation functions, learning rate, batch size, regularization parameter, momentum factor, and dropout probability. Choosing optimal hyperparameters requires careful tuning based on the dataset characteristics and constraints.


**Overfitting:** Overfitting occurs when a deep learning model performs significantly better on the training data compared to its ability to generalize to unseen test data. It usually happens when the model becomes too complex, leading to low variance and high bias errors. To prevent overfitting, the best practice is to split the dataset into separate training and validation sets, and monitor the model's performance on both sets during training. Regularization techniques like L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation can also help reduce overfitting.


**Regularization:** Regularization is a technique that helps avoid overfitting by penalizing model coefficients that exceed certain thresholds. This ensures that the model stays underpinned by important features while still capturing irrelevant ones. Common regularization techniques include L1/L2 regularization, dropout, and data augmentation.


# 3.Core Algorithm Principles and Operations - Layers, Activation Functions, and Loss Function
Here are five critical components of a typical deep learning system:


**Layers:** Layers are the fundamental building blocks of a neural network. Each layer consists of a collection of neurons that receive inputs from previous layers and produce output for the next layer. The structure of a neural network is determined by the arrangement of layers and the types of neurons used in each layer. Typical layers include fully connected layers (FCN), convolutional layers, recurrent layers, and pooling layers. FCNs are commonly used for classification problems where the final output is a single scalar value. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input data to generate feature maps that are fed into subsequent layers for further processing. Recurrent layers operate on sequential data such as speech or text sequences, allowing the network to reason about temporal dependencies between elements. Pooling layers downsample the feature maps generated by the previous layer, reducing the computational cost and improving generalization.


**Activation Functions:** Activation functions provide the nonlinearity that enables the network to learn complex relationships in the input data. Popular activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, relu (rectified linear unit), and softmax. Sigmoid functions squash the output of the previous layer to fall between zero and one, representing probabilities or scores. Tanh functions transform the output of the previous layer to span between negative one and positive one, providing additional non-linearity. Relu is similar to tanh, but only activates nodes if the input is greater than zero, enabling sparse networks that can reduce computation costs. Softmax functions normalize the output of the previous layer to form a probability distribution across classes, allowing multiple independent choices to be made for each sample.


**Loss Function:** Loss functions measure the difference between the predicted values and the true values for a given input. The goal is to minimize the loss function during training to improve the accuracy of the model. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), binary cross entropy (BCE), categorical cross entropy (CCE), and Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). MSE measures the average square deviation between predicted and actual values. BCE measures the logarithmic likelihood of the predicted class versus the actual class. CCE measures the distance between the predicted probability distributions and the empirical probability distributions. KLD measures the divergence between two probability distributions.


**Optimization Procedure:** Optimization procedures search for the best set of model parameters that minimizes the loss function. Common optimization algorithms include gradient descent (GD), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), adagrad, adam, and rmsprop. GD computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters and updates the weights iteratively. SGD randomly selects a subset of samples and computes the gradients based on those samples, resulting in faster convergence. Adagrad keeps track of past gradients to smooth out the update step and adaptively adjust the learning rate per parameter. Adam combines the idea of adaptive moment estimation with SGD, resulting in faster convergence even when the learning rate is constant. Rmsprop is a variant of adam that adapts the learning rate per parameter based on the magnitude of recent gradients.


# 4.Code Example and Detailed Description
Before going into detail, let's take a look at a code example that demonstrates how to implement a simple dense neural network using TensorFlow library in Python:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input and output dimensions
input_dim = 10
output_dim = 2

# Create placeholders for input and labels
inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, input_dim])
labels = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, output_dim])

# Define a dense neural network with three hidden layers
hidden_layers = [100, 50, 25]
activations = [tf.nn.relu]*len(hidden_layers) + [None] # last layer does not apply any activation
previous_layer = inputs
for i in range(len(hidden_layers)):
    current_layer = tf.add(tf.matmul(previous_layer, tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([input_dim if i==0 else hidden_layers[i-1], hidden_layers[i]]))),
                            tf.Variable(tf.zeros(shape=[hidden_layers[i]])))
    previous_layer = activations[i](current_layer)
    
# Define the output layer with linear activation function since we're doing regression
logits = tf.add(tf.matmul(previous_layer, tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([hidden_layers[-1], output_dim]))),
                tf.Variable(tf.zeros(shape=[output_dim])))
        
# Calculate the loss and optimizer
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.squared_difference(logits, labels)) # MSE loss function
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimize(loss)

# Train the model on some dummy data
data = np.random.rand(1000, input_dim)
labels = np.random.rand(1000, output_dim)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    
    for i in range(100):
        _, l = sess.run([optimizer, loss], {inputs: data, labels: labels})
        
    preds = sess.run(logits, {inputs: data})
```

This code creates a placeholder tensor `inputs` for input data and a placeholder tensor `labels` for ground truth labels. Then it defines a dense neural network consisting of three hidden layers with 100, 50, and 25 neurons respectively. Since the last layer doesn't apply any activation function, it must be defined separately using the keyword argument `activations`. 

Next, the output layer is defined with linear activation function because we're dealing with a regression problem. The logits tensor calculates the raw output of the network before applying the activation function. We then calculate the mean squared error between the predicted and true values using the `squared_difference()` operation and compute the gradients of the loss function wrt the model variables using the `gradient()` operator. Finally, we use the Adam optimizer to update the weights of the network during training.

Training the model requires initializing all the global variables created in the graph and passing input data and label tensors to the session object to execute the operations in the graph. After running the session object for a few epochs, we retrieve the predicted values using another call to the same session object and evaluate the model's performance on some external test data.
