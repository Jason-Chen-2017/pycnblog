: What is chatbot and why it's useful for businesses today?
Chatbots have become an increasingly popular tool among businesses, especially those who want to provide personalized services or products to their customers. They can be trained to interact with users in natural language, making them more engaging than other types of bots that rely on rules-based processing. However, building real-time chatbots requires advanced knowledge of NLP techniques such as machine learning algorithms, deep learning frameworks, and natural language processing libraries. 

In this article, we will discuss how to build a high-quality chatbot using natural language processing techniques by implementing the Conversational AI Kit from IBM Watson. This kit contains several essential components required to create a robust conversational AI system, including a dialogue engine, natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG).

We will start by giving a general overview of chatbots and the different ways they are used within businesses today. We'll then cover the main concepts and algorithms behind building a chatbot using NLP technologies, before diving into specific code examples and explanations of how these technologies work together to deliver a quality chatbot. Finally, we'll talk about some possible future directions and challenges for chatbot development. Let's get started!

# 2. Core Concepts & Contact
## 2.1 Introduction to Chatbots
A chatbot is a computer program that mimics conversation between two people through text messages, phone calls, or social media platforms. It provides a service or product without requiring human interaction through chatting. The term "chatbot" was coined in 2013 by Velbauer et al., describing what it meant to be like a robot talking to a person instead of just listening to commands. In recent years, chatbots have grown exponentially due to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and technology.

The purpose of chatbots is varied depending on the company or industry, but many companies use chatbots to increase customer engagement, sales leads, and reduce workload. Companies use chatbots to answer common questions, perform tasks automatically, manage support tickets, and connect with clients over messenger apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger, etc. Businesses also use chatbots to provide personalized content, recommendations, and services to customers based on their preferences and needs.

Sometimes, chatbots may be mistaken for actual humans, but because they behave like people, they often learn from their interactions and improve upon themselves. Research has shown that most chatbots share one or both of three traits - positivity, empathy, and trustworthiness. These characteristics make them particularly valuable for emerging markets where large volumes of consumers are still unaccustomed to online shopping and receiving feedback via automated messaging systems. Despite their potential value, chatbot research is limited due to the difficulty in gathering data about their behavior and intentions.

## 2.2 Types of Chatbots
There are several categories of chatbots according to their functionalities:
1. Customer Service Bot: A bot designed to assist customers in their queries related to products, services, account management, transactions, etc. They are usually available 24/7.

2. Sales Bot: A bot that helps sellers promote their products and services by responding to customer queries. 

3. E-commerce Bot: A bot built specifically for e-commerce websites that automates simple tasks like checking out orders, managing carts, providing shipping information, and providing payment options.

4. Inventory Management Bot: A bot that manages inventory and stock levels by scanning barcodes and using OCR software to read item details. They are mostly used in retail industries.

5. Healthcare Bot: Bots specialized in healthcare can help patients receive accurate advice and treatment. They can answer medical questions, monitor patient vitals, diagnose illnesses, and offer personalized care plans.

6. Financial Bot: A financial assistant that can answer common financial questions, provide investment insights, and calculate taxes.

### Conversational Programming vs Dialogue Systems 
Another distinction is between programming chatbots versus using dialogue systems. Programming chatbots typically require coding expertise and manual effort, while dialogue systems involve automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) modules, which detect and understand user input. Furthermore, dialogue systems can handle complex scenarios such as multi-turn conversations, context switching, and natural language understanding.

In summary, chatbots are becoming ever more important as they are able to replace aspects of traditional customer communication methods, enabling greater efficiency and speed in dealing with customers. To ensure success in creating chatbots, companies need to focus on acquiring and analyzing large amounts of relevant data, developing intelligent algorithms and models, optimizing performance, and ensuring scalability across various devices and channels.
