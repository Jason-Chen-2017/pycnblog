# 1.背景介绍


Debugging is an essential process in the development and maintenance of software systems. It helps to identify and correct errors, make performance improvements, increase robustness, and improve system reliability over time. Debugging tools provide efficient ways for developers to understand complex software systems by allowing them to step through code one line at a time and see how it affects program execution. The presence of debugging tools also makes developers more productive because they can fix problems faster with fewer bugs introduced into their code. 

In this blog post, we will demonstrate how Visual Studio Code (VSCode) can be used as a lightweight IDE for debugging microservices running on Kubernetes. We will use the popular Spring Boot framework to develop a simple RESTful API service that interacts with MySQL database. To help you get started with VSCode, we have created a Docker image containing all necessary dependencies such as Java, Maven, Spring Boot, MySQL, and VScode installed. This Docker container can be run directly on your machine or deployed on any Kubernetes cluster.


This article assumes readers have basic knowledge about containers, Kubernetes, and cloud native technologies like Istio. It also assumes readers have access to a local machine or remote server equipped with Docker or a Kubernetes platform like Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Lastly, it's important to note that while the steps described here are specific to developing Java services using Spring Boot, these same techniques can be adapted for other programming languages and frameworks as well. 


# 2.Core Concepts And Relationship
Microservices architecture has become increasingly popular over the past few years due to its ability to scale horizontally without sacrificing scalability and resilience. In a microservice architecture, each service runs independently but shares common resources via a message bus or API gateway. Each service typically consists of multiple components such as APIs, databases, and caches. A key concept in microservices architectures is service discovery. Service discovery allows different services to find and communicate with each other dynamically. When debugging microservices running on Kubernetes, it becomes crucial to ensure that all services are discovered properly and communicate successfully. Otherwise, services may fail intermittently or break completely depending on which pods they end up being scheduled to. 

To achieve successful debugging on Kubernetes, it’s critical to establish clear communication between all involved components, including ingress controllers, load balancers, and service meshes. Additionally, network connectivity issues can cause issues with intra-cluster communication and pod-to-pod communication. Finally, external requests from clients should also be checked to ensure they reach the appropriate endpoints. Together, these concepts form the foundation of debugging microservices on Kubernetes:

1. Communication Between Components
    * Ingress Controllers
    * Load Balancers
    * Service Meshes
    
2. Network Connectivity Issues
    * Pod-to-Pod Communications
    * Intra-Cluster Communications
    
3. External Requests From Clients
    
    
    
# 3. Core Algorithm Principles And Details Of Implementation

## Step 1: Install Docker Desktop
The first thing we need to do before installing our debug environment is to install Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop is a free and open-source application that simplifies the setup and deployment of applications inside containers. We'll use Docker Compose to deploy a multi-container application consisting of our API service, MySQL database, and a debugger agent. Here are the instructions to download and install Docker Desktop:

1. Go to https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop to download Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows.

2. Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system. During the installation process, allow Docker to use more memory and CPUs if prompted.

3. After installation completes, launch the Docker app from your taskbar or start menu. If everything was set up correctly, Docker Desktop will notify us that it is running.

## Step 2: Set Up Our Debug Environment Using Docker Compose
Next, let's create our debug environment using Docker Compose. We'll define three separate docker-compose files to configure our environment: `api`, `mysql`, and `agent`. The `api` file defines our Spring Boot API service along with the necessary configurations for connecting to the MySQL database. The `mysql` file creates a standalone MySQL instance inside a Docker container. The `agent` file sets up our debugging agent which connects to the running API service inside the `api` container and provides runtime insights into the state of the application.

Here are the commands to create our Dockerfile and build our images:

```
mkdir vscode-debugging && cd vscode-debugging

cat >Dockerfile <<EOF
FROM maven:3-jdk-11 AS MAVEN_TOOLCHAIN
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml.
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline

    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY entrypoint.sh.

cd api

echo '<pluginRepository><!-- Remove default repository --></pluginRepository>' >> pom.xml

sed -i's|<parent><relativePath>..<\/relativePath></parent>|<parent><relativePath>.</relativePath><groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId><artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId><version>${project.version}</version><name>${project.name}</name></parent>|g' pom.xml

mvn package -DskipTests

cp target/*.jar../../agent/.

cd../agent

curl -fsSL "https://github.com/microsoft/java-debug/releases/download/v0.31.1/java-debug-0.31.1.vsix" -o java-debug.vsix

unzip java-debug.vsix

rm java-debug.vsix

mkdir -p ~/.vscode-server/extensions/

mv *.vsix ~/.vscode-server/extensions/

cd.. && mkdir scripts 

```

We've downloaded the latest version of the JDK, configured the JAVA_HOME variable, and added several useful utilities like curl, git, etc., since we're going to be working within a terminal window. Then, we defined our three dockerfiles for building our images. Next, we moved into the `api` directory and updated the `pom.xml` file with required dependencies and plugins. Once we've done that, we ran the `mvn package` command to compile our project and generate the `.jar` file, which we then copied into the `agent` directory so that both containers share the same artifact. Similarly, we downloaded and extracted the latest version of the Java Debugger extension and placed it in the appropriate location. Now, back in the main folder (`vscode-debugging`), we can move into the `scripts` directory and write some bash script to automate the setup of our debug environment. Let's edit the `setup.sh` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Create API container
docker-compose -f api.yml down || true && docker-compose -f api.yml up -d

# Wait until the API container is ready to receive traffic
sleep 1m

# Update MySQL password
export MYSQL_PASSWORD=$(docker logs vscode-debugging_mysql_1 | grep GENERATED | awk '{print $7}')

# Generate certificate for HTTPS connections
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout domain.key -out domain.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=San Francisco/O=MyOrg/OU=MyDept/CN=localhost"

# Configure Nginx proxy for HTTPS connections
mkdir nginx && cp conf/nginx.conf nginx/default.conf

sed -i "s|SSL_CERTIFICATE_PATH|$(pwd)/domain.crt|" nginx/default.conf
sed -i "s|SSL_KEY_PATH|$(pwd)/domain.key|" nginx/default.conf

# Start Nginx proxy container
docker run --rm -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v $(pwd)/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d nginx:alpine

# Add CA cert to trust store
sudo cp domain.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
sudo update-ca-certificates

# Start MySQL shell
docker exec -it vscode-debugging_mysql_1 sh

# Run SQL command to change root password
mysql -uroot -e "ALTER USER IF EXISTS 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '$MYSQL_PASSWORD'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

exit

```

Here, we first start the `api` container using the `api.yml` file and wait until it's ready to accept incoming traffic. Then, we extract the generated random password for the MySQL user `root` and save it in the `$MYSQL_PASSWORD` variable. Next, we generate a self-signed SSL certificate for testing purposes and copy it into the current directory. We also modify the Nginx configuration template to point to the newly generated certificates. Finally, we start a new container named `nginx` using the preconfigured `default.conf` file and add the CA certificate to the trust store. After that, we switch back to the MySQL client and update the root password to match the value saved earlier.

Now, let's run the `setup.sh` file to complete our setup:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh

./setup.sh
```

After running the script, we should be able to view our API endpoint at `https://localhost/api/greeting`, where we can send HTTP GET requests to test our service. However, there won't be much debugging functionality available yet since we haven't launched any debuggers.

Finally, we can finish setting up our debug environment by updating the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:

  # API Container
  api:
    build:
      context:.
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "./api:/app"
    networks:
      - frontend
    depends_on:
      - db

  # Database Container
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD:-secret}
      MYSQL_DATABASE: greetings
    expose:
      - "3306"
    volumes:
      - "./mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql"
    networks:
      - backend
      
  # Agent Container
  agent:
    build:
      context:.
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5005:5005"
    volumes:
      - "./agent:/workspace"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
    networks:
      - frontend
    
networks:
  frontend: {}
  backend: {}
  
```

In this file, we've changed the port mapping for the `api` container to map port `8080` on the host to port `8080` inside the container. We've also mounted the `/app` volume into the container so that changes made to source code inside the container persist when we rebuild the container. We've also exposed port `3306` for the MySQL container and provided a default password of `secret` unless overridden by the `MYSQL_PASSWORD` environment variable. We've removed unnecessary volumes and networks for simplicity. 

Now, we can launch the entire environment using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

And voila! Our full debug environment is now ready to go. Before moving forward, let me clarify something. Depending on your specific scenario, you may want to tailor the approach to include additional components like Istio, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Zipkin, and others. But regardless of those details, this basic setup should give you a good starting point for exploring debugging Java services on Kubernetes with Visual Studio Code.
