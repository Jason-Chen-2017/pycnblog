# 1.背景介绍


Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition that involves persistent repetitive behaviors such as drinking alcohol or drugs with the intent of living longer or achieving higher levels of enjoyment. These behaviors are also known as obsessions and can result in bouts of anger, depression, guilt, self-harm, and other negative symptoms. It has been reported to affect millions of people worldwide, making it one of the most common psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about how OCD affects brain function, especially in terms of its neurobiological correlates, including epileptic seizures, ataxia, and dementia. In this study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the relationships between specific brain patterns induced by OCD and various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, and mood disorders. We hypothesized that the changes in these brain patterns could be related to the development of OCD symptoms over time. Specifically, we sought to examine whether the increased activity of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortex was associated with increased symptomatology and severity scores in depressive, anxious, ADHD, and mood disorder cases during OCD episodes. Furthermore, we predicted that a subgroup of patients who had developed epileptic seizure syndrome after completing an OCD episode would have higher neuropsychiatric symptom severity scores than normal controls and those who did not develop epileptic seizure syndrome.


In order to measure MTL activity, we utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from healthy individuals and adults who experienced both control groups and patients with obsessive compulsive behavior (OCB). Anatomical MRI findings were similar for all participants regardless of their level of experience in OCD. Despite differences in age, sex, education level, and socioeconomic status, the majority of subjects faced no signs or symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although some experienced ASD symptoms. All participants underwent clinical assessment regarding depression, anxiety, ADHD, mood disorders, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which included symptom rating scales, assessments of sleep disturbances, questionnaires on pain perception, and family history of OCD. Results from each group were compared using paired t-tests and statistical analysis techniques, specifically regression models, correlation matrices, and multivariate analysis. 

To evaluate the relationship between MTL activation and neuropsychiatric symptoms, we calculated whole-brain connectivity maps using resting state networks obtained from structural MRI scans. For every participant, we extracted 9 different connectome metrics based on multiple criteria, including global signal intensity, geodesic distance matrix, Functional Connectivity Density, Sparsity Index, Cluster Statistic, Eccentricity, Average Path Length, and Local Field Power Spectrum. We then applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset while retaining most relevant features. 

Finally, we trained a random forest classification model to predict the presence of symptoms in OCB cases, along with depression, anxiety, ADHD, mood disorders, GAD, and ASD. To estimate individual symptom severity scores, we used logistic regression models trained separately for each case. Our analysis provides insight into the complex interplay between obsessive compulsive behavior and the brainstem area responsible for the transmission of psychological information. This knowledge may be useful in identifying potential biomarkers for disease progression and treatment optimization. Moreover, our results suggest that reducing the frequency of OCD activities might help prevent potentially fatal brain injury in certain populations.
