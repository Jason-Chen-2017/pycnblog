# 1.背景介绍


Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely adopted for generating novel music samples or synthesizing audio from given melodies, pitches or other features of interest. They are known as unsupervised learning models because they learn the underlying patterns and relationships between data without any prescribed labels or guidance. The architectures consist of two parts: a generator network that generates fake data with similar properties to the input data, while another discriminator network is trained to distinguish between real and fake data. In this article we will explore the fundamental principles behind GAN-based music synthesis using examples and mathematical analysis. 

Recently, researchers have demonstrated impressive results in creating novel synthetic music through Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approaches, but it remains an open question whether these techniques can create truly new music samples that do not exist in our existing datasets. As technology advances and machine listening capabilities grow, there is an urgent need to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and human creativity by producing soundtracks that capture the imagination and emotions of listeners. It would be of great benefit if such technologies could produce a wide range of music styles, ranging from happy pop songs to heavy metal productions, which cannot be achieved only through traditional techniques like algorithmic composition. Hence, understanding the basics of GAN-based music synthesis may help us develop new ways of creating emotional and expressive pieces of music through deeper integration of AI algorithms with cultural influences.

## 2.1.GAN简介
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), also known as Unsupervised Learning models, were introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al.[1] in 2014, as a way of training neural networks to generate new data samples with certain characteristics similar to those seen during training. This idea was based on the concept of adversarial competition, where two neural networks fight against each other in a zero-sum game. One of them is called the generator network, which creates new data samples that appear to be realistic enough to trick the discriminator network into believing that it came from the original distribution, while the other one is the discriminator network, which discriminates between real and generated data samples and tries to differentiate between them. During training, the generator network learns to map random inputs onto outputs that look like the desired output distribution, while the discriminator network has to distinguish between the true data and faked data produced by the generator network. GANs are considered unsupervised learning models since they don't require labeled training data and can generate their own data points by transforming the initial input noise.

In recent years, GANs have gained tremendous attention due to their impressive performance in various applications including image generation, text-to-image conversion, and style transfer[2]. There are several variations of GAN architectures, such as Conditional GANs, Cycle GANs, InfoGANs, and Wasserstein GANs, among others. However, in general terms, the basic structure of a GAN consists of a generator network and a discriminator network, where the former produces fake data and takes advantage of conditional information provided to improve its quality, whereas the latter evaluates the validity of the data coming from either the real world or the generator network. In addition to these key components, GANs can include additional layers such as skip connections and batch normalization for better performance.


The following figure demonstrates the overall architecture of a GAN-based music synthesizer. It includes multiple blocks of convolutional layers, transposed convolutional layers, residual connections, and normalization layers. These elements form the building blocks of the generator and discriminator networks, respectively, which together construct the GAN model.

### 2.2.1.GAN-based WaveNet生成器网络
WaveNet is a deep learning model developed by DeepMind Technologies in 2016[3], used for generating raw waveform sounds. It uses dilated convolutional filters that allow it to process longer and more complex time-domain signals than standard CNNs. At its core, WaveNet consists of a stack of causal dilated convolutional layers followed by a recurrent unit that generates the final output signal by combining the intermediate representations obtained at each layer.

However, while WaveNet is capable of generating high-quality speech samples, its ability to handle musical notes and chords is limited due to its linear temporal structure. To address this issue, MuseGAN [4] proposed a hybrid approach that combines GAN-based synthesis and WaveNet models to generate novel and diverse music. Instead of directly feeding WaveNet a discrete sequence of pitch values, MuseGAN treats music as a continuous vector space and applies a mapping function to convert the input into a low-dimensional latent representation that can then be fed into WaveNet. The result is a sample of music that looks and sounds similar to the input, but contains newly generated content within the same semantic context. MuseGAN is shown below:


Another popular application of GAN-based music synthesis is by implementing Style Transfer over music tracks using AdaIN[5] or PixelDA[6]. Both methods use a generative model to generate novel images or videos from source ones, but instead of converting entire tracks into stylized versions, they focus on modifying individual instrument tracks or specific regions of them, making them unique objects. Examples of these techniques are displayed below:


### 2.2.2.GAN-based VAE生成器网络
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is another type of GAN-based music synthesis technique that allows users to generate new music sequences with varying levels of complexity. VAEs represent the likelihood of observing some observed data point x as a probability density function (pdf) parameterized by a set of variables Θ = {μ, log σ²}. When presented with a randomly sampled value z, the corresponding reconstructed value y can be computed using Bayes' rule. By minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the pdf of x and the approximation of the pdf of y, the VAE learns to encode the latent space of high-dimensional input data into a smaller dimensional latent variable space that captures most of the relevant information in the dataset. The decoder part of the VAE takes this latent code as input and maps it back into the original dimensionality.

There are many types of VAEs available, including regular VAEs, Conditionally-generated Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), Denoising Variational Autoencoder (DVAE), and Attention-guided Variational Autoencoder (AGVAE). CVAEs incorporate the condition c into the variational loss calculation, allowing them to control the degree of variation in the generated output. DVAEs add stochastic noise to the input during training, reducing mode collapse and improving the robustness of the model. AGVAEs integrate attention mechanisms into the model to focus on important parts of the input when generating the output, leading to improved interpretability and long-term controllability.

Some prominent applications of VAE-based music synthesis include Style Transfer, Sequential Generation, and Latent Space Interpolation. Style Transfer involves applying the learned transformation matrix to the latent vectors of the target song, resulting in a new version of the track with similar texture and color scheme. Sequential Generation involves generating successive samples conditioned on previous samples, enabling non-stop improvisation and exploration of the latent space. Lastly, Latent Space Interpolation involves interpolating between two points in the latent space, obtaining a mix of both styles while retaining the shared latent factors. For instance, interpolation between two arbitrary music samples can lead to a composition that seems neither too original nor repetitive.
