Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of artificial intelligence that enables an agent to learn by interacting with its environment and making decisions based on the learned information [1]. However, when we deal with graph structured data like social networks or knowledge graphs, existing RL algorithms cannot effectively solve this problem since they are designed for handling sequential decision-making problems, which do not capture the rich relationship between nodes in real world scenarios such as multi-relational networks [2], complex relational dependencies [3] or uncertain relationships among entities [4]. Thus, there is a need for new reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle these complex relationships within the context of graph structure data. To overcome this challenge, several works have been proposed using structural correlation analysis techniques that help analyze and discover latent relationships between graph vertices [5],[6],[7].[8],[9]. In particular, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which has become one of the most popular topic modeling methods for text analysis [10], has also been applied to graph structured data via its natural language processing nature [11],[12]. Similarly, more recent works use graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) and their variants for solving graph structured data classification tasks [13],[14]. 

However, applying LDA and GCNs to graph structured data directly may lead to undesirable results because it involves treating each vertex independently without taking into account their connections and interrelations. Moreover, LDA assumes the assumption of multinomial distribution of word frequencies across all topics, which may be inappropriate if the underlying graph structure features both categorical and continuous attributes [15]. On the other hand, the requirements of longitudinal sequence data make it difficult to apply deep learning models like CNNs to graph structured data directly due to its high dimensionality and complexity.

In this work, we propose a novel algorithm called SCANRAL that combines the advantages of structural correlation analysis techniques while being able to address some of the challenges of handling graph structured data. Specifically, our method incorporates node connectivity through the definition of region proximity and uses structural similarity metrics to measure the significance of pairwise interactions among nodes to determine the importance of links between them. We then train a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model with the learned link weights and estimate its optimal policy. Finally, we evaluate our approach through experiments conducted on real-world datasets, including synthetic and empirical ones. Our experiments show that SCANRAL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly in terms of link prediction accuracy while maintaining good scalability.

Overall, our contribution lies in addressing the fundamental limitations of traditional machine learning approaches for analyzing and understanding graph structured data by combining the strengths of statistical correlation analysis with reinforcement learning principles. By leveraging prior domain knowledge and carefully designing heuristics to select informative subgraphs, our framework provides a powerful tool for reasoning about and extracting valuable insights from large-scale real-world systems.

## 2.1 Structural Correlation Analysis (SCA)
Structural correlation analysis is a technique used to study the interdependence among variables in high-dimensional data. It focuses on identifying groups of highly correlated variables or pairs of related variables that exhibit similar behavior patterns [16]. The key idea behind SCA is to calculate the degree of dependence between two variables as a function of the mutual dependence between corresponding sets of variables [17]. Commonly used SCA measures include Pearson's r coefficient and partial least squares regression (PLS-regression). Both of these measures represent the strength and direction of linear dependency between two variables, but they only provide limited information about nonlinear relationships. Therefore, in order to identify non-linear relationships, additional measures are required, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial Least Squares path (PLSP) [18][19].

Our method builds upon these ideas and applies SCA to analyze and discover latent relationships between graph vertices. We start by defining the concept of "region" based on vertex connectivity. A region is defined as a set of connected vertices that share at least one edge. Given a graph $G$, let $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^n$ denote the collection of regions of $G$. Each region can be represented by a vector of size $d$ where $d$ is the number of features representing each node in the graph. For example, if the nodes correspond to webpages and edges indicate hyperlink relationships between them, then each feature could represent the page rank score, number of incoming links, or any other relevant attribute.

Next, we define the concept of "region proximity". Let $a(v)$ and $b(u)$ denote the average values of the features associated with vertices $v$ and $u$, respectively, among the connected components of $v$. The region proximity between regions $a$ and $b$ is given by:

$$prox_{reg}(a, b) = \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{v \in V} [\min_{u \in N_c(v)} (\alpha a(v) + (1-\alpha)(b(u))) - a(v)]^2,$$

where $N_c(v)$ represents the set of neighbors of $v$ that belong to the same connected component, $\alpha$ is a tradeoff parameter between average distance and maximal proximity, and $V$ is the set of vertices in $a$. This formula measures the minimum squared difference between the mean feature value of each neighbor and the actual feature value of $v$, weighted by the amount of time that passes before reaching the neighbor. If $\alpha$ is close to zero, then we assign equal weight to all neighboring distances, whereas if $\alpha$ is close to one, we consider only the closest neighbor. When $\alpha$ is equal to half, the region proximity captures both direct and indirect relationships between vertices.

Finally, we compute the structural similarity between two regions $a$ and $b$ based on their respective region proximities and shortest paths. Formally, the structural similarity between regions $a$ and $b$ is given by:

$$sim_{str}(a, b) = \frac{\max_{v \in V} dist_{p}(v, v') sim_{prox}(a, b)}}{|V|},$$

where $dist_{p}$ is the length of the shortest path connecting $v$ and $v'$, computed using a specified metric, and $sim_{prox}$ is the similarity between the region proximities of $a$ and $b$. Intuitively, a higher structural similarity indicates that the two regions are more likely to have been generated by the same process and reflect stronger interdependence than random noise.

We now describe how our algorithm integrates SCA and reinforcement learning principles. First, we precompute the pairwise structural similarities between all possible combinations of regions of different sizes in the input graph. These similarities are stored in a matrix of size $(k+1)^2$, where $k$ is the maximum degree of regions considered during training. Second, we build a Markov decision process (MDP) model whose states correspond to different configurations of selected regions, actions specify whether to add/remove a single vertex to/from a specific region, and rewards determine the quality of each configuration according to the cumulative reward obtained after following an optimal policy. The MDP model includes a transition probability matrix that specifies the likelihood of selecting a particular action given a particular state, and a discount factor controls the balance between immediate and future rewards. Third, we train the MDP model using REINFORCE algorithm with stochastic gradient descent updates to find an optimal policy. Fourth, we evaluate the trained policy on held-out test instances and report the performance statistics. Overall, our approach demonstrates effective exploration of the search space and generalization capabilities of the learned policies, especially in the presence of sparsely labeled data.

## 2.2 Markov Decision Process Model (MDP)
The Markov decision process (MDP) is a formal mathematical model used to describe dynamic processes that involve uncertainty and interact with the outside world [20]. The main components of an MDP model are the agent's state ($S$), the action taken ($A$) and the state resulting from the action ($S'$), the reward received ($R$) and the dynamics of the system ($T$). The agent starts in a particular initial state $s_0$, takes an action $a_t$ at time step $t$, receives a reward $r_{t+1}$, transitions to a new state $s_{t+1}$, and continues iterating until the end of the episode. We assume that the transitions are deterministic, meaning that $s_{t+1} = T(s_t, a_t)$, and independent of previous outcomes. Additionally, we assume that the next state does not affect the current reward signal, which helps simplify the problem and avoid infinite loops.

## 2.3 Optimal Policy
Given the MDP model, the optimal policy is the strategy adopted by the agent to take actions in each state in order to maximize the expected cumulative reward. Mathematically, the optimal policy satisfies the Bellman equation:

$$Q^{*}(s_t, a_t) = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} +... = \underset{a}{\mathrm{argmax}} \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \gamma Q^{*}(T(s_t, a_t),.)] $$

The term inside the expectation sign is called the temporal-difference error, which measures the discrepancy between the actual observed rewards and those predicted by the estimated Q-values under the optimal policy. We update the Q-value estimates at each time step using the standard temporal-difference equation:

$$Q^{(t+1)}(s_t, a_t) = Q^{(t)}(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \big[ R_{t+1} + \gamma Q^{*} \big( T(s_t, a_t),. \big) - Q^{(t)}(s_t, a_t)\big].$$

The parameter $\alpha$ determines the speed of learning, and should be chosen small enough so that changes to the Q-function dominate changes to the policy parameters. One common choice is $\alpha=\frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of steps in the episode. Finally, we implement the REINFORCE algorithm to optimize the policy parameters using gradient descent updates.
