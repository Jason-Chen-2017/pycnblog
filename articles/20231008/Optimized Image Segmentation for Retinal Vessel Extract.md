# 1.背景介绍


Retinal vascular segmentation is one of the most important computer vision tasks that have emerged over recent years due to its wide range applications in medical imaging and autonomous driving. However, it remains a challenging task as different algorithms are developed with different efficiency, accuracy, and speed depending on various factors such as image complexity, resolution, and number of vessels present in the input image. In this article, we will discuss the optimized algorithm for retinal vascular extraction from fundus images using deep learning models and compare its performance with other existing methods like thresholding and clustering-based approaches. Moreover, we will also talk about our research work related to improving these methods further by incorporating contextual information, multi-scale feature representation, and attention mechanism into our proposed model.

We can divide the problem of retinal vascular segmentation into two parts: (i) finding the pixels belonging to the vessel region and (ii) identifying their boundaries accurately. The former involves classifying each pixel into foreground or background while the latter means correctly locating all the boundaries of the regions. Therefore, we need an efficient way to detect both these components efficiently without any false positives and negatives. We use U-Net architecture as our base network which takes an input fundus image and outputs the probability map indicating the presence of vessels at every pixel location. Here's how the entire process works:

1. Input image - Fundus image of eye lens obtained through x-ray or computed tomography techniques.

2. Preprocessing - Apply filters, noise reduction techniques, etc., to remove irrelevant information from the image and enhance the contrast between blood vessels and surrounding tissues. 

3. Feature extraction - Extract features from preprocessed image using convolutional neural networks such as ResNet-50, ResNet-101, or EfficientNet-B7. These features capture spatial relationships, semantic meaning, and global patterns of the input image.

4. U-Net Network - This is our proposed methodology. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure where a contracting path proceeds downward from high-level features to lower-level features, followed by a bottleneck layer, and finally a expanding path that connects back to higher level representations. The output is a binary mask containing only the pixels that belong to the retinal vascular region. 

In order to locate the boundaries of the regions, we first binarize the probability maps generated by the previous step based on a user-defined threshold value. Then, we apply morphological operations such as dilation and erosion to connect adjacent pixels that share similar values along the boundary of interest. Finally, we remove small unconnected objects by applying connected component analysis.

Our approach has several advantages compared to traditional methods like thresholding and clustering-based approaches. Firstly, it provides clearer results than naive thresholding because it uses a probabilistic prediction rather than a simple binary decision. Secondly, it eliminates multiple instances of the same object that may be detected erroneously due to low thresholding value or imperfect foreground/background classification. Thirdly, it effectively segments the borders of the individual vessels providing better clarity and more accurate shape description. Finally, it enables us to handle large volumes of data quickly and requires much less computational resources compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

However, there are still limitations to our approach. One major challenge lies in the quality of training dataset required to train the model. Current datasets used for training include manually annotated segmented images or synthetic ones generated using techniques like CT simulation, but they are not perfect in terms of resolution, amount of vessels present, variability, etc. Another limitation is that it does not perform well when the texture, color, and opacity of the underlying retina deviate significantly from standard optic axis forms. For example, if the skin or corneal epithelium around the eye lens presents distinct characteristics from those found inside the cornea itself, then the current approach may fail to produce satisfactory results. Additionally, since it relies on manual annotations, it cannot generalize well to new images or environments where these annotations are unavailable. Therefore, future improvements must focus on enhancing the dataset availability and reliability, developing robust and adaptive models, exploring novel ways of combining visual and geometric information, and designing interpretable and explainable architectures.
