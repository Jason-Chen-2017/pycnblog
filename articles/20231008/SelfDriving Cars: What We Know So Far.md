# 1.背景介绍


In February of this year, Tesla Inc. announced that they were developing a prototype self-driving car. The company plans to launch the product in April of 2019 and has already invested millions into its development process. 

Self-driving cars are increasingly popular due to their advantages over human drivers, such as safety, speed, and convenience. They also offer many benefits like reduced fuel consumption, reduced accidents, and lower operating costs than traditional cars. Despite these benefits, there is still much work ahead for companies trying to develop self-driving cars.

The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the technical capabilities and challenges faced by companies in the field of self-driving cars, with a focus on advanced algorithms used in autonomous vehicles. It will cover topics such as sensor fusion, perception, localization, planning, control, navigation, and decision making. I will include code examples demonstrating how each component can be implemented in various programming languages and frameworks. Finally, I will discuss some of the key limitations and future potential issues facing the industry.

# 2.Core Concepts & Relationships
There are several core concepts related to self-driving cars that we need to understand before diving deeper into more detailed analysis. These include:

1. Sensor Fusion: This involves combining information from multiple sensors, including cameras, lidar, radar, GPS, etc., to create accurate representations of the environment around the vehicle. This data helps improve performance by taking into account factors such as traffic conditions, weather, and other obstacles.

2. Perception: This refers to the ability of a self-driving system to recognize objects, faces, and lanes in the real world. This includes processing image data to identify relevant features such as edges, corners, lines, and shapes, then matching them against models created using computer graphics techniques or learned through machine learning methods.

3. Localization: This refers to determining the current position and orientation of the vehicle within the surrounding environment. This involves predicting the trajectory of the vehicle based on past data, which enables it to make decisions about where to go next.

4. Planning: This involves creating a route for the vehicle to follow given a destination and a set of constraints. This may involve analyzing available roads, intersections, and nearby obstructions, then selecting a path that minimizes time and distance traveled.

5. Control: This involves controlling the motion of the vehicle to reach a target location while avoiding collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians, and any obstructions that come in its way. This requires both longitudinal (steering) and lateral (acceleration/braking) controls, all of which are optimized using feedback loops and trained through reinforcement learning algorithms.

6. Navigation: This involves guiding the vehicle through complex urban environments without getting stuck or running into obstacles. This involves integrating driving strategies, such as streets congestion, intersection control, lane following, and parking, along with optimal paths computed through graph search algorithms.

7. Decision Making: Once the vehicle reaches its final goal, the decision making module needs to take action to prevent crashes, maintain safe operation, increase efficiency, and ensure compliance with regulations. This includes ensuring proper lane keeping, staying in lane, maintaining traffic flow, handling unexpected events, and anticipating emergency situations.

These components interact closely together in different ways, depending on the specific use case and desired functionality. For example, during daytime hours, the self-driving car might rely heavily on camera inputs and localize itself precisely using ultrasonic sensors. During the night, it might rely heavily on lidar input and plan a course toward darkness. In urban areas, the self-driving car might prioritize navigational tasks such as street level parking or curbing speed. When confronted with tight traffic volumes or construction sites, it might prioritize comfortable speeds. Overall, these relationships help inform the design of robust and intelligent self-driving systems that function efficiently under various circumstances.

# 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Details
Now let's get into the details of the individual components mentioned earlier, starting with sensor fusion.
## Sensor Fusion
Sensor fusion is essential for achieving high accuracy when working with self-driving cars. Sensors typically produce separate but complementary measurements, so we often combine them to reduce errors and improve our estimates. Here's a simple explanation of how sensor fusion works:

First, we gather data from multiple sources. For instance, we may have LiDAR scans that measure distances at every point in space, alongside images captured by front-facing cameras and depth maps generated by stereo vision. We also might have GPS coordinates and velocity readings from our odometer. Next, we perform filtering and noise reduction on each measurement type to remove outliers and extract reliable signals. 

Next, we align the measurements relative to the vehicle's pose, i.e. what direction the front wheels are pointing, where the center of mass is located, and what direction the vehicle is traveling. To do this, we estimate the rotation between the two coordinate frames using RANSAC, which finds the best alignment among a set of candidate rotations. We then shift the measurements into a common frame that takes into account gravity and magnetism. Finally, we fuse the aligned measurements into a single representation, which gives us a higher-level understanding of the environment.

For example, if we have overlapping LiDAR points, we'll know that those points correspond to the same object in the real world, even though we don't necessarily see them together in one scan. By aligning the measurements in a consistent manner, we can better interpret the relationship between objects in the scene and the surrounding environment. Similarly, if we've collected data from multiple cameras and taken into account viewpoint and lighting variations, we can build a comprehensive model of the surroundings that reflects reality as accurately as possible.

## Perception
Perception involves extracting meaningful information from raw sensor data. As mentioned above, we use vision and range sensors to obtain images and ranges of objects in the environment, respectively. To solve this problem, we need powerful deep neural networks and effective feature detection techniques.

Once we've extracted features, we can match them against templates or known models. Template matching involves comparing image regions against pre-defined templates, while model-based recognition involves training machine learning models to classify new instances based on labeled data. Both approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but template matching is faster and easier to implement, whereas model-based recognition offers greater flexibility and adaptability. Model-based recognition systems often require large amounts of annotated data to train and generalize well, however.

Another important aspect of perception is **object segmentation**, which involves breaking down larger objects into smaller parts and assigning them labels. Object segmentation is especially useful for identifying and tracking small moving objects, such as pedestrians or bicycles, since they cannot always be tracked directly by their bounding boxes. Common object segmentation architectures include fully convolutional networks (FCNs), convolutional autoencoders (CAEs), and multi-scale object detectors (MSOD).

Finally, perception must handle variations in lighting, viewpoints, occlusions, and scale to achieve good results. One approach is to apply geometric transformations, such as scaling, rotation, and skewing, to the images and sensor readings to generate virtual views that resemble the actual world. Another technique is to use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn to synthesize novel realistic synthetic scenes that mimic the distribution of natural scenes. However, GANs suffer from extreme GPU requirements and limited scalability for practical deployment in real-world scenarios. Therefore, simpler, task-specific methods tend to perform better in practice.
