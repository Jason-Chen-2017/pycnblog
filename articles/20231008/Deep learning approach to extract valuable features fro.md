# 1.背景介绍


Text classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in natural language processing (NLP). It involves categorizing a document into one or more predefined categories based on its content. The goal of text classification is to automatically assign labels or categories to unlabeled documents. Text classification has been an active research area for decades and many advanced techniques have emerged such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this article, we will focus on two state-of-the-art models used for text classification - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - using both shallow and deep architectures with different performance metrics. We also discuss how these models can be combined together using meta-learning methods like transfer learning and stacking algorithms to achieve better results than any individual model alone. 

In recent years, the use of deep learning techniques for various NLP tasks has become increasingly popular due to their high accuracy, ability to handle large amounts of data efficiently, and effectiveness in handling noisy data. However, it requires expertise in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and statistics to effectively utilize these models. In our opinion, knowledge of deep learning techniques and techniques for natural language processing are critical to building reliable systems that perform well in today's rapidly evolving natural language environment.

# 2.核心概念与联系
To understand why deep learning models work so well for text classification tasks, let’s first define some core concepts: 

1. Feature extraction: This process involves converting raw text into numerical representations such as word embeddings, which capture semantic relationships between words within a sentence or a document. These features help to identify important patterns and distinguish between similar classes of texts.

2. Classification layer: After extracting features from the input text, a classifier applies a softmax function to convert the feature vectors into probabilities corresponding to each class label. This probability score determines whether a given instance belongs to that particular class or not. A multi-class classification problem can involve multiple classifiers working together to produce final predictions.

3. Loss function: A loss function measures the difference between predicted values and actual values during training. The objective of training is to minimize the loss function over time by adjusting the weights of the network parameters through backpropagation. There are several standard loss functions such as cross-entropy, hinge loss, KL divergence etc., depending upon the type of task at hand.

4. Gradient Descent: During training, the weight parameters of the network are adjusted by computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to those parameters using backpropagation algorithm. This gradient information helps to update the weights of the network in the direction that minimizes the loss function.

5. Hyperparameters: Hyperparameters are constants that determine the architecture and behavior of the neural network. They include learning rate, batch size, regularization parameter, number of layers, activation function, optimizer, dropout rate, etc., and need to be tuned based on the specific dataset, hardware constraints, and complexity of the problem.

Based on the above definitions, we can now explain how CNNs and RNNs work for text classification.

## Introduction to CNNs for Text Classification
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used for image recognition purposes. A typical CNN consists of an input layer, followed by multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Each convolutional layer learns filters that scan the input space for relevant patterns and activate neurons that represent them. The resulting outputs from all these layers are then passed through pooling layers where redundant information is removed and spatial information is compressed. Finally, the output is fed into a fully connected layer to make the prediction. For text classification, we can consider each token or word in the input text as a separate channel in the input tensor, thus creating a multi-channel input tensor. 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of a typical CNN architecture for text classification:

1. Input Layer: The input layer takes the multi-channel input tensor containing tokens/words of length L and generates an L x D dimensional output vector, where L is the maximum sequence length allowed and D is the embedding dimension. Typically, D=300 and this value can be increased or decreased based on the available computational resources and corpus size.

2. Convolutional Layers: The next set of convolutional layers typically consist of multiple filters with fixed filter sizes FxF, stride SxS, padding Pp, and non-linearity functions such as relu or sigmoid. Filter depth d is usually set to D as mentioned earlier. We repeat this block of layers for n times, where n is chosen according to the size and complexity of the vocabulary. 

3. Pooling Layers: Next, we apply pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the output tensors generated by the previous convolutional blocks. The most commonly used pooling operation is max pooling which selects the maximum value from a window of pre-defined size.

4. Dropout Layer: To prevent overfitting, we add a dropout layer after every dense layer except the last one, which produces the final predictions. Dropout randomly drops out a percentage of nodes during training to avoid co-adaptation of neurons and thereby improve generalization.

5. Output Layer: The output layer contains linear units with softmax activation function that predict the probability distribution across all possible class labels.

As mentioned earlier, filtering and transformation of the inputs create local dependencies within the input domain, allowing the model to learn rich contextual information about the input sequence. This makes CNNs particularly effective for modeling structured sequences such as sentences or paragraphs.


## Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence Classifier
The main idea behind applying CNNs for text classification is to extract meaningful features from the input text and pass them through multiple convolutional layers to capture the relationships between different parts of the sentence. Here's how it works:

1. Preprocess the data: First, we tokenize the input text to generate a list of words. Then, we build a vocabulary dictionary consisting of unique words encountered in the corpus along with their respective indices. We embed each word in the input text using its respective index from the vocabulary dictionary.

2. Build the model: We initialize the weights and biases of the model according to the specifications provided in the paper. We train the model on a labeled dataset of text samples belonging to either positive or negative sentiment category.

3. Train the model: Given the trained model, we preprocess new test data that needs to be classified. We embed each word in the input text using its respective index from the vocabulary dictionary obtained while preprocessing the original training data. We pass the embedded representation through the convolutional layers, obtaining an output tensor. We feed this output tensor to a fully connected layer followed by a softmax function to obtain the probability distribution across all possible class labels. Based on this probabilistic output, we classify the input text as positive or negative sentiment category.

Let's take a look at the code implementation of a simple CNN model for sentence classification:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, padding="same",
                 activation="relu", input_shape=(MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH, EMBEDDING_DIM)))
model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))
model.add(Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, padding="same", activation="relu"))
model.add(GlobalMaxPooling1D())
model.add(Dense(units=128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(rate=0.5))
model.add(Dense(units=NUM_CLASSES, activation='softmax'))

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.001)
loss = 'categorical_crossentropy'
metrics = ['accuracy']

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=metrics)
model.summary()
```

We start by importing TensorFlow and Keras libraries. We define a sequential model object using the Sequential API. We specify the number of filters, kernel size, activation function, and other hyperparameters for the convolutional and dense layers. We compile the model using Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy metric.

After defining the model structure, we fit the model to a labeled dataset of text samples using the `fit()` method. When calling the `fit()` method, we specify the number of epochs and batch size, and provide the training data and target labels. If you don't want to split your data into training and validation sets, you can directly call the `train_on_batch()` method instead of `fit()`.
