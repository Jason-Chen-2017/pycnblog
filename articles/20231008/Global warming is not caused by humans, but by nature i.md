## What is global warming? 
Global warming refers to the increase in the average temperature of Earth's surface over time. It has become one of the main concerns of our planet as it affects people’s daily activities and climate change has become a global challenge for humanity. According to IPCC reports, global warming can be divded into two parts: direct warming or net radiative forcing (NFR), which results from human-made changes in the atmosphere, and indirect effects such as ozone depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, land use changes and anthropogenic aerosol production.

In recent years, scientists have observed dramatic changes in Earth’s global temperature records. However, some explanations are still controversial including the lack of understanding of how global warming occurs under the surface layer, the origin of thermostats, and other factors that could cause long-term cooling trends. Despite these challenges, efforts are being made to understand the complex interactions between the natural system, its drivers and mechanisms, and the human impact on climate. 

The four key questions asked by scientists who want to better understand the causes of global warming include:

1. How does human activity affect the climate system?
2. What factors determine the strength and duration of the Near-Surface Air Mass (NSAM)?
3. How do different types of vegetation respond to increased air masses due to global warming?
4. Can we predict future climate change based on current trends and past events? 

Based on their research findings, they came up with several hypotheses that support various viewpoints on why global warming occurs. Some prominent experts like <NAME>, Sir <NAME> Jr., and Weizmann Institute for Geophysics explained that global warming is a result of increasing energy imbalance between the planetary interior and the atmosphere due to urbanization, energy consumption, and industrialization. Other experts pointed out that it could also be linked to anthropogenic climate change caused by renewable energy sources like wind and solar power generation, deforestation, and pollution. Additionally, they suggested that current policies and institutional arrangements could influence global warming, making it harder for societies to adapt to environmentally responsible practices.

## The concept and connection between global warming and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels
Climate change and CO2 levels are closely interconnected because both lead to an increase in the rate of atmospheric carbon uptake. Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration lead to more ultraviolet light absorption, resulting in increases in nighttime cloud formation and lower temperatures. This leads to more frequent extreme heatwaves, droughts, floods, fires, storm surges, and sea level rise. Conversely, reductions in atmospheric CO2 concentrations reduce the amount of energy needed to generate new oxygen, leading to higher population density and economic growth rates.

As a consequence, an increase in atmospheric CO2 levels can ultimately lead to global warming if there is no effective regulation or management of the release of carbon dioxide. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations are often referred to as "carbon tax" laws, where governments set prices for burning fossil fuel for reducing CO2 levels. Another option is to invest in clean energy projects to offset the increased demand for fossil fuel and mitigate the damage from the warmer temperatures caused by increased CO2 levels.

Another important aspect of the relationship between CO2 levels and global warming is its impact on ecosystems. Human activities such as agriculture, forestry, and tourism contribute significantly to carbon sequestration in the ecosystem through the production of garbage, animal waste, and dead plants. These wastes accumulate in areas around cities, which result in rising CO2 levels within short distances. This effect becomes even stronger during the summer months when people collectively take more trips across multiple countries. As a consequence, this leads to diminishing biodiversity and reliance on fossil fuel for transportation, food, and energy needs, leading to further increases in global warming.

Overall, many scientific studies suggest that both human activities and climate systems are directly responsible for causing global warming, particularly if not properly managed. Future research should focus on identifying specific mechanisms linking human actions to global warming and developing effective strategies for managing them.
