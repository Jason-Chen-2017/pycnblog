# 1.背景介绍


In modern communication systems, an email is a piece of information that can be exchanged between two or more people over a network. It usually consists of various components such as subject line, body text, attachments, etc., which provide important contextual information about the message for its recipients. However, there exist certain risks associated with the use of emails: security vulnerabilities, spamming, viruses, and other malware attacks. To address these challenges, enterprises are adopting different strategies to protect their sensitive data and reduce risk. One such strategy is encryption and decryption of emails before they reach their intended recipient. 

However, email encryption involves additional processing time and resources required by the client-server architecture of the SMTP protocol. This makes it difficult to scale up email encryption processes in large-scale organizations. As a result, we need efficient ways to offload encryption workloads to cloud platforms. In this blog article, I will discuss one way of achieving this using AWS S3 and KMS (Key Management Service). 

This approach leverages AWS's distributed storage infrastructure and key management service to securely store encrypted emails on Amazon S3 buckets, while ensuring control and visibility over access to those files. The user-friendly interface provided by AWS KMS allows us to easily manage keys and access policies, including fine-grained controls on who has access to what keys. With the help of S3 event notifications, our Lambda function can detect new objects being uploaded into the bucket and encrypt them using the specified KMS key. Finally, we can retrieve the encrypted emails through standard S3 API calls, just like any other file stored in S3. 

Overall, by combining AWS services such as S3, KMS, and Lambda functions, we can achieve scalable and secure email encryption solutions without increasing operational complexity or sacrificing performance.

## S3 - Simple Storage Service (Amazon Web Services)
S3 is a highly available, durable, and low-cost object storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). S3 offers reliable and fast data transfer speeds, seamless integration with AWS computing services, and supports multiple programming languages and frameworks. Each object in S3 is assigned a unique identifier known as a key, which is used to retrieve and modify individual objects. Objects are replicated across multiple availability zones within a region to ensure high availability and data resiliency. Additionally, S3 provides cost-effective storage capacity pricing based on storage utilization, request frequency, and data retrieval duration.

## KMS - Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services)
KMS is a managed encryption service provided by AWS. It enables you to create and control symmetric and asymmetric encryption keys used to encrypt and decrypt data securely. Each key has a unique key ID that is used to identify and manage permissions for each key. By default, all encryption operations performed using KMS are secured by FIPS standards.

## Lambda - Serverless Computing (Amazon Web Services)
Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by AWS. It allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers, reducing costs and complexity while also enabling agility. Using Lambda, developers can write code that listens for events occurring within AWS and automatically triggers a specific function to execute when those events happen. Lambdas support multiple programming languages and runtimes such as Node.js, Java, Python, and Ruby. Developers have the option to pay only for the amount of compute time consumed by their lambda functions and get billed only for actual usage, providing great flexibility in terms of scaling up or down based on demand.


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
  Our approach uses three main steps to implement email encryption at scale:
  1. Store encrypted emails on S3 Buckets: First, we store the unencrypted emails as plaintext on S3 buckets. These unencrypted emails remain accessible to anyone who knows the corresponding object key.
  
  2. Encrypt Emails on Demand using AWS Lambda: We trigger a Lambda function whenever a new object is added to the S3 bucket. The Lambda function then reads the plaintext content of the object and encrypts it using a specified KMS key. The encrypted content is then saved back to the same bucket under the same key, replacing the original unencrypted content.
  
  3. Control Access to Encryption Keys using AWS KMS: To prevent unauthorized users from accessing or modifying the encryption keys, we apply fine-grained IAM access policies to each KMS key used for encryption. These policies restrict access to only authorized IAM roles and principals.
  
  The above three steps combine to form a fully functional end-to-end solution that guarantees secure and private storage and transport of sensitive data over the internet.
