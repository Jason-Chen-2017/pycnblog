# 1.背景介绍


Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a task of answering natural language questions about images using multimodal representations such as text, audio or video. In this paper we propose the first neural network model that uses attention mechanism to jointly reason over both visual information and textual question representation. We show how our proposed framework can be trained end-to-end by maximizing the similarity between the predicted answers and ground truth labels through backpropagation. The experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our work also opens up new possibilities for applying neuro-symbolic models to tasks that require cross-modal interactions between image and language.

This article is an extended version of the original CVPR'17 paper "Attention Is All You Need" which was published earlier than its later follow-up NIPS'17 paper with similar objectives but different architecture details. The aim here is to provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of our recent research contributions towards building better VQA models using attention mechanisms over multimodal data. 

In addition to providing high-level technical insights into our approach, the hope is to foster discussion and collaboration among AI researchers in the field of visual question answering and multimodal learning. This should lead to improved solutions and enable more practical applications of these models in real world scenarios. It will also inspire further exploration and development of advanced techniques such as neural belief tracking, deep reinforcement learning, and probabilistic graphical modeling.

Finally, it's worth noting that there are many ways to extend and improve upon our existing work - some of which may become future directions in this area. However, the key theme of this article remains: exploring attention mechanisms for integrating knowledge from multiple modalities and effectively solving complex vision and language problems. With the advent of efficient hardware platforms, we anticipate significant improvements in performance and scalability with increasing dataset sizes and complexity levels. Thus, I believe this article would be valuable for both practitioners and researchers alike who are interested in developing more effective and accurate VQA systems using neuro-symbolic approaches.

# 2.Core Concepts & Relationship
Before diving straight into the details of our proposed approach, let’s understand some basic concepts and their relationships:

1. Vision: Images are one of the most common input modality used for VQA models. Although they are difficult to represent as vectors due to their large size, modern computer vision algorithms have made significant progress in capturing fine-grained features from them. There are various types of convolutional networks like ResNet, VGG, GoogLeNet etc., used to extract feature maps from raw images. These feature maps capture discriminative spatial patterns like edges, shapes, textures etc., which can be used for downstream tasks like classification or detection. 

2. Text: Text is another important input modality for VQA models. It represents the natural language questions as sequences of words and sentences. Language models have been used to encode the semantics of text sequences to produce fixed length vector embeddings. Common embedding methods include word embeddings, character embeddings, and hybrid embeddings based on convolutional and recurrent layers. Text embeddings can help the VQA model learn abstracted representations of questions which can then be compared against the learned feature maps of the corresponding images.

3. Attention Mechanism: An attention mechanism captures the relationship between the query and the set of candidates at hand, allowing the system to focus on relevant parts of the inputs without being hindered by irrelevant ones. It has been extensively applied across numerous areas including natural language processing, speech recognition and machine translation. For instance, self-attention layers were introduced recently in Recurrent Neural Network models to capture long term dependencies between elements of sequence. Similarly, attention mechanisms can be used to combine the feature maps extracted from the images alongside the textual question encodings to predict the correct answer. A variety of attention mechanisms exist including content-based, location-based, and memory-based mechanisms.

4. Sequence-to-Sequence Models: One popular type of neural network architectures used for VQA is the encoder-decoder architecture known as sequence-to-sequence models. These models use a bidirectional LSTM encoder to process the input sequence and generate hidden states which are passed on to a decoder LSTM that produces output symbols one at a time. The final output is usually mapped to a softmax distribution over candidate answers. Many variations of sequence-to-sequence models like CNN-RNN, Hierarchical Seq2Seq, Attention-Based Seq2Seq etc., have been developed to incorporate additional contextual information beyond simple textual input.


Our Proposed Approach:

Our proposed method uses a combination of multi-head attention mechanisms over the input modality pair (image and text), followed by feedforward neural networks to perform regression or classification depending on the task. Specifically, the approach consists of four main components:

1. Image Encoder: The image encoder takes raw images as input and produces low dimensional feature vectors. Currently, two types of image encoders are commonly used - ResNet and MobileNet. Both of these networks operate by performing successive convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers at the end to obtain feature maps. Each feature map is flattened and fed onto a separate transformer layer to extract global and local features respectively. Finally, a global averaging operation is performed over all the feature maps to obtain a single vector encoding of each image.

2. Text Encoder: The text encoder processes the textual questions by encoding them into vectors using pre-trained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, or ALBERT. Pre-training involves training a large corpus of texts on a specific language modeling objective like next sentence prediction, masked language modeling, or sentence-order prediction. Once the model is trained, it can be fine-tuned on the specific VQA dataset to optimize the parameters for achieving good performance on downstream tasks. During inference time, the encoded text vectors are provided as input to the subsequent layers of the model.

3. Multi-Head Attention: The multi-head attention module leverages the ability of the human brain to pay attention to different parts of the visual scene or the text while processing information. It works by computing linear transformations of the input embeddings followed by dot products between transformed vectors. Multiple heads are computed at different positions within the same dimensionality space and combined together to give a unified result. Here, we compute attention scores between the text and image encodings and apply them to align the representations. Then, we concatenate the aligned representations and pass them through several feedforward neural networks to produce the final predictions.

4. Output Layer: Based on the nature of the problem, either a regression or classification head is added after the multi-head attention module to convert the final output into the desired format. Regression outputs typically involve predicting a continuous value, while classification outputs can be binary or categorical. For example, if the task is asking for a yes/no answer, the output layer can be a sigmoid function that assigns probability of positive label to any non-zero output. If the output needs to be classified into predefined classes, a softmax activation function can be used to assign probabilities to each possible class.

Overall, our proposed framework builds upon the strengths of attention mechanisms and employs novel techniques for jointly reasoning over multimodal data to solve the visual question answering task. By combining the strengths of both modalities and exploiting the unique properties of images and text, our framework enables us to build powerful and reliable models capable of addressing challenging visual question answering tasks at scale.
