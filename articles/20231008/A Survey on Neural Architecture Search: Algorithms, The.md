# 1.背景介绍


Neural architecture search (NAS) has been a hot research topic in the past few years due to its potential to significantly reduce the computational cost of deep neural networks by finding suitable network architectures that outperform randomly initialized ones. Traditional NAS algorithms mainly focus on searching for the best model structure while ignoring other aspects such as hyperparameters, i.e., how many layers should be used or which activation functions to use. However, it is well known that better performance can also be achieved through an optimized combination of both structure and hyperparameters, making this field more promising than ever before. In addition, there are several recent works proposing hybrid NAS techniques that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives, including topology and hyperparameter tuning. The success of these approaches motivates further exploration into new directions that incorporate learning-based optimization and reinforcement learning, among others. Nevertheless, despite their significant impacts, NAS remains a challenging task due to its combinatorial nature and the need for careful design of search spaces and evaluation metrics. This survey aims at providing an overview of the current state-of-the-art NAS research with a focus on the most commonly used methods and discussing future trends and challenges.

## 2.1 Neural Network
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly popular in various applications ranging from image classification to natural language processing. Despite their successful training, DNNs still suffer from two main drawbacks: they have high computational costs and they require large amounts of data to achieve satisfactory accuracy. To address these issues, numerous NAS techniques were proposed to automatically find the optimal structure and hyperparameters of DNNs. These techniques aim at reducing the number of parameters needed to approximate a target function while maintaining good generalization capability. There are three key concepts underlying modern neural architecture search (NAS): (i) the search space, where possible architectures and hyperparameters are explored; (ii) the evaluation metric, which determines whether one architecture performs better than another; (iii) the optimizer, which drives the evolutionary process towards better solutions. 

## 2.2 Search Space
The search space typically consists of different types of operators or modules that can be combined together to form a complete neural network. Common examples include convolutional, pooling, normalization, activation, and drop-out layers, among others. Different combinations of these operators can lead to different network structures, each with unique characteristics. For example, some architectures may use residual connections between layers to ease the gradient flow and improve training efficiency. It is crucial to carefully design the search space so that we do not overfit our models to any specific dataset and avoid introducing unnecessary complexity that hinders generalization. An efficient way to design the search space is to start small, selecting only the simplest building blocks, and gradually increase the size of the network until convergence.

## 2.3 Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric plays a central role in determining the quality of an architecture during the search process. Various metrics such as top-1 error, cross entropy loss, and accuracy are commonly used, but none of them provide a comprehensive picture of the network's behavior. As a result, it is essential to choose appropriate evaluation metrics that capture relevant factors such as test accuracy, computation time, memory usage, and hardware resources. Additionally, using synthetic benchmarks or real world datasets ensures that the evaluations are objective and reproducible. Moreover, benchmark datasets can serve as a basis for comparing different NAS techniques and identifying the best performing ones. Finally, it is important to measure the robustness of the models under perturbations, e.g., adversarial attacks.

## 2.4 Optimizer
An effective optimization algorithm plays a vital role in finding the global optimum solution to the problem of optimizing neural networks. Several common optimization strategies, such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms, have been employed in NAS. Although these algorithms are widely adopted, they often require expert knowledge and tuning to perform efficiently. Recent advances in deep learning allow us to train much deeper and larger networks than previously feasible. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop more advanced NAS techniques that scale up to meet the demand of real-world problems. One direction could be to leverage reinforcement learning algorithms to learn policies that directly map states to actions, enabling autonomous agents to explore the search space effectively without relying on human guidance. Another promising approach is to combine machine learning and physics based simulations with probabilistic programming tools to generate physically plausible architectures and hyperparameters. We expect these novel ideas to play a crucial role in addressing longstanding challenges in NAS.
