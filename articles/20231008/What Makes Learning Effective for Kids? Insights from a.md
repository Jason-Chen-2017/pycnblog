The term "learning effectiveness" has become an increasingly popular topic in educational research and practice since the early years of education reform movements such as Gutenberg-Richter exams. In this article, we will explore what makes learning effective for kids, how children learn better than adults, and the importance of several factors that influence student learning. We will then summarize some key findings from a systematic review of studies that examine different factors related to achieving or decreasing learning effects for young children around the world, including global trends, individual differences, parental behaviors, instructional practices, age groups, cultures, and contexts.
Learning effectiveness is defined as the ability of students to achieve optimal learning outcomes based on their strengths, abilities, needs, interests, motivation, cognitive development, prior knowledge, and social environment. This includes ensuring that all aspects of schooling are balanced and focused to meet each child's individual needs while also promoting academic success. However, it can be challenging for parents to develop healthy ways of teaching and encouraging children to succeed. 

In recent years, there have been many empirical investigations into factors associated with learning effectiveness in both classrooms and outdoor environments (e.g., gym settings). While these approaches may provide valuable insights into improving student performance and achievement, they typically focus on one specific context and do not account for the diversity of factors influencing learning at scale across diverse population groups. To address this challenge, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted a comprehensive study on learning effectiveness globally and identified multiple factors that impact student learning, such as: 

1) Individual Differences - Factors like gender, age, socioeconomic status, family structure, cultural background, language proficiency, previous educational experiences, and emotional skills are critical for developing effective learning behaviors.

2) Parental Behaviors - Parents should prioritize providing children with engaging, motivating, challenging, relevant activities that enhance their understanding and interests. Additionally, parents need to help children identify their own intrinsic strengths and create opportunities for them to grow beyond their comfort zone.

3) Instructional Practices - Different types of instructional materials, delivery methods, and lesson planning strategies can significantly affect children's learning outcomes. For instance, using videos, quizzes, worksheets, and group discussions can foster problem solving, active recall, and collaborative learning.

4) Age Groups - Young children often face different challenges when it comes to accessing appropriate resources and identifying patterns of behavioral change. Therefore, there is a need for continual monitoring and assessment to ensure that children are well-prepared for learning and development.

5) Cultures & Contexts - The linguistic culture, geographic location, religious beliefs, family dynamics, and organizational structures can also influence learning effects. These variations result in unique pedagogical techniques and cultural influences that shape how children approach learning.

To date, little work exists to systematically evaluate whether these factors contribute to higher levels of achievement or decreased attendance rates among underprivileged children. To fill this gap, the authors of the above mentioned paper sought to synthesize existing literature on learning effectiveness within various contexts and populations, leading to three main contributions: 

1) Identify the most important factors that positively or negatively impact learning outcomes for young children. 

2) Develop recommendations for incorporating these factors into curricula and program design so that children can effectively learn at home, during school hours, and in various outdoor environments.

3) Use mathematical models and machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of learning outcomes for individuals given demographics, context, and factors of measurement, thus enabling stakeholders to tailor interventions accordingly.

This is just one example of how employing systematic reviews in educational research can inform policy-makers, parents, teachers, and policymakers about the importance of factors that influence learning and support effective policies and programs for young children. Overall, more research must be done to identify the specific roles and mechanisms underlying the complex interplay between these factors and improve learning outcomes for all communities.
