Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a branch of Social Science and Psychology that focuses on analyzing the relationships between individuals or organizations in networks. The goal of SNA is to extract meaningful insights from data about people’s interactions with one another over time or space. One popular application area for SNA is understanding online communities such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, where users connect with each other through various social media platforms. Therefore, it is critical for businesses, researchers, politicians, and policy-makers to have good understanding of how different actors interact within these communities. In this article, we will explain how to perform SNA using Python libraries and techniques. 

Before starting our discussion, let us first understand what is meant by “social” network in SNA context: A social network is defined as an interconnected set of entities that exhibit human behavior or influence based upon their shared interests, ties, roles, and/or affiliations. An entity can be anything like an individual, organization, or concept. Two entities are said to be connected if they share some common characteristic or attribute, which makes them members of the same social group or community. For example, two persons who are friends may form a social group called a friendship circle or cohort. Another example would be a student club with its membership list consisting of multiple students. 

In traditional social science literature, social networks are studied extensively to gain insights into factors affecting human behaviour and decision making. However, due to the sheer size of modern social networks and the complexities involved in collecting large amounts of data, there has been relatively limited progress made towards developing efficient algorithms and methods for analyzing social networks. This gap has led to the need for new computational tools that facilitate the process of extracting valuable insights from massive datasets. Hence, SNA using Python is gaining momentum among industry professionals and academics alike.

In order to perform SNA using Python, we need to use several popular Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NetworkX, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, and Gensim. Here's the general outline of the steps involved in performing SNA:

1. Data Collection - Collect data from various sources, whether social media posts, emails, chat logs, text messages, tweets, blogs, customer reviews, etc., depending on the type of analysis being performed. 

2. Data Preprocessing - Clean up and preprocess collected data by removing noise, handling missing values, dealing with duplicate entries, and normalizing numerical features so that they fall within certain range of values. 

3. Graph Construction - Convert preprocessed data into a graph representation. A graph consists of nodes representing entities and edges connecting pairs of nodes that indicate relationships between them. Each edge carries attributes or weights associated with it reflecting the strength of the relationship. 

4. Network Analysis Techniques - Once the graph is constructed, various network analysis techniques can be applied to identify patterns, trends, and find interesting subsets of the network. Some commonly used techniques include degree centrality, clustering coefficient, shortest path length, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and PageRank algorithm. 

5. Visualization - Visualize results obtained from network analysis techniques using standard visualization tools like matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and ggplot. These visualizations help analyze the network structure and identify key clusters or communities within it. 

6. Prediction and Classification - Use machine learning models to predict and classify connections or outcomes between entities based on network structure, attributes, or behaviors. Commonly used techniques include logistic regression, k-NN classification, and neural network training. 

7. Causal Inference - Use statistical methods to infer causal effects between variables in the network based on observed relationships and unobserved confounders.

8. Conclusion - Summarize findings and discuss implications of the analysis. Identify next steps for further research and development.
