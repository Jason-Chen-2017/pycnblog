# 1.背景介绍

:
Audio classification is a popular technique used in many applications such as speech recognition and sound event detection. The performance of an audio classifier can be significantly improved by fine-tuning the model’s parameters or training with large datasets. However, it is still possible for adversarial attacks to manipulate an audio classifier into misclassifying its inputs. In this work, we propose a new methodology that utilizes the power of deep neural networks (DNN) to detect adversarial example attacks on audio classifiers based on their DNN features.

2.1 DNN Features: DNN is a type of machine learning algorithms used mainly for image and text classification tasks. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes called neurons which process input data through forward propagation and generate output predictions through backpropagation. The outputs from each layer are fed into subsequent layers and transformed until the final output is generated. Each node has multiple weights associated with it, where some weights are responsible for signal transmission between different neurons while others are responsible for node activation and deactivation. These weights form the connections between neurons that define the structure of the network. In this work, we use the last few fully connected layers of a pre-trained DNN model as our feature representation of audio signals. This approach reduces the dimensionality of the features and improves the efficiency of the system when dealing with high dimensional input data. 

2.2 Adversarial Examples: An adversarial attack is a malicious modification of the input data intended to fool a machine learning model into making incorrect predictions. There are several types of adversarial attacks, but one common category is those that perturb the input audio signal without changing its semantic meaning. A well known method for generating adversarial examples is Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), which updates the gradient of the loss function by multiplying it with a small value to create the adversarial example. We will focus on FGSM here because it requires only slight changes to the original input signal to fool the classifier into misclassifying it.

2.3 Attack Detection Using DNN Features: To detect adversarial attacks on audio classifiers, we first need to extract the DNN features from the audio signal. Then, we train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on top of these features to classify the input as benign or adversarial. The SVM takes two sets of features - clean and adversarial - as input and generates a decision boundary separating them into classes. If the distance between the decision boundary and the input features exceeds a certain threshold, then the input is classified as adversarial; otherwise, it is classified as benign. The goal is to find a good tradeoff between false positive rate and true positive rate while maintaining a low false negative rate. 

Overall, we can divide this problem into three main steps:
1. Extract DNN features from audio signals
2. Train SVM classifier on extracted features
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the detector using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

3.1 Feature Extraction: We use a pre-trained DNN model that was trained on audio classification task to extract features from the audio signal. Specifically, we extract the features from the last few fully connected layers of the DNN model. For simplicity, we assume that all the layers except the last ones have 1D filters of size 1x1, i.e., they perform convolution over the time axis. Therefore, the final extracted features would have length equal to the number of channels at the last hidden layer. Since there might be variations in the level of noise present in real-world audio signals, we preprocess the audio signals before feeding them to the DNN model to reduce background noise and increase signal quality. Finally, we normalize the resulting feature vectors to make them unit norm. Here's how the preprocessing pipeline looks like:


3.2 SVM Training: Once we have the extracted features, we train an SVM classifier on top of them. During training, we randomly split the set of features into two subsets - clean and adversarial - and label them accordingly. We use linear kernel to represent the decision boundary and tune the hyperparameters C (regularization parameter) and gamma (kernel coefficient) to balance between misclassification error and margin maximization.

Here's how the SVM classifier looks like:


3.3 Attack Detection: When testing the detector, we compute the decision score for the test sample using the same formula as above and compare it against a predefined threshold. If the decision score is greater than the threshold, then the input is considered adversarial. Otherwise, it is classified as benign.

Here's how the attack detection algorithm works:

4.1 Implementation Details:

The implementation details including the following aspects:

Preprocessing Pipeline: 
We use librosa library to load and preprocess the audio files. Preprocessing includes resampling the audio file to 16 kHz sampling rate, removing the silence parts of the file, applying zero-padding if necessary, normalizing the amplitude, and finally padding the signal with zeros to ensure that the length of the signal is divisible by 512 frames.

Model Selection:
We use VGGish architecture for feature extraction. The model is pretrained on YouTube-8M dataset containing approximately 500k hours of audio from YouTube videos tagged as belonging to 400 categories. We fine-tune the model on Kaggle’s Dog Breed Identification Dataset, consisting of 25,000 dog breed images labeled as ‘dog’ and ‘not_a_dog’. We also add dropout regularization to prevent overfitting during training.

SVM Hyperparameter Tuning:
During training, we randomly select 20% of the samples from both clean and adversarial sets and evaluate their performance using cross-validation. We keep track of the best performing values of C and gamma and use them during inference.

Evaluation Metrics:
We measure the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the detector. Accuracy measures the overall performance of the detector, precision measures the ability of the detector to correctly identify the adversarial samples, recall measures the percentage of adversarial samples detected by the detector, and F1-score combines precision and recall into a single metric.


Code Structure:

The code uses Python programming language along with NumPy and Keras libraries for implementing the above pipeline. We implement a module named 'features' to handle feature extraction, another module named'svm' to handle SVM training and evaluation, and a script named 'attackdetection' to combine everything together.
