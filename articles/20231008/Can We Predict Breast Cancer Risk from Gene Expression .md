# 1.背景介绍


## Breast cancer (癌症)
Breast cancer is a common malignancy that occurs in the cells of the lining of the male breast. It typically starts as a benign growth or non-cancerous change and grows more aggressively over time until it becomes cancerous. The early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer reduce its risk of developing advanced disease by preventing uncontrolled cell division and inflammation. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide with almost half of all new cases being detected within one year after diagnosis. Despite this high prevalence, there are few effective treatments available for patients with breast cancer at the moment because of limitations on the ability to target specific cancer cells responsible for the cancer development. Therefore, accurate prediction of breast cancer risk based on gene expression data alone will be critical in ensuring successful treatment of patients with breast cancer.  
## Gene expression
Gene expression refers to the molecular process during which individual genes are transcribed into RNA and translated into proteins. By studying the expression patterns of these genes, scientists have been able to identify genetic abnormalities that contribute to breast cancer development and progression. However, analyzing entire gene expression profiles has several challenges including sample size limitation, technical complexity, low reproducibility, and sensitive to biases introduced by various sources such as incomplete purity control and batch effects. Therefore, there is a need for efficient and reliable methods to predict breast cancer risk using only gene expression data without any information about DNA or protein sequences.   
In recent years, several machine learning techniques have been developed to address these issues. One example is the use of deep neural networks (DNNs), where gene expressions are fed through an artificial neural network (ANN) that learns to recognize patterns and correlations between them. Although DNNs are widely used in bioinformatics, they often require extensive computational resources and cannot achieve very high accuracy due to their architecture requirements. Other approaches include statistical models that utilize gene expression data as features and make predictions based on linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines. These models generally perform well but suffer from poor interpretability and limited scalability when applied to large datasets. To further improve the performance of these models, we propose a hybrid approach that combines both deep learning and ensemble methods.

## Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods combine multiple models to produce better predictions than could be achieved from any single model alone. This is particularly useful in problems like classification where a small number of models may outperform a larger collection of competing models. There are two main types of ensemble methods: bagging and boosting. Bagging involves training many copies of the same base model on different subsets of the dataset and aggregating their outputs. Boosting involves creating a sequence of weak learners that each focus on making errors in its previous step, leading to stronger overall results. Both bagging and boosting can lead to improved predictive performance compared to working with just one model alone.    
## Deep Learning
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It uses multiple layers of nonlinear processing units to extract complex features from input data, allowing for automated feature extraction and representation. DNNs are currently dominant in fields ranging from image recognition to natural language processing, making them a powerful tool for biomedical research. They have shown impressive performance across a variety of tasks such as object detection, speech recognition, and text analysis, but still face significant challenges such as overfitting and slow convergence speed. While some studies have attempted to address these challenges, the field remains challenging despite advances in algorithmic developments and increased computing power.

## Data preprocessing
To analyze gene expression data efficiently, we first need to preprocess it. Here are some steps we might take:

1. Remove duplicates: If the dataset contains duplicate samples, we should remove them to avoid bias towards any particular sample.

2. Normalize gene counts: Divide each gene count by the total read count for each sample to normalize the scale and enable comparisons between samples.

3. Filter lowly expressed genes: Genes with very low expression levels may not be informative for determining cancer risk and should be removed. A reasonable cutoff threshold might be excluding any gene with less than ten times the median expression level across all samples.

4. Create binary outcome variable: For now, we will assume that any patient who expresses at least five genes associated with breast cancer is at high risk of having cancer. We can create a binary outcome variable indicating whether a patient's gene expression profile indicates high risk of cancer (value = 1) or normal (value = 0). 

## Model selection
There are several options for selecting the best model for our task. Some possibilities are logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs). Logistic regression is simple and fast to train, while SVMs offer good margin properties that allow us to handle imbalanced classes if necessary. Random forests and gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs) also work well on high dimensional tabular data, making them suitable for our problem. In contrast, deep neural networks are ideal for dealing with high-dimensional and sparse gene expression data, making them a viable alternative to traditional methods.     
We will select an ANN-based model called XGBoost, a variant of gradient boosting designed specifically for handling tree-based models and capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance on many machine learning competitions. XGBoost operates by constructing a series of decision trees sequentially, each attempting to correct the residual errors made by prior trees. Each successive tree focuses on areas where the previous trees were insufficient, leading to much faster training times than other popular tree-based methods. Additionally, XGBoost allows us to easily incorporate categorical variables and handles missing values automatically, greatly reducing the amount of manual preprocessing required.    

## Training procedure
The basic training procedure for XGBoost involves the following steps:

1. Split the data into training and validation sets. 

2. Train the XGBoost model on the training set using hyperparameters specified by the user.

3. Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using metrics such as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and mean squared error (MSE).

4. Repeat steps 2-3 using additional iterations or increasing the strength of regularization parameters until the performance metric stops improving.

After evaluating several combinations of hyperparameters, we can choose the combination that performs best on the validation set. Finally, we can test the selected model on a separate test set to estimate its generalizability to new data.

XGBoost works by building an ensemble of decision trees, similar to random forest, except that instead of bootstrap sampling the data to get resampled datasets for each iteration, XGBoost builds each tree on a random subset of the data. During training, XGBoost constructs a loss function that measures how far each predicted value deviates from the true value, calculates gradients based on this loss function, and updates the model accordingly. At each node of the tree, the model splits on the feature that minimizes the expected loss reduction, resulting in a higher resolution of the space of possible splits and better generalization capabilities. Overall, XGBoost provides a robust solution for predicting breast cancer risk from gene expression data that offers excellent performance, flexibility, and scalability.  

## Mathematical formulation
For XGBoost, we start by defining the objective function that we want to minimize, which represents the cost of misclassifying a given instance. In this case, the goal is to maximize the probability of correctly identifying positive instances, so we define the objective function as follows: 

$$\min_{y_i} \sum_{j=1}^n l(y_i, f(x_i)) + \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \|w\|^2,$$

where $l(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted and actual label, $f(\cdot)$ is the model output, $T$ is the number of trees in the ensemble, $\lambda$ is the L2 penalty parameter, and $w$ is the weight vector representing the learned coefficients for the features.   

Next, we specify the model structure. Since we are interested in predicting the probability of cancer occurrence, we use sigmoid activation function for the final layer of the model:

$$h_\theta(x) = \sigma(\theta^{T}x),$$

where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid function defined as:

$$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}.$$

Finally, we apply the gradient descent optimization algorithm to find the optimal weights $\theta$ that minimize the objective function:

$$\theta^{(t+1)} = \theta^{(t)} - \eta \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta^{(t)}, \mathcal{D}_{train}),$$

where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta^{(t)}, \mathcal{D}_{train})$ is the gradient of the objective function evaluated at point $\theta$, and $\mathcal{D}_{train}$ is the training dataset.

Since we are trying to optimize an expensive black box function, we will use stochastic gradient descent with minibatches to update the model parameters in each iteration. Specifically, we randomly select a subset of the training data called a minibatch, calculate the gradient of the objective function using this minibatch, and update the model parameters using a simple formula. This ensures that our algorithm does not rely too heavily on any single observation and improves convergence rates.
