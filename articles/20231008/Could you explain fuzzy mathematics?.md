# 1.背景介绍


Fuzzy mathematics is a type of mathematical study involving real-valued variables or quantities that have varying degrees of truth. Fuzzy mathematics has its roots in AI and computer science research, where fuzzy logic and neural networks are commonly used for processing uncertain inputs. The term "fuzzy" derives from the idea that values can be partially true and partially false, making it an important concept in many fields such as engineering, medicine, psychology, finance, etc. In this article, we will explore the basic concepts behind fuzzy mathematics, including sets, membership functions, operations on sets, and how they relate to fuzzy inference systems.

# 2.Core Concepts and Relationships
## Sets 
A set (or finite set) is a collection of distinct objects or elements. It's defined by a list of its members enclosed within square brackets: {a, b, c}. 

Sets play a fundamental role in fuzzy mathematics because all calculations involve manipulating sets of numbers. For example, let's say we have two sets A={1,2} and B={3,4}, which represent some domain of possible input values. We want to find the intersection between these two sets. One way to do this is to create another set C = {1, 2, 3, 4}, then remove any duplicates using the "distinct" operation. However, since there may be multiple possible ways to arrive at this result based on our assumptions about A and B, we need a method to estimate how certain we are about each element before taking the final decision. That's where membership functions come into play. 

## Membership Functions
A membership function assigns a degree of membership to every point in a set, typically ranging from 0 to 1. Mathematically, it takes the form of a smooth curve with values between 0 and 1 that is non-negative and increasing with increasing x values. For example, the triangular membership function can take on the following values:  

$$
0 \leq x < a \quad f(x) = 0 \\
a \leq x < b \quad f(x) = (x - a)/(b - a)\\
b \leq x \quad f(x) = 1 \\
$$

In other words, if x is less than a, the value of f(x) is 0; if it's greater than b, the value is also 1; otherwise, it varies linearly from 0 to 1 between a and b. This allows us to assign degrees of membership to points inside and outside the set A.

To calculate the probability that a given point x belongs to A, we simply evaluate the membership function at x: $p_A(x)=f(x)$. Similarly, to determine the complementary set C, we subtract the membership function evaluated at x from 1: $C=\{y : y\neq x,\forall x\in A\}$.

Now that we understand what sets and membership functions are, we can begin exploring their applications in fuzzy mathematics.

## Operations on Sets
We can perform various operations on sets to manipulate them in different ways. Here are a few common ones:

1. Union: The union of two sets A and B is denoted by A ∪ B and consists of all elements that belong to either A or B. We can use this operator to combine sets together and generate new sets. For example, suppose we have two sets A={1, 2} and B={2, 3}, then the union of these sets would be A∪B={(1), (2),(3)}= {1, 2, 3}. 

2. Intersection: The intersection of two sets A and B is denoted by A ∩ B and contains only those elements that belong to both A and B. To get the intersection, we use the "&" symbol: A & B=(2). 

3. Complementation: The complement of a set A relative to a universal set U is denoted by A' and consists of all elements that don't belong to A. We can obtain the complement of A by finding all the elements of U that are not in A, i.e., A'=U\{A\}= \{u:\ u\not\in A\}\.

Using these operators, we can derive several useful properties of sets such as their size (cardinality), closure, and relative complements. These properties allow us to make intelligent decisions under uncertainty by considering the effects of different sets on each other.
