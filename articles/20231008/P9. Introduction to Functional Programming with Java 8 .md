# 1.背景介绍


Functional programming (FP) is a declarative programming paradigm that emphasizes the evaluation of expressions without assignment statements or mutable state. In other words, FP focuses on defining operations on immutable data structures instead of side effects such as mutation or I/O output. The goal of functional programming is to create programs that are composable, i.e., easy to build up from simpler pieces, and modular, i.e., they can be split into smaller, more manageable components. This makes it easier to reason about complex systems and facilitates testing and debugging because each component in the program can be tested independently of its surroundings. 

Java 8 introduced two key features that support functional programming: lambda expressions and streams. A lambda expression is an anonymous function that can be used wherever a function is expected. It can take any number of parameters and return a value, which can also be a void type if no result needs to be returned. Stream is a collection of elements that supports various common operations like filtering, mapping, sorting, grouping, etc.

In this blog post, we will discuss the basics of functional programming using Java 8 streams and lambdas. We will learn how these concepts fit together, what problems they solve, and how we can use them effectively in our applications. By the end of this article, you should have a better understanding of why FP is important and how to apply it to your projects. 

Let's get started!

## Lambda Expressions 
A lambda expression consists of three parts:
 - Parameters: comma-separated list of zero or more variables representing the input arguments to the lambda expression. If there are no arguments, parentheses can be omitted. 
 - Body: An expression that represents the operation to be performed by the lambda expression. The body can contain references to local variables defined outside the scope of the lambda expression. 
 - Arrow operator "->" separating the parameter list from the body. 
 
Example: 

```java
(String s) -> { System.out.println("Hello, " + s); } 
```
This lambda expression takes a string argument s and prints out "Hello, " followed by the value of s.

Lambda expressions can be assigned to variables for later reuse:

```java
Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Hello World!"); //r is a Runnable object that prints "Hello World!" when run() is called. 
```

Lambda expressions provide a concise way to define small functions without needing to explicitly declare a new class or method. They can be passed around and used as arguments to higher-order functions. 

## Streams 
Streams are collections of elements that supports several commonly used operations like filter(), map(), sorted(), limit(), distinct(), etc. These operations can be chained together to perform multiple transformations on the stream. Once the stream is constructed, intermediate results are computed lazily, only when necessary. Finally, the results can be collected back into a collection or consumed directly via forEach().

Stream operations can be either terminal or non-terminal. Terminal operations produce a result based on all elements of the stream while non-terminal operations returns a new stream based on some transformation applied to the original stream. For example, the sorted() operation produces a new stream with the elements sorted according to their natural order, while the distinct() operation removes duplicate elements.

To create a stream, we need to call one of the static creation methods provided by the java.util.stream package. Examples include:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
IntStream intStream = IntStream.of(numbers.toArray()); // Convert List to IntStream
long count = longStream.count();   // Count the number of elements in the stream
```

Each element in the stream must conform to the same type. Here are examples of creating different types of streams:

```java
List<Person> persons =...;
Stream<Person> personStream = persons.stream();    // Create a stream of Persons
 
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
DoubleStream doubleStream = Arrays.stream(arr).asDoubleStream();     // Create a DoubleStream from an array of ints
```

Streams can be created from any kind of iterable collection using the `stream()` method. Alternatively, we can convert existing collections to streams using the `stream()` method of Collection interface. Similarly, we can convert arrays to streams using the corresponding `stream()` method. We can then chain together the desired operations to transform the stream into the required format.

Here are some examples:

```java
// Filter out even numbers
List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
nums.stream().filter((n) -> n % 2 == 1).collect(Collectors.toList()) // [1, 3, 5]

// Calculate sum of squares of even numbers
double sumOfSquares =
    Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
         .stream()
         .mapToInt((n) -> n*n)          // Convert elements to int
         .filter((n) -> n % 2 == 0)      // Select even numbers
         .average()                     // Calculate average of selected integers
         .orElse(Double.NaN);           // Handle case where no matching elements found
    
System.out.println(sumOfSquares);       // Output: 7.0
```

We can also use primitive streams for efficient processing of integer, long, double or other primitive values. Here are some examples:

```java
IntStream intStream = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).stream().mapToInt(i->i);
LongStream longStream = Arrays.asList(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L).stream().mapToLong(l->l);
DoubleStream doubleStream = Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0).stream().mapToDouble(d->d);
```

The main advantage of using streams over traditional loops is that they handle large datasets efficiently, avoiding bottlenecks due to excessive memory usage and CPU utilization. Additionally, they can simplify code by removing boilerplate code related to iteration and error handling. However, it is worth noting that certain scenarios may require direct manipulation of iterators or iterables for performance reasons.  

Finally, we should note that streams do not guarantee atomicity of operations, meaning that operations executed sequentially on the same thread might execute concurrently and interleave unpredictably. To ensure proper synchronization, we can use explicit locks or synchronize blocks during multi-threaded executions.
