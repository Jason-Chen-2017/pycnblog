# 1.背景介绍


Unstructured data refers to a type of data that has no fixed schema or format and requires processing and analysis techniques in order to extract valuable insights from the data. It can be textual, multimedia, social media, etc., but it also includes structured databases such as relational databases, flat files, CSVs, JSONs, XMLs, NoSQL databases like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Cassandra, MongoDB, MySQL, etc. The traditional methods for analyzing unstructured data are rule-based approaches using regular expressions or statistical algorithms, which have limitations due to the lack of structure in the data. However, with advancements in machine learning and deep learning technologies, there is an opportunity to apply these techniques on unstructured data by leveraging their ability to learn patterns and relationships from large datasets without any prior knowledge of how the data should be organized. In this article, we will explore the application of various machine learning techniques on unstructured data, including natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition tasks, and discuss how they can help solve real-world problems related to customer feedback analysis, fraud detection, sentiment analysis, spam filtering, content categorization, and so on.
The importance of tackling unstructured data using machine learning techniques goes beyond its utility in business applications. Although businesses often collect unstructured data such as emails, documents, medical records, videos, surveys, etc., they still rely heavily on human intelligence to make sense of them and gain meaningful insights. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning systems can improve efficiency and effectiveness across many industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, education, e-commerce, marketing, and so on, leading to significant savings and benefits in revenue, profits, and bottom lines. Therefore, companies must continue investing in research and development to develop new tools and techniques that leverage machine learning capabilities to analyze unstructured data effectively and efficiently.

In machine learning, unsupervised learning is used to group similar objects together into clusters based on their features. There are several popular clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), etc. These algorithms work well when the input data is clean and labeled; however, they cannot handle noise or outliers very well because they do not have ground truth labels. To overcome these issues, supervised learning algorithms are usually applied to train the model with labeled training examples. Some commonly used supervised learning algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks, and random forests. Unlike clustering, where only the features matter, supervised learning algorithms require both input data and corresponding output labels, making it more suitable for handling complex problems requiring classification, prediction, and regression.

On top of the above mentioned clustering and supervised learning algorithms, another important task in machine learning is anomaly detection. Anomaly detection involves identifying rare events or observations that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset, especially if those events represent known patterns or trends. Several anomaly detection algorithms exist, including Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoder Neural Networks (AE), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), etc. All these algorithms use different mathematical formulas to detect anomalies and measure the degree of deviation from normality, but they all share some common principles, namely:

1. Finding anomalies in high-dimensional spaces requires dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or AE. 

2. The algorithm needs to estimate the expected distribution of the underlying data to identify anomalous points correctly. This step is critical for outlier detection since it ensures that only extreme values are considered as outliers. 

3. Finally, most anomaly detection algorithms assume a certain degree of contamination rate within the data set, i.e., the fraction of actual outliers among the entire dataset. 

To summarize, while the core concept behind machine learning lies in learning patterns and relationships from data without any prior knowledge of how it should be organized, it can be extended to unstructured data by applying clustering, anomaly detection, and other machine learning algorithms to extract relevant insights and insights from the data.
