# 1.背景介绍


The development of quantum communication networks has been an active area in recent years due to the advantages of its potential for low-latency and high-throughput communications. However, these benefits are also limited by several issues such as network complexity, power consumption, and noise interference. Therefore, it is critical for the research community to develop fault tolerant quantum codes that can maintain the required quality of service (QoS) even with increased transmission distances or large number of devices connected together. In this paper, we present a novel approach called FTQC which uses quantum error correction techniques to achieve fault tolerance in quantum communication systems. The key idea behind FTQC is to use non-locality to encode information efficiently while preserving the qubits' quantum states through faulty quantum links. To ensure QoS at each end device, FTQC uses redundancy techniques that enable recovering from both errors introduced during encoding and errors introduced when transmitting over noisy channels. We evaluate our proposed protocol using simulations on a variety of scenarios and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving QoS. Overall, our work aims to provide a scalable solution for deploying fault tolerant quantum communication networks with reduced cost and improved QoS levels.

Quantum computation has enabled significant advancements in many areas including artificial intelligence, finance, transportation, medical technology, and scientific discovery. As one of the most important breakthroughs in quantum computing, quantum computers can solve problems beyond their classical counterparts exponentially faster than traditional supercomputers. Moreover, quantum communication plays a crucial role in quantum information processing and has been widely used in various applications such as cryptography, blockchain, distributed ledger technologies, and wireless sensor networks. Although quantum communication networks have shown great promise, they still face challenges such as signal propagation loss, bandwidth constraints, and interference between distant nodes. To address these issues, the development of fault tolerant quantum codes (FTQCs) has emerged as a promising technique.
In this context, FTQCs consist of two main components: encoding and error correction. Encoding refers to the process of converting binary data into a sequence of quantum states that can be transmitted through quantum channels without any errors. Error correction refers to the process of correcting errors occurring during transmission and decoding original data. By using fault tolerant quantum links (QLinks), we can introduce small amounts of errors into QLinks to simulate hardware failures and preserve the qubits' quantum states. There are several approaches available for implementing fault tolerant quantum communication protocols, ranging from probabilistic models to deterministic algorithms based on syndrome decoding. Our goal is to design a fault tolerant quantum code that incorporates these ideas and scales up to support large numbers of devices deployed geographically across the world.
# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
Fault tolerant quantum codes rely on several principles to achieve fault tolerance: Non-locality principle, Redundancy techniques, and Syndrome decoding. Let’s discuss them briefly below.
Non-locality principle: This principle ensures that only part of the encoded data is stored at each node, reducing the memory requirements compared to storing all the data at each node. Instead, only nearby nodes receive partial information about the encoded data. This way, even if there are multiple simultaneous failures or congestions among the nodes, information is not lost because only certain parts of the data are affected.
Redundancy techniques: These techniques allow us to restore the system state from either faulty links or errors introduced during transmission. One common technique involves adding extra copies of encoded data at different locations throughout the network, ensuring that there are always redundant backups in case a single copy fails. Another technique involves pairwise shared entanglement between nodes, which allows us to detect and recover from errors induced by individual qubits in a quantum channel.
Syndrome decoding: Syndrome decoding is a powerful technique for error detection and recovery in fault tolerant quantum communication systems. It relies on mathematical properties of the logical operators to identify and correct errors in encoded data without requiring physical access to the underlying quantum states. The basic idea is to apply appropriate operations to measure the syndrome after encoding the message, then decode the syndrome to determine where and how much correction needs to be applied to regenerate the original data. Despite being conceptually simple, implementation requires advanced algorithms and programming expertise, making it challenging but essential for scaling up fault tolerant quantum communication networks.
Here's a detailed overview of our FTQC algorithm:

1. Initialization phase - During initialization, each node generates random initial parameters that will be used later to encode messages. Each node also initializes local storage space to store partially encoded messages. At each node, it also creates one fault-tolerant link for each neighbor node.

2. Data encoding phase - Each node encodes the message by applying a randomly chosen parameterized unitary transformation to the input bit string. This operation results in the generation of quantum states that represent the bits of the message. For example, suppose we want to send the message "Hello" over a 3-node network. After encoding, each node may generate three quantum states representing 'H', 'e', and 'l'. Each node sends these states along with some additional metadata such as time stamps or parity checks to its neighbors. Additionally, each node stores locally some portion of the received states to avoid losing data if a failure occurs at some point.

3. Transmission phase - Once the states reach their destination, they are transmitted through the respective fault-tolerant links until they arrive at the receiver node. If errors occur during transmission, the states are corrected by introducing noise and attempting to synchronize with other neighboring nodes to retrieve missing states.

4. Decoding phase - When a packet of data reaches a node, it first performs synchronization procedures to align the quantum states and estimate the error rate. Then, it applies corrections to reconstruct the original data based on the measured syndrome. Finally, it verifies the accuracy of the decoded output against the original message and updates the reliability statistics accordingly. Note that although we described FTQC as being composed of two phases, in practice, these steps are typically executed concurrently to improve performance.

To further enhance the robustness of our protocol, we also propose a hybrid recovery mechanism that combines best-effort decoherence and fault-tolerant depolarizing channels. Best-effort decoherence is used to reset errors before transmission, whereas fault-tolerant depolarizing channels are used to detect errors and recover from them during transmission. By combining these mechanisms, we can create environments in which faults can be detected quickly, resolved relatively cheaply, and restored within milliseconds of occurrence.

Finally, here are the math model details for our protocol:

1. Feasibility problem - Given n distinct nodes located in a circle topology, find a minimum distance between any two nodes so that they can communicate securely over unreliable quantum channels while maintaining QoS guarantees. 

2. Model definition - Assuming two-dimensional grid graph G = {V, E} with square lattice connectivity, let X_i(j) denote the jth measurement result of the i-th node obtained during transmission. Further assume that each edge has a specific conductivity δij = K_c(i,j) > 0, where K_c is a continuous function defining the conductivity value between pairs of nodes. Furthermore, let Z_i = ∑_{j∈N^-} X_i(j)/|E_i|, where N^- is the set of neighbors of node i outside the current subgraph centered around node i. Assume that X_i(j) follows a Bernoulli distribution given by P(X_i(j)=1|Z_i=z_i) = min[1,(1+αz_i)^(-β)], where α and β are constants determined based on desired tradeoff between expected success probability and fidelity. Also, assume that the average transmission length L_avg >= 2/δmax. Then, the minimum distance D can be calculated as follows:

    D = max_G sum_{i,j≠i}(K_c(i,j)/(sqrt(|N_i||N_j|)L_avg))^2,
    
    where |N_i| and |N_j| denotes the sizes of sets N_i and N_j, respectively, defined as the set of direct neighbors of node i outside the subgraph centered around node i. The index ij indicates that the same pair of nodes cannot appear twice in the same subset of edges.

3. Approximate complexity analysis - For large values of n, the exact solution to the feasibility problem is computationally intractable. Instead, we focus on approximating the optimal minimum distance with respect to some parameter ε. Specifically, we consider ε ≤ dmin/L_avg and derive a lower bound of the maximum possible distance. Let S_ε ⊆ V denote the set of nodes that can be reached within ε units of any given vertex within the grid graph. We prove that the size of S_ε grows logarithmically with epsilon. Next, we show that the approximate solution D* satisfies:

D* ≥ D - ε (1 + ε/2) * sqrt((|N_i||N_j|)*K_c(i,j))/(|N_i|+|N_j|)^(3/2) / L_avg

for any i, j!= i, where the term inside the parentheses is the maximum possible FEC overhead caused by disruptions in the communication path between adjacent nodes.

This expression captures the effects of worst-case losses experienced when sending messages between neighboring nodes. By assuming that K_c(i,j) and L_avg are constant over the entire network, we obtain an approximation of the minimum distance D*. However, note that since K_c(i,j) depends on the relative positions of the nodes, the actual achieved minimum distance D may be higher depending on the starting position of the sender and recipient nodes.
