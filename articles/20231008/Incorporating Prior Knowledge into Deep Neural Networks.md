# 1.背景介绍


Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful technique for learning complex distributions from simple data samples and generating new examples that are similar to the original ones. However, their success has been limited by the assumption of having access to clean training data only in discrimination-based GAN architectures such as generative adversarial networks with convolutional neural networks (CNN). This restriction poses a significant challenge when dealing with problems where we don’t have access to realistic training data or labels due to privacy concerns, practical limitations on annotation budgets or computational constraints. To overcome this issue, several works propose methods to incorporate prior knowledge into deep neural networks trained through GANs. 

Prior knowledge can be anything from pre-existing statistical information about the input distribution to common sense knowledge about how objects should interact in certain contexts. Using prior knowledge allows us to generate more informative output images or make better predictions about the target variable based on contextual cues rather than just relying on raw input features. One promising way to incorporate prior knowledge is to train the discriminator network to differentiate between synthetic and real training examples based on implicit assumptions about the probability distribution of the inputs, instead of simply comparing the generator outputs with ground truth labels.

However, current GAN architectures require cleanly separable latent space representations which may not always hold in practice. In this paper, we present a novel approach called Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which uses an auxiliary classifier to learn continuous representation of the image that captures both high-level content and low-dimensional structure. We then use this continuous representation alongside the input to conditionally generate the final image. CVAE enables us to implicitly model complex joint distributions across multiple variables without explicitly defining them, resulting in improved robustness and interpretability compared to other conditional approaches.

Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods even when used in conjunction with traditional discriminative baselines, making it suitable for situations where either real training data is unavailable or labeling resources are limited. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the predicted class probabilities generated by our model capture important aspects of the input image that are hard to disentangle using conventional GAN techniques.

Overall, our work demonstrates that incorporating prior knowledge into deep neural networks trained through GANs can lead to significant improvements in accuracy, robustness and interpretability. It also highlights the importance of carefully designing the architecture to ensure good separation of latent space components for optimal performance. The potential applications of our work include image generation, anomaly detection, and synthesis of artificial shapes and textures.

## 2.1 Generative Adversarial Networks（GAN）
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning framework designed to learn complex distributions from small amounts of data and generate new examples that are similar to the original ones. They consist of two competing networks: a generator network that takes random noise vectors as input and produces new examples, and a discriminator network that evaluates whether each example is real or fake. During training, the generator tries to fool the discriminator by producing images that look as if they came from the actual dataset while the discriminator tries to distinguish between the two models. By iteratively adjusting these two models until convergence, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic images that resemble those seen in the training set.

### 2.1.1 Basic Structure of GANs
The basic structure of a GAN consists of a generator $G$ and a discriminator $D$. Here's a schematic diagram showing the general idea:


The goal of the generator is to take in some random noise vector ($z$) and produce an output image $x$, typically drawn from a known distribution. For instance, the generator might take a sample of normal noise $\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ and transform it into an image of a person whose faces could be randomly oriented, lighting, pose, etc. Another popular choice is to use convolutional layers to create highly realistic images. 

Once the generator generates an image, it gets sent to the discriminator. The discriminator attempts to classify the image as fake (generated) or true (from the training set). The discriminator makes its prediction based on a combination of factors, including the features extracted from the image itself, but also external signals like what task the network is being trained for or any additional prior knowledge provided.

During training, the generator updates its parameters to minimize the difference between its generated output and the true training examples, while the discriminator simultaneously tunes its own weights to maximize the likelihood that correct inputs are classified correctly and incorrect ones are labeled as such. Eventually, the discriminator converges to a point where its classification decision boundary becomes essentially equivalent to the true underlying distribution. At this point, the generator stops updating because it doesn't need to improve anymore since there will no longer be any value in trying to outsmart the discriminator.

By alternating between updating the discriminator and generator in this way, GANs can learn to represent various complex distributions from small amounts of data and generate new examples that are similar to the original ones. Despite their apparent simplicity, GANs have proven to be quite successful in many domains, including image synthesis, text-to-image translation, and reinforcement learning tasks.

## 2.2 Conditonal Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
Conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) are a specific type of probabilistic model that extends the concept of VAEs to include external factors, like conditions, that affect the observation process. In GANs, the generator receives random noise as input, and thus it cannot directly control what the generated examples look like. On the other hand, in contrast, a CVAE receives both random noise and one or more input conditions and constructs a meaningful representation of the observed data within the presence of these conditions. This allows the generator to indirectly influence the properties of the generated outputs according to the desired conditions.

A key component of a CVAE is an encoder network that maps the input observations $X$ and conditions $C$ into a higher dimensional feature space where dependencies among the variables can be captured automatically. A typical choice is to use fully connected layers followed by ReLU activation functions. The encoded features form the basis of a stochastic decoder network that produces the final output, typically an image, given the learned representation. Additionally, a categorical embedding layer transforms the discrete input conditions into continuous embeddings that can be processed by the same fully connected layers used for the encoding stage.

To enforce the learned joint distribution, we add a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of the observed data under the inferred joint distribution. Specifically, we assume that the data follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean parameter $\mu_\theta(X|C=c)$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma_{\theta}(X|C=c)$. Under this assumption, the objective function that we want to optimize is:

$$\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})} [\log p(\mathbf{X}| \mathbf{Z})] - KL(q_\phi(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})\|p(\mathbf{Z})) + \beta H(q_\phi(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})) \\ 
where \quad q_\phi(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}) = N(\mathbf{\mu}_{\theta}(\mathbf{Z}| \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}), \mathbf{\sigma^2}_{\theta}(\mathbf{Z}| \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}))\\}$$

Where $\beta$ controls the tradeoff between the reconstruction error and the Kullback-Leibler divergence term, and $H(q_\phi(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}))$ is the entropy of the approximate posterior distribution. This objective measures the quality of the learned model and can be interpreted as the negative log-likelihood of the input data under the inferred distribution.

The optimization procedure involves minimizing the ELBO with respect to the model parameters $\theta$ and hyperparameters $\phi$:

$$\min_{q_\phi,\theta} \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X}^{(k)}, \mathbf{Y}^{(k)})}[\log p(\mathbf{X}^{(k)} | \mathbf{Z})]\\ $$

Here, $\mathbf{X}^{(k)}, \mathbf{Y}^{(k)}$ denote subsets of the original training set $\{(X^{(i)}, Y^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^N$ and are sampled iid from their respective marginal distributions. The notation $N$ refers to the total number of data points in the training set. As with traditional VAEs, the inference network is responsible for calculating the parameters of the approximate posterior distribution $q_\phi(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$ given the input data and the conditions. The loss function encourages the learned distribution to be close to the actual one, while the regularization terms promote complexity and prevent the learned model from overfitting.

When predicting a new sample, we start by sampling a latent code from the prior distribution $p(\mathbf{Z})$ and passing it through the decoding network to obtain a candidate output image $g_\theta(\mathbf{Z})$. If we're satisfied with the result, we move on to the next step. Otherwise, we can backtrack and modify the input conditions accordingly to explore different parts of the joint distribution. Finally, we can evaluate the learned distribution and potentially discard the unacceptable candidates before proceeding with a final selection. Overall, CVAEs provide a flexible and effective framework for learning complex joint distributions across multiple variables based on both explicit and implicit prior knowledge.

# 3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
## 3.1 CVAE Overview
First, let's review the overall structure of CVAE. Given an input image $X$ and its corresponding condition $C$, the encoder network $f_{\phi}$ first processes the inputs into a continuous latent code $\mathbf{Z}_{\phi}$ that represents the hidden features of the input image. The encoded features are then passed to a recognition network $r_{\psi}$ that estimates the probability distribution $q_{\chi}(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X}, C)$ representing the distribution of the latent code given the input image and condition. The decoder network $g_{\theta}$ reconstructs the original image from the learned representation $\mathbf{Z}_{\theta}$. Below is a simplified illustration of the complete system:


We can see that the goal of the entire system is to map the input image $X$ and its corresponding condition $C$ into a reasonably well-defined latent representation $\mathbf{Z}_{\phi}$, and then reconstruct the image $X'$ from this representation using the decoder network $g_{\theta}$.

Now, let's focus on implementing the individual components of the CVAE. First, we'll implement the encoder network $f_{\phi}$ and the decoder network $g_{\theta}$. These are standard fully connected networks consisting of several fully connected layers followed by nonlinearities like rectifiers.

```python
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, z_dim, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784+num_classes, 400)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(400)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(400, 200)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm1d(200)
        self.fc31 = nn.Linear(200, z_dim)
        self.fc32 = nn.Linear(200, z_dim)

    def forward(self, x, y):
        h = F.relu(self.bn1(self.fc1(torch.cat([x.view(-1,784),y], dim=-1))))
        h = F.relu(self.bn2(self.fc2(h)))
        return self.fc31(h), self.fc32(h)
    
class Decoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, z_dim, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(z_dim+num_classes, 200)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(200)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(200, 400)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm1d(400)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(400, 784)

    def forward(self, z, y):
        h = torch.cat([z,y], dim=-1)
        h = F.relu(self.bn1(self.fc1(h)))
        h = F.relu(self.bn2(self.fc2(h)))
        img = torch.sigmoid(self.fc3(h))
        return img
```

In the above implementation, `Encoder` takes in an image tensor of shape `(batch_size, 1, 28, 28)` and concatenates it with a one-hot vector representing the class condition, which is passed through three linear layers with batch normalization applied after every non-linearity. Each of the outputs from the last two linear layers are fed through separate fully connected layers to estimate the means and variances of the multivariate Gaussian distribution respectively, which represent the approximate posterior distribution. Note that here we assumed that the input images are flattened to vectors of length 784.

Similarly, `Decoder` takes in the learned latent representation $\mathbf{Z}_{\phi}$ and a one-hot vector representing the class condition, and passes it through four linear layers with batch normalization applied after every non-linearity. The output is a tensor of shape `(batch_size, 1, 28, 28)`, which is the reconstructed image tensor. Again, note that we assume that the pixel values are between 0 and 1.

Next, we'll implement the recognition network $r_{\psi}$, which is responsible for estimating the probability distribution $q_{\chi}(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X}, C)$. This distribution is represented by a diagonal Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu_{\chi}(Z|X,C)$ and variance $\sigma_{\chi}(Z|X,C)$. Thus, we define a pair of dense layers (`fc41` and `fc42`) that compute $\mu_{\chi}(Z|X,C)$ and $\sigma_{\chi}(Z|X,C)$ respectively, and pass the computed values through sigmoid activations to ensure that the estimated means lie between 0 and 1. We also concatenate the condition tensor $C$ with the latent code tensor $\mathbf{Z}_{\phi}$ before feeding it into the recognition network. The full implementation looks like this:

```python
class RecognitionNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, z_dim, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(z_dim+num_classes, 200)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(200)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(200, 200)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm1d(200)
        self.fc41 = nn.Linear(200, z_dim)
        self.fc42 = nn.Linear(200, z_dim)

    def forward(self, z, y):
        h = torch.cat([z,y], dim=-1)
        h = F.relu(self.bn1(self.fc1(h)))
        h = F.relu(self.bn2(self.fc2(h)))
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc41(h)), F.softplus(self.fc42(h)+0.5)
```

Finally, we combine all these pieces together and put them into the main CVAE class. Here, we instantiate an instance of each module and call their forward functions appropriately. The constructor of the class accepts two arguments, namely the dimensionality of the latent code and the number of classes in the data. The forward function takes in an input image tensor `x`, a binary label tensor `y`, and returns a tuple containing the reconstructed image tensor `recon_x` and the sampled latent code tensor `z`. The latter is obtained by sampling from the approximate posterior distribution calculated by the recognition network. We use another set of labels `y'` to construct a second copy of the input image to help stabilize the estimation of the latent codes. The final implementation looks something like this:


```python
class CVAE(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, z_dim, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = Encoder(z_dim, num_classes)
        self.decoder = Decoder(z_dim, num_classes)
        self.recognition = RecognitionNet(z_dim, num_classes)
        
    def encode(self, x, y):
        mu, logvar = self.encoder(x.view(-1, 784), y)
        std = torch.exp(0.5*logvar)
        eps = torch.randn_like(std)
        z = eps.mul(std).add_(mu)
        return z
    
    def decode(self, z, y):
        recon_x = self.decoder(z, y)
        return recon_x
    
    def reparameterize(self, mu, logvar):
        std = torch.exp(0.5*logvar)
        eps = torch.randn_like(std)
        return eps.mul(std).add_(mu)
    
    def forward(self, x, y):
        z = self.encode(x, y)
        z_prime = self.reparameterize(*self.recognition(z, y))
        y_prime = torch.ones_like(y)*torch.randint(low=0,high=num_classes,size=(len(y),)).long().cuda()
        #helping the estimator to stay consistent
        recon_x = self.decode(z_prime, y_prime)
        return recon_x, z
