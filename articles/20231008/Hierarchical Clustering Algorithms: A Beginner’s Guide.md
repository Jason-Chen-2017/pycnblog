# 1.背景介绍


Hierarchical clustering refers to a set of clustering algorithms that use the relationships between objects in a dataset to build an agglomerative tree-based hierarchy. It is commonly used for data analysis and visualization tasks such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), pattern recognition, or market segmentation. In this article, we will review popular hierarchical clustering methods such as single linkage, complete linkage, centroid linkage, average linkage, and median linkage. We also discuss their properties and compare them with each other. Finally, we will provide sample code implementations using Python programming language.

In the field of machine learning and data science, there are numerous applications of hierarchical clustering, including but not limited to customer segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation, DNA sequencing data analysis, and gene expression profiling. Therefore, it's essential to understand how these methods work under the hood, so that they can be applied to real-world problems effectively. 

Hence, I hope you find this article useful! Let us begin our journey...

# 2.Core Concepts & Connection
Let's first have a look at some core concepts and definitions related to hierarchical clustering before moving on to its algorithmic details.
2.1. What Is Hierarchical Clustering?
Hierarchical clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique that involves building a hierarchy of clusters from a given set of observations or data points. The goal is to group similar data points into one cluster while minimizing the similarity between different clusters. The resulting tree structure makes it easy to identify patterns and trends within the data.

2.2. Types of Hierarchical Clustering Methods
There are several types of hierarchical clustering techniques available: 

 - Single Linkage: This method determines whether two groups should be merged based on the smallest distance between any pair of elements in both groups. If two clusters have been identified as having too small a minimum distance between their most similar members, then they are combined. 

 - Complete Linkage: This method determines whether two groups should be merged based on the largest distance between any pair of elements in both groups. Compared to single linkage, it ensures that all pairs of distances between clusters are less than or equal to the maximum distance among all possible pairs.

 - Centroid Linkage: This method uses the mean of the coordinates of each object to determine which cluster an element belongs to. Similarly, it merges two clusters if their centroids are closer together.

 - Average Linkage: This method assigns a new point to the cluster whose mean distance from the two original elements is closest to the sum of the distances to each original element.

 - Median Linkage: This method finds the pair of clusters that has the median distance between their respective medians. It merges those two clusters.

2.3. Dendrograms and Clusters 
Dendrograms are graphical representations of hierarchical clusterings. Each node represents a cluster, and branches represent successively smaller subclusters until individual data points are represented by terminal nodes. By following the branches of the dendrogram, analysts can easily identify the composition of each cluster and explore the hierarchy.

2.4. Properties of Different Hierarchical Clustering Methods
The choice of the appropriate hierarchical clustering method depends on various factors such as the size of the dataset, the level of detail required in the analysis, and the goals of the researcher. Some common properties of different hierarchical clustering methods include:

 - Metric versus Nonmetric: There are many nonmetric measures for determining the distance between two data points, whereas Euclidean distance is usually used for metric hierarchical clustering methods.

 - Deterministic versus Probabilistic: Deterministic hierarchical clustering methods produce clear cut boundaries between clusters while probabilistic clustering methods may split a cluster into multiple parts.

 - Overlapping Versus Nonoverlapping: Nonoverlapping hierarchical clustering produces distinct clusters where no data point exists in more than one cluster. On the other hand, overlapping hierarchical clustering may allow data points to belong to multiple clusters.

 - Time Complexity: All hierarchical clustering methods require O(n^3) time complexity due to the recursive nature of the algorithm. However, newer advancements like incremental clustering techniques and approximate clustering methods can reduce the computational cost significantly.

2.5. Sample Datasets for Hierarchical Clustering Experimentation
Before we move on to hierarchical clustering algorithms, let's test out our understanding of these concepts on some sample datasets. Here are three popular benchmark datasets that are often used for evaluating hierarchical clustering methods:

 - Rainfall Dataset: This dataset contains daily rainfall records across several cities over a period of 7 years. The goal is to segment the weather data into seasons based on historical data.

 - Customer Segmentation Dataset: This dataset includes demographic information about customers along with purchase history. The goal is to identify customer segments based on past behavior and preferences.

 - Document Clustering Dataset: This dataset consists of news articles written by different authors and grouped into categories based on keywords. The goal is to automatically classify news articles into different topics.
