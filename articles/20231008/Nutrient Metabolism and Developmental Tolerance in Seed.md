# 1.背景介绍


African tree fern (Betula auricola), commonly known as Betula aurea or Tagetese trees, are native to East Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. In tropical climates such as the western Mediterranean, they have a unique beauty that is highly prized for its beautiful flowers, colorful leaves, graceful branches, fragrant foliage and soft green velvety skins with lush hanging fruits like jasmine blossoms and sweet-scented berries.

To study their nutrient metabolism mechanisms and developmental tolerance under various environments, researchers have collected seeds from different species over time using potting methodology. They analyzed the microbial and chemical composition of these seedlings by conducting cultivation in isolation cells or in large glass vats. From analyses of these results, scientists have discovered several important features:

1. Different species display different patterns of nutrient concentrations within their seeds and sprouts, making them ideal for differential investigation into the effects of environment on nutrient uptake rates and utilization efficiency.

2. The majority of taxa of African tree ferns exhibit low toxicity against many pathogens including ants, caterpillars, snakes, mice and boilers. However, certain types can show high levels of bioterrorism due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the plant stems. Therefore, it is essential to carefully manage ecosystems and protect plants against potential threats.

3. Many genes involved in carbohydrate synthesis are enriched in the seeds of some species compared to others. As a result, differences between the methanogenesis of different species could have significant consequences for the overall structure and function of the ecosystem. It would also be interesting to understand how this affects developmental traits such as height and morphological diversity among fern populations.

In this work, we will focus on one specific species – the Carolina tree fern, which has the longest wildlife lifespan and wide range of habitat use. We will further explore its reproductive cycle through closely observing its seedling stage, along with its responses to water stress and early puberty. This analysis will provide insights into the role of water availability, temperature, and light conditions on the development of this fern’s seedling cohort. We will identify factors that affect seed size, root growth, root architecture, and grain quality in relation to its physiological requirements during sexual reproduction. Finally, we will evaluate whether any of these factors contribute to its adaptation to varying environments across different seasons and cultivars. These data may reveal new insight into the genetic control of fern development and suggest ways to improve the food security of African tree ferns through better nutritional management techniques.

Our goal in writing this article was to provide a detailed explanation of the key processes behind the response of this fern to different environments. We hope that our effort will help to raise awareness about the importance of careful management and monitoring of African tree ferns throughout their life cycles. With the right knowledge, innovative practices, and best-practices, African tree ferns could become more resilient and capable of adapting to changing environments and face lesser risks than other similar trees. By sharing information, we want to inspire people to adopt a responsible approach towards managing natural resources and take steps towards mitigating biotic threats.


# 2.核心概念与联系
To begin with, let's first define some key concepts related to our topic.

1. **Nutrient Metabolism:** Nutrients include both soluble and insoluble components. Soluble components refer to those organic compounds found in most living things that can be easily digested by cells. Examples of soluble nutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, etc. On the other hand, insoluble nutrients cannot be easily absorbed directly into cells, but must pass through complex transport systems involving organelles called tissues. For instance, arsenic, lead, mercury, copper, and selenium are considered insoluble nutrients.

2. **Developmental Tolerance:** Developmental tolerance refers to the capacity of a plant to tolerate changes in environmental conditions without extensive damage caused by extreme weather events or diseases. Plants often respond differently when they grow at different stages of development, i.e., embryonic vs late juvenile phases, tillering periods, fruit set and ripening season, etc. To enhance developmental tolerance, proper care needs to be taken while growing plants.

3. **Seed Size:** Seed size refers to the total amount of material in the stem, including the cytoplasm and cell membrane, inside the ovary tissue. It is typically measured in milligrams per cubic centimeter (mg/cm^3). Seed size plays a crucial role in determining the nutrients that can be taken up by the plants, specifically carbohydrates and proteins. Large seeds require larger spaces for storage and processing, thereby allowing for greater amounts of available nutrients.

4. **Root Growth and Architecture:** Root growth refers to the process of developing roots in a live plant, starting from the soil surface or shoot apex. During this process, the root hair develops around the central axis of the plants, providing protection from predators and supporting the plant in extreme weather conditions where it might be attacked by wind and storms. Root architecture consists of multiple layers of the tissue surrounding the root, from the basement membrane to the epidermis. Layers of the root system interact together to form a framework that supports the root tissue. Changes in root architecture can influence the development of a fern's fruit set, yield strength, floral characteristics, and immune system.

5. **Grain Quality:** Grain quality refers to the physical appearance and properties of a fern's grains, including particle size, shape, consistency, and texture. Grains play a critical role in defining the overall character and nutritional value of a fern's seed, especially if freshly harvested. Flavor and odor characteristics also depend heavily upon the microbiomes present within the leaf tip, as well as the type of oil used to cook the fern.

6. **Sexual Reproduction Cycle:** The sexual reproduction cycle involves the fertilization, male gamete production, and female gamete development before ovulation occurs. At each stage, seeds develop in the style of the fern family, with elongated veins running parallel to the ground, eventually resulting in a ring of hairs above the head region of the flower. Ovulation occurs approximately every 27 days and involves releasing eggs containing Zygomycetes, which bind together with Lactobacillus casei producing chloroplasts and spores ready for fertilization. The pollen produced from egg collection forms a cream-like substance containing honeydew and lobelia, which becomes an inflorescence in spring. Once females hatch, they release ovules, which become gametes that enter the zygote and produce a full-grown daughter plant. 

With these definitions in mind, we can now move on to exploring the scientific findings and evaluating what went wrong and what can be done to prevent it happening again.

Now let's talk about the actual science behind our experiment and analyze the outcomes based on the observations made. Here are the main points that need to be addressed: 

1. **Microbial Composition Analysis**: Firstly, we observed that only small quantities of Bacteroides fragilis were found in the seeds of all three species studied. Other viruses and bacteria like Escherichia coli and Salmonella were not detected. One possible reason for this could be because these bacteria colonize the seeds of the young ferns very quickly and transfer them to the plants for storage and reuse. Another possibility is that these bacteria are susceptible to being introduced later in life stages or by direct human contact. We can confirm this hypothesis by looking for evidence of antibiotic usage in the seed samples or collecting additional samples from older ferns to validate the existence of these bacteria. If confirmed, we should look for alternative methods of preparing and storing the seeds for future use.

2. **Chemical Composition Analysis**: Next, we looked at the chemical makeup of the seeds and sprouts to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying the response of ferns to different environments. Overall, we noticed that although the chemical composition varied significantly between species, the major constituents remained consistent and matched the guidelines recommended by the International Code of Botany. For example, there were a smaller proportion of sulfur, chlorine, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, calcium, and zinc in the seeds compared to sprouts. There were no discernable differences in pH values or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present. Additionally, we found that most of the same VOCs were present in all three species, even though their exact ratios changed slightly due to variations in seed size and humidity level. Some common examples of VOCs present in fern seeds include formaldehyde, ethanol, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, ammonia, dimethylsulfoxide, and ethyl alcohol.

3. **Phytate Concentration Analysis**: Lastly, we wanted to compare the distribution of phenolic acid and phytohormones in the seeds and sprouts to see if the presence of these compounds affected the rate of nutrient consumption and utilization. Surprisingly, we found that both seeds and sprouts contained higher levels of phenolic acid compared to sugars and starches, indicating a strong preference for increased fermentability and energy output. Similarly, we also observed a lower concentration of phytohormones in the sprouts compared to seeds, implying a slower recycling of nutrients after maturity. Despite this contrast, we did find that the levels of phytohormones were correlated with specific gene expression profiles, suggesting that these compounds regulate different aspects of fern development.

Based on our observations, we decided to perform another experiment to address some of the issues identified earlier. Specifically, we wanted to test the effectiveness of increasing the quantity of sugar content added to the seeds of the Carolina fern compared to traditional seeds. Additionally, we wanted to assess the impact of reducing the proportion of magnesium in the seeds on the development of the fern's fruit set and seed size. We started by choosing two existing clones of the Carolina fern - a commercially grown variety that had been around for several years, and a clone purchased recently for limited distribution. Both clones were left to establish themselves and reproduce normally during the next few weeks. Then, we injected high quantities (~20% higher than normal) of polyphenols into both seeds simultaneously and allowed the ferns to establish itself. After four months of established population, we collected the seeds and placed them into a controlled environment with minimal air exposure.

After two months of medium air exposure, we ran the DNA extraction protocol on the individual seeds and extracted 1 mg/mL DNA per sample. After filtering out host DNA, we calculated the GC content and determined the total number of C and G bases using an online calculator. Based on these results, we then classified the individual seeds based on their respective GC contents. Low GC content (less than 40%) indicated traditional seeds, whereas high GC contents (greater than 55%) indicated seeds with a higher proportion of sugars relative to the traditional fern model. We repeated this experiment on both clones to obtain reliable data for comparison.

Using the same experimental design, we asked the subjects to manipulate the proportions of magnesium and salt content in the seeds. We specified that the final product should contain no more than 2% of magnesium or more than 3% of salt. We randomly assigned groups of participants who received either the traditional fern seed or a high magnesium/salt combination. Each group was given five treatments consisting of increasing amounts of salts until they reached their target proportions of salt and then gradually decreased the salt amount. We tested the effectiveness of these manipulations by measuring the weight loss achieved by the participants during the course of the experiment.

Finally, we conducted an additional experiment to examine the effectiveness of altering the abundance of dietary fiber in the feed for the young ferns. In previous experiments, we have seen that supplementation of fiber provides beneficial effects on the development of young ferns, particularly the fruit set and body mass index (BMI). Therefore, we were interested in testing whether a higher fibrous diet could compensate for reduced fiber intake by individuals. We conducted the following experiment:

We selected two clones of the Carolina fern, a commercial variety and a newly purchased brand, and gave them standard feeds containing normal dietary fibers. All participants were instructed to eat the entire diet for two consecutive days, followed by a 1 day fast. We recorded the daily weight change obtained by each participant and averaged the results to determine the average weight gain over the entire period. To increase the proportion of fiber intake, we provided a high proportion of semi-solid fiber products, such as coco butter, to meet the US Department of Agriculture's recommendation of >10% of dietary fiber. We repeated this experiment on both clones and examined the relationship between dietary fiber intake and weight gain for both clones.

The results showed that supplementation of semi-solid fiber with normal dietary intake yielded higher weights compared to the traditional dietary intake. Moreover, a higher fibrous diet did not necessarily translate into higher weight gains, as the benefits of fiber may outweigh the cost of increased dietary intake. Nonetheless, these initial findings indicate that higher density of abundant sources of fiber may provide valuable benefits for fern reproduction.

These experiments demonstrated that changes in seed nutrition have significant consequences for the development of the fern, including changes in its reproductive cycle and responses to diet modifications. Interventions targeting nutrient balance in seed and sprout formulations, selective breeding programs to favor seeds with particular nutrient contents, and improved post-harvest processing and storage strategies may be able to reduce the risk of negative impacts caused by poor nutrition choices and promote adaptive evolution of African tree ferns in the long term.
