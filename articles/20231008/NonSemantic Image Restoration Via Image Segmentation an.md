# 1.背景介绍



Non-Semantic Image Restoration (NISR) is a popular problem in computer vision where an input image with no explicit content information needs to be restored. One common way for achieving this goal is by using semantic restoration methods which assume that the non-semantic content of the original image can be inferred from its surrounding contextual information or textured regions. However, these approaches are limited by the assumption that the object boundaries between different textures are well defined, making them less effective in realistic scenarios where objects may have irregular shapes or textures. Moreover, most of these techniques require training data annotated with object labels, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. In contrast, we propose a novel approach based on image segmentation that separates different foreground objects within the scene and then synthesizes texture maps for each segmented region by applying local deformation models such as deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The resulting texture map is then merged back into the corresponding segmented region to reconstruct the original image. This approach eliminates the need for any external supervision or annotation, and it produces high-quality results even without any textural details provided in the input image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several challenging datasets including natural images, hyperspectral imagery, and medical imaging.


In summary, our proposed technique uses both image segmentation and texture synthesis to restore an input image with non-semantic content, eliminating the requirement for explicit ground truth annotations or pre-defined textures. It outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of quality and efficiency while still being computationally efficient enough to handle large images at high resolutions. Our work provides a new paradigm for NISR research and opens up new possibilities for exploring more complex visual effects in unstructured scenes.

## Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation refers to the task of classifying every pixel of an image into one of multiple categories, typically based on their spatial relationships or characteristics. The output is usually represented as a labelled image where each pixel has been assigned a unique label representing the category to which it belongs. For example, given an RGB image as input, semantic segmentation would produce a grayscale image where each pixel has been labeled according to whether it contains foreground objects such as people, animals, vehicles, etc., or background pixels. In order to perform semantic segmentation effectively, it is necessary to have clear definitions for all possible classes, meaning that it is not always straightforward to determine what constitutes a foreground object versus a background pixel. By assigning distinctive features to each class, however, the process becomes much easier.

## Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs)
A DCNN is a type of artificial neural network (ANN), commonly used in computer vision tasks, particularly in image classification and segmentation applications. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes that apply filters over an input image, producing feature maps that capture meaningful aspects of the underlying structure of the image. Different layers of the network learn increasingly abstract representations of the image, until they eventually converge on a single, highly specific representation, allowing the network to classify the image or predict the location of relevant objects. A wide range of architectures exist, depending on the complexity and size of the model, but many modern CNNs use residual connections and pooling layers to prevent vanishing gradients and improve performance.

## Local Deformation Models
Local deformation models are mathematical functions that describe how an object in an image changes under small perturbations due to the presence of certain physical properties. They are widely used in image processing and computer graphics, where they provide significant benefits compared to simple geometric transformations like rotation, scaling, and translation. Examples include wavelets, diffusion maps, and Markov random fields. Each of these models assumes that an object exists as a localized point set in an image domain, whose shape and appearance can vary locally around the point without changing the overall topology of the object. Given an initial shape of the object, a local deformation model can generate variations of the object's appearance at nearby locations based on different factors, such as distance and orientation.

In our approach, we use a patch-based formulation of Markov random field (MRF) to represent the deformable surface of each object in the scene. An MRF consists of a set of variables representing the probability distribution of each pixel in the object's local neighbourhood, and a set of energy functions that define how the variables interact during inference and optimization. At each iteration of the algorithm, we update the variable distributions based on the current estimate of the surfaces' displacement fields obtained from the trained DCNNs. To ensure that the predicted surfaces do not leave the image boundary, we enforce a zero-flux condition that forces the variables to remain confined inside the bounding box of the object. This ensures that the predicted texture does not extend beyond the visible area of the object.

Each pixel corresponds to a variable in the MRF model; the values of these variables indicate probabilities of different states for each pixel. The edges of the graph correspond to potential interactions between neighboring pixels. During inference, we optimize the parameters of the MRF model to maximize the likelihood of observing the observed image under the prior assumptions about the noise level, smoothness of structures, and intensity variation within the object.
