# 1.背景介绍


Clustering (聚类) is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms in data mining and statistical analysis. It aims to partition a dataset into subsets (clusters), such that objects in each cluster are similar in some way (measured by some similarity measure like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity). The goal of clustering is to discover “hidden” patterns or structure within the data. Clustering techniques have many applications including image segmentation, market segmentation, bioinformatics, text categorization, and fraud detection. However, not all clustering methods provide good results on different types of datasets due to their assumptions about how clusters should be formed and how data points relate to each other. In this article, we will focus on maximum entropy modeling as an alternative approach for formulating clusters based on given observations. Maximum entropy models provide a theoretical framework for defining clusters with complex shapes, non-convex boundaries, and irregular distributions. We can use maximum entropy modeling to learn natural groupings from unstructured data without any prior knowledge about the underlying structure of the data. This technique can handle high dimensional data with noise and outliers, making it useful for handling large real-world problems. 

Maximum entropy modeling can also be used to optimize the number of clusters in a dataset. A commonly used metric for evaluating clustering quality is the so-called modularity score. Modularity measures the agreement between the actual grouping of nodes and the predicted grouping using a recursive formula involving mutual information between pairs of nodes. By maximizing the modularity score subject to constraints on the size and density of each cluster, we can find the optimal number of clusters in a dataset.

In this article, we will introduce both maximum entropy modeling and its application in clustering. We will discuss several key concepts, algorithms, and mathematical details relevant to maximum entropy modeling and its application in clustering. Finally, we will present example code implementations and explanations for applying maximum entropy clustering in Python.


# 2. Core Concepts and Relationships
## 2.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence
Kullback-Leibler divergence is a measure of how two probability distributions differ when we apply a transformation function to one distribution but not the other. It was first introduced by MacKay in his seminal work "Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms". In clustering, it is used to quantify the difference between the empirical distribution of the observations in a cluster and the expected distribution under the assumption of randomness. Specifically, let $\theta$ denote the true model parameters and $p(x|\theta)$ denote the joint probability distribution over all variables in the system conditioned on the parameter values $\theta$. Let $\pi_k(\theta)$ denote the conditional probability distribution of the $k$-th cluster (with fixed parameter value $\theta$) over all variables in the system. Then, the KL divergence $\operatorname{KL}(q||p)$ between the empirical distribution $q$, defined as
$$q_{\cdot k}=n_k/N,\quad n_k\text{ is the count of samples assigned to cluster } k,$$
where $N$ is the total number of samples, and the corresponding discrete probability mass function, and the expected distribution $p$, which takes the form
$$p_{\cdot k}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^Nw_ip(x_i|w_i,\theta)}{\sum_{j=1}^M\sum_{i=1}^Nw_ip(x_i|w_i,\theta)},\quad w_i\text{ is the weight associated with sample } i.$$
Here, $M$ is the number of clusters and $w_i$ represents the importance of observation $x_i$ towards determining the membership to a particular cluster. We assume that $w_i$ follows a Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter equal to the number of clusters ($\alpha$). Thus, $p_{\cdot k}$ incorporates uncertainty in assigning weights to individual observations towards each cluster. The KL divergence between these two distributions gives us an idea of how well our clustering algorithm has captured the intrinsic relationship among the data points. Lower values of the KL divergence indicate better clustering. 


## 2.2 Minimum Description Length Principle
The minimum description length principle states that if there exist a set of variables that fully characterizes the behavior of a system, then a shorter string encoding this set of variables is likely to occur more frequently than would be expected by chance alone. For instance, suppose we want to transmit a message containing three letters: 'A', 'B', and 'C'. One possible coding scheme could be 'ABC' followed by eight zeros indicating unused bits. If we were trying to minimize the number of times we need to repeat this sequence randomly, then 'BCACAB' would be preferred since it requires fewer bits than 'ABC'. Similarly, if we want to represent a cluster using a mixture of Gaussians, then we might choose a code consisting of the means and variances of the Gaussian components, along with a prior assignment of each data point to one of these components. Given enough training examples, the likelihood of generating new examples according to the same code will tend to increase beyond chance, leading to higher probabilities of correctly identifying the correct cluster assignments for novel test instances.


## 2.3 Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Maximum likelihood estimation is a widely used methodology in machine learning that involves finding the best estimate of the model parameters that explain the observed data. In clustering, we seek to maximize the likelihood of observing the observed data assuming the specific structure and relationships implied by the clustering algorithm. We do this through optimization of a cost function that evaluates the probability of seeing the data under a specified model. One common cost function for clustering is the negative log-likelihood, which is proportional to the cross-entropy between the empirical distribution and the expected distribution. We maximize this cost function by adjusting the parameters of the model until the likelihood of the observed data under the model becomes highest. Once the model is trained, we can evaluate its performance on new data using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., depending on the nature of the task at hand.


# 3. Maximum Entropy Modeling Algorithm
To derive a probabilistic model for clustering using maximum entropy, we start by considering a set of $M$ data points $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N\}$. Each data point $x_i$ consists of $d$ features or attributes $[x_i^{(1)}, x_i^{(2)}, \ldots, x_i^{(d)}]$. Assuming that we know the ground truth class label $c_i$ for each data point $x_i$, the problem of clustering them into $M$ distinct groups is considered. Since we don't necessarily know the true class labels, we may only observe a subset of the available data points $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\mathcal{O}\}$, where $\mathcal{O}<N$. Our objective is to develop a probabilistic model for inferring the hidden class labels for the remaining data points. To simplify notation, let $z_i\in\{1,2,\ldots,M\}$ denote the inferred class label for data point $x_i$ while $c_i$ denotes the true class label. Using Bayes' rule, we can write the likelihood of observing $z_i$ and $c_i$ as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}&\log p(z_i=k|c_i)\log p(c_i=k)\\&\propto p(z_i=k|c_i)p(c_i=k)=p(x_i|z_i=k, c_i=k)p(z_i=k)p(c_i=k)\\&=(2\pi)^{-d/2}\det(S_k)^{-1/2}exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x_i-\mu_k)^T S_k^{-1}(x_i-\mu_k))p(z_i=k)p(c_i=k)\\&\forall k=1,2,\ldots, M.\end{aligned}$$
where $S_k$ is the shared covariance matrix of the clusters, $\mu_k$ is the mean vector of the $k$-th cluster, and $(x_i-\mu_k)^T S_k^{-1}(x_i-\mu_k)$ denotes the squared Mahalanobis distance between $x_i$ and the $k$-th cluster. We note that the term $(2\pi)^{-d/2}\det(S_k)^{-1/2}$ appears because we assumed that the data points belong to a zero-mean multivariate normal distribution with full covariance matrices, which leads to an exponential decay of the likelihood with increasing dimensionality.

Since we only observe a subset of the original dataset $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\mathcal{O}\}$, we cannot compute the complete joint probability distribution $p(x_i|z_i,c_i)$ directly. Instead, we make use of the concept of maximum entropy, which provides an intuitive explanation of why the above equation holds. Recall that the KL divergence $\operatorname{KL}(q||p)$ between two probability distributions $q$ and $p$ gives us an idea of how much we lose by approximating $q$ with $p$. Intuitively, we want to approximate $q$ as closely as possible to $p$ while ensuring that the resultant approximation maintains the properties of $q$ such as its support and normalization. Therefore, we can consider the reverse direction of KL divergence, which tells us what degree of dissimilarity there exists between $q$ and $p$. More specifically, we define the joint probability distribution $q_{\cdot k}$ as the proportion of data points in the observed set $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\mathcal{O}\}$ that fall into the $k$-th cluster, and hence satisfy $z_i=k$. Taking the negative logarithm of the joint distribution $q_{\cdot k}$ gives us the Shannon entropy $H(q_{\cdot k})$, which serves as a measure of the amount of information contained in $q_{\cdot k}$. 

Based on the definition of entropy, we can show that the lower bound on the Shannon entropy $H(q_{\cdot k})$ satisfies the following expression:
$$H(q_{\cdot k})\geq -\sum_{i=1}^N q_{\cdot k}(z_i)\log q_{\cdot k}(z_i)=-\sum_{i=1}^N q_{\cdot k}(z_i)\log\left(\sum_{l=1}^Mq_{\cdot l}\right)=-E_q[\log\sum_{l=1}^Mq_{\cdot l}]$$
where the expectation $E_q[\cdot]$ refers to the average value of $\cdot$ taken across the distribution $q$. Note that the second line uses the fact that $q_{\cdot l}$ forms a proper probability distribution and integrates to 1, whereas $q_{\cdot k}$ does not. 

Now, taking the derivative of this upper bound with respect to the mixing coefficients $q_{\cdot k}$, we obtain the following update rules for the mixing coefficients:
$$\frac{\partial H(q_{\cdot k})}{\partial q_{\cdot k}}=p_{\cdot k}-q_{\cdot k}.$$
We interpret these equations as saying that if we knew the true labels for the remaining data points, then minimizing the shannon entropy would require us to assign equal weights to all classes in the entire dataset regardless of their sizes. Instead, we would prefer to allocate larger amounts of probability mass to smaller classes based on their relative frequencies in the observed data. Mathematically, this is equivalent to setting the prior probability $p(c_i)$ to reflect our beliefs regarding the true class labels before observing the data.

Using these ideas, we can derive the maximum entropy clustering algorithm as follows. First, we initialize the probability vectors $q_{\cdot k}$ uniformly such that they sum up to 1. Next, we repeatedly perform the following steps:
1. Compute the weighted marginal distributions $p_{\cdot k}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^Nw_ix_{ic_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^Nw_i},\quad w_i\text{ is the weight associated with sample } i.$
2. Update the probability vectors $q_{\cdot k}$ using the updating rules derived earlier.
3. Normalize the updated probability vectors $q_{\cdot k}$ so that they still sum up to 1.
4. Repeat step 2 and step 3 until convergence.
Once the algorithm converges, the estimated probability vectors $q_{\cdot k}$ correspond to the posterior probability of observing data point $x_i$ in the $k$-th cluster, while the mixing coefficient $p_{\cdot k}$ corresponds to the relative frequency of data points in the $k$-th cluster. These parameters capture the salient characteristics of the data distribution and help us to infer the hidden structures in the data space.
