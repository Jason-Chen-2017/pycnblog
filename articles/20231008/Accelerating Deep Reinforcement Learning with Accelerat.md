# 1.背景介绍


## Reinforcement learning (RL)
Reinforcement learning（RL）研究如何让智能体（agent）在一个环境中进行有监督学习并利用奖励信号和惩罚信号来指导其行为。它主要由两个组成部分构成：环境（environment）和智能体（agent）。环境是一个外界真实世界的状态集合，智能体可以执行一系列动作（action），从而影响环境的状态。通过不断尝试，智能体会慢慢学会如何选择最优的动作，以最大化收益。RL是一个高度研究的领域，也是当前各个领域中的热点。它的应用也非常广泛，包括游戏、机器人控制、推荐系统等。

RL有助于解决很多实际的问题，例如机器人控制、工厂自动化、资源管理、人机交互等。由于环境的复杂性，RL并不能直接用于所有场景，因此，研究者们提出了基于模仿学习的方法来解决RL难题。模仿学习旨在从经验数据中学习到模型（model），该模型可以准确预测环境的下一步动作。因此，模仿学习和强化学习是相辅相成的。

## Distributed training of deep reinforcement learning agents
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to learn complex behaviors from raw sensor data or language instructions. To train these DRL agents efficiently, researchers have turned to distributed training techniques that leverage large amounts of computation power and diverse computing architectures. These techniques aim to distribute the workload across multiple machines so that each machine can be used for a specific task, leading to faster training time compared to using just one machine. However, there is a tradeoff between scalability and performance: increased computational resources lead to higher utilization but may also increase communication overhead and reduce throughput. This means that an optimal combination of both hardware architecture and algorithm design must be found to achieve best results. 

In this paper, we propose a new acceleration technique called accelerated mini-batching (AMB) which can help improve the speed and efficiency of distributed RL training by reducing the amount of required computation. AMB breaks down batches into smaller microbatches during training, allowing individual workers to work on small portions of the batch at any given moment, improving parallelism and enabling pipeline parallelism. We then combine AMB with pipeline parallelism (P-P) to further reduce communication overheads, while still maintaining high performance. P-P enables us to parallelize the model update step of DRL algorithms, as well as other critical parts of the training process, resulting in significant improvements in overall training time. 

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we implement it on several popular DRL algorithms including PPO, IMPALA, and DDPG. Our experiments show that AMB combined with P-P significantly improves the speed and efficiency of distributed RL training without compromising agent performance. Specifically, we observe up to a 3x reduction in wallclock training time for various environments and settings. In addition, we find that P-P alone achieves similar improvement, indicating its usefulness in conjunction with AMB. Overall, our findings indicate that AMB and P-P offer a promising path towards efficient distributed RL training, which could pave the way for broader application of DRL in real-world problems.

## Batch training vs mini-batch training
Batch training refers to the traditional approach where all examples are processed together before updating the parameters of the neural network. The goal of batch training is to minimize the error between predicted actions and actual actions taken in the environment. On the other hand, mini-batch training involves processing only a subset of the examples at once and updating the weights after every few iterations or epochs. This reduces the memory footprint and makes the optimization more stable, especially when working with large datasets. While mini-batch size plays a crucial role in determining the convergence rate of the gradient descent algorithm, larger mini-batches generally result in slower convergence rates than smaller ones. As such, mini-batch sizes need to be adjusted depending on the available compute capacity and the desired level of accuracy.

## Pipeline parallelism
Pipeline parallelism is another type of parallelism that has been used to optimize distributed training for DRL algorithms. It involves breaking down the neural network computation into stages and executing them independently on different processors. Each stage performs computations on a different set of input data and combines the output to form the final prediction. By distributing the computation across multiple devices, pipeline parallelism allows for better resource utilization and reduced communication costs. 

We can compare pipeline parallelism and AMB in terms of how they divide the batch size into smaller chunks: AMB breaks down the entire dataset into smaller chunks known as microbatches, whereas pipeline parallelism divides the entire dataset into independent stages, where each device processes a distinct chunk of the dataset. Although both methods involve splitting the workload, they differ in how they use the splits: AMB uses these microbatches to generate gradients, while pipeline parallelism updates the model after each stage completes execution. Therefore, they serve different purposes and complement each other effectively in a hybrid approach.

## Gradient accumulation
Gradient accumulation involves accumulating the gradients computed for a single minibatch instead of applying them directly. The accumulated gradients are then applied in bulk later, making it easier to handle very large minibatches. Mathematically, let $g_t$ denote the gradient of the loss function w.r.t. parameter vector $\theta$ computed on a sample point $x_t$. Let $n$ denote the number of samples per minibatch. Then, we define an accumulator variable $\beta$, initialized to zero, and an updated version of the gradient $\tilde{g}_t = g_t / n + \beta(g_{t-1} / n)$, where $\tilde{g}_t$ represents the average gradient since the last accumulation step. After processing a full minibatch worth of samples, we reset $\beta$ to zero and apply the current value of $\tilde{g}_t$ to update the weight vector $\theta$: $\theta := \theta - \eta\tilde{g}_t$, where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

The intuition behind this concept is that if we calculate the gradients for a whole minibatch at once, the weights will not converge as fast. Instead, we can take advantage of the early stopping mechanism employed by modern optimizers like Adam and SGD and accumulate the gradients over time until the next minibatch is reached. This helps prevent getting stuck in local minima and prevents premature termination. Another benefit of gradient accumulation is that it allows us to adjust the learning rate dynamically based on the magnitude of the gradients. Finally, combining gradient accumulation with stochastic gradient descent can dramatically improve the speed and stability of training.

Here's how the grad accum algorithm works in pseudocode:

```python
grads = [] # initialize empty list of gradients
accumulated_loss = 0 # initialize accumulator to zero
for t in range(T):
    x, y = get_next_minibatch()
    loss, grad = forward_and_backward(x, y)
    grads += [grad]
    accumulated_loss += loss
    
    if ((t+1) % n == 0):
        avg_grad = sum([g/n for g in grads])
        theta -= lr * avg_grad
        grads = []
        accumulated_loss = 0
        
```

## Accelerate Mini-Batching with Pipeline Parallelism
Our previous section discussed about gradient accumulation as a separate operation that takes place outside the loop. Now we turn our attention to incorporating gradient accumulation within the same iteration. To do so, we break down the batch size into microbatches, pass each microbatch through the model separately, and finally accumulate the gradients before applying them back to the model. Here's how the pipeline parallelism algorithm works:

First, we create `N` replicas of the model, where `N` is the number of devices participating in the distributed system. Next, we split the minibatch into `M` microbatches of equal size, where `M` is less than or equal to the total number of replicas created earlier. For instance, suppose we have two devices and `total_replicas=4`, then `microbatch_size = total_replicas // num_devices`. Also, we maintain an accumulator array `accum_grads` of length `num_params` that holds the running sum of gradients across all devices. Initially, the values in this array would be zeros.

Next, we iterate over the microbatches and send each replica a copy of its corresponding microbatch. At the same time, we start forwarding each microbatch through the respective replica, waiting for the outputs of all microbatches to complete. Once all replicas have finished processing a microbatch, we collect the outputs and calculate the gradients using the provided loss function. Finally, we add these gradients to the corresponding entries in the `accum_grads` array. Note that we don't apply the gradients yet. Instead, we wait for all microbatches to finish processing before proceeding to the next iteration.

Once all microbatches are processed, we normalize the accumulated gradients by the number of replicas (`num_replicas`) and multiply by the learning rate to obtain the effective update for the global model. Finally, we call `optimizer.step()` to update the model parameters with the effective update obtained earlier.

Overall, the basic idea behind accelerated mini-batching with pipeline parallelism is to perform the backward pass separately for each microbatch, i.e., replicate the mini-batch processing and accumulate the gradients asynchronously. This leads to improved efficiency and reduced latency. Additionally, we can use a variety of optimizers like Adam, SGD, etc., with no change in the overall algorithm.
