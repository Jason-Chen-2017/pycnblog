# 1.背景介绍


Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is widely used in machine learning and pattern recognition to perform unsupervised clustering or hidden variable detection on data sets with latent variables. The EM algorithm is a powerful tool for unsupervised learning that can handle both continuous and discrete variables. It has many practical applications such as mixture modeling, topic modeling, and factor analysis. This article will introduce the basic theory behind the EM algorithm and implement it using Python code.

The purpose of this article is not only to present an advanced implementation of EM algorithm but also to provide insights into how we can apply it effectively to real world problems. We hope you find this article helpful!

## 2.1 概念介绍
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is named after <NAME> and Robert (Ravi & Lauradou, 1977). It belongs to a class of algorithms known as "expectation maximization" methods because they maximize the expected value of the complete log-likelihood function. Unlike other traditional optimization techniques like gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, which optimize a single cost function, EM optimizes two functions: 

1. E step - Compute the responsibilities based on the current estimate of the model parameters.
2. M step - Maximize the expected value of the complete log-likelihood function using the updated responsibilities. 

In general, these steps are repeated iteratively until convergence or some stopping criteria is met. To put it simply, EM algorithm attempts to learn the optimal set of cluster assignments by repeatedly updating its beliefs about the underlying clusters given new observations. It does so by estimating the probability distribution of each observation being assigned to each cluster and then adjusting those probabilities accordingly. This process ends when the estimated probabilities no longer change significantly between iterations.

## 2.2 模型概览
Let's assume we have a dataset $X=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$ where $x_i \in R^d$. Our goal is to discover patterns among the data and group them together according to their similarity. One approach to do this is by assuming there exist k true groups (clusters), denoted $\Theta=\{\theta_k\}_{k=1}^K$, and finding the values of parameters $\theta_{ik}$ for each data point x_i that best explain what group it belongs to. Specifically, we want to maximize the likelihood of the observed data points $X$ under a probabilistic model. The model assumes each data point $x_i$ comes from one of K different distributions over a fixed finite domain $\mathcal{X}_k$:

$$p(x_i|\theta_{ik}) = B(\theta_{ik}|x_i)=\frac{e^{-\frac{(x_i-\mu_{ik})^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu_{ik})}{2}}}{\sum_{\ell=1}^{K} e^{-\frac{(x_i-\mu_{\ell})^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu_{\ell})}{2}}}$$

where $\mu_{ik}$ is the mean vector of the i-th Gaussian distribution within the k-th group, $\Sigma$ is the shared covariance matrix across all groups, and $\sigma_{ik}$ is the variance parameter of the i-th Gaussian distribution within the k-th group.

To learn the parameters of our model, we need to assign each data point to a particular cluster based on its likelihood under each possible assignment. We represent this assignment probability using the responsibilities r_ik, which indicate the degree to which each data point is likely to belong to the k-th group.

$$r_{ik}=P(Z=k|X=x_i,\Theta) = \frac{p(x_i|\theta_{ik})p(\theta_{ik})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K}\sum_{n=1}^{N} p(x_n|\theta_{jk})p(\theta_{jk})}$$

We use these responsibilities to update our estimates of the parameters theta_{ik}:

$$\hat{\theta}_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} r_{ik}x_n }{\sum_{n=1}^{N} r_{ik}}$$

Once we've computed the parameters for all K clusters, we can evaluate the likelihood of the data under each possible configuration of cluster assignments and choose the one that results in the highest likelihood. Once again, we can repeat this process iteratively until convergence or some stopping criteria is met. This approach gives us a set of cluster assignments that reflects the most probable arrangement of the data. However, due to the presence of latent variables, this approach may not necessarily produce the best overall fit to the data. Therefore, we typically use cross validation techniques to ensure that our final solution provides good performance on unseen data.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

## 3.1 参数估计（E-step）
In order to compute the responsibilities, we first need to estimate the parameters for each cluster. Let's define $\phi_{ik}$ as the responsibility corresponding to the n-th data point and the k-th cluster. Then, the expected value of the complete log-likelihood function under the current model parameters can be written as follows:

$$Q(\Theta,\phi) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_{ik} \log p(x_i|\theta_{ik}) + \lambda\left(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left\|\Phi_{ik}-\mathbb{E}[B(\theta_{ik} | x)]\right\|_{F}^{2}+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left\|\Theta_{ik}-\mathbb{E}[\theta_{ik}]\right\|_{F}^{2}\right) $$

where $\lambda$ is a regularization term that controls the tradeoff between fitting the data well and having sparsity in the learned representation of the data. The expectations of the random variables $\Theta_{ik}$ and $B(\theta_{ik} | x)$ are calculated as follows:

$$\begin{align*} 
&\mathbb{E}[\theta_{ik}] = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} r_{ik}x_n}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} r_{ik}} \\ 
&\mathbb{E}[B(\theta_{ik} | x)] = p(x_i|\theta_{ik}).
\end{align*}$$

To calculate the responsibilities, we use numerical integration to approximate the integral involving the density function $p(x_i|\theta_{ik})$. Specifically, we use the Monte Carlo approximation method:

$$\begin{align*}
&q(\theta_{ik}) = p(x_i|\theta_{ik})\\
&\int q(\theta_{ik})f(\theta_{ik},z)\mathrm{d}(\theta_{ik}, z)\\
=&\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^{M}\frac{q(z^{(m)}|\theta_{ik})\prod_{l=1}^{L} q(\theta_{il}|\theta_{lk})}{f(\theta_{il}|\theta_{lk})}
\end{align*}$$

where $(z^{(m)},\theta_{lk})$ are sampled from the conditional distribution $p(\theta_{ik}|\theta_{lk})$. After computing the above equation for all data points and clusters, we obtain the following expression for the responsibilities:

$$\phi_{ik} = \frac{q(Z=k|X=x_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{K}q(Z=j|X=x_i)}$$

which indicates the fraction of the total evidence contained in the k-th group for the i-th data point. Note that since we're dealing with probabilities rather than actual counts, the sum over all K clusters should add up to 1. Also note that the responsibilities depend only on the current estimate of the parameters $\theta_{ik}$, and hence, do not involve any uncertainty quantification.

## 3.2 模型训练（M-step）
After calculating the responsibilities, we proceed to update our estimates of the parameters $\Theta_{ik}$. The formula for updating the parameters is straightforward:

$$\Theta_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} r_{ik}x_n }{\sum_{n=1}^{N} r_{ik}}$$

Note that once we've computed the parameters for all K clusters, we can evaluate the likelihood of the data under each possible configuration of cluster assignments and choose the one that results in the highest likelihood. Once again, we can repeat this process iteratively until convergence or some stopping criteria is met.
