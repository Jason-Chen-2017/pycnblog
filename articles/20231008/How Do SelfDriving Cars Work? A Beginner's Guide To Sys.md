# 1.背景介绍


Self-driving cars (SDCs) are becoming increasingly popular in recent years with the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. They can be classified into two types: computer vision systems that use camera inputs to identify objects or features and produce actions such as driving, while other types employ sensors such as radar, lidar, and GPS for perception tasks. In this article, we will focus on one particular type of SDCs called "lane following" vehicles that utilize cameras to detect lanes and control their movement within a road network. We will discuss how these SDCs work under the hood and what challenges they face along with their solutions. 

The basic idea behind self-driving cars is simple. The car should be able to drive itself by analyzing its surroundings using various sensors and interpreting information from them. For instance, when it detects a sign that tells it to turn right, it should slow down and apply brakes until it reaches the correct angle to avoid accidents. Similarly, the system should also learn from previous experience so that it does not make mistakes repeatedly. However, building an AI-powered self-driving car requires a combination of knowledge and technology that goes beyond just software engineering. This involves designing algorithms, architectures, hardware components, and integrating them together to create a robust system that can handle complex situations like traffic jams and changing weather conditions. Here is a general overview of how lane following SDCs work:

1. Perception: The SDC uses images captured by its front-facing camera to determine where the road edges are, which allows it to locate obstacles ahead of it and plan its route around them. It then extracts specific features from each image, including lines, curves, and surfaces that help it understand the world around it better. 

2. Planning: After identifying relevant features, the system creates a path through the scene by planning a sequence of maneuvers that moves the vehicle smoothly from point to point. These include things like keeping track of obstacles and ensuring a safe distance between itself and others, staying on course, etc. 

3. Control: Once the system has planned a route, it applies controls to its actuators, such as steering wheel and throttle, based on feedback received from the environment. This includes information about the speed and position of nearby vehicles, current road curvature, and any potential obstructions that could interfere with the desired path. 

4. Learning: As the car drives along the route, it learns what worked well and what did not. This enables it to adapt to new scenarios and improve performance over time. By combining sensor data, learned behaviors, and trial-and-error techniques, self-driving cars achieve impressive levels of accuracy and safety without ever needing to be taught.

However, there exist several challenges faced by these SDCs that need to be addressed before they become commercially successful. Some of the most significant issues are:

1. Dynamic Environmental Conditions: Since self-driving cars operate in dynamic environments, such as urban areas, stormy seas, highway intersections, and rush hour trains, they must have the ability to adapt quickly to changes in the environment. They must constantly monitor their surroundings and adjust their behavior accordingly to ensure that they do not cause harm to themselves or others. 

2. Latency and Accuracy Requirements: Self-driving cars require high latency and low input lag times due to their constant monitoring of the environment. They must provide real-time decisions and actionable insights within milliseconds, which poses new challenges for both processing power and communication bandwidth. Additionally, since the task at hand is highly complex, there exists a tradeoff between making accurate predictions and handling uncertainty. 

3. Scalability and Robustness: Despite the advances made in computer vision and deep neural networks, building reliable and scalable self-driving systems remains challenging. Current SDC architectures rely heavily on cloud computing and distributed computing frameworks, which add further complexity and overhead to the overall architecture. Even with the latest advancements, even the smallest and lightest of SDC units still struggle to keep up with modern demands for precision and speed. 

4. Privacy and Security Concerns: Self-driving cars collect and process large amounts of personal data, including photos, videos, text messages, GPS coordinates, and audio recordings. They must implement strong security measures to protect sensitive user data and prevent unauthorized access or damage.
