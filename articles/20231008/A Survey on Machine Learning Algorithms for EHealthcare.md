# 1.背景介绍


This article is a survey of machine learning algorithms used in e-healthcare data analysis. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview and critical evaluation of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms in real-world applications such as diagnosis prediction from medical images or disease detection from textual notes. With regard to current research progress and future directions, the article aims at providing valuable insights into the state of the art and inspiring new ideas for future work. This article has four sections: background introduction, core concepts and related literature review, selected machine learning algorithms with their mathematical model details, implementation examples using Python programming language and finally conclusion with open issues and future directions. The proposed article will be beneficial both for researchers who are planning to implement and evaluate various machine learning algorithms in e-healthcare settings, but also for practitioners seeking practical guidance in selecting appropriate algorithms for specific problems.
# 2.Core Concepts and Related Literature Review
In general, there are three main categories of machine learning algorithms used for healthcare data analysis tasks: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training models based on labeled data while unsupervised learning finds patterns within unstructured or semi-structured data without any prescribed labels. Reinforcement learning enables agents (e.g., patients) to learn by taking actions and receiving feedback from an environment in order to maximize its reward function. Additionally, other types of machine learning include deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). In this section we briefly introduce these main concepts and refer to relevant literature for more detailed discussions later.

1.Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training models based on labeled data where the goal is to predict a target variable given some input variables. Some common supervised learning techniques include regression, classification, and ranking. These methods can handle both numerical and categorical inputs, making them suitable for many applications including predicting patient outcomes like survival time or mortality risk, inferring causal relationships between variables, identifying correlations among multiple features, and discovering latent structure in complex datasets. 

2.Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns within unstructured or semi-structured data without any prescribed labels. Common unsupervised learning techniques include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation. Clustering groups similar instances together based on similarity measures like Euclidean distance, K-means algorithm, hierarchical clustering etc. Dimensionality reduction reduces the number of dimensions involved in modeling data by transforming it into a lower dimensional space that captures important patterns. Density estimation estimates probability distributions of attributes using kernel functions like Gaussian kernels or kernalized estimators. Unsupervised learning may help identify hidden structures in complex datasets that cannot be easily discovered through traditional exploratory data analysis techniques.

3.Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning enables agents (e.g., patients) to learn by taking actions and receiving feedback from an environment in order to maximize its reward function. Agents interact with the environment by performing actions which result in rewards or penalties. The agent learns by updating its policy or strategy based on the cumulative reward received over time. Reinforcement learning is widely used in fields such as robotics, gaming, and game playing. However, its application in healthcare data analysis remains limited due to the complexity of interpreting clinical decision rules embedded in the environment. 

4.Other Types of Machine Learning Techniques
Deep learning, CNN, RNN are further types of machine learning techniques used for healthcare data analysis tasks. Deep learning leverages multilayered neural networks to extract representations from raw input signals. CNN uses filters to learn spatial features of high-dimensional inputs and apply non-linear transformations. RNN processes sequential data by processing each element sequentially, thus capturing temporal dependencies in sequences.

# 3.Selected Machine Learning Algorithms with Mathematical Model Details
Here, we discuss five frequently used machine learning algorithms for e-healthcare data analysis: decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes classifier. We begin with decision trees since they have been shown to perform well in classification tasks and offer interpretable results. Next, we move onto random forests, SVM, and KNN. Finally, we explore Naive Bayes classifiers for binary classification scenarios and summarize the discussion of all five methods below. Each method's mathematical formulation follows closely after its name.
