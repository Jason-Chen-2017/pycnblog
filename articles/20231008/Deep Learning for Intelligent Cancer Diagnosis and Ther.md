# 1.背景介绍


>Cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the body, responsible for over 70% of all cancer deaths worldwide. In this article, we will discuss how deep learning techniques can help improve intelligent diagnosis and therapy in cancer patients using medical imaging data. We will present a novel algorithm called Neural Collaborative Filtering for cancer diagnosis and treatment recommendation based on medical image analysis. The proposed method integrates two sub-models: an image feature extractor and a collaborative filtering layer to recommend optimal treatments for cancerous cases based on their symptoms and current status.

## 2.1 Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)
Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), introduced by He et al., combines neural networks with collaborative filtering algorithms to provide personalized recommendations. NCF uses a neural network to learn features from raw input data such as user preferences or images, while collaborative filtering leverages implicit feedback such as clicks or ratings to train the model. This approach allows the system to capture both explicit and implicit information about users’ interests and behaviors. 

In our case, given medical images of cancerous cells, we want to develop a solution that recommends optimal treatments based on symptoms and disease progression indicators extracted from these images. To achieve this goal, we need to extract meaningful features from the medical images, which are then fed into the NCF framework alongside click/rating signals obtained from experts' clinical experience. During training time, the model learns correlations between image features and disease outcomes, allowing it to accurately predict potential treatments for each patient. At inference time, when new instances of medical images arrive, the trained model makes predictions about which treatments may be effective and identifies areas requiring specialization or followup. 

The figure below shows the general architecture of the proposed system:



## 2.2 Medical Image Analysis
Medical image analysis involves several steps including acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, registration, feature extraction, and classification. Each step requires specialized tools and expertise, so integration of various methods within one software package is challenging. For example, there have been multiple attempts at developing standardized protocols for analyzing medical images, but none has yet achieved widespread acceptance and interoperability. Therefore, in this project, we use open source libraries and toolkits such as TensorFlow, Keras, MedPy, etc., to build end-to-end systems for cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. 


# 3. Core Algorithm and Operations Details

### 3.1 Image Feature Extractor 
The first sub-model of our proposed method is the image feature extractor. We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn visual features from medical images. CNNs are known to be highly effective at capturing complex patterns in high-dimensional data such as medical images. In order to handle variations in radiology reports, noise, contrast, size, and orientation, we preprocess the input images before feeding them into the CNN. Specifically, we resize the images to fixed sizes such as $256 \times 256$, normalize pixel values to zero mean and unit variance, remove any background or black artifacts, apply histogram equalization and adaptive histogram clipping, and finally perform convolution operations followed by max pooling layers. These preprocessed images serve as inputs to the CNN and produce fixed-size representations of the original images.

For illustration purposes, let's consider a simple CNN architecture consisting of three convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers:

1. **Convolutional Layer #1**: Takes as input the preprocessed image and applies six four-by-four filters with stride of 1 and no padding. It outputs feature maps with dimensions $(W-4+1) \times (H-4+1)$ where $W$ and $H$ denote the width and height of the input image. 

2. **Pooling Layer #1** : Applies average pooling with kernel size of 2x2 and stride of 2. Its output is a grid of feature vectors with dimensions $\frac{W}{2} \times \frac{H}{2}$.

3. **Fully Connected Layer #1**: Takes as input the flattened output of Pooling Layer #1 and produces a vector of length 128.

4. **Activation Function #1**: ReLU activation function applied to the output of Fully Connected Layer #1.

5. **Dropout**: Randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

6. **Fully Connected Layer #2**: Takes as input the output of Activation Function #1 and produces a probability distribution over five possible diseases.

We repeat this process with additional convolutional layers and fully connected layers until the desired level of complexity is reached. Note that the choice of hyperparameters such as filter size, number of filters, strides, dropout rate, batch normalization, regularization, and optimization scheme can significantly impact performance and convergence speed.

Overall, the image feature extractor produces dense low-dimensional feature vectors that encode the important characteristics of individual objects in the image, making them suitable for downstream applications like object recognition or pattern recognition tasks.

### 3.2 Collaborative Filtering Layer 
Our second sub-model is the collaborative filtering layer. This layer takes as input a set of user profiles generated by the image feature extractor and associated user preference scores derived from clinical observations. User profiles typically consist of latent factors that describe individual preferences, such as demographics, behavioral traits, past history, and physiological states. Preferences can also be inferred from the similarity among different individuals. Based on these preferences and ratings, the collaborative filtering layer produces a personalized ranking of items available to the user. Our chosen collaborative filtering technique is matrix factorization, which decomposes the user-item rating matrix into the product of two lower rank matrices, i.e., a user profile matrix and an item feature matrix.

Matrix factorization models are widely used in recommender systems due to its ability to capture latent relationships among users and items, even if they do not occur simultaneously. In our case, since the user profiles are computed from medical images and contain rich visual features, they are naturally amenable to matrix factorization. Moreover, matrix factorization provides easy interpretability and generalizability because it does not depend on a specific representation for users or items, unlike some other approaches.

Specifically, for each user, we compute the dot product between their corresponding user profile and item feature matrices. This gives us a predicted score indicating the likelihood of a certain item being rated positively by that user. If this score exceeds a threshold, the item is considered to be recommended to the user. We can vary the threshold and balance the tradeoff between precision and recall by optimizing it via cross-validation or grid search. Overall, the collaborative filtering layer helps refine the initial results produced by the image feature extractor by incorporating human intuition and observed behavior patterns into the final decision.

### 3.3 Putting it All Together
Putting everything together, we get the following overall pipeline for generating personalized cancer treatment recommendations:

1. Preprocess input images using appropriate techniques to obtain clean, informative features for modeling
2. Feed the processed images through the image feature extractor to generate user profiles and item features
3. Compute the user-item rating matrix based on observed ratings or inferred similarity across pairs of users and items
4. Train a matrix factorization model on the user-item rating matrix to recover user profiles and item features
5. Given a test instance of a medical image, compute the dot product between the corresponding user profile and item feature matrices to obtain a predicted rating
6. Filter out items that do not exceed the predicted rating threshold and return the top k recommended treatments to the user

### 3.4 Evaluation Strategy
To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare it against a baseline approach that recommends similar treatments based solely on symptom similarity without considering contextual information. Since we lack reliable ground truth labels for determining whether a particular treatment is more effective than another, we split the dataset into a training set and a validation set randomly. We use the training set to fit the image feature extractor and collaborative filtering layer, and validate it on the validation set. Finally, we measure the average AUC-ROC metric on the held-out test set to determine the quality of our method compared to the baseline.
