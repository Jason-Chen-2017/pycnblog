# 1.背景介绍


In this article we will explore the world of recommender systems and their application in media streaming platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video etc., by applying a deep learning approach using neural networks (RNNs). We will also discuss how the use of RNNs can address some limitations of traditional collaborative filtering techniques like content-based or demographic based recommendation algorithms. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our models on real-world datasets and compare them against other popular approaches for movie recommendation tasks. This is a critical but yet an open research topic that has been receiving extensive attention recently due to its potential impact on people's daily lives. We aim at providing a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in this area and paving the way for future research efforts towards developing more accurate and efficient recommendation systems.

The goal of any recommender system is to recommend items that are likely to be useful to users. The most common types of recommendations include personalized recommendation for individual users, contextual/social recommendation, item recommendation, and product recommendation. In this paper, we focus on the latter type called item recommendation which attempts to predict what a user might want next given her past behavior. It differs from typical collaborative filtering approaches because it only considers information about a single user, not all the data available. Instead, it leverages the sequential nature of human interactions and relies on users' implicit preferences towards certain items to make predictions.

Recommendation systems have typically relied heavily on supervised machine learning techniques such as matrix factorization methods, clustering, and classification algorithms. These methods require large amounts of labeled data and are often computationally intensive, requiring expensive hardware resources. To overcome these challenges, researchers have started exploring deep learning approaches that utilize neural networks. These models learn patterns in the underlying data by processing it through hidden layers and outputting a prediction or estimate. Popular examples include convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and recursive neural networks (RNN) among others.

In contrast to classical recommendation algorithms that rely primarily on explicit ratings or interactions between users and items, recent works have demonstrated the promise of using deep learning to build effective recommenders. One example is Siamese networks, a pairwise similarity function that learns embeddings of users and movies in order to compute similarity scores between them. Another technique uses sequence modeling with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that take into account both temporal relationships and hierarchical dependencies between items. Several papers have shown that these architectures provide significantly better results than other classic algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency while being able to scale up to handle large-scale datasets.

We propose a novel deep learning architecture for item recommendation using RNNs that combines the strengths of both collaborative filtering and content-based approaches. Our model takes as input a sequence of clicked items generated by a user during his/her interaction session, along with additional features extracted from the metadata associated with each item, such as genres, cast, directors, release dates, and text descriptions. The primary component of our model is a stacked recurrent neural network (RNN) layer that processes the sequential data effectively. We then use fully connected layers to transform the output into a probability distribution over the set of candidate items. Each element in the output vector represents the likelihood of selecting a particular item within the top k predicted ones.

To train our model, we use triplet loss, a common metric used for measuring the quality of learned representations. Triplet loss involves comparing a positive sample (an item clicked by the current user) with a randomly selected negative sample (a random item outside the current session) while ensuring that the distance between the two samples does not exceed a predefined margin value. By minimizing this criterion across multiple training iterations, our model learns a robust representation of the dataset that captures the diversity and affinity of different items in the session.

A key aspect of our model is its ability to capture both sequential and non-sequential correlations present in the underlying data. The first step of our algorithm is to extract features from the metadata associated with each item using pre-trained word embedding models like GloVe or Word2Vec. These vectors represent high-level semantics of words and help us capture the overall meaning of each item. We feed these feature vectors directly into the input of our RNN layer where they act as initial hidden states. At every time step, the model computes the inner products between the current state and the feature vectors of the previously clicked items. These inner products serve as inputs to the RNN cell that generates the output vector at the current time step. Based on this process, the model builds a rich representation of the user's interests in the form of a long term memory. As the user continues interacting with the platform, new feature vectors and click events are fed into the model sequentially, leading to a gradually built representation of the user's entire past behavior.

After generating a dynamic understanding of the user's past behavior, our model applies a set of fully connected layers followed by softmax activation to produce a probability distribution over the set of candidate items. The final output is a ranked list of recommended items sorted according to their relative likelihood of selection. We select the top k items from this distribution and return them as the recommendations. Since the output of our model is probabilistic and reflects uncertainty inherent to the problem of recommendation, we apply a temperature scaling transformation before ranking the candidates to smooth out the scores and encourage exploration.

Finally, since our method is trained end-to-end without relying on handcrafted features, it automatically adapts itself to the specificities of each domain, allowing it to generalize well to unseen data distributions. Therefore, despite its simplicity, our proposed framework provides significant improvements over traditional collaborative filtering algorithms when dealing with highly sparse and noisy datasets. Overall, our work establishes a strong foundation for building scalable and accurate recommendation engines for various media streaming services that support personalized recommendations.
