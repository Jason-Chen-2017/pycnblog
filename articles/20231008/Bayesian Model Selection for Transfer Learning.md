# 1.背景介绍


Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that allows a model to learn from one domain and transfer its knowledge to another related but different domain with minimal supervision or labeled data. One common application of transfer learning is image recognition, where a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large dataset can be fine-tuned by using it as the initial layer in a smaller CNN for classifying images in a new domain without requiring any additional training data. However, how does one select appropriate models and hyperparameters during transfer learning? In this article, we will explore two Bayesian methods: variational inference and maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP), which are commonly used approaches in transfer learning research. We will also compare these two approaches based on their performance metrics and discuss their respective advantages and limitations. 

The key idea behind both Bayesian methods is to estimate the probability distributions over the models and hyperparameters instead of point estimates. This approach leads to more robust model selection than non-Bayesian methods, especially when there are multiple competing hypotheses. Furthermore, given the uncertainty in parameter values, Bayesian methods provide a way of quantifying the risk of choosing poorly performing models or hyperparameters. Therefore, they have been widely adopted in recent years due to their ability to handle high dimensional problems with complex constraints and uncertainties.

In this article, we will focus on the problem of selecting an optimal model architecture and hyperparameter settings for transfer learning tasks. The specific goal is to identify the best architecture and set of hyperparameters for each target task based on the prior beliefs about the source task. Specifically, we assume that the source task is represented by a dataset $D$ consisting of examples $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$, where each example is a vector of features $\phi(x_i)$ and the corresponding label $y_i$. We further assume that the target task is similar to the source task except for some differences in the input space or output classes. Thus, our goal is to find a mapping function $f_{\theta}(z)=\phi(g_\psi(z))$ such that $f_{\theta}$ maps the feature representation z obtained from a source task to the same feature representation $\phi(\tilde x_{i}^{*})$ generated by the mapped target task. To do so, we need to choose the right model architectures and hyperparameters for each step in the transfer learning process. Our hypothesis is that the optimal choice of model architectures and hyperparameters depends not only on the characteristics of the source task but also on the structure of the target task itself. 


To solve this problem, we use two popular Bayesian techniques called Variational Inference and Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP). We begin by defining the generative process for our transfer learning problem. Given a fixed set of possible model architectures $\Theta$, the latent variable z represents the preprocessed feature vectors extracted from the source examples. Then, we apply a transformation $\phi$ followed by a classification layer $\psi$ to obtain the mapped feature representations $\phi(\tilde x_{i}^{*})$. Finally, we minimize a loss function between the predicted labels and true labels $L(\hat y_i,\tilde y_i)=-[y_i\log \hat y_i + (1-y_i)\log (1-\hat y_i)]$. For simplicity, we assume that $\hat y_i=\sigma(\psi(\phi(g_\psi(z_i))))$, where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation function and $\epsilon$ is a noise term added to break the symmetry of the Bernoulli distribution.

We now turn to Bayesian inference methods for model selection in transfer learning. The first method is Variational Inference, which involves approximating the posterior distribution over the weights parameters $\theta$ and hyperparameters $\alpha$ using a probabilistic model. We then optimize the ELBO objective function with respect to these variables to maximize the likelihood of observing the data under the learned model. The second method is MAP, which computes the posterior distribution over the parameters using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent. It returns the mode of the joint posterior distribution over all the variables, which corresponds to the most likely combination of model and hyperparameters.

# Generative Process
Our generative process follows a standard pattern for transfer learning applications. Starting with a fixed set of possible model architectures $\Theta$, the feature extractor learns to extract low-level features from the raw inputs $\mathbf{x}$. These features are then transformed into higher-level representations through a transformation function $\phi$ before being passed through a classifier $\psi$.

Let's denote the original feature vectors $\mathbf{x}$ by $Z=(z_1,\ldots,z_N)^T$ and let $G_{\theta}(Z;\beta)$ represent the distribution over the latent variables $Z$ conditioned on the observed outputs $(Y=(y_1,\ldots,y_N)^T; \theta,\beta)$. Here $\theta$ refers to the parameters of the model architecture and $\beta$ is a set of hyperparameters shared across all layers. The transformation function $\phi$ transforms the latent code $Z$ into the feature representation $\Phi$ according to $P(\Phi|\mathcal{X},Z) = P(Z|\mathcal{X})\prod_{l=1}^L P(h_l(W^{(l)})|\Phi, b^{(l)}, \beta^{(l)})$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the observed dataset consisting of input examples $\{\mathbf{x}_j\}_{j=1}^J$ along with their corresponding labels $y_j$. Each hidden layer $l$ takes the previous layer's output $\Phi$ as well as the shared hyperparameters $\beta^{(l)}$ as input. The final output layer $\psi$ produces a binary prediction $\hat Y$ based on the transformed feature representation $\Phi$: $\psi(\Phi; \theta,\beta) = P(y|\Phi; \theta,\beta)$.

Given the above model architecture, the source domain is assumed to have been observed by a dataset D containing N examples $X_1,\ldots,X_N$ with associated labels $Y_1,\ldots,Y_N$. Let $\mu_S$ and $\Sigma_S$ be the mean and covariance matrices of the Gaussian distribution representing the observations in the source domain. Denoting the prior on the model parameters $\Theta$, hyperparameters $\alpha$, and noise variance $\sigma^2$, the joint distribution of the model, hyperparameters, and noise variance is given by

$$p(D;\Theta,\alpha,\sigma^2|\mu_S,\Sigma_S) = p(Y|X;\Theta,\alpha,\sigma^2) p(X;\mu_S,\Sigma_S) p(\Theta) p(\alpha) p(\sigma^2)$$

where $p(Y|X;\Theta,\alpha,\sigma^2)$ is the likelihood of the observed data X and Y, assuming a specified probability model and hyperparameters. The terms on the left hand side correspond to various factors that may influence the performance of the learned model including the complexity of the problem ($L$), the number of parameters in the model ($K$), and the amount of noise present in the data ($\sigma^2$). The middle two terms correspond to the prior information available about the source domain and reflect assumptions made about the structure of the data and the underlying generative process. On the right hand side, $p(X;\mu_S,\Sigma_S)$ is the prior distribution over the inputs given the source data, which has a multivariate normal form. Finally, the priors on the model parameters $\Theta$, hyperparameters $\alpha$, and noise variance $\sigma^2$ are typically chosen to balance tradeoffs among these factors.

Variational Inference (VI):
The basic idea behind VI is to approximate the posterior distribution over the weights parameters theta and hyperparameters alpha using a probabilistic model. We define the variational approximation q(theta, alpha) as a tractable family of approximating distributions over these variables. The key idea behind VI is to optimize the ELBO objective function with respect to these variables to maximize the likelihood of observing the data under the learned model. Specifically, we seek the following maximization problem:

$$\text{maximize} \;\; \mathcal{L}(\theta,\alpha) := \mathbb{E}_{q(Z;\phi)}\left[\log p(D;\Theta,\alpha,\sigma^2|\mu_S,\Sigma_S)\right] - \mathrm{KL}\left[q(Z;\phi)||p(Z)\right] $$

The first term on the right-hand side is the expected log-likelihood of the observed dataset under the learned model, which is computed using the variational approximation q(Z;phi). The second term is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the variational approximation and the prior distribution over Z, which ensures that the learned model doesn't rely too heavily on irrelevant input features.

The next step is to derive the necessary derivatives of the ELBO wrt to the model parameters and hyperparameters. Since q(Z;phi) is assumed to be a tractable distribution, we can evaluate the expectations inside the expectation operators using samples drawn from q(Z;phi). The resulting expression for d/d\theta \mathcal{L} can be evaluated directly since the only dependence of the ELBO on \theta is through the kernel matrix K, whose trace is constant with respect to the variational distribution. Similarly, the partial derivative of \mathcal{L} wrt to alpha can be evaluated using Monte Carlo integration. Once we have obtained the gradients of the ELBO, we can perform stochastic updates of the model parameters theta and hyperparameters alpha in a gradient descent manner until convergence.

Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP):
The basic idea behind MAP is to compute the posterior distribution over the weights parameters theta and hyperparameters alpha using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent. We treat the marginal log-likelihood of the observed dataset as a function of the model parameters, i.e., $\log p(D|\Theta,\alpha,\sigma^2)$. The posterior distribution over the model parameters is thus obtained by minimizing the negative marginal log-likelihood:

$$\text{minimize} \;\; L(\Theta,\alpha) := -\sum_{n=1}^N \log p(y_n | x_n ; \Theta,\alpha,\sigma^2)$$

where $y_n$ and $x_n$ are the n-th observation and input respectively. Note that we negate the summands because we want to maximize the log-likelihood rather than minimize it. Unlike VI, we don't need to explicitly consider the prior distribution here, as it is implicitly encoded in the likelihood function.

Once we have found the local minimum of L, we take it to be the global minimum of the whole objective function $\log p(D;\Theta,\alpha,\sigma^2|\mu_S,\Sigma_S)$. We can then use the estimated parameters to make predictions on unseen test data points. Overall, MAP provides a simple and effective way of estimating the model parameters while handling high-dimensional nonlinearity issues by relying on empirical moments of the data distribution alone.
