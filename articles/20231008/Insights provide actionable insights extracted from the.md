# 1.背景介绍


Data has become an essential part of modern life and businesses. Every company is now collecting massive amounts of data about its customers, transactions, inventory levels, sales performance, product preferences, marketing campaigns, etc., which allows them to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and make informed decisions. Data mining techniques have been used extensively to analyze this data and derive meaningful patterns, trends, and insights that can be used by businesses to improve operations, enhance customer experience, drive revenue growth, and increase profits. These insights are particularly important in today’s competitive market environment where businesses must constantly adapt and evolve to stay ahead of the competition. However, generating meaningful insights requires expertise in various areas such as machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis tools, and database management skills. Business analysts typically use these tools to mine large volumes of data, identify patterns, trends, and relationships between different variables within datasets. The insights generated by data mining techniques are often used to inform business decisions such as pricing policies, promotional campaigns, product development strategies, and staffing changes. Unfortunately, however, it can be challenging to understand how each technique works, why they work, and when they should be applied to specific problems. This article aims to provide actionable insights extracted from the analyzed data that helps decision-makers make better business decisions. It also discusses key concepts related to data mining, algorithmic design principles, and mathematical modeling behind some popular data mining techniques. Specifically, we will cover:

1) Introduction to data mining

# 2.核心概念与联系
Before delving into details of data mining, let us briefly explore some core concepts and terminology related to data mining.

1. Data Mining (DM): Data mining is the process of extracting information from large and diverse datasets. In general, data mining involves three main components: data collection, processing, and analysis.

2. Dataset: A dataset is a set of data points collected from a source, usually structured or unstructured, and organized in a tabular format. The columns in a dataset represent the attributes or features of the entities being measured while rows represent individual instances or cases.

3. Attribute: An attribute is a property of an entity, such as name, age, income, occupation, etc. Attributes describe the characteristics of individuals or objects in the dataset.

4. Instances/Cases: An instance or case refers to a single record or occurrence in the dataset. Each row in the dataset represents an instance, i.e., a set of values corresponding to the attributes of the instance.

5. Feature: A feature is an independent variable that describes an instance or case. Features are used to build models that can accurately classify new instances or infer missing values.

6. Target Variable: A target variable is the attribute that we want to predict or categorize. It can be categorical, continuous, or ordinal. If the target variable is categorical, we refer to classification; if it is continuous, regression; and if it is ordinal, we call it ranking.

7. Training Set/Test Set: A training set is a subset of the original dataset that is used to train the model. The test set is another subset of the same dataset that is used to evaluate the accuracy of the trained model. The purpose of separating the dataset into two subsets is to ensure that the learned pattern does not overfit the model to the training set and instead generalizes well to the test set.

8. Model: A model is a computational representation of a relationship between input variables and output variables. Models can be linear, non-linear, or rule-based. Linear models assume a linear relationship between input and output variables; non-linear models represent nonlinear relationships between input and output variables using a combination of functions and transformations; and rule-based models rely on expert rules to make predictions or classifications. 

9. Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters are parameters that control the behavior of the model but cannot be learned directly from the data. Hyperparameters need to be specified before training and optimized during the course of training to obtain optimal results. There are several hyperparameter tuning strategies such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient descent optimization. Grid search involves specifying a set of candidate values for each parameter and testing all possible combinations. Random search randomly samples the hyperparameter space to find good candidates. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to optimize hyperparameters by exploring a surrogate function that models the posterior distribution of the objective function. Gradient descent optimization adjusts the hyperparameters iteratively towards the minimum of the loss function to minimize the error in the predicted values.

10. Instance Selection Strategy: Instance selection strategy refers to the way instances are selected from the dataset for training and validation purposes. Some common instance selection strategies include holdout cross-validation, k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, bootstrap aggregation, stratified sampling, and conditional sampling. Holdout cross-validation involves partitioning the dataset into two parts - training set and test set - and evaluating the performance of the model on the test set only after the model has been trained on the training set. K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into k equal parts, fitting the model on k-1 parts and validating it on the remaining part. Leave-one-out cross-validation involves evaluating the performance of the model on every instance except one, resulting in k separate models evaluated independently. Bootstrap aggregation involves aggregating multiple bootstrapped datasets to reduce variance and bias in estimators derived from sample statistics. Stratified sampling involves maintaining the class balance across folds during cross-validation. Conditional sampling involves only including instances whose attributes satisfy certain conditions, reducing the size of the dataset without losing much information. 

Now that we have explored some key concepts related to data mining, let's move on to learn more about particular data mining techniques.
