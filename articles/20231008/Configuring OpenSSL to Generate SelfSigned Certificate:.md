# 1.背景介绍


The Internet is a complex and intricate place filled with different protocols and technologies. To secure communication between web servers and clients, we need to use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). These encryption methods provide authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality of information exchanged over the network. In order for these encryption mechanisms to work, we need to have our own digital certificate that can be verified by other parties who want to communicate securely using SSL/TLS. 

One way to generate your own self-signed digital certificates is to install and configure the free software package OpenSSL on your system. Here are the steps you will follow to generate a self-signed certificate:

1. Install Openssl Package
    On Ubuntu, run the following command to install openssl:
    
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install openssl -y
    

2. Create Directory for Private Key and Certificate
   Next, create two directories called `certs` and `private` inside `/etc/` directory to store your private key and public certificate respectively.
   
    mkdir /etc/certs && mkdir /etc/private
    
3. Generate Private Key and CSR File
   
   Run the following commands to generate your private key and certificate signing request file:
   
   openssl genrsa -out /etc/private/server.key 2048
   
   openssl req -new -key /etc/private/server.key -out /etc/private/server.csr

   You will be prompted to enter various details such as country name, state/province, organization name, etc., which should match the details used when requesting a trusted certificate from an authorized CA like Let's Encrypt or Comodo.
   
    Example:

    Generating a RSA private key
    Enter pass phrase for /etc/private/server.key: 
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
    
     Country Name (2 letter code) []:US
     State or Province Name (full name) []:New York
     Locality Name (eg, city) []:New York City
     Organization Name (eg, company) []:MyCompany Ltd
     Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:IT Department
     Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:www.mycompany.com
     Email Address []:my@email.com
  
   After filling out all the required fields, save the file and proceed to the next step.
   
4. Sign the Certificate Request Using a Trusted Certificate Authority

   Now that you have generated your private key and csr file, it is time to sign them with a trusted certificate authority (CA) to get a valid signed certificate. We recommend using Let's Encrypt or Comodo certificates if you don't have any preference. Follow their documentation for instructions on how to setup DNS settings so that they can verify ownership of your domain name. Once you receive your signed certificate, copy it to your local machine where you installed OpenSSL.
   
5. Configure Openssl to Use the Signed Certificate

   The last step is to configure OpenSSL to use the newly signed certificate by copying it to the appropriate location and setting up the configuration files properly. Run the following commands to complete this process:
   
   cp /path/to/your/certificate.pem /etc/certs/server.crt
   
   touch /etc/openssl/ssl/openssl.cnf
   
   Add the following lines to the end of the file `/etc/openssl/ssl/openssl.cnf`:
   
    [ v3_ca ]
    subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
    authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always,issuer:always
    basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
    
    [ v3_req ]
    distinguishedName = req_distinguished_name
    
    [ req_distinguished_name ]
    C = US
    ST = New York
    L = New York City
    O = MyCompany Ltd
    OU = IT Department
    CN = www.mycompany.com
    emailAddress = my@email.com
   
    Then edit the main OpenSSL configuration file located at `/etc/ssl/openssl.conf`, add the following line to the bottom:
   
    ssl_cert             = /etc/certs/server.crt
    ssl_key              = /etc/private/server.key
    ssl_session_timeout  = 3600
    ssl_protocols        = TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3
    ciphers              = ECDHE+AESGCM:ECDHE+CHACHA20:DHE+AESGCM:DHE+CHACHA20:ECDHE+AES256:ECDHE+AES128:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS
    use_rsa_cipher       = yes
   
    Finally, restart the nginx service or apache httpd service for changes to take effect.

That's it! With just a few simple steps, you now have a working self-signed SSL certificate configured on your Linux system ready to serve secure websites.
