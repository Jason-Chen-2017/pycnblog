# 1.背景介绍


React Native is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Facebook Inc., which allows developers to build applications for iOS and Android using only JavaScript (JS). It was originally developed in the year 2015, but it has since gained popularity among developers due to its ease of use, flexibility, and cross platform compatibility. In this article, we will learn how to develop native mobile apps using React Native from scratch. 

In order to follow along with the tutorial, you must have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You also need to install Node.js and npm on your computer or download it online if you don't already have them installed. Additionally, you should be familiar with the command line interface (CLI) and terminal commands such as cd, mkdir, touch, etc. If you are not experienced with any of these tools, please consult our previous tutorials before proceeding further. 

The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive guide on building mobile apps using React Native. We will cover the core concepts behind React Native, explain what makes it different from other mobile app development frameworks, and showcase real-world examples of creating fully functional mobile apps that can run on both iOS and Android devices. By the end of the article, readers should have a good understanding of the basics of developing native mobile apps using React Native and should be able to create their own production-quality mobile apps. 

This article assumes some level of familiarity with programming concepts and general software development practices. However, knowledge of web development technologies like JSX and ES6 syntax would be helpful. 

By the time you read through this article, you should have a thorough understanding of how to use React Native to develop mobile apps from scratch, including: 

 - Setting up a new React Native project
 - Creating screens and components
 - Managing state data and user interaction
 - Adding third-party libraries and plugins
 - Deploying and publishing your mobile app
 
# 2.核心概念与联系
Before we dive into the technical details of developing mobile apps using React Native, let's quickly go over some key concepts and terminology related to React Native. These include:

1. Components vs Screens
A component is a self-contained piece of UI code that can be used multiple times within an application. For example, a button component could be reused across several screens within an application while still being customizable according to the needs of each screen. On the other hand, a screen is simply a set of UI elements displayed on the device’s screen. Screen components contain various subcomponents such as text fields, buttons, images, lists, and more.

2. State and Props
State refers to data stored within a component that may change over time. Whenever the state changes, the component re-renders itself to reflect the updated state. Similarly, props are arguments passed down to a child component from its parent component. They allow us to customize the behavior of child components based on values provided by the parent.

3. Flexbox Layout
Flexbox layout is a powerful tool in CSS that helps us easily manage the layout of our UI elements. Using flexbox, we can control the position, size, and alignment of our UI elements within a container without needing to specify absolute pixel positions.

4. Styling with Stylesheets and Themes
Styling refers to applying visual design aspects to our UI components. There are two ways to style our components in React Native – using inline styles or external stylesheet files. Inline styling is done directly on the components themselves via the style prop. External stylesheets are organized into separate.css files and imported into our main App.js file where they can then be applied to individual components or the entire app. A theme can also be defined using a JSON object containing colors, fonts, and other design parameters that can be applied throughout the app. This saves us from having to repeatedly define common styles throughout the codebase.

5. Navigation
React navigation provides a flexible way to navigate between different screens within an app. It offers easy-to-use APIs for handling navigation stack operations such as push, pop, replace, reset, and getting current route information.

6. Third-Party Libraries and Plugins
React Native comes preinstalled with a wide range of popular third-party libraries and plugins. Some commonly used ones include react-native-maps for displaying maps and location data, react-native-camera for capturing photos, and react-native-video for playing video content. Other lesser known plugins include react-native-push-notification for sending push notifications, react-native-image-picker for selecting images/videos from the camera roll, and react-native-speech for speech recognition and synthesis. All these plugins come with extensive documentation and usage guides so that developers can easily integrate them into their mobile apps.

7. Debugging Tools
React Native includes a built-in debugger that enables us to debug our app on both Android and iOS simulators and physical devices. It works similar to Chrome Developer Tools and offers a convenient debugging experience for identifying errors and fixing issues efficiently.

Overall, React Native is a powerful and fast-growing framework that can help developers build high-performance mobile apps with complex functionality in record time. With proper planning and execution, React Native apps can deliver features faster than traditional app development processes and achieve market dominance.
