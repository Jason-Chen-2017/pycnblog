# 1.背景介绍


Big data refers to large and complex datasets that are too big to be processed by traditional tools such as relational databases or Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). To handle this volume of data, the Apache Software Foundation has created two open source frameworks: Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Both frameworks allow developers to write parallel programs in Java/Scala language using a high-level API which is optimized for distributed processing on large clusters.
Flink was introduced by Yahoo! in December 2014 and later acquired by the Apache Software Foundation in April 2017. It provides powerful stream processing capabilities based on Apache Hadoop ecosystem, including state management, checkpointing, and fault tolerance. Additionally, it supports Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, and other popular messaging systems as sources and sinks for ingesting and analyzing real-time events from various sources. It also offers SQL like query engine called Table API that enables users to manipulate event streams directly within a streaming program. As an alternative to Flink, Apache Beam is another framework being developed at Apache Software Foundation. However, both Flink and Spark are highly recommended platforms for handling massive amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data because they provide low latency, scalability, and fault tolerance. 

In terms of developer experience, both frameworks offer similar ease of use, requiring no prior knowledge about distributed computing or parallel programming. Developers can focus solely on writing their business logic while the underlying platform takes care of optimizing performance, fault tolerance, and resource management. These frameworks have been used extensively for building real-world applications such as Netflix Recommendations Engine, Twitter's Streaming API, and Amazon Kinesis Streams. However, with so many choices available today, developers need to choose between these frameworks carefully based on their requirements and expertise level. In this article we will discuss how Flink and Spark compare in terms of their pros and cons, and what makes them different. We will also explore their commonalities, differences, and tradeoffs further.

## 2.1. MapReduce vs Flink
MapReduce is a popular algorithm for parallel processing of large datasets. It splits a dataset into multiple partitions, processes each partition independently, and then combines the results. Each partition is assigned one node and its corresponding subset of the input data. This approach allows distributing tasks across multiple nodes for faster processing times. Similarly, Flink is also designed to process large volumes of data in parallel. Unlike MapReduce where intermediate results are stored locally and only final output is emitted when all the parts are complete, Flink keeps track of every single intermediate result and emits them as soon as they become available. Flink achieves this through its incremental computation model.
Both Flink and MapReduce follow a “write once run anywhere” approach, meaning you can run your code on any cluster environment. However, there are some key differences in how they operate and interact with the underlying system. 


Table 1 shows some important features of MapReduce architecture. 

| Feature | Description |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Master Node | A central control unit responsible for managing job scheduling and resource allocation. |
| Job Tracker | Keeps track of the status of jobs running on slave nodes. |
| Task Tracker | Responsible for executing individual mappers and reducers. |
| Input Split | A piece of data that is divided among mapper tasks for parallelization. |
| Partitioner | Determines the partition key for each record. |
| Mapper | Processes records and generates key-value pairs. |
| Combiner | Performs local aggregation before sending intermediate results to reducer task. |
| Reducer | Takes key-value pairs generated by mappers and aggregates them into smaller sets of key-value pairs. |

On the other hand, Table 2 presents the fundamental concepts and design principles behind Flink’s architecture.

| Concept | Definition |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| JobManager | Flink’s central component that manages all distributed tasks. It receives instructions from the user, coordinates the communication between the JobClient, TaskManagers, and Executors, and ensures the overall execution flow of the application. |
| TaskManager | Each worker node runs a separate TaskManager instance. Its main responsibility is to execute individual tasks, communicate with the JobManager and other TaskManagers in order to coordinate their operations, and collect metrics and monitoring information. |
| Slot | A logical resource allocation unit that represents the ability of a machine to execute a task. |
| Executor | An instance of the JVM running inside a TaskManager instance. An executor is responsible for carrying out the actual work done by a task. One executor can execute multiple tasks concurrently. |
| Task | The smallest unit of work that can be executed on a Flink cluster. It encapsulates a set of operators and transformations, and may contain multiple subtasks that execute sequentially on the same worker node. |
| Operator | A basic building block of Flink’s Stream and Batch APIs. Operators transform input data and produce new output data. |
| Transformation | A higher-order operator that applies a function to elements of a data stream or batch collection. Transformations define the core functionality of a Flink program, transforming input data into output data in some way. |
| KeyedStream / KeySelector | A special type of transformation that groups elements together based on a certain key value. |
| CoGroup | Join operation that combines two or more data streams based on their keys. |
| BroadcastVariable / BroadcastOperator | Allows sharing immutable state across multiple tasks during runtime. |
| Sink / OutputFormat | Defines how output data should be written and managed. |

Overall, both Flink and MapReduce share several important characteristics: 

1. Ease of Use - Developers do not require extensive knowledge about parallelism, distributed computing, or resource management to develop efficient programs using either framework. They just need to understand the relevant terminology and syntax.

2. Flexibility - MapReduce requires a predefined schema for inputs and outputs. While Flink operates on dynamic schemas, allowing developers to plug in custom functions to manipulate incoming data.

3. Fault Tolerance - Both Flink and MapReduce support fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure that failed tasks can be restarted without loss of data. However, recovery time depends on the amount of lost data due to failures.

4. Scalability - Both Flink and MapReduce scale horizontally by adding additional resources to increase compute power and throughput.

However, there are some key differences in how they operate and interact with the underlying system:

1. Resource Management - Flink uses slots to allocate resources to each task, ensuring optimal utilization of machines. On the other hand, MapReduce typically allocates entire machines to each map or reduce task.

2. Performance - Because Flink relies heavily on memory caching and asynchronous IO, it can achieve very high performance compared to MapReduce. However, it requires tuning parameters such as number of slots, buffer sizes, and batch sizes to optimize performance.

3. Complexity - MapReduce focuses on batch processing and mostly involves fixed algorithms whereas Flink’s real-time processing capabilities include advanced stream analysis and windowing techniques.

4. Integration - Although both frameworks offer easy integration with external systems such as HDFS, Kafka, and Elasticsearch, Flink offers greater flexibility in integrating third party components such as machine learning libraries and databases.

Overall, choosing between Flink and MapReduce depends on the specific needs of the application and personal preferences of the developer. If data ingestion rate is critical, Flink would be preferred over MapReduce due to its ability to consume and process data continuously. Conversely, if fine-grained updates are required, MapReduce could still be a good choice since it has built-in support for structured data formats such as CSV and Avro. Nonetheless, the choice ultimately depends on the goals of the project and the skills and abilities of the development team.
