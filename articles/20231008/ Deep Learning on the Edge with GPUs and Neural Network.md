# 1.背景介绍


The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has transformed modern society into a digital economy. However, as these advancements have been accelerated by exponential growth in computational power, various AI applications such as computer vision and natural language processing are being deployed at very high scale. One of the main challenges faced by developers is that they need to leverage their existing resources efficiently while also considering cost and latency constraints for edge devices running embedded systems or IoT gateways. This brings us to Deep Learning on Edge with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
In this primer article we will discuss the core concepts and algorithms related to deep learning, along with some hands-on code examples using Python programming language. We will explain how to effectively use GPU computing power to speed up computationally expensive tasks like image recognition, natural language processing and neural networks training, among others. In addition, we will touch upon future trends and directions of development for advanced machine learning techniques for edge devices. Finally, we will conclude by summarizing the major takeaways and areas for further exploration. 
2.核心概念与联系
## 2.1 What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is an area of machine learning where a large number of layers of interconnected artificial neurons are trained based on data provided to them through input. It uses multiple levels of abstraction to learn complex features from raw data, making it highly effective in pattern recognition and prediction problems. The ability of deep learning models to extract relevant features from raw data makes them ideal for many real-world applications including object detection, face recognition, speech recognition, and recommendation engines.

Deep learning can be applied across several fields such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, etc., providing solutions for a wide range of tasks.


## 2.2 How does it work?
A typical deep learning system consists of three key components:

1. Input Data: The input data includes images, audio signals, textual data, etc., which needs to be fed into the model for training.

2. Model Architecture: The architecture of the model defines its depth and complexity. There are different types of architectures available depending on the type of task. For example, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are popular choices for image classification, time series analysis, and sequential modeling respectively.

3. Training Strategy: Once the dataset and architecture are defined, the next step is to train the model on the given data set using optimization algorithms such as Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adagrad, Adam, etc. The goal of training is to adjust the weights and biases of each layer of the network to minimize the loss function during the course of training process.

## 2.3 Types of Layers used in Deep Learning Models
### 2.3.1 Linear Layer
Linear layer is one of the simplest types of layers used in deep learning models. These layers perform simple linear transformations on the inputs passed through them without any non-linear activation functions. They are typically followed by Activation Functions, which define whether the output should be activated or not. The most commonly used activation function in linear regression models is the sigmoid function. The equations for calculating forward pass for a single unit in a linear layer are:


where Z is the output of the linear layer, theta are the parameters of the model and x are the inputs.

### 2.3.2 Non-Linearity Layer
Non-linearity layers add non-linearities to the linear combination performed by the previous layers. Commonly used non-linear activation functions include Sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU, SELU, and PReLU. The mathematical formula for calculating the output of a nonlinearity layer is:


where Y is the output of the layer, σ is the activation function, and Z is the weighted sum calculated by the preceding layer.

### 2.3.3 Fully Connected Layer (FC layer)
Fully connected layers consist of fully connected units arranged in a matrix format. Each unit takes input from all the nodes in the previous layer and produces an output. The weight matrices connecting two FC layers represent connections between the corresponding nodes in both layers. The equation for calculating forward pass for a single unit in a fully connected layer is:


Here, h<sub>i</sub> is the i-th node's output, W<sub>ij</sub> is the weight between j-th and i-th nodes, N is the total number of nodes in the previous layer, and X<sub>j</sub> is the j-th node's input.

### 2.3.4 Convolutional Layer (Conv layer)
Convolutional layers apply filters over small regions of the input tensor and produce feature maps. Filters can detect patterns and interactions within the input data, which helps identify the important features in the data. Common types of convolutional layers include spatial and depthwise separable convolutions. Spatial convolution applies a filter to every position in the input tensor independently, whereas Depthwise Separable Convolution splits the filter into two parts – depthwise and pointwise – allowing for faster execution times. The mathematical formulas for calculating forward passes in a convolutional layer are:

For Spatial Convlution:


Where ∗ denotes the convolution operator, conv_weight[K_j*K_j*C_in,C_out_j] is the filter parameter, input(N_i, C_in, H_in, W_in) is the input tensor, and out(N_i, C_out_j) is the output feature map.

For Depthwise Separable Convolution:

Depthwise convolution performs dot product operation separately for each channel and concatenates the resulting feature maps along the channels axis. Pointwise convolution then reduces the dimensionality of the resulted feature maps again according to required number of output channels. Mathematical expression for forward pass in a depthwise separable convolution layer is:


Here, G() represents any non-linear activation function, such as ReLU().
