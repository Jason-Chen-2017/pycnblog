## What is an object detection task? 

Object detection refers to the process of identifying and localizing objects in images or videos with high precision. In this article, we will mainly discuss about one-stage detectors which are simple, highly accurate but relatively slow compared to two-stage detectors. One-stage detectors include R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks), Fast/Faster R-CNN and YOLO(You Only Look Once). 

In general, a typical object detection problem can be divided into three steps: 

1. Region proposal generation : The first step involves generating regions of interest that may contain the target object. These regions could be rectangles, circles, ellipses etc., depending on the method used for region proposal generation.

2. Feature extraction : After obtaining the list of candidate bounding boxes, their corresponding features need to be extracted from the image. This feature extraction step typically uses deep convolutional neural networks such as ResNet, VGG, MobileNet. 

3. Classification and localization : Finally, each proposed region is classified based on its features and predicted position within the original image. If there is only one instance of the target object per image, then the localization step is not required. However, if multiple instances exist, then the final output should be precisely localized.

Now let’s take a closer look at these different methods of region proposal generation and classification and localization steps performed by these models. We will also try to understand how they work mathematically behind them and get insights into what makes these algorithms more powerful than others.<|im_sep|> 
# 2. Core Concepts and Related Work 
Let's start by understanding some fundamental concepts related to object detection tasks.
## Datasets 
The most commonly used dataset for training and testing object detection models is called Pascal VOC or MS COCO datasets. These datasets have large scale object annotations labeled in various formats such as XML files. The data contains both pre-annotated images and human generated annotation labels. Besides these datasets, other popular ones like ImageNet are available for use too.

## Regions of Interest (ROIs) 
A region of interest or ROI is a rectangular area where the object might reside within it. It helps us locate the target object in an image since it provides a smaller search space to search for objects around it. There are several ways to generate ROIs. Some common ones include Selective Search, Edgeboxes, Random Forests etc.

## Classifiers and Localizers 
We often associate classifiers with traditional machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines etc. But here, we need to clarify whether we mean classifier or regressor during our definition of "classifier". While region proposals are being classified using CNNs, localizer network predicts the position of the target object relative to the entire image. Regressor means any model that outputs continuous values instead of discrete predictions like binary classes.

## Bounding Boxes 
Bounding boxes represent the coordinates of an object inside an image and they are used extensively throughout object detection pipelines. Each bounding box consists of four parameters - x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width and height. They help to identify the exact location of the object in the given image. A bounding box can be represented in various formats such as “x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max” format or as a center point and dimensions. 

One of the key challenges faced while working with object detection problems is dealing with small variations in object sizes, positions, orientations and occlusions due to camera movement and lighting conditions. Hence, object detection needs to be robust against variations in input images. As such, we need to carefully consider all aspects of image preprocessing, including normalization, scaling, rotation, color augmentation, contrast stretching, brightness adjustment etc. To further improve accuracy, we can apply data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, rotating and scaling the images. 

After processing the raw inputs through image preprocessing steps, we obtain an output tensor containing pixel intensities ranging between 0 and 1. During training stage, we train a CNN based model to learn visual features that describe the object present in an image. The output of the model is a set of feature maps corresponding to the regions of interest obtained after applying suitable region proposal generation technique. 

During inference time, once we receive an image, we extract the relevant regions from the image and pass them to the trained CNN. The resulting feature map gives us information about the presence or absence of the object in each region. We use an activation function such as sigmoid, softmax or max pooling layer to produce probability scores over the possible object categories. Then, we select the category with the highest score and apply NMS (Non Maximal Suppression) to eliminate overlapping detections. 

Finally, we interpret the detected objects based on their confidence scores and return the top K candidates along with their locations and confidences. All of these steps make up the pipeline involved in performing object detection.
