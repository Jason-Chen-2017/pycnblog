## Introduction
Graph partitioning is a widely studied problem in computer science and engineering, which is used to decompose the large graphs into smaller subgraphs that are more manageable for efficient processing or analysis. There are many graph partitioning algorithms available with varying computational complexity, accuracy, scalability, and effectiveness depending on different factors such as the type of input graph, size of partitions, and number of processors involved. One popular family of graph partitioning algorithms called spectral partitioning algorithms is based on the eigenvector decomposition technique and can be applied to any undirected weighted graph. This paper provides an overview of the existing methods for spectral graph partitioning, compares them with each other in terms of their properties, analyzes their time complexities and shows how they can be implemented efficiently using various programming languages. It also discusses practical applications of these techniques, including social network analysis, clustering, and data mining. The reader will learn about the benefits and drawbacks of each algorithm, understand how to choose the right one for a specific application, and appreciate its advantages over other less known approaches. 

## Overview
Spectral graph partitioning is a class of graph partitioning algorithms based on the eigenvector decomposition technique. In this approach, we first compute the normalized laplacian matrix L = D−1/2 A D−1/2 (where D is the diagonal degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix), where −1/2 indicates taking the inverse square root. Then, we use the eigendecomposition of L to obtain the spectrum S (eigenvalues) and eigenvectors U (eigenvectors). These matrices provide us information about the structure of the graph: if two nodes have similar characteristics along the eigenvectors corresponding to high-frequency components, then those nodes are likely to belong to the same partition. We can interpret these eigenvectors as prototypes or centroids representing clusters of similar nodes. Based on these eigenvectors, we assign each node to its most closely related prototype, resulting in a partitioning of the original graph. Popular spectral graph partitioning algorithms include Kernighan–Lin’s algorithm, the Laplacian spectral partitioning (LSP) method, the normalized cut (NCut) method, the modularity maximization (Modularity) method, and several variations thereof. Each algorithm has distinct properties that make it suitable for certain types of problems and offers tradeoffs between computation speed, memory usage, and quality of the results.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art spectral graph partitioning algorithms by examining their features, strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions, comparing them against each other in terms of their performance metrics and real-world impacts, and identifying some potential research directions. We start with brief introductions to relevant concepts such as regularity, modularity, cuts, and constraints, followed by detailed descriptions of six representative algorithms—Kernighan-Lin's Algorithm, the Laplacian Spectral Partitioning Method, Normalized Cut Method, Modularity Maximization Method, Semi-Supervised Community Detection via Iterative Random Walk Clustering, and Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent Variational Inference Model for Partitioning Complex Networks—alongside their implementation details and design choices. Finally, we highlight some future research topics that could advance the field and point out remaining challenges and open questions.

Let $G=(V,E)$ denote a simple undirected connected graph, where $V$ denotes the set of vertices and $E$ denotes the set of edges connecting pairs of vertices in $V$. Let $\Lambda(G)$ denote the natural boundary operator acting on $G$, i.e., let $\Lambda^n G=\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k\delta_{B_k}$ be the discrete gradient function of the boundary operator $\Lambda$, where $\{\delta_{B_k}\}_{k=1}^{\Lambda(\emptyset)}\subseteq\mathrm{ker}(\Lambda)$ is a basis of the space of functions defined on the boundary $\partial B_{\emptyset}$. Thus, the $k$-th component of the boundary vector $\bar{b}=\Lambda^k b$ at vertex $v$ is given by
$$
\bar{b}_v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\sum_{u\in N(v)}x_u,\quad x_u\in\mathbb R^p,\quad d=\deg(v)-1,\quad k\leq n<\infty.
$$
We assume that all vertices in $V$ are equally distributed across the processes that will execute the partitioning algorithm. Each process operates independently and receives an equal share of the entire graph.

The Laplacian matrix of the graph $G$ is defined as
$$
L=D-\A,
$$
where $D$ is the diagonal degree matrix and $\A$ is the adjacency matrix, both of which satisfy the following properties:

1. $(i,j)\neq (j,i)$ for all $i\neq j$.
2. For all $i\in V$, $D_{ii}>0$, $D_{ij}=0$ if $i\not\in N_j(i)$.
3. $L$ is symmetric.

Assume now that we want to divide $G$ into two parts $S$ and $T$ such that the number of vertices in $S$ is approximately half of the total number of vertices in $G$. To achieve this goal, we can apply spectral partitioning algorithms to find two eigenvectors $U^{(1)}$ and $U^{(2)}$ of $L$ that correspond to the two largest non-zero singular values of $L$ within some tolerance $\epsilon$. More precisely, we require that the following conditions hold:

1. $\|\theta_1\|_\infty\leq\frac{1}{2}$, where $\theta_1=[U^{(1)}_1,\cdots,U^{(1)}_n]$.
2. $\|\theta_2\|_\infty\leq\frac{1}{2}$, where $\theta_2=[U^{(2)}_1,\cdots,U^{(2)}_n]$.
3. $\|\theta_1\cdot \theta_2\|_\infty\leq \epsilon$.

Under certain conditions, we can further ensure that the number of vertices in $S$ is exactly half of the total number of vertices in $G$ by setting $\epsilon=0$ and requiring that $d^{(1)},d^{(2)}\leq\frac{n}{2},$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$. This ensures that the product $\theta_1\cdot \theta_2$ contains only zeros except for entries that correspond to shared vertices, and hence, the number of vertices in $S$ is exactly half of the total number of vertices in $G$. When computing eigenvectors, we can truncate the second smallest value until reaching the desired precision level $\varepsilon$.
