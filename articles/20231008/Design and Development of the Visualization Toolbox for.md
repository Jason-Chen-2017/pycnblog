# 1.背景介绍


Microbial communities are commonly studied through various types of visualizations such as bar graphs, scatter plots, heat maps etc. However, little attention has been paid to developing effective visualization tools that provide valuable insights into microbial community data in public health surveillance settings where accurate interpretation of complex patterns is critical. 

Herein, we propose a new type of toolbox called "Public Health Visualization Toolkit (PHVT)" which provides an integrated set of software tools designed specifically for analyzing microbial community data from public health surveillance scenarios. The toolkit includes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, clustering techniques like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines to identify biological patterns and relationships among individual microbes and the environmental factors they interact with. Additionally, the PHVT can be customized using user-friendly GUIs so that it becomes easy to use by non-technical users and researchers alike. We have implemented several example applications that demonstrate how these technologies can be applied to different types of microbial community datasets including fecal bacteria, urine bacteria, water quality monitoring systems, and sewage sludge. These examples will serve as case studies to showcase the utility and effectiveness of the proposed visualization toolbox.

# 2.核心概念与联系
The PHVT uses a variety of methods and algorithms to analyze microbial community datasets. Below is a brief overview of each method:

1. Data preprocessing and normalization: This involves cleaning up the dataset and standardizing the scale to ensure proper analysis. 

2. Dimensionality reduction: Algorithms like PCA, t-SNE or others reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining important information. This helps us visualize the distribution of microbes in high-dimensional space and identify clusters of similarities or trends.

3. Clustering: Techniques like K-Means, hierarchical clustering or neural networks assign individuals to predefined groups based on their similarity characteristics. In this process, the algorithm identifies distinctive features within each group, enabling us to evaluate the functional diversity of microbial communities.

4. Network inference: When dealing with complex social interactions between microbes, traditional approaches such as network theory may not suffice. Here, we employ methods like Markov chains or Bayesian models to infer causality relationships among microbes and their host environments.

5. Prediction and classification: For more challenging cases where we need to predict certain outcomes or classify samples into different categories, machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests or support vector machines can help. These algorithms train on available data to learn patterns and make predictions based on new observations.

6. Graphical representation: Finally, we use various graphical representations to present our results in a visually appealing manner. Several tools exist that enable us to generate interactive web-based visualizations or standalone desktop applications.

Overall, the PHVT seeks to unify the many methods and algorithms used in microbiology and public health surveillance to develop an intuitive and comprehensive platform for analyzing microbial community data. It combines novel mathematical models and statistical techniques with highly scalable computational resources to handle large-scale microbial datasets. By providing a flexible yet customizable platform, PHVT makes it easier than ever for public health authorities to gain valuable insight into their natural ecosystems and leverage them for better disease prevention and control efforts.

# 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Details
## 3.1 Data Preprocessing and Normalization
Before applying any visualization technique, the raw microbial community data needs to be cleaned and normalized. This step ensures that all the variables have equal weight and also removes any outliers that might interfere with the subsequent analysis. One way to do this is to remove rows containing missing values and perform some form of normalization such as scaling or log transformation. 

We can choose between several popular normalization methods depending upon the nature of the data. Some common normalization techniques include MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, RobustScaler and PowerTransformer. Each of these normalizers transforms the original variable range into a range of [0,1] or [-1,1], making it suitable for further processing.

## 3.2 Dimensionality Reduction 
Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of reducing the number of dimensions in a dataset while still maintaining its intrinsic structure. One popular technique for doing this is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It computes the principal components of the multivariate dataset and projects the data onto a lower dimensional subspace. This allows us to capture the maximum amount of variance in the data without losing much information about the original structure.

PCA achieves this by calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the correlation matrix of the input data. The eigenvectors correspond to the directions along which the data varies most quickly, while the corresponding eigenvalues indicate the magnitude of those variations. We select only the top k eigenvectors and project the original data onto the subspace spanned by these vectors.

Another widely used technique for dimensionality reduction is t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) which applies a nonlinear mapping to the data that tries to preserve both local and global aspects of the data's distribution. It generates a two-dimensional map of the embedded data points that conveys the structure of the high-dimensional space in a way that is very similar to what we would observe if we plotted the points in a low-dimensional projection. The key idea behind t-SNE is to determine a suitable cost function that balances distance and similarity within and across the data points. If the costs are too high, then the embedding will not produce smooth shapes, whereas if the costs are too low, then the data will cluster together unnecessarily. Therefore, we typically optimize the cost function over multiple runs to obtain good results.

## 3.3 Clustering
Clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in machine learning and pattern recognition that aims to group similar objects together based on their attributes or behaviors. There are several popular clustering techniques such as K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model, etc., which differ in terms of their underlying assumptions, performance metrics, and practical implications. 

K-Means is a simple but powerful approach that partitions the data into k clusters based on the centroid of each cluster. At each iteration, K-Means updates the positions of the centroids and assigns each point to the nearest cluster center. The algorithm terminates when the assignment stops changing or after a fixed number of iterations. Commonly, K-Means is initialized using k random centroids chosen randomly from the dataset, although other initialization strategies can lead to better convergence rates. Despite its simplicity, K-Means performs well on relatively small to medium sized datasets, especially when there are clear clusters within the data.

Hierarchical clustering is another clustering technique that operates recursively, starting with each object in its own cluster. At each stage, pairs of clusters are merged that minimally increase the similarity of the resulting clusters. The final result is a tree-like structure where internal nodes represent merged clusters and leaves represent singleton objects. Hierarchical clustering can handle mixed geometry and noise easily and usually produces a dendrogram showing the hierarchy of clusters.

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are another probabilistic model that assumes a mixture of Gaussians, representing each object as a weighted combination of multiple normal distributions. GMMs can model complex shape and size distributions of the data, often giving better results compared to simpler clustering techniques like K-Means. In contrast to K-Means, GMMs allow for elliptical distributions and can handle incomplete data sets.

Neural Networks and Deep Learning are two popular machine learning techniques that work particularly well on structured or tabular data. They can extract relevant patterns and relationships from heterogeneous sources, such as text, images or audio signals. In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known for their ability to automatically detect spatial dependencies in the input data, which can be useful for analyzing microbial community data.

## 3.4 Network Inference
Network science is a branch of mathematics and computer science that focuses on studying complex systems and their interconnections. Among its fields, network inference is the task of inferring the structure of a network given its observed properties or measurements. Traditional network inference techniques such as statistical mechanics assume a specific type of probability distribution, such as a power law, to describe the connection strengths between nodes. Other techniques, however, use machine learning algorithms to infer the network topology directly from the data itself, often using graph-theoretic concepts such as cliques or triads.

Markov chains are a class of stochastic processes that exhibit a memoryless property, meaning that future states depend solely on the current state and no external events influence the transition probabilities. Assuming that each node is initially connected independently at random, a stationary state is reached after a finite time. To estimate the connectivity of the system, we follow the chain backwards from a terminal state, keeping track of the fraction of times that each pair of neighboring nodes was visited during the walk. The average visit frequency gives rise to a correlation matrix whose elements encode the degree of connectivity between nodes. This matrix can be interpreted as a weighted adjacency matrix of the network.

In addition to Markov chains, Bayesian inference provides a framework for reasoning under uncertainty and deals with situations where we lack prior knowledge of the system. It treats the probabilities of observing each event as a probability density function and integrates over possible causes of events to compute their joint probability. Using this framework, we can estimate the conditional probability of different linkages between nodes based on the strength of evidence provided by the observed properties. Examples of Bayesian networks include models for epidemiology, sociology, finance and business networks.

## 3.5 Predictive and Classification Methods
Predictive modeling is the process of estimating the outcome of a phenomenon given certain inputs. Supervised learning techniques attempt to solve this problem by training a model on labeled data where the output variable is already known. Two common supervised learning methods are linear regression and logistic regression, which relate a set of input variables to a continuous or binary response variable. Other supervised learning methods include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks. Decision Trees divide the feature space into regions based on a single attribute, repeatedly splitting the space until a stopping criterion is met. Random Forests combine multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) aim to find a hyperplane that separates the positive and negative classes of data points, while also maximizing the margin around the boundary. Neural Networks are able to capture complex relationships between input and output variables using non-linear functions.

Classification problems require assigning a categorical label to an observation based on a set of input features. One common classification technique is Naïve Bayes, which estimates the probability of a sample belonging to each category based on the frequencies of features associated with that category. Other classification techniques include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs and Neural Networks. Logistic Regression is similar to linear regression except that the dependent variable is restricted to be binary. Decision Trees are similar to regression trees, dividing the feature space into regions based on a single attribute. SVMs maximize the width of the decision boundary and try to balance the error rate between different classes. Neural Networks can achieve higher accuracy by using non-linear activation functions and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

## 3.6 Graphical Representation
Visualization plays an essential role in understanding and interpreting data, enabling humans to quickly spot patterns and correlations. Many popular visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Plotly, D3.js and Bokeh provide APIs for generating static and interactive visualizations, respectively.

Static Visualizations display data on a 2D surface or chart, with one dimension per axis. Examples of common static visualizations include line charts, scatterplots, histograms, pie charts and box plots. Interactive Visualizations offer additional interactivity options beyond zooming and panning, allowing users to explore complex patterns in real-time. These include time series animations, linked views, cross-filtering, tooltips and clickable legends.

One famous interactive visualization library is Google Maps. Users can pan, zoom, rotate, and filter the data displayed on the map, enabling them to discover geographic patterns and trends at different scales. Another interesting application of interactive visualizations is data exploration and manipulation via parallel coordinates and force directed layouts. Parallel coordinates displays multi-dimensional data sets in a matrix format, with lines connecting related variables and colors indicating the relative value of each attribute. Force-directed layouts treat vertices as nodes and edges as springs, simulating physical forces acting on them to create emergent structures. Both techniques help users understand the relationships and dependencies between variables and drive insights.
