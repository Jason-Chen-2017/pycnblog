## 概述
随着云计算、容器技术的普及，越来越多的人开始关注容器安全、减少安全风险。container security is critical for any organization that uses containers in production environments. In this article, we will discuss the different methods to secure containerized applications and explain how a combination of configuration management, runtime security mechanisms and application hardening techniques can help organizations achieve better container security posture. Additionally, we will explore ways to detect and respond to vulnerabilities in real-time using container scanning tools like Clair or Twistlock. Finally, we will provide recommendations on further steps an organization should take to ensure their container security posture remains strong and resilient against threats over time. 

In this series of articles, we will cover these topics: 

1. Introduction - This article provides an overview of container security and why it's important to secure your containers.

2. Container Runtime Security - We'll learn about the various options available for securing your container runtime environment and best practices for hardening them. We'll also dive into the differences between running containers with root privileges and non-root privileges, as well as strategies to limit escalation of privilege when possible.

3. Image Configuration Management - We'll discuss some popular image configuration management tools and walk through the process of creating custom images with improved security measures enabled.

4. Application Hardening - We'll delve deeper into the inner workings of containers and explore different layers of defense to protect our applications from attackers. The focus here will be on strategies for hardening individual application components such as API endpoints, databases, and file systems.

5. Continuous Vulnerability Monitoring - While traditional vulnerability scanners may not always have full visibility into container environments, continuous monitoring solutions like Clair and Twistlock offer more detailed information and actionable alerts to help keep your containers safe and up-to-date.

6. Summary - In conclusion, we've reviewed six key areas of container security, including introduction, container runtime security, image configuration management, application hardening, continuous vulnerability monitoring, and summary. These areas are essential components for ensuring your containers remain secure even after they're deployed. By following best practices outlined throughout this series of articles, you can effectively manage your container security risk and stay ahead of emerging threats.
