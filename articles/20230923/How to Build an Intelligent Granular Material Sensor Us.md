# Section 1: Introduction 
## Background Information  
The modern world today relies heavily on natural resources such as minerals, metals, and plastics. As a result, there has been an exponential growth in the consumption of these resources due to globalization. However, this also led to an increase in production costs and pollution levels resulting in higher environmental impact.  

One of the major challenges facing the industry today is the significant amount of waste produced during the manufacturing process. One way to reduce waste is to implement automated warehouse management systems that monitor the location, quality, and flow of raw materials before they are processed. Another approach is to design granular material sensors that can identify and track debris and ensure efficient resource usage. Granular materials range from small pieces of fine powders to large cubes of solid materials such as metal and stone. To build a reliable granular material detector requires knowledge of scientific principles, electronics, mechanical engineering, and software development.  


## Application Areas of Granular Material Sensors  
 - Chemical detection: Granular materials can be used for early detection of potential threats to human health. Therefore, it is crucial to design advanced algorithms that can recognize and isolate traces of certain types of harmful chemicals.
 - Food processing: Granular materials can be useful in industries such as agriculture where they are used for rough granulation processes such as drying, grinding, and mixing ingredients. By detecting debris early enough, wastage can be reduced, improved efficiency can be achieved, and customer satisfaction can be enhanced.
 - Mining industry: Granular materials can be employed as an effective method for monitoring mineral deposits. They help detect erosion, find sand spots, and locate heavy ores.
 - Construction industry: Granular materials are often used in constructions to prevent damage caused by falling rocks or mould spores. Several companies have already demonstrated the feasibility of applying granular material sensors in this field through its ability to identify and eliminate adhesive residue.   



# Section 2: Basic Concepts and Terms Explanation 
## Biological Principles of Granular Materials
Granular materials are molecules made up of many smaller particles called microscopic grains. Each grain has a characteristic shape and size ranging from a few microns to several centimeters. These microscopic grains can be organic, semi-organic, or inorganic. Organic compounds such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are present in all forms of granular matter. Hemicellulose is composed mostly of chitin which helps protect them from water. While semi-organic materials such as fibers or synthetic polymers can also exist in the interior of granular matter.

It is essential to understand how these microscopic grains interact with each other and what forces cause them to separate. There are two fundamental forces that act on the microscopic grains inside a granular material. First, gravity acts as a force pushing them down towards the bottom of the material. Second, friction between the grains creates air bubbles around the surface causing them to stick together. 

Together, these forces create a stable structure known as a spherical shell or sphere. Depending on the temperature and pressure in the surrounding environment, the internal motions of the grains may cause them to move slightly differently. If the ambient conditions are hot and moist, the grains may shift into larger and more compact shapes while cooler environments may show a denser distribution of microscopic grains.

## Physics and Mechanics of Granular Materials
While biology gives us a better understanding of how granular materials work, physical principles offer insights into the inner workings of the material itself. Understanding the behavior of the fluid inside the granular material is key to making sense of its signals. Let’s start by diving deeper into the role of viscosity in the behavior of granular matter.

Viscosity refers to the resistance of a substance to flowing liquid, gas, or solids. When a body exhibits a high level of viscosity, it becomes difficult to transport or pass liquids freely. However, when the viscosity of the body decreases, the fluid flows easily even if the velocity is relatively slow. Viscosity is usually measured in the units of kinematic viscosity (m²/s). Higher viscosity indicates a greater resistance to flowing compared to lower viscosities.

The behavior of granular materials is influenced by three primary factors - pressure, temperature, and density. Pressure affects the movement of the grains inside the material. For example, increasing pressure causes the grains to stretch, compress, and slide farther apart. Similarly, cooling the material changes the overall geometry and therefore, increases the average size of the grains. Density plays a crucial role in determining the diameter and volume of the grains. Heavier dense materials tend to produce larger and smoother grains, whereas lighter ones produce smaller and denser grains. Overall, the effects of these factors create complex geometries known as the nanostructure of granular matter.

Finally, since granular materials are made up of small particles that cannot fall individually, the medium must continuously flow against the surface until the entire mass settles down onto the substrate. This results in turbulent flows that propagate away from the surface leading to a vortex sheet pattern. Vortices that do not align properly lead to buckling instability. Buckling occurs when an object tends to oscillate back and forth and eventually loses all relative balance. Increasing the stiffness of the material reduces the frequency of vibrations and mitigates buckling issues. 


## Signal Processing and Image Analysis in Granular Material Sensors  
As mentioned earlier, granular material sensors use image analysis techniques to capture and interpret the signals emanating from the surroundings. The captured images are then analyzed to identify specific characteristics associated with the detected materials. Different approaches have been taken to develop image analysis techniques for granular material sensors. The following are some of the commonly used techniques:

1. **Histogram Equalization**: Histogram equalization is a technique that normalizes the intensity values across an image so that the pixels occupy an equal number of spaces in the color space. This makes it easier for an algorithm to process the image effectively.

2. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Adaptive thresholding involves adjusting the threshold value automatically depending on the pixel values in the region of interest. This allows the algorithm to adapt to varying lighting conditions, reducing noise and improving accuracy.

3. **Background Subtraction**: Background subtraction refers to the removal of the foreground objects (i.e., the materials) from an image. The background is modeled as the median of multiple frames obtained from different angles and distances. The difference between the current frame and the model serves as the mask for removing the background.

4. **Edge Detection**: Edge detection techniques involve finding discontinuities in the gradient of the grayscale image. Discontinuities occur wherever the brightness transitions from one value to another, indicating regions of rapid change.

5. **Shape Detection**: Shape detection techniques focus on detecting particular shapes in the image. Often, shape detection is done via template matching or clustering techniques. Template matching involves comparing the features of an input image with pre-defined templates in order to locate them in the image. Clustering involves grouping similar shapes together into clusters based on similarity criteria.

6. **Feature Tracking**: Feature tracking involves keeping track of the position and movement of an object over consecutive frames. This is useful for scenarios where the same object appears multiple times in the scene but needs to be tracked across multiple frames.

All of these techniques provide valuable insights into the working mechanism of granular material sensors. Overcoming these challenges and integrating them seamlessly into an intelligent granular material detector would greatly enhance its capability to detect different types of granular materials accurately and efficiently.
