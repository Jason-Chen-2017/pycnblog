Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is a widely used technique in machine learning to minimize the expected loss function over training examples from a given data set with supervised or unsupervised learning techniques. The basic idea behind ERM is to find the model parameters that minimize the empirical risk over all possible training examples by updating them iteratively using gradient descent algorithm in an online manner. We can divide ERM into three categories: ranking, classification, and prediction tasks. In this article, we will focus on both ranking and classification algorithms for decision making under uncertainty. 

In the first part of this article, we will introduce some background knowledge and concepts related to ERM, including mathematical optimization theory, convexity, regularization, and multi-task learning. Then, we will discuss about rank-based methods such as pointwise mutual information and Bayesian personalized ranking. Next, we will explain about the intuition and steps of cooperative filtering algorithm which predicts user preferences for items. Finally, we will summarize the strengths and weaknesses of different types of models and compare their performance through experiments on real-world datasets. 

In the second part of the article, we will cover advanced topics such as collaborative filtering, deep neural networks, multiclass ERM problems, and transfer learning. After that, we will present two practical applications of ERM, recommender systems and anomaly detection, and analyze its advantages and limitations when applied to large-scale datasets.

## Mathematical Optimization Theory
Mathematical optimization is one of the fundamental areas of mathematics concerned with finding optimal solutions for various problems. It involves solving problems of finding extremes, optimizing costs, resource allocation, and designing products or processes. There are many subfields of mathematics involved in optimization, ranging from linear programming, quadratic programming, integer programming, discrete optimization, nonconvex optimization, semidefinite programming, and metaheuristics. In this section, we will briefly introduce some key concepts of mathematical optimization.
### Convexity
Convex functions are functions where if you draw a straight line connecting any two points on the graph, the line always lies above the curve. More precisely, convex functions have the following properties:
- If $f(x)$ is a convex function, then $\forall x_1\in X$, there exists at least one $x_2\in X$ such that $f(x_2)\leq f(x_1)+\nabla f(x_1)^T(x_2-x_1)$. This means that the value of the function increases monotonically when moving towards more optimal values along the direction indicated by the tangent vector $\nabla f(x_1)$. That is, it takes less work to increase the function value than it would take to decrease it.
- Any twice differentiable function is also convex.
- A single variable function is convex if and only if its Hessian matrix is positive definite everywhere. This means that all critical points of the function are local minima or saddle points.

A convex problem has a global minimum if and only if the objective function is convex and the constraints are linear or affine. If these conditions are not met, then the problem is said to be nonconvex. One way to transform a nonconvex problem into a convex problem is to add artificial variables, known as slack variables, which allow the original problem to become feasible while still satisfying all constraints. However, adding too many slack variables can result in a complex, ill-posed problem. Therefore, it's important to carefully choose appropriate constraint type and penalties to ensure feasibility and smoothness of the solution.

### Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is a popular optimization method for finding the minimum of a function by iteratively moving in the direction opposite to the gradient until convergence. The update rule is simple: $x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta\nabla f(x_t)$, where $\eta$ is the step size or learning rate, which controls the speed of convergence. Theorem 1 shows that every stationary point of the objective function has a unique minimum global optimizer corresponding to the direction opposite to its gradient. Hence, repeated application of this update rule eventually converges to the true global optimum.

### Regularization
Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that discourages the model from taking on extreme values. The most common form of regularization is L2 regularization, which adds a squared norm of the weights to the cost function: $J(\theta)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\{y_i-\hat y_i+\lambda\|\theta\|^2\}$. Here, $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter that controls the amount of regularization and serves as a tradeoff between fitting the training data well and avoiding overfitting. Another popular form of regularization is dropout, which randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation of neurons. Dropout works by setting the output of each neuron to zero with a certain probability.

### Multi-Task Learning
Multi-task learning refers to the task of simultaneously learning several related tasks in a single model. For instance, in natural language processing, we might want to classify text documents as belonging to multiple categories at once, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition. Traditional machine learning approaches typically treat each category separately and require separate models. However, with multi-task learning, we can learn all these tasks together using a single model that outputs joint probabilities for each document. The goal is to improve overall accuracy by combining the individual models' predictions.
