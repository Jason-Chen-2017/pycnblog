# 1.简介
  

Static analysis tools are the type of software tool that analyzes source code without executing it to find bugs or vulnerabilities in a program's design, structure, and behavior before runtime. These tools analyze compiled code, which means they work on machine-readable representations of programs rather than their source code. They do not require any running instances of an application to perform static analysis, making them ideal for use with continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

Dynamic analysis tools are the type of software tool that interacts directly with a running instance of an application at runtime and monitors its execution for errors and exceptions. These tools allow developers to detect potential security threats such as buffer overflows and format string attacks, as well as more subtle issues like memory leaks, deadlocks, and race conditions. Dynamic analysis is often used by testing frameworks, bug trackers, and customer support teams to provide real-time feedback about applications' behavior during development.

Together, both types of tools can help improve the quality of software products and reduce the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced into production systems. However, choosing the right combination of tools requires careful consideration of each tool's strengths and weaknesses, knowledge of programming language syntax, and experience with specific projects. 

In this article, we'll explore some common static and dynamic analysis tools and how they can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines using various languages and environments. We'll also discuss why it's important to choose the right set of tools for your project and what challenges might arise if you don't have access to experts on these technologies. Overall, our goal will be to give you a comprehensive overview of available options and identify opportunities for improvement in the industry.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving deeper into the details of static and dynamic analysis tools, let's first define some basic concepts and terminology. This information may seem overwhelming but it helps to understand the core ideas behind static analysis and ensure we're all on the same page:

 - Source code: The textual representation of computer programs written in high-level programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, etc.
 - Compiled code: Machine-readable representation of source code generated after compilation by a compiler or interpreter.
 - Bytecode: A low-level binary representation of compiled code that is designed specifically for easy interpretation and execution by virtual machines.
 - Binary: A file containing instructions executable by the operating system. It is typically produced from compiled code via linking and optimization processes.
 - Executable: An application that has been compiled and linked into a single binary executable file. It contains everything needed to run the program, including libraries and other dependencies required to execute properly. 
 - Debugging: The process of locating and fixing errors and bugs in a program while it is still executing.
 - Testing: The act of verifying whether a software product behaves as expected when executed under certain conditions. Tests aim to catch unexpected edge cases, errors, and defects.
 - Code review: The practice of looking at source code, line by line, and providing comments on areas where changes need to be made or improvements could be made.

Now, let's dive deeper into the details of different types of analysis tools. In order to compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, we need to break down their methodologies and approaches. Specifically, we should focus on the following aspects:

  - Methodology: Whether the tool employs manual inspection, heuristic analysis, or statistical inference techniques.
  - Focus: Which part(s) of the codebase(s) the tool looks at; either just the source code itself or parts of it that are already compiled.
  - Coverage: How much of the codebase the tool examines. Some tools only examine the lines of code themselves, whereas others look at entire functions, modules, files, directories, or packages. 
  - Language Support: What programming languages the tool supports. Most modern tools offer support for multiple languages, while older tools may be restricted to one or two popular ones. 
  - Time Complexity: How long the tool takes to analyze large codebases. Some tools take longer to analyze larger codebases because they must handle complexities like control flow graphs and data structures.
  - Accuracy: How accurate the tool's results are. Some tools are highly accurate, while others may produce false positives or negatives due to limitations in their algorithms or assumptions. 
  - Scalability: How well the tool can handle very large codebases, particularly those that contain many thousands of lines of code or more. 
  - Customizability: How easy it is to customize the tool's configuration settings to tailor it to specific needs. For example, a developer might want to configure the tool to generate reports in a particular style or output formats based on his or her preferences. 
  - Integration: How easily the tool can be integrated into various stages of the software development lifecycle, including build, test, and deploy phases. 
These criteria form the basis of evaluating and selecting appropriate tools for your project. 

Let's now move on to exploring the actual tools offered in the market today. 


# 3. Common Analysis Tools

## 3.1 FLAKE8
FLAKE8 is a code analyzer tool that checks for style violations and logical errors in Python code. It works by parsing through Python source files and applying regular expressions to search for problematic patterns, such as trailing whitespace, unused variables, and missing imports. By default, it includes plugins for checking PEP 8 compliance, Django coding conventions, and importing best practices. The tool generates reports that highlight any offending code along with suggested corrections automatically. The user can modify the configuration settings of the tool according to their requirements.

Flake8 offers several advantages over traditional linters such as PyLint: 

1. Flake8 integrates with Git hooks so that users can automate the check and fix process for new commits or changes.
2. Flake8 can detect and report multiple types of issues such as naming convention violations, import order issues, and complexity metrics.  
3. Flake8 comes packaged with built-in plugins for checking PEP 8 compliance, Django coding conventions, and importing best practices, thus enabling developers to enforce coding standards across a codebase.
4. Flake8 is easy to install, requiring only a few commands to get started. Additionally, it runs quickly even on large codebases since it only performs simple regex pattern matching operations.

Overall, FLAKE8 is a widely-used open-source tool with strong community support and extensive documentation resources. Its popularity indicates its usefulness as a linting tool for Python developers who prefer lightweight solutions instead of full-fledged IDEs.   


## 3.2 Mypy
Mypy is a static type checker for Python that adds optional type hints to source code and performs type inference to unify the way code is interpreted. It catches typing mistakes early in the development cycle, allowing developers to avoid expensive runtime debugging sessions later on. Mypy uses a gradual typing approach, meaning it doesn't require rewriting existing code and can be added incrementally throughout the development lifecycle. Mypy provides detailed error messages, including helpful suggestions to resolve type mismatches. Developers can specify custom types and annotations within docstrings or stub files to further enhance type safety.

Mypy has several benefits compared to traditional type checkers:

1. Mypy is capable of handling complex codebases with nested function calls, loops, conditional statements, and recursion.
2. Mypy produces precise error messages that point out exactly where in the code the issue was encountered.
3. Mypy offers advanced features such as generics and protocols for working with collections and interfaces, respectively.
4. Mypy allows customization of the behavior of the type checker through config files and command-line flags.

As mentioned earlier, Mypy can integrate seamlessly with most Python IDEs and editors, supporting powerful autocompletion features and real-time error reporting.

Overall, Mypy is becoming increasingly popular among Python developers, especially those who value type safety and readability. The addition of type annotations makes Mypy a compelling alternative to other static type checkers like Pylint and mypyc.



## 3.3 Radon
Radon is a tool for computing various software metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, and Halstead complexity measures, among others. Radon operates on Python code as it is parsed and analyzed by an abstract syntax tree (AST). It does not require compiling the code and works on purely syntactic constructs, eliminating the need for external tools like compilers or interpreters. Radon can handle various forms of input, including standalone Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and GitHub repositories. Radon can compute metrics for whole modules, classes, functions, and methods, giving developers a holistic view of their code base's health.

Some key benefits of Radon include:

1. Easy installation: Radon can be installed using pip or conda, making it easy for developers to start using it immediately.
2. Fast computation times: Radon is able to scan Python codebases very quickly, making it suitable for continuous integration and deployment scenarios.
3. Flexible usage: Radon is highly flexible and can handle a wide variety of inputs, including individual files, directories, and git repositories.
4. Powerful output formatting: Radon can print results in JSON or CSV formats, making it easy to extract and share metric data with other tools or platforms.

Radon is a versatile tool that covers a wide range of analysis tasks. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a good choice for small to medium sized code bases. However, its scalability limits its applicability to very large codebases, making it less practical in industrial contexts.
