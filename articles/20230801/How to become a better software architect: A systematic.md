         # 2.Architecture and Design Patterns
         ## 2.1 Architecture
         ### 2.1.1 What is architecture?
         In simple terms, architecture refers to the fundamental decisions made during the development of any software solution or product from conception to deployment into operation. These decisions include defining the scope of work, choosing appropriate technologies, implementing infrastructure, designing databases, and optimizing overall performance.

         In practice, architecture typically falls under three categories - global, component, and solution level. Global architecture covers the entire project while component architecture focuses on specific modules within the application. Solution architecture addresses the issues faced when dealing with multiple components integrated together, such as scaling, security, and resilience.
         
         Each of these architectures have varying levels of complexity depending on the scale of the project. For instance, global architecture may involve several teams working across different geographical regions, where each team would collaborate closely to define its own business goals and constraints. Component architecture requires well-defined boundaries between different functional areas of the application, allowing developers to independently manage them without affecting other parts of the codebase. On the other hand, solution architecture targets highly integrated systems that must adhere to strict requirements imposed by external parties, like payment gateways or insurance providers.

          ### 2.1.2 Components and Services
          At the core of every modern application is a set of interconnected components, also known as microservices. Microservices are small, independent services responsible for handling individual features of the application, enabling rapid delivery, flexible scaling, and agility. Each service communicates with others via APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), providing a loosely coupled architecture that allows for easy maintenance and evolution of the system.
          
          Another important aspect of microservices is that they should be stateless, meaning that each request should not rely on any persistent data storage outside the local memory space. This makes it easier to horizontally scale the application, since adding new instances doesn't require moving all existing data around. Instead, each instance handles requests independently based on its local data.

          Additionally, microservices can communicate asynchronously, relying instead on message queues to handle events or commands. This enables event-driven architectures that allow for faster response times, lower latency, and increased scalability.

          ### 2.1.3 Design Principles
          1. Single Responsibility Principle - Every class or module should do one thing and one thing only. When classes or modules start getting too big and too many responsibilities, it becomes difficult to test, debug, and modify them separately. Therefore, breaking down complex functionality into smaller, simpler units makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

          2. Open/Closed Principle - Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. Adding new functionalities or behaviors to existing entities should not break existing client code. Instead, new implementations should be added as separate classes or subclasses that extend the original entity's behavior.
           
          3. Dependency Inversion Principle - Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementation details. This principle states that higher-level modules shouldn’t depend upon low-level modules. Rather, both modules should depend upon abstractions that make sense at the same level of abstraction. This reduces coupling and increases modularity.

          4. Separation of Concerns - Separating concerns means organizing the code base so that it has distinct sections responsible for different aspects of the problem being solved. This promotes modularization and simplifies testing, debugging, and maintenance.

           5. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle - DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself," and it encourages developers to reuse code whenever possible. By creating reusable modules and libraries, developers save time and effort by avoiding redundant coding efforts.

        ## 2.2 Refactoring Techniques
        Refactoring is the process of improving the structure, readability, and extensibility of existing code without changing its external behavior. There are several techniques commonly used for refactoring, including renaming variables, extracting methods, and replacing conditional statements with polymorphism.

        **Renaming Variables:** Renaming a variable is a straightforward task, especially if done systematically throughout the whole codebase. However, there are certain conventions and best practices that need to followed to ensure consistency and clarity. Here are some common ones:
        
        * Avoid using single character names, except for very short temporary variables or counters.
        * Use meaningful names that describe what the variable represents, even if this means repeating information already present elsewhere in the code. 
        * Keep names concise and descriptive, taking advantage of language features such as aliases and type hints. 

        **Extracting Methods:** Extracting methods involves breaking out a section of code into its own method, whether because it is long and complex, needs to be tested separately, or simply needs to be reused somewhere else in the code. To extract a method, first identify the logic that belongs inside the new method. Then create a function signature that defines the parameters, return value, and exceptional cases. Write the body of the function according to your specifications. Once completed, replace the old code with a call to the newly created method.
        
        **Replacing Conditional Statements with Polymorphism:** One way to refactor code is to remove conditional branches and replace them with polymorphic behavior. For example, consider the following code snippet:

        ```python
        def calculate_tax(amount):
            tax = 0
            if amount > 1000:
                tax = amount * 0.1
            elif amount > 500:
                tax = amount * 0.07
            else:
                tax = amount * 0.05
            return tax
        ```

        If we wanted to add another condition for calculating taxes based on income bracket, we could rewrite the code to use polymorphism like so:

        ```python
        class TaxCalculator:
            def __init__(self, brackets=[(0, 1000, 0.1),(500, float('inf'), 0.07)]):
                self.brackets = sorted(brackets)
            
            def calculate_tax(self, amount):
                rate = None
                for min_income, max_income, bracket in self.brackets:
                    if min_income <= amount <= max_income:
                        rate = bracket
                        break
                if rate is None:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid income")
                return amount * rate
            
        calculator = TaxCalculator()
        
        def calculate_tax(amount):
            return calculator.calculate_tax(amount)
        ```

        In this case, we've moved the calculation of tax rates into a separate `TaxCalculator` class that takes care of the sorting and searching for applicable tax brackets. We then replaced the previous `if`/`elif`/`else` branch with a loop that iterates over the list of tuples representing the tax brackets, selects the correct one based on the input amount, and assigns the corresponding tax rate.

        This technique helps keep the main calculation logic cleaner and more readable, making it easier to reason about the flow of execution and prevent bugs caused by incorrect assumptions about the input values.
