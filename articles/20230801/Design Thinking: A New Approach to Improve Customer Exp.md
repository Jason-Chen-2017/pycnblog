 Design Thinking is a Chinese philosophy and methodology originated in the UK by IBM. The basic idea of Design Thinking is to emphasize human-centered design, collaboration, and iterative improvement through dialogue with users and stakeholders. It combines psychology, strategy, design thinking techniques such as problem-solving, ideation, prototyping, testing, and feedback loops, and business analysis skills to create products or services that are usable, engaging, delightful, and sustainable for customers. In short, it helps organizations solve complex problems by breaking them down into small parts, finding solutions one step at a time, and applying what they learn to improve products over time.
          
          Within this article, we will introduce you to the principles and concepts behind Design Thinking and explain how to apply it to customer experience improvement. You can also find out some practical examples from real-world projects related to improving product quality, user satisfaction, retention rates, and revenue growth. We hope that by reading our article, you would be able to develop a deeper understanding of this important discipline and make an impact on your organization's success.

          Note: This article assumes general knowledge of computer science, information technology (IT), marketing, sales, and/or customer service fields. However, if you have strong technical skills and backgrounds in these fields, then it should still be helpful.

         ## 2.1.背景介绍（Introduction）

         What does "customer experience" mean? And why should businesses invest in it? Well, let's start by exploring these questions first.


          1. What does “customer experience” mean?

          Customers' overall satisfaction with their experiences is defined by five factors - “aesthetics,” “functionality,” “usability,” “reliability,” and “personalization.” These aspects determine whether a customer feels positive about the brand, product, or service they’ve purchased. 

          Together, these attributes contribute to the perception of the entire experience - the individual interaction between the consumer and the brand. Overall customer satisfaction is determined by the sum total of all five attributes. 


          Now let us explore more about "customer experience":

          2. Why should businesses invest in it?

          Businesses need to continually strive towards creating better customer experiences. As evidenced by numerous research findings, poor customer experiences result in low sales and increased churn rates among other negative consequences. 

          By investing in customer experience management, companies can enhance customer relationships and boost customer loyalty by providing relevant, consistent and personalized value-adding services. Companies who manage the customer experience effectively could potentially increase their bottom line, while delivering great value to their consumers. 

          Additionally, developing a well-rounded, comprehensive and integrated approach to customer experience creates tremendous opportunities for businesses to compete successfully within increasingly crowded marketplaces. 



         ## 2.2.设计思维的概念和相关术语（Concepts and Terminologies）

         Let's talk about Design Thinking terminologies before diving deep into the core concept and ideas behind Design Thinking. Here's what we'll cover:

         1. Design Thinking

         Design Thinking is a Chinese philosophy and methodology that emphasizes human-centered design, collaboration, and iteration, known as “human-centred design process”. It was coined in the United Kingdom by IBM in 1987 and has become one of the most popular design methods used worldwide today. 

         2. Human-Centricity

         HCD refers to a set of principles, practices, tools, and processes that focus on ensuring that the end product meets the needs of the people using it, not just its makers. It encourages constant input from various stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, users, and designers, to ensure that each element of the final product is designed to address different needs, preferences, and concerns. 

         3. Collaboration

         At its core, Design Thinking involves collaborating across multiple disciplines to develop products and services that work together seamlessly to provide valuable insights, perspectives, and solutions to real-world challenges. 

         4. Problem-Solving

         One of the main principles of Design Thinking is to break down problems into smaller, simpler ones, and tackle them one step at a time. This process is called Problem-Solving. It involves analyzing current pain points, identifying issues, and formulating possible solutions. 

         5. Ideation

         Another key aspect of Design Thinking is Ideation, which involves generating many different ideas around the same issue or challenge. People often come up with multiple ways to approach the same problem or analyze a specific situation, leading to various insights. 

         6. Prototyping

         Prototype creation involves creating a working model of a potential solution before fully implementing it. It allows for early evaluation of assumptions, functionality, and performance, enabling faster decision making throughout the project lifecycle. 

         7. Testing

         After completing a prototype, testing is essential to validate its feasibility, effectiveness, and viability. User testing ensures that the proposed solution works as intended for real-world scenarios, uncovering any necessary improvements or changes needed to meet customer expectations. 

         8. Feedback Loops

         Feedback loops are crucial in Design Thinking because they enable continuous improvement and learning. They involve continuous communication between stakeholders, team members, and executives, providing regular updates, suggestions, and comments to keep teams focused on staying aligned on objectives, improving processes, and shaping new approaches. 

         Besides these fundamental principles, there are several additional terms and concepts to consider when doing Design Thinking, including Value Driven Design, Continuous Improvement, Teamwork, and Contextual Design.
