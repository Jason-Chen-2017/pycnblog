# 1.简介
         
20世纪70年代，MIT大学的艾姆斯·戴维斯曼、约翰·麦卡锡和谢尔盖·庞蒂克提出了著名的“动态规划”（dynamic programming）方法，提出一种通过解决子问题而不是直接求解整个问题的方法。后来这种方法得到广泛应用于各种领域，如图灵机、运筹学、石油勘探、金融等多个领域。
          
          在机器学习、数据挖掘、模式识别等领域，也都对动态规划方法进行了高度重视。比如在图像处理、文本处理、语音识别、推荐系统、计算广告等领域，都已经或正在使用动态规划方法解决复杂的问题。因此本文旨在提供给读者一个全面的介绍，帮助其更好的理解动态规划的理论和实践。
          
          本文从动态规划的基本概念开始讲起，主要介绍动态规划算法的一些关键概念，并着重介绍两种不同类型的动态规划——正向动态规划和反向动态规划，以及它们之间的联系和区别。然后，详细描述两种类型动态规划的几个典型案例，包括背包问题、最长公共子序列问题、最短路径问题以及矩阵链乘法问题，并阐述如何用Python语言实现这些问题。最后，介绍一些注意事项和技巧，总结一下动态规划的方法优缺点，并展望到未来的发展方向。
          
       # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
        ## 2.1 What is Dynamic Programming (DP)?
        **Dynamic Programming** is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each of those subproblems only once, and storing their solutions so that they can be easily reused later. It involves two main steps:

        1. Divide the problem into overlapping subproblems - these are the same subproblems we encounter again and again while solving larger instances of the original problem. This allows us to use memoization or tabulation techniques to solve the problem efficiently.

        2. Recursively define a function that returns the optimal solution to the current subproblem, based on solutions to its subproblems.

        The primary advantage of dynamic programming over brute force algorithms like backtracking is that it reduces the overall number of times we need to compute the solution by caching the results of expensive subproblems and avoiding recomputing them repeatedly. Additionally, DP often yields better performance than other optimization techniques because it exploits relationships between similar subproblems, making it more likely to find good solutions earlier in the search process.

        In summary, dynamic programming is an algorithmic paradigm that relies on reducing a complex problem to simpler subproblems and building up a solution step-by-step, rather than trying to come up with a direct solution.

        ## 2.2 Types of DP
        There are two types of DP: forward-looking DP and backward-looking DP. Forward-looking DP starts from the beginning and works towards the end; whereas backward-looking DP starts from the end and builds up towards the beginning. Both have their advantages depending on the nature of the underlying problem at hand. For example, when optimizing the cost of some route in a city, forward-looking DP may consider all possible routes starting from any point, whereas backward-looking DP may prioritize finding efficient paths through the city center before looking farther outwards.

        ###  2.2.1 Forward-Looking DP  
        Forward-looking DP solves problems recursively, typically by filling in a table of values as we go along. At each step, we fill in the value of the smallest remaining cost path from one of our previous choices. We choose which choice gives us the best result so far, updating our list of choices accordingly until we reach the goal state. These tables usually keep track of the minimum or maximum possible cost we could obtain so far during each step, allowing us to reconstruct the optimal solution if needed. 

        Here's how this looks visually:

        ###  2.2.2 Backward-Looking DP
        Backward-looking DP, also known as bottom-up DP, also uses recursion but goes backwards instead of forwards. Starting from the final state of the problem, we build up a complete set of intermediate results by working backwards through the states and applying the appropriate decision rules. At each stage, we make a single choice that leads to the next level of optimality. Once we get to the initial state, we store the optimal solution for future reference. This method is sometimes referred to as divide and conquer. 

        Backward-looking DP has several benefits over traditional recursive methods such as memoization and branch pruning. One benefit is that it avoids redundant computations and increases the chances of early stopping and memoization. Another is that it makes it easier to parallelize since different parts of the problem can be solved independently. However, this can make it slower compared to forward-looking DP for certain problems due to increased complexity.

        Here's how this looks visually:

    ## 2.3 Key Terms
    * Subproblem: Any instance of the problem that we would face while solving the larger version of the problem.
    
    * Memoization: An optimization technique used to store previously computed results to avoid redundant computation and speed up the algorithm. When the memoized values are available, they can be returned directly instead of being recomputed, significantly reducing the time required for large problems.
    
    * Tabulation: A specific type of memoization where the memoized values are stored in a separate table as opposed to being incorporated into the recursive calls themselves.
    
    * Optimal Solution: A solution to the given problem that provides the highest expected return or lowest possible cost. This term is frequently used interchangeably with “best case scenario.”
    
    * Overlapping Subproblems: A group of related subproblems that share common characteristics.
    
    * Recursive Function: A function that consists of both base cases and recursive calls to itself, producing a sequence of operations that eventually reaches the desired output.
    
    * Brute Force Algorithm: An exhaustive search strategy that checks every possible way to solve a problem, resulting in exponential runtime complexity.
    
    * Pruning: An optimization technique used to reduce unnecessary calculations and prune branches that cannot lead to a successful solution.

    ## 3.1 Knapsack Problem
    Say you want to fit a baggage into your backpack, and you have limited space for it. You need to select items such that the total weight does not exceed a certain limit and the total value exceeds a certain amount. Let’s call the knapsack problem for this situation, the capacity constraint c, and the target values t.

    1. Define the input variables. 

    | Item i | Weight Wi| Value Vi | Capacity C |
    |:-------|:--------|:---------|:----------|
    |    1   |    w1   |    v1    |      c    |
    |    2   |    w2   |    v2    |           |
    | ...   |  ...   |  ...    |           |
    |    n   |    wn   |    vn    |           |
    
    2. Create a 2D array dp of size [n+1][c+1] to represent the optimum solution and initialize it to zeroes. The first row and column should be initialized to zeros since there will be no item or baggage left respectively.

    3. Fill in the rest of the cells of dp according to the following recurrence relation: 

     ```
      If wi > ci then 
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] 
      else 
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], vi + dp[i-1][j-wi]) 
     ```
    
    4. After filling in the entire table, the last cell dp[n][c] will contain the maximum total value that can be obtained subject to the constraints specified in the problem statement. Extract the corresponding item set from the matrix dp. 

     Example: Suppose you want to pack three items into a backpack of capacity 10kg, with weights w1=2, w2=3, w3=4, and respective values v1=5, v2=6, v3=9. Compute the maximum value V that can be obtained and extract the corresponding item set {1}.

    | Item i | Weight Wi| Value Vi | Capacity C |
    |:-------|:--------|:---------|:----------|
    |    1   |    w1   |    v1    |      10   |
    |    2   |    w2   |    v2    |            |
    |    3   |    w3   |    v3    |            |

    Therefore, V = v1 = 5.
