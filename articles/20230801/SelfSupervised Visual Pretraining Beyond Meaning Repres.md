# 1.简介
         
　　自动驾驶领域是一个非常复杂、长期且持续发展的领域。通过深度学习技术和硬件技术的不断进步，越来越多的人开始关注这个方向。而对于像交通场景这样的高维数据（如图像和文本）的分析处理，传统的计算机视觉和自然语言处理技术已经无法满足需求了。因此，为了解决这个问题，学者们提出了一种新的机器学习方法——联合嵌入(joint embedding)方法。通过将图像和文本信息结合起来进行理解，从而实现对图像语义和文本表征之间的共生关系，使得模型能够更准确地预测出每个像素在全局视野下的语义信息。自然语言生成方面也迎来了新的发展——即用机器生成语言的方式来回应图片、视频等。然而，如何将图像和文本信息有效地整合到一个特征空间中，仍然是一个难点。
        通过阅读相关文献，可以发现将两个模态的信息融合的方法实际上可以分成三种类型：(i)单模态特征学习、(ii)多模态特征交互学习、(iii)联合训练学习。
        在2021年，研究者们提出了多模态特征交互学习(Multimodal Feature Interaction Learning, MFIL)方法。MFIL方法的主要思想是在相同的特征空间下，利用不同模态之间的内在联系来学习高效的特征表示。它使用了一个称为动态自注意力模块(dynamic self attention module, DSA)的模块来提取不同模态之间的全局相似性信息。它可以看作是一种无监督的特征学习方法，可以应用于各种类型的输入信息，例如图像、文本、音频等。

        近几年，研究人员对神经网络的训练过程进行了深入的研究，尤其是当涉及到监督学习时，通常需要设计较为复杂的损失函数、优化器以及数据集的预处理方法才能保证模型的性能。但在这个过程中，对预训练过程的关注却被局限在了数据增强、微调、正则化这些标准化的方法上，缺乏考虑到预训练的必要性和作用。虽然目前有很多的经典预训练模型可供使用，但它们都没有考虑到多模态任务的需求。例如，最近提出的vision-language pretraining model (VLPT) 是基于微调的视觉识别任务上的预训练模型，但是其在多模态任务上效果不佳。
        
        本文的目的是通过一个新的视觉语言联合预训练模型来探索多模态预训练的可能性，并展示其在一些多模态任务上的有效性。我们认为，联合学习的关键是建立多个模态之间的数据和任务相关的潜在相互依赖性。
        同时，本文还着重探讨了如何有效利用不同模态的潜在相互关联，而不是简单地拼接或加权不同的模态特征。本文试图借鉴multi-task learning的思路，用多模态预训练的方式来提升多模态任务的效果。
        

        

        
        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
        
        
        
        # 2.Related Work
        ## 2.1. Unsupervised Multi-Modal Pre-Training
        #### 2.1.1. InfoNCE Loss
        One of the most popular ways to train an encoder on multiple modalities is through a technique called contrastive learning. This involves training two encoders on the same dataset but with different augmentations applied to them so that they learn different features from each other and don't rely too heavily on one modality over another. The most common loss function used in this setting is the InfoNCE loss, which is based on the idea of finding similar pairs of examples across different modalities by maximizing their mutual information. Once these encoders are trained, we can then use them as regular backbone layers in downstream tasks such as image classification or object detection.
        
        In recent years, there has been some work focusing on unsupervised multi-modal pre-training methods. These include VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), MEAD (Multi-modal Latent Space Encoder Decoder) and the masked language modeling objective for vision-and-language pre-training models. However, none of these have explicitly addressed how to handle data correlation between different modalities during the pre-training stage.

        #### 2.1.2. Reptile Algorithm
        Another approach to learn shared representations for multiple modalities is using a method called Reptile, which is based on minimizing a difference between the target parameters obtained after running a set of gradient descent steps on the task at hand. It works well when the task itself requires aligning modalities (such as machine translation), whereas it may not perform well for more general tasks where only the learned representations need to be shared (such as object recognition). Nonetheless, this method offers a simple yet effective way to share the knowledge learned by a single network over multiple tasks.

        ### 2.1.3. Mutual Knowledge Distillation
        Yet another possible approach is to leverage the knowledge distillation framework to transfer the expertise gained in one modality to the other. This could potentially help reduce the size of the required labeled datasets while still enabling good performance on downstream tasks. Although efficient implementations of this concept exist, it remains underexplored due to its limited effectiveness compared to traditional supervised multi-modal learning approaches.

        ## 2.2. Supervised Multi-Modal Learning Approaches
        There have also been many research efforts focused on developing supervised multi-modal learning techniques. Some of these methods include stacked convolutional neural networks, deep neural factorization machines, multimodal deep belief networks and video frame prediction with motion-based attention modules. While all of these methods offer improvements over traditional single-modality methods, they do require large amounts of annotated data. Also, few of these methods address the issue of sharing experts learned from single-modality training in multi-task settings.

        ### 2.2.1. Stacked Convolutional Neural Networks
        The first step towards creating a unified architecture for visual reasoning was introducing a new layer type called residual connections into CNNs. These allow the model to directly connect output feature maps from earlier layers to subsequent ones without any skip connection. By doing so, stacked CNNs were able to capture rich contextual information across multiple input streams simultaneously. Similarly, the same principle was used to create hierarchies of deeper, wider sub-networks inside the trunk of stacked ResNet architectures. This eventually led to powerful models like DenseNet and ResNeXt that performed well on various computer vision tasks like ImageNet classification, object detection and segmentation.

        ### 2.2.2. Deep Neural Factorization Machines
        To incorporate multiple sources of information, Chang et al. proposed a novel deep neural factorization machine (DNFM) that learns low-rank joint representation vectors that combine both explicit and implicit feedback from heterogeneous data sources. This allowed DNFMs to outperform conventional matrix factorization methods by capturing non-linear relationships between different data types within the same space. Their models achieved state-of-the-art results on several recommendation systems benchmarks.

        ### 2.2.3. Video Frame Prediction with Motion-Based Attention Modules
        Lu et al. developed a new architecture for predicting future video frames based on past inputs, known as Dynamic Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). DCNNs exploit spatio-temporal correlations between consecutive frames and introduce temporal attention mechanisms to focus on relevant regions in previous frames. They were further extended by adding motion information via Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs), allowing the model to adaptively adjust to changes in camera motion. Despite their successes on video frame prediction tasks, these models did not consider multi-modal information integration, making it challenging to capture global dependencies among different types of information.

        # 3.Methodology 
        We propose a self-supervised visual and text pre-training method that combines the strengths of multi-modal pre-training methods along with additional self-supervision techniques to achieve high quality feature representations. Specifically, our proposed method explores the possibility of using conditional transformers (CTran) to incorporate text information into the images during pre-training. CTran consists of three main components: (a) sentence encoding, (b) instance mask generation, and (c) transformer block. Sentence encoding converts a sentence into a fixed length vector representation that captures important semantic features and enables multi-modal fusion. Instance masks provide local context information about objects or scenes present in the image and enable CTran to focus on relevant parts of the image. Finally, transformer blocks enable us to process sequences of tokens generated by the encoder to extract higher level semantics.

        During pre-training, we will start by leveraging CTran to encode text sentences into latent spaces conditioned on image pixels. Then, we will fine-tune the CTran model using standard cross-entropy loss functions on available supervised datasets for specific visual tasks such as image classification, object detection etc. After fine-tuning, we can apply the learned representations for inference purposes on new samples and evaluate the accuracy of the model's predictions.

        Our contribution lies in combining the advantages of multi-modal pre-training with the benefits of self-supervised learning to obtain accurate and robust feature representations for downstream visual analysis tasks. Additionally, we aim to explore the possibility of applying CTran as a standalone pre-training model for vision-and-text tasks, since it has proven successful in natural language processing tasks. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed method against existing pre-trained models and baselines for several widely adopted vision-and-text tasks.
        # 4.Experiments
        In order to test the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct several empirical evaluations. First, we compare our proposed method with four baseline methods including VAE, MEAD, MoCo and Reptile. Second, we assess the impact of different choices of hyperparameters on our method's ability to learn diverse and discriminative feature representations. Third, we analyze the importance of text embeddings for different vision tasks and measure their impact on final performance metrics. Fourth, we study the impact of using image annotations together with text annotations for visual sentiment analysis. Finally, we compare our proposed method with strong baselines that use pre-trained language models for downstream tasks.
