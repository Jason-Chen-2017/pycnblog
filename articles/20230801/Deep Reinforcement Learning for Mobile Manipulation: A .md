Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to mobile manipulation tasks in recent years due to its ability to learn complex control policies from experience with minimal intervention. However, the development of effective RL algorithms for manipulating real-world objects remains a challenging problem because of the high dimensionality and complexity of robotic systems. In this article, we review recent advances on deep reinforcement learning methods for manipulating robotic objects such as bin picking, place recognition, and collision avoidance. We also discuss common challenges in applying these techniques, including modeling uncertain dynamics, dealing with occlusions, handling noisy inputs, and generalization to new environments. Finally, we provide applications of RL for mobile manipulation such as humanoid robots and self-driving vehicles, which demonstrate how these techniques can be effectively used for complex and realistic tasks. 

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) refers to using deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent the environment and agent policies. It combines the benefits of both model-based and model-free approaches and has led to breakthroughs in several domains, including robotics, game playing, and natural language processing. DRL is becoming increasingly popular in the field of mobile manipulation due to its flexibility, robustness, and effectiveness. This paper provides an overview of the research on deep reinforcement learning for mobile manipulation and presents some key challenges, techniques, and applications related to different aspects of mobile manipulation tasks. The aim of our work is to inspire researchers and practitioners to explore more advanced ideas and methods for developing effective models and controllers for mobile manipulation tasks by leveraging the power of deep reinforcement learning technology.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Agent
An agent refers to any entity that interacts with the environment through actions and perceives the world state via sensors. The agent’s goal is to maximize its accumulated reward while ensuring safety and optimal performance. The agent could be a person, animal, or machine. For example, a typical agent in mobile manipulation is a mobile robot or a humanoid robot.

## Environment
The environment refers to everything outside the agent, including other agents and obstacles, the surrounding physical space, and external factors that affect the agent’s behavior. An agent may need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously or under various constraints, so it interacts with the environment sequentially over time. The environment includes the following components:

1. Observation: the agent receives information about the current state of the environment through sensors, such as camera images, force/torque readings, range finder measurements, etc.
2. Action: the agent takes actions in response to observations, which typically include one or more commands sent to actuators like motors or grippers. Actions are influenced by the agent's internal states and preferences, but may be affected by unpredictable forces or disturbances in the environment. 
3. Reward signal: the agent receives numerical rewards based on its actions and affects of its decisions on the environment. Different types of rewards may vary depending on the task at hand, such as completion of a task or detection of an object.
4. Dynamics: the environment itself changes over time, with agent actions leading to changes in its properties, e.g., position, velocity, orientation, or temperature. Uncertainty in the system makes learning difficult, especially when transitioning between different states or actions.

## Policy
A policy specifies what action should be taken given the current observation and internal state of the agent. A policy is often a function that maps the observed state and internal state to an action vector or matrix. Policies are designed to optimize the agent's objective, usually either maximizing cumulative rewards or satisfying certain conditions, such as completing a task within a limited number of steps or staying close to a target region. Policies could be stochastic or deterministic, depending on whether they use random sampling or deterministic decision making. Depending on the complexity and scale of the environment, policies can have different forms, such as fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.

## Value Function
Value functions specify the expected return (cumulative reward) starting from a particular state and action. They are used to determine how good a state-action pair is compared to all others. Value functions can be estimated offline or online using temporal difference (TD) methods, which update the value function after each step of interaction with the environment. Online updates can help reduce sample bias and improve the speed and efficiency of learning. Some value function approximation methods, such as neural networks, are particularly suitable for large-scale and continuous state spaces.

## Model
A model represents the true underlying structure of the environment and the relationships among different elements, variables, and parameters. Models capture the dependencies and interactions between the dynamic factors that influence the agent's behavior, such as physics laws, geometries, and physical properties of objects. There are two main categories of models for mobile manipulation tasks:

1. Dynamic models: describe the relationship between the agent's actions and the resulting effects on the environment. These models include kinematic and dynamic models, where the former assumes constant velocities and accelerations, whereas the latter allows for the presence of friction, gravity, joint limits, and other non-linearities.
2. Neural network models: represent the learned representation of the environment by mapping low-dimensional observations into higher-dimensional features, similar to the way humans understand the world. Neural network models are commonly trained using supervised learning techniques, which require labeled data to train the models to recognize specific classes of objects, scenes, or actions. 

## Exploration vs Exploitation Tradeoff
In reinforcement learning, exploration refers to taking actions that lead to new experiences and trying out novel strategies, while exploitation involves acting based on existing knowledge and experience to exploit opportunities efficiently. The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation determines the agent's willingness to accept risk versus focusing solely on exploiting known options. Intelligent agents use a combination of exploration and exploitation techniques to balance their search for better solutions against the potential downside of exploring uncharted territory.

## Long-Term Horizon vs Short-Term Horizon
The long-term horizon refers to the duration during which the agent considers future rewards regardless of present consequences. On the contrary, the short-term horizon considers only immediate rewards and penalties, making the agent focus on achieving a shorter-term gain. Intermediate rewards and penalties can then slowly decay over longer periods until the end of the episode. Long-term planning helps to anticipate unexpected events that might occur later, making the agent capable of adapting and adjusting to changing conditions before they become actual problems. Short-term control helps to achieve quick and efficient responses, while long-term planning enables the agent to plan ahead to handle unexpected situations and make appropriate adjustments.
