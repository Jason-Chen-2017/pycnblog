# 1.简介
         
2020年是互联网时代。因为新型冠状病毒疫情爆发，很多公司和机构急需应对IT变革带来的业务需求转移、人员流动、信息化渗透等挑战，而科技公司也因此成为了新一轮的数字经济的领头羊。在这个过程中，大量优质MOOC平台如Coursera、Udacity、Edx等开始涌现，这些平台上有众多高质量的课程资源，适合学生进行自我学习和提升自己的能力。然而，如何从中获得有效的信息并进行准确预测学生的学习情况呢？这就需要基于行为数据的多模态分析（Multimodal Behavioral Analysis,MBA）技术了。
         
         ## 一、背景介绍
         在日益扩张的MOOC市场里，许多提供给学生进行自学或考试的平台都提供了数据收集系统，包括用户画像、用户行为日志、课堂互动记录、提交作业结果和评分等。但这些数据既没有统一的数据格式，也没有统一的特征来描述学生的学习效果。在实际应用场景中，通常只考虑到单个维度的数据如积极反馈、完成情况、错误次数等；而缺少一种多模态融合的方式来有效地捕获学生不同方面的行为特征，导致了人们的进一步探索。
        
         以Coursera作为典型的MOOC平台，其提供的各种题目类型可以分为文字试卷、编程练习、开放式问答、小测试等。虽然每种题目类型都有对应的提交结果数据，但是由于存在着不同的答案表达方式及标准，使得从各类数据源提取出丰富的多模态行为特征成为一个重要的挑战。除此之外，还有一些参加考试的学生还会共享自己的作业/项目，这时候还需要额外的注意力放在这一类数据集的构建上。
         
         ## 二、基本概念和术语介绍
         ### 1.Behavioral Analysis（行为分析）
         Behavioural analysis is a set of techniques and methods used to understand human behavior through observation and data collection, with the aim of identifying patterns that can help organizations make better decisions or adapt their operations to meet changing needs. It includes observational studies, survey research, focus groups, experiments, case studies, ethnography, and computer modeling. Commonly used terms in behavioral analysis include motivation, attitudes, behaviors, perceptions, emotions, cognition, skills, attention, working memory, decision making, problem-solving, learning styles, teamwork, and social influence.
         
         ### 2.MultiModality（多模态）
         MultiModality refers to a combination of modalities – such as text, images, videos, audio signals, etc., – which are often combined together during an event or process to give rise to collective phenomena such as complex interactions among multiple sources. In other words, multimodality involves more than one type of information being combined to form a cohesive whole. The key feature here is interconnectedness: when we see something new, we may be able to relate it back to what we have already experienced before. Multimodal systems work best when they use various input modes to capture different aspects of the same underlying event or situation. For example, a system for analyzing customer service experiences might combine speech, video, and text inputs.
         
         ### 3.Attention (注意力)
         Attention refers to the ability of individuals to pay close attention to specific parts of a stimulus and turn off unimportant distractions. This requires efficient processing of incoming information by selectingively activating relevant regions within the brain. In recent years, artificial intelligence models have made great strides in capturing this important signal through sophisticated neural networks. However, humans still exhibit deviations from optimal attention allocation, leading to biases in the output generated by AI systems. To address these challenges, we need to develop algorithms that can accurately predict student’s attention level based on his/her behavior in real-time.
         
         ### 4.Feature Engineering（特征工程）
         Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract meaningful features from raw data to improve the accuracy of machine learning algorithms. Features can come in many forms including numeric values, categorical variables, temporal sequences, spatial contexts, and combinations thereof. Some popular feature extraction techniques include PCA, LDA, word embeddings, bag-of-words representation, image recognition, and deep learning.
         
         ### 5.Artificial Intelligence (人工智能)
         Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, software, or hardware, essentially the capability of learning and making predictions on its own, without being explicitly programmed. AI is a subset of Machine Learning, which involves creating statistical models that mimic the way that the human mind works and then applying those models to new problems to solve them. There are several types of AI including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and hybrid learning.
