The future of NLP in e-commerce may lie in making it part of everyday processes and interactions between customers and products to deliver seamless customer experiences while maximizing profit margins.


# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before delving into the specifics of leveraging NLP for e-commerce, here are some essential concepts and terminologies you need to know: 


## Corpus
A corpus refers to a collection of documents or text data. It is usually composed of various types of texts, including social media posts, emails, news articles, FAQs, and customer feedback forms. In our case, the corpus consists of customer review data provided by different vendors across several categories. Each vendor provides their own set of reviews which helps us build a holistic picture of customer preferences and needs.


## Vocabulary Size
Vocabulary size refers to the number of unique words used in a given corpus. For example, if we take a corpus consisting of customer reviews related to apparel, then the vocabulary size could be considerably large due to variations in brand names, product descriptions, and descriptive phrases like 'great' or 'amazing'. On the other hand, if we take a corpus of financial reports, the vocabulary size might be relatively small since each document contains only a fixed range of meaningful words.


## N-grams
An n-gram is a sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. In our context, n-grams refer to contiguous sequences of words within each review. As a result, an n-gram can capture short-term semantic relationships or patterns that emerge frequently throughout a review. The larger the value of n, the richer and more detailed the representation becomes. Common values of n are 1 (unigrams), 2 (bigrams), and 3 (trigrams). Since our corpus is made up of multiple categories, we should consider taking bigrams and trigrams as well, so as to capture common themes across different categories.


## Stop Words
Stop words are words that occur very commonly and do not carry any discriminatory information, such as 'the', 'and', 'of', etc. Oftentimes, stop words can cause ambiguity or distort the meaning of a sentence. Hence, it is crucial to remove them during pre-processing stage, especially when working with natural language processing tasks. In addition to removing stop words, another approach is to use stemming or lemmatization, where words are reduced to their root form.


## Bag of Words
Bag of words represents text as the frequency distribution of words. It ignores the order of occurrence of words in the document. To create a bag of words representation, we count the frequency of each distinct word in a document and represent them as vectors containing the relative frequencies of each word. For instance, a sample bag of words vector for a given document would look something like {'shirt': 2, 'blue': 1, 'large': 1}.


## Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Weighting Scheme
Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a corpus. The weight assigned to a word in a document is inversely proportional to its frequency in that particular document. Higher frequency of the word indicates importance whereas low frequency indicates irrelevance. Moreover, TF-IDF assigns weights to uncommon words based on their frequency among the entire corpus to ensure accuracy and reduce noise. The formula for calculating TF-IDF weight is as follows: 

$$tfidf(t, d, D) = tf(t,d)    imes idf(t,D) $$

where t is the term being evaluated, d is the current document, $D$ is the corpus, tf(t,d) is the frequency of term t in document d, and idf(t,$D$) is the inverse document frequency of term t in the corpus.


## Word Embeddings
Word embedding is a way to represent words as dense numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning. These vectors are learned from a large corpora of text, typically using neural networks. They allow us to perform machine learning tasks such as clustering, classification, and dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional textual data. Popular word embedding techniques include GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText. Unlike traditional counting-based approaches, word embeddings directly encode semantics in the vector space.


## Cosine Similarity Calculation
Cosine similarity measures the angle between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It ranges between -1 and 1, indicating the extent to which the two vectors point in similar directions. In our case, the input vectors would consist of n-gram vectors representing individual reviews. We calculate the cosine similarity score between each pair of reviews and recommend those whose scores exceed a certain threshold.


## K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions the data points into k clusters. Here, k refers to the desired number of clusters and must be specified prior to training. The main idea behind K-means is to find centroids that minimize the total sum of distances between the data points and their respective cluster centers. We can visualize the output clusters as convex shapes that contain similar features. In our case, we can use K-means clustering to group reviews into subsets based on their characteristics, such as topics discussed in the review.


## Topic Modeling
Topic modeling is a type of statistical machine learning technique used to discover underlying structures in unstructured text data. It involves automatically identifying recurring patterns of co-occurring words and determining the probability distributions of these patterns across the corpus. Keywords and phrases identified by topic modeling can serve as search queries for users looking for relevant information. In our case, we can apply topic modeling to the combined dataset of reviews from different categories and generate a list of representative topics that are trending nowadays.


## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis involves classifying opinions expressed in text into positive, negative, or neutral categories. Some popular methods for performing sentiment analysis include rule-based systems, lexicon-based techniques, and deep learning models. In our case, we can use sentiment analysis to classify customer ratings as either positive, negative, or neutral, enabling businesses to gain insight into how customers feel about their products and services. 


## Spam Filtering
Spam filtering is the process of detecting and rejecting incoming email messages that are likely to be unsolicited or fraudulent. Traditional spam filtering mechanisms rely on keyword matching or signature detection, which often leads to false positives and negatives. Leveraging powerful NLP techniques such as bag of words and word embeddings can help address this problem by employing advanced pattern recognition techniques to filter out malicious messages. In our case, we can utilize techniques such as topic modeling to automatically tag spammy reviews as such and eliminate them from further analysis. 


## Content Moderation
Content moderation is the act of categorizing and screening web content according to predefined criteria such as offensive, defamatory, violent, or obscene material. Traditionally, this task was performed manually by human moderators, but with the advent of AI tools like facial recognition and image recognition, automated moderation strategies have become feasible. Given the vast quantity of digital content generated each day, accurate and efficient content moderation is critical to protect against threats and keep the platform safe. In our case, we can automate the process of flagging harmful content through NLP-powered algorithms, which can save time and effort for moderators and improve overall performance.


## User Behavior Prediction Models
User behavior prediction models can help predict user engagement, purchase intentions, and retention rates. These models learn from historical customer behavior data to make predictions about the likelihood of engagement, purchase intention, and retention, respectively. In our case, these models can assist e-commerce businesses in personalizing offers, targetting marketing campaigns, optimizing inventory management, and generating insights into consumer behavior. Specifically, behavioral models can leverage user reviews, shopping history, and demographics to predict whether a customer will return again, make a purchase, or abandon a product. Using predicted outcomes, we can adapt offerings, pricing, and promotions to meet customer demands, resulting in increased engagement and loyalty.
