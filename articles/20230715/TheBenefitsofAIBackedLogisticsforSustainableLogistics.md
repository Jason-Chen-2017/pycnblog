Sustainable logistics (SL) refers to a set of practices that aim at managing and reducing the environmental impacts of goods and services transportation processes. These include optimizing energy efficiency, reusing materials, minimizing packaging waste, and conserving natural resources. To achieve SL, organizations need to address complex challenges such as high costs, uncertain demand, low productivity, limited staff skills, and inefficiency within current operations. However, increasingly, businesses are using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to automate some aspects of their SL processes. Specifically, AI-powered logistics platforms can optimize routing, scheduling, inventory management, customer relationship management, fleet optimization, and supply chain visibility. However, there is little research on the benefits of these new technologies when applied to sustainable logistics. 

This article will review recent advances in AI-backed logistics and examine how they can be used for improving overall SL outcomes by improving efficiencies, reducing costs, and promoting ecological footprints. The article will also discuss potential limitations of AI-based solutions and identify future research opportunities. In summary, this article aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of AI-backed logistics in terms of applications and benefits, and highlight areas for further exploration. 

 # 2.基本概念术语说明
Artificial Intelligence (AI): A field that involves developing machines that perform tasks that are similar or even identical to those performed by human brains. It includes both machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. Artificial intelligence has made significant progress over the last decade with advancements in hardware, algorithms, and data collection techniques. The term AI now encompasses various subfields such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and decision making. One example of AI is Google's Tensorflow, which was released in 2015. This technology allows developers to train models on large datasets and deploy them into production systems quickly.

Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning algorithm where the model learns from labeled training data to predict outputs based on inputs. The goal of supervised learning is to learn the underlying patterns and correlations between input features and output labels. Supervised learning works best when there is a clear mapping between input and output values, i.e., when the problem under consideration can be solved through labeling examples. Examples of supervised learning problems include image classification, speech recognition, and text analysis.

Unsupervised Learning: An extension of machine learning where the model does not have any pre-existing labels associated with the input data. Instead, it tries to find its own structure and relationships amongst the unlabeled data points. Unsupervised learning finds clusters, outliers, and interesting patterns among the data without any prior knowledge about what each cluster or pattern represents. Examples of unsupervised learning problems include clustering, anomaly detection, and recommendation engines.

Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning enables agents to learn by trial and error by taking actions in response to the feedback received from the environment. The agent learns to balance the tradeoff between maximizing expected rewards and ensuring safety constraints. Reinforcement learning models work well when the agent interacts with the environment repeatedly and needs to make decisions in real time. Examples of reinforcement learning problems include robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving. 

Data Science: Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses statistical methods, mathematical models, and computational tools to extract insights from structured and unstructured data sources. Data science combines multiple disciplines including mathematics, programming languages, statistics, domain expertise, and software engineering. One specific area of data science is machine learning, which focuses on developing algorithms to analyze and understand data sets.

Logistics: Logistics refers to the process of moving goods across borders, handling shipment volumes, and storing/processing raw material, intermediate products, and finished goods. It involves several interrelated activities like planning, designing, operation, monitoring, control, and reporting. Logistics plays a crucial role in achieving efficient business operations and effectively manage the flow of goods across different locations. Logistics has traditionally been considered one of the most difficult industries to scale due to its complexity and non-linear nature compared to other industries. 

Supply Chain Management (SCM): Supply chain management (SCM) is a vital component of modern economies and relies heavily on advanced technologies to optimize efficiency, reduce costs, enhance profitability, and create competitive advantage. SCM covers all stages of the value chain, starting from strategic planning to inventory management, order management, shipping, and customer service. Its primary objective is to ensure that the right items get to the right places at the right time to meet specified delivery objectives.

Supply Chain Optimization (SCO): SCO is the study of how to improve the performance, quality, cost effectiveness, and scalability of a supply chain. SCO includes key elements such as inventory management, procurement, sales, marketing, finance, risk management, and human resource management. Improvements to SCO result in reduced costs, improved efficiency, better product quality, and increased profitability. Sustainable COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) strategies leverage established market trends and long-term thinking to deliver compelling offers to consumers while mitigating risks. As demand for sustainable products grows, so do the required investments and operational expenditures. Traditional approaches may become outdated and fall short if we seek to stay ahead of the curve.

 # 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
In order to apply AI techniques to improve sustainable logistics, three main steps are involved: modeling, optimization, and deployment.

Modeling: Modeling is essential because it helps to simulate the behavior of entities and environments, allowing us to explore scenarios beforehand. AI models can take many forms, ranging from simple linear regression models to complex neural network architectures. Some popular AI models for logistics include deep learning models, support vector machines (SVM), and rule-based systems. While traditional optimization techniques can help identify optimal routes, identifying the best way to allocate resources is much more challenging than simply relying on manual adjustments. Therefore, AI-powered logistics platforms should rely on optimized heuristics, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning techniques.

Optimization: Optimization involves finding the best way to minimize individual costs, maximize individual benefits, and achieve balanced results throughout the entire supply chain. There are two main categories of optimization methods - constrained optimization and robust optimization. Constrained optimization methods solve problems subject to certain constraints, whereas robust optimization methods can handle noise and uncertainty in the system. Popular optimization methods include genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution, and quasi-newton methods.

Deployment: Deployment involves integrating optimized logistics models into existing systems and workflows. Integration requires careful coordination between departments and stakeholders, as well as integration testing to ensure compatibility with existing infrastructure. New systems should incorporate automated decision-making mechanisms that integrate forecasts, predictions, and analytics generated from the AI model. AI-powered logistics platforms should enable transparency in tracking movements, inventory levels, and forecasts, providing detailed reports for management teams. Moreover, platform operators should be empowered with access to real-time metrics that provide actionable insights into bottlenecks and issues, thus enabling prompt adjustments.


Mathematical Formulas:
To calculate the number of stops required for optimal route, we use the formula:
No_stops = sqrt(dist / stop_distance)^2
Where dist is the distance covered and stop_distance is the desired distance between consecutive stops. For example, if we want to cover a distance of 2 km with a stop distance of 1 km, then the no. of stops would be approximately equal to √2=1.41. If the distance is too small or stop distance too large, then the calculated value might not be accurate enough.

Another important factor that affects the number of stops needed is the speed of the vehicle being used. A faster vehicle may require fewer stops, whereas slower vehicles may require more stops to complete the same distance. Hence, additional factors such as idle times, loading times, and acceleration coefficients should be taken into account while calculating the number of stops.



 # 4.具体代码实例和解释说明
As mentioned earlier, logistics companies are leveraging AI technologies to automate some aspects of their SL processes. The below code snippet shows an example implementation of Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) architecture for predicting trip duration using historical travel time and weather data:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class GCN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_features, hidden_units, dropout_rate):
        super().__init__()

        self.gcn1 = GraphConvLayer(num_features, hidden_units[0])
        self.bn1 = BatchNormalization()
        self.relu1 = Activation('relu')
        self.dropout1 = Dropout(dropout_rate)
        
        self.gcn2 = GraphConvLayer(hidden_units[0], hidden_units[1])
        self.bn2 = BatchNormalization()
        self.relu2 = Activation('relu')
        self.dropout2 = Dropout(dropout_rate)
        
        self.dense1 = Dense(hidden_units[-1], activation='relu')
        self.dropout3 = Dropout(dropout_rate)
        self.output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')

    def call(self, x, edge_index, edge_weight=None):
        h = self.gcn1([x, edge_index, edge_weight])
        h = self.bn1(h)
        h = self.relu1(h)
        h = self.dropout1(h)
        
        h = self.gcn2([h, edge_index, edge_weight])
        h = self.bn2(h)
        h = self.relu2(h)
        h = self.dropout2(h)
        
        h = global_mean_pool(h, batch)
        h = self.dense1(h)
        h = self.dropout3(h)
        y_pred = self.output(h)
        return y_pred
    
def preprocess_data():
    # Prepare data here
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    X_train, y_train, edge_index, edge_weight, _, _ = load_dataset()
    
    num_features = X_train.shape[2]
    hidden_units = [32, 64]
    dropout_rate = 0.5
    
    optimizer = Adam(lr=0.01)
    loss_fn = BinaryCrossentropy()
    metric_list = [BinaryAccuracy(), MeanAbsoluteError()]
    callbacks_list = [EarlyStopping(patience=10)]
    
    model = GCN(num_features, hidden_units, dropout_rate)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=metric_list)

    history = model.fit([X_train, edge_index, edge_weight],
                        y_train,
                        epochs=100,
                        verbose=1,
                        validation_split=0.2,
                        callbacks=callbacks_list)
```

Here, we define a custom GCN layer using TensorFlow's Keras API, followed by preprocessing the data and defining the model architecture. We compile the model with binary cross-entropy loss function, binary accuracy metric, mean absolute error metric, and early stopping callback. Finally, we fit the model on the training data, with 20% of the data used for validation during training.
