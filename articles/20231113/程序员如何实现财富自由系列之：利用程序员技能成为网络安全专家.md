“程序员”这个职业已经成为创造财富的大宗且极具吸引力的行业，而网络安全也成为了行业中的热门话题。如今网络空间已成为黑客攻击的主要目标，社会也越来越重视网络安全。如何成为一名优秀的网络安全专家，让自己享受到财富自由的快感？本文将通过分享自己的实践经验，从程序员的角度，分享一下成为一名网络安全专家的心路历程和方法论。
在我们这个时代，成为一名网络安全专家，是一个艰巨的任务。首先要有足够的知识积累，才能对复杂的网络安全漏洞进行准确分析、编写检测脚本并实现自动化、有效地应对攻击。此外，还需要具有较高的执行能力，能够承受日益增长的网络安全事件，并坚持不懈地进步提升自我。
因此，我们需要更多地学习和沉淀网络安全相关的知识和技能，用编程语言或工具来提升自己的专业能力，并且建立起全面的网络安全知识体系。下图展示了作为一名网络安全专家的基本要求和职责。

2.核心概念与联系
首先，我们需要了解一些网络安全相关的基础知识。例如，什么是网络攻击类型、协议、漏洞、攻击方法、威胁模型等，它们的关系是怎样的。另外，我们需要熟悉网络安全的一些术语和定义，例如：身份认证、加密、VPN、中间人攻击（Man-in-the-Middle Attack）、DDOS攻击、SSL证书、TLS协议、HSTS、HIPPA、GDPR、SOC、PCI DSS等。这些术语和定义都有助于我们更好地理解网络安全的各个方面。
随着网络安全领域的快速发展，越来越多的技术人员、研究者加入到这一领域中来。他们有的善于发现新型漏洞，有的擅长编写代码，有的专门从事安全建模，有的专门研究渗透测试，但大多数人的知识面仍然相对有限，缺乏一个综合性的、全局性的、系统性的网络安全思维。为了做好网络安全相关的工作，就需要将自己的知识、经验和技能融汇贯通，形成系统性的学习体系。所以，下面我们以云安全为例，分享一下如何构建一个系统性的、全局性的、可落地的网络安全学习体系。
Cloud Security是一个由多个子领域组成的平台。其中包括云计算安全、容器安全、边缘计算安全、IaaS安全、PaaS安全、服务器安全、网络安全、应用安全、数据库安全、运维安全、渗透测试等。如果按照发展规划的优先级，我们应该优先关注云计算安全和容器安全。如下图所示。

但是，不同角色的人可能对这些子领域并不是很熟悉，因此我们可以围绕它们制定一套相应的学习路径。以下是以云计算安全和容器安全为例，分享一下构建学习路径的方法。
# 2.1 Cloud Computing Security Learning Path
1. Introduction to Cloud Computing and its Security Threats
2. An Overview of Cloud Services and Infrastructure Security
Introduction to Cloud Computing: This is a high level overview that introduces the basics of cloud computing including why it was introduced, what makes up the cloud, how does it work etc.

3. Types of Attacks on Cloud Infrastructure

This section will focus on understanding different types of attacks against the infrastructure used by clouds. These attacks can be categorized as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which involves flooding an internet service with a large number of requests in order to overload resources or services, Volumetric attack, which involves sending a large amount of data without authorization from multiple sources, SQL injections, which involve injecting malicious code into database queries, Cross site scripting (XSS), which involves inserting malicious scripts into web pages, Insecure deserialization, which involves exploiting vulnerabilities in application frameworks to execute unauthorized code, Authentication bypass, which involves gaining access to authorized users without providing proper authentication credentials, and many more.

4. Key Principles for Secure Deployment of Applications on Cloud

In this section we will discuss various principles for securely deploying applications on cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure etc. We will cover topics like Separation of duties, Use of secure communication protocols, Isolation of environments, Central monitoring and logging capabilities, Least privilege model and use of encryption. 

5. Containerization and Docker Security

Containerization has become one of the hottest technologies nowadays and offers several benefits compared to virtual machines. Containers allow developers to package their applications along with all dependencies into a container image that can then be run on any platform that supports containers. However, there are security challenges associated with running containers due to the fact that they share the kernel with the host system. In this section, we will learn about Docker security best practices and features including use of Dockerfile templates, Content trust, Running containers in secure contexts and Restricting container privileges. 

6. Edge Computing Security

Edge computing is the concept of computing devices being placed near end points, where they interact directly with end users. The aim of edge computing is to provide low latency and bandwidth processing power while ensuring privacy, security, and compliance. In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts behind edge computing architecture, networking requirements, threats involved in edge computing systems, and mitigation techniques. 

7. Beyond Identity Management – Governance, Risk Management and Compliance

Identity management plays a crucial role in achieving true customer experience across digital channels and creates a strong foundation for business operations. While identity management covers broad range of areas such as user authentication, session management, provisioning, access control policies, etc., these areas alone cannot ensure overall governance, risk management and compliance needs. Therefore, in this section, we will look at various approaches to address governance, risk management and compliance for organizations using identity management solutions in their cloud environment. 

Conclusion

By completing the above learning path, you should have a better understanding of the core components and principles underlying cloud computing and containerization security. Additionally, you will also gain insights into effective ways to deploy secure applications on cloud platforms and create safe ecosystems around them.
