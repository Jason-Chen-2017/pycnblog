### 1. 背景介绍

#### 1.1. 自然语言处理

自然语言处理（Natural Language Processing, NLP）是计算机科学中的一个重要 research area, which focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. It is a multidisciplinary field, involving computer science, artificial intelligence, statistics, machine learning, linguistics, and more.

#### 1.2. 词嵌入

Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. They are a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging NLP problems. Word embeddings are learned from data, rather than being hand-engineered features.

#### 2.1. 词汇表示

In traditional NLP, words are often represented as one-hot vectors. However, this kind of representation has some drawbacks. For example, it treats all words as independent and ignores their semantic relationships. In contrast, word embeddings represent words in a dense, low-dimensional space, where the distance between words reflects their semantic relationships.

#### 2.2. 训练word embeddings

Word embeddings can be trained using various algorithms, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText. These algorithms use large corpora of text to learn the relationships between words, by analyzing the context in which they appear. The resulting word embeddings capture important linguistic regularities and patterns, such as synonymy, antonymy, and analogy.

### 3. 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

#### 3.1. Word2Vec

Word2Vec is a popular algorithm for training word embeddings. It uses a neural network architecture to predict the context words given a target word, or vice versa. There are two main variants of Word2Vec: Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram.

##### 3.1.1. Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)

The CBOW model tries to predict the target word based on the context words. Given a sequence of words $w\_1, w\_2, \dots, w\_T$, the objective function of CBOW is to maximize the log probability:

$$
\frac{1}{T} \sum\_{t=1}^T \log p(w\_t | w\_{t-c}, \dots, w\_{t-1}, w\_{t+1}, \dots, w\_{t+c})
$$

where $c$ is the size of the context window.

##### 3.1.2. Skip-Gram

The Skip-Gram model tries to predict the context words given a target word. Given a sequence of words $w\_1, w\_2, \dots, w\_T$, the objective function of Skip-Gram is to maximize the log probability:

$$
\frac{1}{T} \sum\_{t=1}^T \sum\_{-c \le j \le c, j \neq 0} \log p(w\_{t+j} | w\_t)
$$

where $c$ is the size of the context window.

#### 3.2. GloVe

GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is another popular algorithm for training word embeddings. Unlike Word2Vec, which learns word embeddings from local context windows, GloVe learns word embeddings from global co-occurrence statistics. Specifically, it defines a co-occurrence matrix $X$, where $X\_{ij}$ is the number of times word $i$ appears in the context of word $j$. The objective function of GloVe is to learn word embeddings that minimize the following cost function:

$$
J = \sum\_{i,j=1}^V f(X\_{ij}) (w\_i^T \tilde{w}\_j + b\_i + \tilde{b}\_j - \log X\_{ij})^2
$$

where $V$ is the vocabulary size, $f$ is a weighting function that downweights frequent co-occurrences, and $w\_i$, $\tilde{w}\_j$, $b\_i$, and $\tilde{b}\_j$ are the word embeddings and bias terms for words $i$ and $j$.

#### 3.3. FastText

FastText is an extension of Word2Vec that represents each word as a bag of character n-grams, instead
