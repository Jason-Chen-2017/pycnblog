*by Ernest Davis, Turing Award Laureate and Master of Computer Science*

## 1. Introduction

Computation is the process of converting input to output based on a set of rules. In this chapter, we will explore the art of computation and machine-oriented computational thinking. We will discuss the core concepts, algorithms, and mathematical models that underlie computation, as well as best practices, practical applications, tools, and resources. This knowledge will enable you to develop more efficient and effective algorithms, make informed decisions about which tools to use for specific tasks, and better understand the capabilities and limitations of computational systems.

### 1.1 Background

Computation has been an essential part of human civilization for thousands of years. Early examples include counting sheeps with pebbles, calculating taxes with abacuses, and performing astronomical calculations with astrolabes. However, it was not until the development of electronic computers in the mid-20th century that computation became automated and capable of handling complex and large-scale problems. Today, computation is ubiquitous and plays a critical role in many areas of science, engineering, business, and entertainment.

### 1.2 Scope

This chapter focuses on the art of computation and machine-oriented computational thinking. It covers the fundamental principles and techniques of computation, including data representation, algorithms, and mathematical models, as well as their application to real-world problems. It also provides an overview of the history and evolution of computation, from ancient calculation devices to modern supercomputers and cloud computing platforms.

### 1.3 Audience

This chapter is intended for anyone who wants to learn about the art of computation and machine-oriented computational thinking, regardless of their background or experience. It assumes some familiarity with basic mathematical concepts, such as sets, functions, and graphs, but does not require any advanced knowledge or skills. The chapter is written in a clear and concise style, with plenty of examples and illustrations to help readers understand the material.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

In this section, we will introduce the core concepts and connections of computation, including data representation, algorithms, and mathematical models. We will explain how these concepts are related and how they form the foundation of computation.

### 2.1 Data Representation

Data is the raw material of computation, and data representation is the way of encoding data so that it can be processed by a computational system. There are many ways of representing data, depending on the type and purpose of the data. Some common types of data include numbers, strings, booleans, lists, tables, and graphs. Some common ways of representing data include binary code, ASCII, Unicode, and JSON.

### 2.2 Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of steps that describes how to solve a problem or perform a task. Algorithms are the heart of computation, and designing efficient and effective algorithms is a key challenge in many fields. An algorithm typically consists of three parts: input, processing, and output. The input is the data that the algorithm operates on, the processing is the sequence of operations that transform the input into the output, and the output is the result of the algorithm.

### 2.3 Mathematical Models

A mathematical model is a simplified representation of a real-world phenomenon or system. Mathematical models are used to analyze, predict, and optimize the behavior of complex systems, such as physical, biological, social, and economic systems. Mathematical models are often based on mathematical equations, such as differential equations, linear equations, or graph theory, that describe the relationships between the variables of the system.

### 2.4 Connections

Data representation, algorithms, and mathematical models are closely connected and interdependent. Data representation determines the format and structure of the data that an algorithm can process, while algorithms determine how the data is transformed and manipulated. Mathematical models provide a theoretical framework for understanding and analyzing the behavior of algorithms and data. Together, these concepts form the foundation of computation and enable the development of powerful and versatile computational systems.

## 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Operations

In this section, we will discuss the core algorithm principles and operations, including search, sorting, optimization, and learning. We will explain the mathematical models and techniques that underlie these algorithms, as well as their advantages and limitations.

### 3.1 Search

Search is the process of finding a particular item or value in a collection of items or values. Search algorithms are used to locate data in databases, files, networks, and other structured or unstructured data sources. Some common search algorithms include linear search, binary search, hash table lookup, and tree search.

#### 3.1.1 Linear Search

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks each element of a list or array in sequential order until the desired value is found or the end of the list is reached. The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

#### 3.1.2 Binary Search

Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm that divides the search space in half at each step, based on the middle element of the list or array. Binary search requires that the list or array be sorted in ascending or descending order. The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

#### 3.1.3 Hash Table Lookup

Hash table lookup is a fast search algorithm that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array or table. Hash table lookup requires that the keys be unique and that the hash function distribute the keys evenly across the indices. The time complexity of hash table lookup is O(1), assuming that the hash function and the table size are well chosen.

#### 3.1.4 Tree Search

Tree search is a general search algorithm that explores the nodes of a tree or graph in a systematic manner, based on a search strategy, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, or best-first search. Tree search is useful for searching large and complex data structures, such as hierarchical or networked data. The time complexity of tree search depends on the size and shape of the tree or graph, as well as the search strategy and heuristics used.

### 3.2 Sorting

Sorting is the process of arranging a collection of items or values in a specific order, such as ascending or descending order. Sorting algorithms are used to organize, filter, and compare data in databases, files, networks, and other data sources. Some common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.

#### 3.2.1 Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements of a list or array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Bubble sort repeats this process until the list or array is sorted. The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list.

#### 3.2.2 Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a more efficient sorting algorithm that builds a sorted list or array by repeatedly inserting the next element in the correct position, based on its value and the values of the previous elements. Insertion sort has a better average-case time complexity than bubble sort, but still has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).

#### 3.2.3 Selection Sort

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that finds the minimum or maximum element of a list or array and puts it in the first or last position, respectively. Selection sort then repeats this process for the remaining elements, until the list or array is sorted. The time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list.

#### 3.2.4 Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively splits a list or array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them back together. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average and worst cases, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.

#### 3.2.5 Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions a list or array around a pivot element, recursively sorts the smaller and larger sublists, and then combines them. Quick sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case and O(n^2) in the worst case, depending on the choice of the pivot element and the distribution of the data.

#### 3.2.6 Heap Sort

Heap sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to maintain a partially ordered list or array. Heap sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case, making it a relatively efficient sorting algorithm.

### 3.3 Optimization

Optimization is the process of finding the best solution or configuration for a problem or system, based on a set of constraints and objectives. Optimization algorithms are used to solve a wide range of problems, such as resource allocation, scheduling, routing, design, and control. Some common optimization algorithms include linear programming, integer programming, nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, and evolutionary algorithms.

#### 3.3.1 Linear Programming

Linear programming is an optimization technique that deals with linear objective functions and linear constraints. Linear programming can be solved using the simplex method, which is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds the optimal solution by iteratively improving a feasible solution.

#### 3.3.2 Integer Programming

Integer programming is an extension of linear programming that allows some or all of the variables to take integer values. Integer programming can be solved using branch-and-bound methods, which are exponential-time algorithms that explore the search space by branching on the integer variables and pruning the branches that do not contain the optimal solution.

#### 3.3.3 Nonlinear Programming

Nonlinear programming is an optimization technique that deals with nonlinear objective functions and nonlinear constraints. Nonlinear programming can be solved using gradient-based methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method, or gradient-free methods, such as the Nelder-Mead method.

#### 3.3.4 Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is an optimization technique that breaks down a complex problem into simpler subproblems, solves each subproblem only once, and stores the solutions in a table or memory. Dynamic programming can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as knapsack problems, shortest path problems, and sequence alignment problems.

#### 3.3.5 Evolutionary Algorithms

Evolutionary algorithms are a class of optimization techniques that use population-based search and genetic operators, such as mutation, crossover, and selection, to evolve a population of candidate solutions towards the optimal solution. Evolutionary algorithms can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and control systems.

### 3.4 Learning

Learning is the process of acquiring knowledge or skills from experience, data, or instruction. Learning algorithms are used to model and predict the behavior of complex systems, such as natural language, images, sounds, and actions. Some common learning algorithms include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning.

#### 3.4.1 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of learning that involves training a model on labeled data, where each input-output pair is associated with a label or category. Supervised learning can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as classification, regression, and prediction.

#### 3.4.2 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of learning that involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the input data is not associated with any labels or categories. Unsupervised learning can be used to discover patterns, structures, or clusters in the data, as well as to reduce dimensionality or noise.

#### 3.4.3 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of learning that involves training a model to make decisions or take actions in an environment, based on rewards or penalties. Reinforcement learning can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as game playing, robotics, and control systems.

#### 3.4.4 Deep Learning

Deep learning is a type of learning that involves training a model on large datasets, using multiple layers of neural networks. Deep learning can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

## 4. Best Practices: Coding Examples and Explanations

In this section, we will provide some coding examples and explanations for the core concepts and algorithms discussed in previous sections. These examples are intended to illustrate the principles and operations of computation, as well as to provide practical guidance for implementing and applying these concepts and algorithms in real-world scenarios.

### 4.1 Search: Binary Search Example

Here is an example of binary search in Python:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
   low = 0
   high = len(arr) - 1
   while low <= high:
       mid = (low + high) // 2
       if arr[mid] == target:
           return mid
       elif arr[mid] < target:
           low = mid + 1
       else:
           high = mid - 1
   return -1
```
The `binary_search` function takes two arguments: `arr`, which is a sorted list or array of integers, and `target`, which is the value to be searched. The function initializes three variables: `low`, which is the lower bound of the search space; `high`, which is the upper bound of the search space; and `mid`, which is the middle index of the search space. The function then enters a while loop, which continues until the search space is empty or the target is found. In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the middle index, compares the middle element with the target, and updates the bounds of the search space accordingly. If the target is found, the function returns the index of the target. Otherwise, the function returns -1, indicating that the target is not in the array.

### 4.2 Sorting: Merge Sort Example

Here is an example of merge sort in Python:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
   if len(arr) <= 1:
       return arr
   mid = len(arr) // 2
   left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
   right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
   return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
   result = []
   i = j = 0
   while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
       if left[i] < right[j]:
           result.append(left[i])
           i += 1
       else:
           result.append(right[j])
           j += 1
   result.extend(left[i:])
   result.extend(right[j:])
   return result
```
The `merge_sort` function takes one argument: `arr`, which is a list or array of integers. The function first checks whether the length of the array is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns the array itself. Otherwise, the function splits the array into two halves, sorts them recursively using the `merge_sort` function, and merges them back together using the `merge` function. The `merge` function takes two arguments: `left`, which is the sorted left half of the array, and `right`, which is the sorted right half of the array. The function initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, which point to the first elements of `left` and `right`, respectively. The function then enters a while loop, which continues until both `left` and `right` are exhausted. In each iteration of the loop, the function compares the first elements of `left` and `right`, appends the smaller element to the `result` array, and increments the corresponding pointer. After the while loop, the function appends the remaining elements of `left` and `right` to the `result` array, and returns the merged and sorted array.

### 4.3 Optimization: Linear Programming Example

Here is an example of linear programming in Python, using the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog

# define the objective function
c = np.array([1, 1])

# define the constraints
A_ub = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 0]])
b_ub = np.array([5, 3])

# define the bounds
bounds = [(None, None), (None, None)]

# solve the linear program
res = linprog(c=c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, bounds=bounds)

# print the solution
print(res.x)
```
The `linprog` function takes five arguments: `c`, which is the coefficient vector of the objective function; `A_ub`, which is the matrix of the upper bounds constraints; `b_ub`, which is the vector of the upper bounds values; `bounds`, which is the dictionary of the variable bounds; and `options`, which is the dictionary of the solver options. The `linprog` function returns a namedtuple object, which contains the solution, the status, the message, and the time. The `x` attribute of the namedtuple object contains the optimal values of the decision variables.

In this example, the objective function is to maximize the sum of two variables, `x1` and `x2`. The constraints are that `x1 + x2 <= 5` and `x1 <= 3`. The bounds are that both `x1` and `x2` can take any non-negative value. The optimal solution is `x1 = 3` and `x2 = 2`, with a total value of 5.

### 4.4 Learning: Supervised Learning Example

Here is an example of supervised learning in Python, using the `scikit-learn` library:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# generate some random data
X = np.random.randn(100, 2)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)

# split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# create a logistic regression model
clf = LogisticRegression()

# fit the model on the training set
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# predict the labels of the testing set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# evaluate the performance of the model
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", acc)
```
The `LogisticRegression` class is a simple and efficient algorithm for binary classification problems. The `fit` method trains the model on the training set, and the `predict` method predicts the labels of the testing set. The `accuracy_score` function measures the percentage of correct predictions.

In this example, the data consists of 100 samples, each with two features, represented by the `X` array. The labels consist of 100 integers, either 0 or 1, represented by the `y` array. The data is split into 80% training set and 20% testing set. The model is trained on the training set, and the predicted labels of the testing set are compared with the true labels to calculate the accuracy.

## 8. Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between computation and algorithms?**

A: Computation refers to the process of converting input to output based on a set of rules, while algorithms refer to a finite sequence of steps that describes how to solve a problem or perform a task. Algorithms are a specific type of computation, but not all computations are algorithms. For example, a random number generator is a computation, but not an algorithm.

**Q: What is the difference between algorithms and heuristics?**

A: Algorithms are a formal and rigorous way of solving problems, based on mathematical models and logical reasoning. Heuristics are a practical and intuitive way of solving problems, based on experience, common sense, and guesswork. Heuristics are often faster and simpler than algorithms, but may not always produce correct or optimal solutions.

**Q: What is the difference between exact algorithms and approximation algorithms?**

A: Exact algorithms are algorithms that always produce correct and optimal solutions, within a given time or space bound. Approximation algorithms are algorithms that sometimes produce incorrect or suboptimal solutions, but within a guaranteed factor or margin of error. Approximation algorithms are useful when the exact algorithms are too slow or too complex, or when the problem itself is inherently uncertain or fuzzy.

**Q: What is the difference between deterministic algorithms and probabilistic algorithms?**

A: Deterministic algorithms are algorithms that always produce the same output for the same input, without any randomness or uncertainty. Probabilistic algorithms are algorithms that sometimes produce different outputs for the same input, due to randomness or uncertainty. Probabilistic algorithms are useful when the problem itself involves randomness or uncertainty, or when the solution space is too large or complex to explore exhaustively.

**Q: What is the difference between online algorithms and offline algorithms?**

A: Online algorithms are algorithms that process the input data sequentially and adaptively, without knowing the entire input in advance. Offline algorithms are algorithms that process the input data globally and statically, with full knowledge of the entire input. Online algorithms are useful when the input data is dynamic or streaming, or when the response time or throughput is critical. Offline algorithms are useful when the input data is static or batch, or when the accuracy or completeness is important.
