Data is power in today’s world and we are using it to solve real-world problems. With the advent of Big Data technologies, data has become increasingly valuable for organizations across industries. It is crucial that this valuable information can be understood by humans, machines or systems, which requires semantic understanding of the data. However, most current solutions rely on handcrafted features or rules that cannot capture the complex relationships between different attributes in the dataset. In this article, I will discuss how machine learning techniques such as deep learning can help improve the accuracy of existing approaches and provide a new way forward towards building intelligent systems with high precision and explainable capabilities. 

In brief, my approach combines insights from computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to extract relevant knowledge from large datasets and convert them into interpretable models. The extracted knowledge serves two important functions: 

1. As input to downstream decision making processes - enabling human experts to identify patterns and trends in the data through intuitive visualizations.

2. To enable automated decision-making process - improving performance of predictive models by leveraging their ability to automatically recognize and interpret intent behind unstructured textual inputs.  

The resulting models can then be used to build more accurate and reliable decision-making systems, providing higher accuracy and lower error rates than traditional methods. Moreover, these models can also serve as a basis for generating rich visual analytics tools for domain experts who want to gain deeper insights into the underlying patterns and correlations within the data.

I will now proceed to introduce each concept and technique in detail.

## 2.1 Dataset Semantics
Dataset semantics refers to the meaning of individual records or instances present in a dataset. Semantic meaning is an essential aspect of any database system that stores, organizes and manages structured or semi-structured data. Without proper semantic annotations, it becomes difficult to query, analyze and reason over the data effectively. For example, consider a simple table containing employee information like name, age, salary etc. The columns may contain numeric values but without any context or associated metadata, it would be impossible to understand what those numbers represent or infer anything from them. This information should have been annotated with appropriate labels or tags that describe its significance and make it easier to retrieve, filter, group and aggregate data based on specific criteria. Similarly, images captured by a camera or videos uploaded to online platforms typically do not come with clear descriptions or captions. These images could be labeled with descriptive keywords to make them easily searchable and identifiable. 

## 2.2 Knowledge Graphs
A knowledge graph represents a set of entities and their relationships amongst themselves. The main objective of creating a knowledge graph is to capture both explicit and implicit knowledge about a particular subject. A common use case of a knowledge graph is to recommend products to users based on their past purchases, preferences, social interactions, browsing history etc. Knowledge graphs can be used to store, manage, and process vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. They provide a unified view of various sources of data by combining multiple data sets into one coherent model, thereby reducing redundancy and errors during analysis. 

Semantic Web, also known as Linked Data, consists of several specifications related to RDF and OWL, which allows developers to publish data in a machine-readable format and associate additional metadata with it. Linked Open Data consortium, established in 2012, aims at promoting interoperability between datasets published under different licenses and vocabularies. 

Knowledge graphs can be represented in different ways depending on the needs and requirements of different applications. On the one hand, they offer flexible querying options to retrieve data based on user's interests, topics of interest, contexts and other factors. On the other hand, they can be useful for knowledge discovery tasks where facts need to be combined, aggregated and analyzed to derive new insights. There exist several open-source libraries and frameworks available for building knowledge graphs, including Apache Jena, Apache TinkerPop, Stardog and RDFLib. 

## 2.3 Word Embeddings
Word embeddings are representations of words in vector space, where similar words are closer together and dissimilar words farther apart. One application of word embeddings is sentiment analysis, where a sentence is mapped to a numerical value representing its overall positive or negative tone. Another popular use case involves named entity recognition, where words in a sentence are assigned their corresponding named entities such as persons, locations, organizations, dates, etc. Word embeddings can be learned using neural networks or other unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as PCA. Popular pre-trained word embedding vectors include GloVe, FastText and Word2Vec.

## 2.4 Sequence Models
Sequence modeling is the task of determining the likelihood of observed sequences given some hidden state. Traditional sequence models assume that future events depend only on the present event and the previous ones, and hence they are insufficient for capturing dependencies spanning multiple time steps. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Units (LSTMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are three types of sequence models that handle sequential data better. RNNs learn long-term dependencies by maintaining a memory of previously seen elements, while LSTMs maintain short-term memory to capture temporal dependencies better. CNNs apply filters to the image to extract local features and capture spatial dependencies efficiently.

For instance, when reading an email message, the content itself depends on the context provided before it, such as the date, sender, recipient, attachements, links etc. Sequences of letters read consecutively form sentences, paragraphs, chapters, articles, books and so on. Understanding the relationships between such sequences is critical for automatic text summarization and chatbot development.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
There are many popular machine learning algorithms that work well for supervised learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, recommendation systems and anomaly detection. However, few of these algorithms take advantage of the fact that data contains rich structural and semantical information. Some examples of these algorithms are:

* Naïve Bayes Classifier
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Random Forest Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Deep Learning Algorithms (e.g., LSTM, GRU)

Each algorithm uses statistical methods to compute weights or coefficients that define the relationship between input variables and output variables. These weights determine the importance of each feature in terms of prediction accuracy. However, the key challenge in applying these algorithms to data with semantic structure is that they often fail due to the noise introduced by irrelevant or redundant features. In order to address this issue, I propose a novel approach called Wikification, which first extracts relevant entities and properties from the raw text data and then maps them to their corresponding concepts in a predefined ontology using linkers and taggers. We can think of Wikification as a combination of Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-speech tagging (POS) and Dependency Parsing (DP). Here are the basic steps involved in Wikification:

1. NER identifies all occurrences of entities and populates a list of recognized entities along with their spans in the text. Entities might belong to different classes such as person names, organization names, product names, countries, cities, etc. Depending on the use case, we can choose to focus on certain classes of entities or include all possible entity types.

2. POS assigns parts-of-speech to the tokens in the recognized entities, indicating whether they function as nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs. Part-of-speech information helps identify the role of an entity in the sentence. For example, if an entity appears as a direct object in a sentence, it is likely referring to a physical thing. If an entity appears as a subject, it is likely describing something abstract or intangible.

3. DP performs dependency parsing on the recognized entities to extract their syntactic relationships with other entities. Syntactic relationships capture the hierarchical nature of the entities and reveal their relationships with other entities in the same sentence. For example, an entity appearing before another entity in a sentence indicates a sequence or order of events.

4. Linkers map the detected entities to the corresponding concepts in a predefined ontology. The mapping relies on rules and heuristics developed by domain experts to ensure correctness and completeness of the mapping. For example, if the linker encounters the string "apple" in the text and finds that it belongs to the fruit class, it assumes that it corresponds to the apple concept in the ontology.

Once the entities and their corresponding concepts are identified, we can feed them into machine learning algorithms to train them to perform meaningful predictions. We can use different algorithms for different problem domains, such as text classification, question answering, sentiment analysis, topic identification, recommendation systems, and so on. Once trained, these models can be deployed to make predictions on new data and monitor their performance over time to detect changes in behavior and adapt accordingly.

Wikification provides a powerful tool for converting unstructured text data into a structured representation suitable for machine learning models. By analyzing the entities and relationships in the data, we obtain a concise yet informative description of the underlying semantics. Furthermore, it enables us to leverage the latest advancements in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to develop sophisticated models capable of handling complex data with high accuracy and precision. Lastly, it ensures that our models remain explainable and trustworthy because they are based on sound principles and assumptions.
