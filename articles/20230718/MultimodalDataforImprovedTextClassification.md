## Multimodal data
Multimodal data is a type of structured or unstructured textual information that combines various media such as audio, video and text into one single entity. The combination of multiple modalities can offer more context and meaning to the text by enhancing its semantics and understanding. Examples of multimodal data include speech-to-text translation and conversational chatbots with voice and text input. However, it requires different processing techniques compared to monomodal (single modality) text classification tasks due to additional context and content from the other media sources. Therefore, there has been an increase in research on incorporating multimodal data for text classification. This article discusses several ways to incorporate multimodal data into text classification using deep learning models.


## Types of Multimodal Data
### Acoustic features
Acoustic features are extracted from recorded speech signals using signal processing techniques like filtering, feature extraction, and normalization. These features can be used as inputs to neural networks for improved text classification. Examples of acoustic features include Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). 

### Video frames
Video frames can also be used as inputs to neural networks for text classification. Several methods have been proposed for extracting visual features from videos, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). In general, these approaches use convolution layers to extract spatial features, recurrent layers to capture temporal dependencies between consecutive frames, and pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the output vectors.

### Text embeddings
Text embeddings are vector representations of words obtained through natural language processing techniques such as word embedding, Bag of Words model, or Doc2Vec. These embeddings provide contextual information about the words present in the text and help improve text classification accuracy. There are two types of text embeddings: pre-trained and fine-tuned. Pre-trained embeddings are trained on large datasets like Wikipedia or Google News and can be used directly without any further training. Fine-tuned embeddings are trained on a specific task, domain, or dataset and are usually initialized with pre-trained weights. For example, a sentiment analysis model can be fine-tuned on movie reviews to obtain high quality sentiment scores. Similarly, for medical diagnoses, we can use clinical notes and linguistic knowledge to train a disease detection model using pre-trained text embeddings.

In summary, multimodal data includes acoustic features, video frames, and text embeddings. Different algorithms can be applied to each type of data to generate better results for text classification. We will discuss some methods for incorporating multimodal data into text classification below. 


## Methodology Overview
Text classification involves converting raw text into categorical labels based on certain criteria, which can involve analyzing the syntax, semantics, and discourse of the text. Within this framework, multimodal data can be considered alongside traditional text data in order to enhance text classification performance. Three main steps can be taken to incorporate multimodal data into text classification:

1. Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from the multimodal data to feed them into machine learning models. Common methods for feature extraction include combining visual features with text features, integrating acoustic and semantic features, or generating joint embeddings using pre-trained word embeddings and fine-tuned contextualized embeddings.

2. Model Training: Using the extracted features to train separate models for each mode of the multimodal data. Since different modalities may require different models, they should be combined together in some way to achieve best performance. Some common methods for combining models include concatenating their outputs, applying attention mechanisms, or combining their predictions using weighted averages.

3. Ensemble Learning: Combining the individual predictions of the models for each mode to produce final classifications. Depending on the number of modes involved, ensemble techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, or hybridization can be employed to combine the predictions. Together, these three steps form the overall methodology for incorporating multimodal data into text classification.


## Deep Learning Models for Multimodal Text Classification
There are many popular deep learning architectures designed specifically for multimodal text classification problems. Some commonly used ones include Multi-modal LSTM (M-LSTM), TALNet, MBERT, MuTART, CATS, and CLIP4Clip. Each architecture works differently and yields varying levels of accuracy depending on the complexity of the multimodal data and available resources. Here are brief descriptions of each model for those who are not familiar with them already.

### M-LSTM
M-LSTM is a multi-modal long short-term memory network consisting of an LSTMs that processes text, image, and audio at the same time. It uses shared weights across all modalities except for the last layer of the LSTMs where each modality gets its own bias term. Additionally, the model applies attention mechanism over the concatenation of hidden states of the LSTMs to focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequences. Overall, this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various multimodal text classification benchmarks.

### TALNet
TALNet stands for Triple Attention Layer Network. It is a transformer-based model that learns textual and visually-semantic relationships among texts and images simultaneously. It consists of a triple attention module that considers interactions between textual and visual features, a cross-modal encoder that transforms both modalities into a common space, and a decoder that generates categorical labels. TALNet outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy while being less computationally expensive than CNNs or RNNs.

### MBERT
MBERT is a multi-modal BERT model that combines contextualized word embeddings with visual and acoustic features to classify texts effectively. Instead of independently encoding text and visual features separately, MBERT pools their representations together using self-attention mechanisms. Visual and acoustic features are encoded using pre-trained transformers and fed into the pooler layer of the MBERT architecture to obtain the pooled representation. Finally, the pooled representation is passed through a classifier head to predict the label of the text. MBERT yields comparable performance to standard BERT but offers advantages when working with complex multimodal data.

### MuTART
MuTART stands for Multimodal Transformer for Acoustic Representation. It uses transformer architecture to encode the multimodal acoustic features and process them sequentially according to their temporal relationships. Then, a linear projection layer projects the resulting sequence of features into a fixed-length vector representing the whole utterance. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on logmel spectrograms, MuTART captures much richer acoustic information that reflects the underlying phonetic, prosody, and timbre variations of speech.

### CATS
CATS stands for Cross-Attentional Training Strategies for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis. It uses multiple sets of attention modules to process the text, image, and audio features simultaneously, with each set focusing on different aspects of the text. The models apply attention over the pooled representation of each modality before passing them through another dense layer to make predictions. CATS achieved significant improvements over previous approaches on various sentiment analysis tasks.

### CLIP4Clip
CLIP4Clip is a new end-to-end model that combines clip embeddings with bert embeddings for multimodal sentiment analysis. It first extracts clip embeddings using the open-source CLIP model, and then passes them through a BERT model for sentence level classification. Compared to previous approaches, CLIP4Clip reduces the computational cost and improves the sentiment prediction accuracy.
