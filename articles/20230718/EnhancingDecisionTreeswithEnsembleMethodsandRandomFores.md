## Overview of the Problem Statement
In recent years, many decision tree-based algorithms have been proposed for classification or regression problems in both supervised and unsupervised settings. These algorithms work well on a wide range of datasets but can be highly overfitted to specific data instances, making them less generalizable to new ones. In this paper, we will explore ensemble methods that leverage multiple models trained on different subsets of training data to improve accuracy and reduce variance. We will focus on random forests as they are known to achieve good performance even when using only one decision tree model. Our goal is to provide an understanding of how these techniques can be used to address the shortcomings of decision trees by combining multiple weak learners into stronger predictors. Moreover, we will discuss some practical aspects such as feature importance estimation and hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we will evaluate our results on several real-world datasets and compare against other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches like neural networks and boosting methods. 

The problem statement aims at building a more accurate and reliable predictor than traditional decision trees by utilizing ensemble methods that combine multiple weak learners together. The aim is not just achieving better accuracy but also reducing overfitting which happens when a single decision tree model fits all the training samples perfectly without any room for error. This makes it difficult to generalize the model to new, similar datasets due to high variance introduced by the model itself. By incorporating ensemble methods, we can train several weak learners on different subsets of the dataset, each responsible for producing a slightly improved prediction, leading to a much more robust and accurate classifier. Furthermore, we can estimate the importance of features through analyzing their contribution to individual predictions made by each weak learner and use this information to select relevant features from the dataset while discarding irrelevant ones. Hyperparameters like the number of trees in the forest, minimum split size, maximum depth etc., can further be optimized during cross validation to obtain optimal performance. Additionally, we can employ parallel processing to speed up computation time on large datasets. Overall, our objective is to build a system that combines the strengths of decision trees with those of ensemble methods and provides improvements in terms of accuracy and robustness. 

We believe that by providing detailed explanations along with clear illustrative examples, our article will serve as valuable reference material for researchers, practitioners, students and industry professionals interested in applying ensemble methods to enhance the predictive power of decision trees. 

## Dataset Introduction
For the purpose of demonstration, let us consider a binary classification task where the target variable Y takes two values: “Yes” or "No". We will use the Pima Indians diabetes dataset available on Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database]. It contains details about eight attributes including the patient’s age, sex, body mass index (BMI), average blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, admission type, diagnoses and medications taken prior to entry and six personal measurement variables such as glucose concentration, BMI, diastolic blood pressure and skin fold thickness. We will treat the outcome variable Y as a binary label, indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not based on its various measurements obtained during medical examination.
