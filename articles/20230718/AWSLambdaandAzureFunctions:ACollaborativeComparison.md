In recent years, serverless computing has emerged as a new way to run applications without managing or provisioning servers on-premises. The two leading cloud platforms for running serverless functions are AWS Lambda and Microsoft Azure Functions (also known as Azure Functions). Both of these platforms offer a wide range of features such as auto scaling, high availability, built-in data integration, low cost, and support for multiple programming languages. This article aims at comparing the similarities and differences between AWS Lambda and Azure Functions in order to help readers understand their pros and cons better.

Before we start discussing the differences, let's quickly go through some key concepts associated with each platform. 

## Key Concepts
### AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a service that allows you to execute code without having to manage servers yourself. It provides a runtime environment where you can write your code and deploy it as a function. AWS takes care of all the underlying infrastructure including servers, networking, load balancing, and automatic scaling. You simply upload your function code and specify the trigger event - either an HTTP request, message from SQS queue, or another AWS service like DynamoDB. When the specified trigger event occurs, the function gets executed automatically by AWS Lambda. The response returned by the function will be sent back to the caller.

The main advantage of using AWS Lambda is its simplicity of use. Once you have uploaded your code and set up the trigger event, you don't need to worry about the underlying infrastructure. All you need to do is focus on writing the business logic of your application. Additionally, you get a lot of built-in services such as API Gateway, CloudWatch Logs, and IAM roles out-of-the-box which makes it easier to integrate other AWS services.

However, there are several drawbacks as well when compared to other serverless platforms like Google Cloud Functions or Azure Functions. For example, performance issues may arise due to cold starts and long execution times if your code is not pre-warmed. Additionally, debugging and error handling can be challenging since AWS doesn't provide any tools for live monitoring and troubleshooting. Lastly, while both platforms support different programming languages like Node.js, Python, Java, Go,.NET Core, etc., they also have their own specific syntax and libraries.

### Azure Functions

Microsoft Azure Functions is also a serverless compute platform that allows you to execute code without managing servers. In this case, instead of uploading code directly to a managed container, you create a function app in Azure, which acts as a container for your functions. Your function code is written in C#, F#, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python, depending upon the type of function you want to create. Then, you define the trigger events for your function like an HTTP endpoint, blob storage, or Event Hub. Whenever one of those events occur, your function gets executed automatically and its output gets stored somewhere else in Azure.

Overall, Azure Functions offers more flexibility than AWS Lambda in terms of choosing the language, integrating with other Azure services, and providing better tooling for monitoring and debugging. However, unlike AWS Lambda, it does come with a slightly higher price tag due to its usage of virtual machines. Overall, Azure Functions is becoming increasingly popular among developers who prefer a pay-per-use model over a billed monthly fee.

Now that we have discussed the key concepts of both AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, let's move onto the core algorithmic differences between them. We'll first discuss the basic architecture of both platforms before going into detail on how they compare. 

# 2. Basic Architecture of Serverless Computing Platforms

To understand the basics behind both AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, let’s first look at what exactlyserverless computing is. According to the Wikipedia definition of serverless computing: “Serverless computing refers to the ability of cloud providers to abstract away the complexity of infrastructure management so developers can focus on developing code without needing to worry about scalability, availability, security, or maintenance.” Essentially, serverless computing is a concept of allowing software development teams to build and run applications without being responsible for managing servers or other resources. Instead, cloud providers handle all of the infrastructure operations necessary to run the application, making it more efficient and cost effective for developers.

Let us now take a deeper dive into the inner workings of each serverless computing platform.
