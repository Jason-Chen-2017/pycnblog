# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Blockchain
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables efficient, transparent, and trustworthy transactions between multiple parties without intermediaries. Consensus mechanisms ensure that blocks added to the chain cannot be tampered with or modified without consensus being reached among participants. Cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology have emerged as digital currency alternatives to fiat currencies like dollars and euros, enabling peer-to-peer payments, decentralized finance, and other financial services. 

In smart manufacturing, blockchain technology is increasingly adopted for managing global supply chains, tracking inventory levels, auditing supply chains, and securing supply chain collaboration and coordination. For example, Supply Chain Integrity Protocol (SCIP), developed by DXC Technology Group, uses a public permissionless blockchain network to record transactions within a factory and verify them before they take place. Each transaction is stored digitally and linked back to its source documents, providing accountability and traceability. SCIMS, another blockchain-based project, uses smart contracts to automate processes and reduce errors in logistics management. As partners in the supply chain, members of different organizations access SCIP’s records via a web interface, which creates a shared view of each supply chain activity.


## Cryptography
Cryptography refers to a systematic way of breaking down complex messages into smaller pieces so that only authorized persons can read them. Encryption is one type of cryptographic technique where plaintext is converted into ciphertext in such a way that only those who possess the appropriate secret key can reverse engineer the message and understand its contents. Decryption involves reversing the process and converting the encrypted text back into plain text readable by humans.

To provide security in smart manufacturing, organizations often rely on encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman). These algorithms generate keys for encrypting and decrypting data. While AES ensures high data confidentiality, RSA offers strong authentication and non-repudiation capabilities. Differential privacy adds random noise to the dataset, making it difficult to identify specific data points, even if the entire dataset is known. Zero knowledge proofs involve showing that one party knows something without revealing any additional information beyond what could be inferred from that statement. Homomorphic encryption allows calculations to be performed on encrypted data, thus achieving higher performance than traditional encryption methods.

Smart manufacturing organizations also need to be aware of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, including hacking attacks, malware intrusions, malicious insider threats, and denial-of-service attacks. To prevent these threats, organizations should implement effective controls such as antivirus protection, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and user training. Additionally, organizations should prioritize strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, and regularly update security patches and software updates to stay ahead of cybersecurity risks. Finally, organizations must communicate security policies and procedures to employees and contractors, maintain records of breach notifications, and conduct penetration tests when required. 

## Edge Computing
Edge computing refers to computation done at the periphery of the network rather than centralized servers. By offloading compute tasks closer to the source of data, edge computing reduces the load on local servers and increases overall system throughput. Many smart manufacturing applications require fast response times and low latency, which demand the ability to handle large volumes of data quickly and efficiently. Edge computing provides a scalable approach to handling large amounts of data in real-time by leveraging cloud computing resources closer to the data sources.

For instance, many IoT devices collect and transmit data over wireless networks. With edge computing, the processing of incoming data can occur close to the device itself, reducing the amount of traffic passing through the cloud. Edge clusters enable workload balancing and dynamic scaling, allowing more powerful machines to be deployed as needed. Big data analysis and storage frameworks like Hadoop and Apache Spark provide widespread support for working with large datasets and heterogeneous data formats.

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers of connected nodes to learn patterns in large datasets. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are the foundation of deep learning and form the basis for most modern computer vision and natural language processing systems. In the context of smart manufacturing, deep learning algorithms can be trained on large sets of historical data to recognize patterns and make predictions that improve performance and efficiency.

For example, robotic arms can be programmed with deep learning algorithms to perform image classification, object recognition, and motion planning, leading to increased accuracy and precision. Similarly, speech recognition systems and chatbots can be trained to interact with customers and deliver helpful customer service. Moreover, advanced imaging techniques such as CT scanning and MRI are becoming feasible thanks to the advent of deep learning algorithms.

## Internet of Things (IoT) Devices
The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a massive expansion of the internet connectivity. IoT devices cover a variety of application domains, ranging from smart home appliances to medical devices. While some IoT devices may not directly affect manufacturing operations, they still represent significant benefits for the organization seeking to leverage the power of the physical world to enhance business operations. 

As IoT devices become ubiquitous and pervasive, they pose new challenges for organizations to monitor and manage their assets effectively. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data collected from IoT devices to detect anomalies and trigger alerts. Moreover, advanced analytics and visualization tools allow users to gain situational awareness and trends that can inform decision-making processes. Furthermore, the adoption of smart metering technologies coupled with IoT devices offer new opportunities for monitoring and controlling energy consumption. 

In conclusion, smart manufacturing brings together many diverse technologies, disciplines, and business models. When building enterprise-class smart manufacturing platforms, organizations should carefully weigh the benefits and risks associated with integrating these technologies. By closely considering security, privacy, reliability, and scalability factors, organizations can build secure and privacy-preserving smart manufacturing systems that meet the needs of their businesses.
