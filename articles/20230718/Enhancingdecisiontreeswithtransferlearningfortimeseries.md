Deep learning techniques have achieved impressive success in many areas of computer science and engineering. However, they cannot be directly applied to problems related to real-world data streams or longitudinal datasets such as sensor data from mobile devices. In this paper, we present a methodology to enhance the performance of decision tree algorithms using transfer learning on time series data. Specifically, we propose a new approach that combines an ensemble model consisting of multiple individual decision tree classifiers trained using historical training data and recently acquired streaming data, along with the use of transfer learning techniques to fine tune each classifier's parameters based on the available historical data samples. The resulting ensemble is able to improve both accuracy and robustness against adverse environmental conditions caused by extreme events or other irregularities in the input signal. We demonstrate our technique through experiments on two real-world applications: traffic forecasting and seismic anomaly detection in continuous wavelet transform (CWT) representation of seismic signals. Our results show that the proposed ensemble can achieve significant improvements over standard decision tree models when trained and tested on real-time CWT representations of seismic signals. Moreover, it outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning methods, particularly deep neural networks, despite its simple architecture.

The following are some basic concepts and terminologies used in this paper:

1. Time series data: A sequence of measurements taken at regular intervals. They can either be univariate or multivariate, depending upon the number of features measured in each sample. 

2. Decision tree: A type of supervised machine learning algorithm that uses a tree structure to make predictions about the outcome of a classification task. It works by recursively partitioning the feature space into regions based on the values of the predictor variables, leading eventually to one prediction per leaf node.

3. Ensemble models: An ensemble model is a collection of individual learners where each learner makes a guess or prediction independently and then combined together to produce a final answer. There are various types of ensemble models including bagging, boosting, stacking etc., which can be used to combine the outputs of different learners. In this work, we focus on bagging-based ensemble models.

4. Transfer Learning: Transfer learning refers to the process of transferring knowledge learned from one problem or domain to another similar but distinct problem or domain. In this work, we use transfer learning to apply pre-trained decision tree models on newly collected streaming data while still retaining their ability to classify patterns in the historical dataset. This helps to reduce the amount of labeled training data required to train the model further.

5. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT): CWT is a widely used non-parametric transformation technique to analyze time series data. Essentially, it decomposes the signal into a set of sinusoidal functions that represent the original signal at different scales.

In general, decision trees require careful parameter tuning to avoid overfitting. Transfer learning enables us to reuse the weights learned from a well-performing base model without retraining them. Additionally, using CWT representation allows us to capture temporal dynamics in the input data more effectively than conventional scalar features. Finally, combining these techniques forms an effective way of enhancing the performance of decision tree models on time series data.

## Introduction

Time series data plays an important role in modern applications, ranging from stock prices to economic indicators. Despite their importance, there has been relatively little research on applying traditional machine learning algorithms to handle time series data due to their complexity and high dimensionality. 

Recently, deep learning techniques have gained prominence in solving challenging tasks involving time series data. Deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) etc. have shown great promise in addressing complex time-dependent problems. However, they cannot be easily applied to solve problems related to real-world data streams or longitudinal datasets such as sensor data from mobile devices.

To address this challenge, in this paper we present a methodology to enhance the performance of decision tree algorithms using transfer learning on time series data. Specifically, we propose a new approach that combines an ensemble model consisting of multiple individual decision tree classifiers trained using historical training data and recently acquired streaming data, along with the use of transfer learning techniques to fine tune each classifier's parameters based on the available historical data samples. The resulting ensemble is able to improve both accuracy and robustness against adverse environmental conditions caused by extreme events or other irregularities in the input signal. 

Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed ensemble can achieve significant improvements over standard decision tree models when trained and tested on real-time CWT representations of seismic signals. Furthermore, it shows competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, particularly CNNs, RNNs, LSTM networks and random forest algorithms.  

We begin with brief introduction of decision tree algorithms followed by detailed explanation of the transfer learning methodology used to enhance the performance of decision tree algorithms. Next, we explain the mathematical formulas involved in implementing the proposed approach. Then, we discuss the experiments conducted using synthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, we summarize the main findings of the experimentations and provide guidelines for future research directions. 


## Decision Tree Algorithms

Decision trees are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that use a tree structure to predict outcomes. In contrast to most supervised learning algorithms, decision trees do not assume any functional form for the relationship between the response variable(s) and independent variables. Instead, they use a binary split strategy to create nodes in the tree and fit the best split point for each predictor variable until all leaves belong to the same class label or minimum node size limit is reached. 

A common assumption made by decision trees is that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables can be approximated using a linear combination of input features. Decision trees typically yield better predictive power compared to other algorithms because they only consider a subset of the total number of possible splits, making them less prone to overfitting. However, decision trees may also suffer from high variance and low bias. To reduce the risk of overfitting, decision tree algorithms usually employ various strategies, such as limiting the maximum depth of the tree, pruning small branches of the tree or setting a minimum number of samples required at each node during training. 

Once the decision tree model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new inputs. As a result, decision tree algorithms are suitable for handling both categorical and numerical data and are popular choices for analyzing large and complex datasets. 


## Transfer Learning Methodology

Transfer learning is a powerful technique for leveraging knowledge learned from a source task and applying it to a target task. In practice, transfer learning involves taking a previously trained model and repurposing it for a new task. One popular application of transfer learning in natural language processing is word embeddings. Word embeddings encode semantic meaning of words as dense vectors of floating point numbers. These vectors can be trained on large corpora of text data and reused across various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, question answering etc. Similarly, in this work, we leverage the decision tree models' ability to recognize patterns in sequential data to transfer their knowledge to classify recent streaming data samples efficiently. 

Specifically, instead of training separate decision tree models on every incoming stream of data, we exploit the ability of existing models to detect patterns in past data and transfer them to the current stream of data. First, we collect a set of historical data samples containing labels indicating whether the corresponding samples were positive or negative examples. Second, we acquire a new stream of data samples that need to be classified. Third, we preprocess the input data to extract relevant features using techniques such as CWT transform, PCA, scaler etc. Fourth, we train multiple individual decision tree models on the historical data samples using cross-validation and save the trained models for later use. 

After training the models on historical data, we now need to adapt them to the specific characteristics of the new data stream being analyzed. For example, if we are working on detecting seismic anomalies, it could be that the majority of the input data consists of noise rather than an actual fault. Therefore, we would want to remove the noise before feeding it into the decision tree models. Thus, we introduce a layer of transfer learning into the pipeline. During testing, we first apply the CWT transform to convert the raw input data into a time-domain representation. Then, we retrieve the learned features from the saved decision tree models and concatenate them with the transformed CWT coefficients. We pass this concatenated vector into the decision tree models for classification. By doing so, we ensure that the decision tree models are trained specifically on the given input data and take advantage of prior knowledge stored in the historical data to enable accurate classification even under severe adverse environments.


## Mathematical Formulation

### Input Data Preprocessing

Input data preprocessing steps include converting the time series data into a time domain representation using continuous wavelet transforms (CWT). We choose to implement the CWT since it provides us with a clear separation of different frequency components within the signal, thus allowing us to identify any temporal changes in the underlying phenomenon. Another benefit of the CWT is that it reduces the dimensionality of the input data, reducing computational cost and improving efficiency in training the decision tree models. Common implementations of the CWT involve selecting a mother wavelet function, calculating its discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and then reconstructing the signal using the inverse DWT. Here, we use a Morlet wavelet with a default value of 6 cycles/sample, giving rise to four output frequencies: F0 = pi, F1 = 2pi, F2 = 4pi, and F3 = 8pi. 

Next, we compute statistical moments of the input data to normalize the range and scale of the input values. These statistics can be computed separately for each channel or axis of multi-variate time series data. 

### Feature Extraction Using Trained Models

For each incoming batch of input data, we obtain a list of feature vectors obtained by applying the CWT transform to each time window of fixed length W. We pass each feature vector into the saved decision tree models for classification. Since the decision tree models were originally trained on the historical data, they should have already incorporated the CWT transformations used in the previous step. As a result, these models should be capable of recognizing meaningful patterns in the transformed input data. Based on this observation, we don't need to explicitly perform the CWT transformation again here. Once the predicted classes are obtained, we append them to a list of predicted labels for the entire time series. 

Finally, we average the scores assigned to each class across the different time windows to get the overall score for the entire input data. This gives us a single probability score representing the likelihood that the entire input signal belongs to a particular class. 

### Combining Predictions From Multiple Models

As mentioned earlier, we generate multiple probability scores for each incoming time series. Depending on the configuration of the ensemble, we might use different aggregation mechanisms such as averaging the probabilities, using soft voting or hard voting. In this paper, we use soft voting, which assigns equal weight to all models regardless of their individual accuracies. We calculate the weighted sum of the probability scores generated by each model, normalizing the weights based on the number of positive and negative instances seen in the historical data. If the weighted sum exceeds a certain threshold, we assign the input data to the corresponding class label. Otherwise, we discard it.
