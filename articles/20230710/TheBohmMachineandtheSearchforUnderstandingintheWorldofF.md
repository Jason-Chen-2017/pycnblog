The Bohm Machine and the Search for Understanding in the World of Finance
================================================================

Introduction
------------

37. "The Bohm Machine and the Search for Understanding in the World of Finance" explores the application of a theoretical physics concept, the Bohm Machine, to the world of finance. The article aims to provide an understanding of how the principles of this machine can be used to improve financial analysis and decision-making.

2. Technical Principles and Concepts
-----------------------------------

### 2.1. Basic Concepts Explanation

The Bohm Machine is a mathematical model that represents the stock market as a physical system, where each transaction is a change in the tension of a spring. The machine uses this tension to simulate the movement of a spring, which reflects the changing balance of supply and demand for a particular security.

### 2.2. Technical Principles Introduction

The Bohm Machine operates on the principle of self-organization, where the machine learns the underlying patterns in the data and adjusts its behavior accordingly. This principle is based on the idea of a self-replicating system, where the same pattern is repeated in an feedback loop.

The machine works by using a random number generator to generate a series of numbers, which are then used to calculate the tension of the spring. The tension of the spring is then used to simulate the movement of the spring, representing the buying or selling activity of the market.

### 2.3. Related Technical Concepts

The Bohm Machine is related to several other technical concepts, including:

* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are a type of machine learning algorithm that uses two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, to generate new data that resembles an existing dataset.
* Self-Organizing Map (SOM): SOMs are a type of neural network that uses a two-dimensional grid to represent the data, with each cell having a unique cell structure.
* fractal : A self-similar solution of a problem in which the solutions to the problem are used to generate solutions to it.
