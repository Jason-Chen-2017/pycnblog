Priority-based decision making (PBM) is a prominent technique in organizations to help with prioritization and decision-making processes. In this article, we will explore how PBM works through the lens of strategic management theory and the concept of priority categories or levels. We will also demonstrate how it can be applied to complex organizational problems using an example scenario. Finally, we will discuss some potential pitfalls and limitations that may arise from using PBM for complex real-world scenarios.
Priority-based decision making (PBM) is a widely used decision support tool in organizations. It involves allocating resources based on specific criteria such as risk, importance, urgency, effort, feasibility, and timeliness. The goal is to identify and focus on the most critical decisions at any given moment while ensuring that the highest-priority ones are addressed first. Despite its popularity, there are many challenges associated with implementing PBM effectively. These include:

1. Prioritizing complex tasks across multiple objectives, stakeholders, and teams requires expertise and skillsets not typically present in traditional business settings. 

2. Identifying important information quickly becomes challenging when dealing with large volumes of data, unstructured text, and non-linear relationships between different variables.

3. Managing uncertainty by taking into account multiple sources of evidence and correlations between factors makes it even more difficult to determine which priorities should be addressed next.

To address these issues, a new approach called “strategic management” has been developed over the past few decades. Strategic management proposes developing a holistic view of the entire enterprise by breaking down silos within the company and identifying how each component fits together. By organizing work into high-level strategies, departments, divisions, and subdivisions, strategic managers aim to achieve shared goals and aligned actions across the board. This process requires analyzing data through multidimensional analysis techniques to derive insights and find areas of opportunity.

Strategic management can also use prioritization frameworks like PBM to ensure that critical projects are completed efficiently. As a result, PBM is often considered an effective decision-support tool in both complex and large-scale organizations. However, PBM still faces several challenges including scalability, interpretability, and flexibility. To solve these issues, researchers have proposed various alternatives like multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), neural networks, and fuzzy logic. However, no single framework or method provides a panacea for all types of organizational challenges. Therefore, the need for hybrid approaches like combining MCDM with PBM remains a challenge.

In summary, the role of PBM in complex organizational contexts requires careful consideration of the underlying principles behind strategic management and alternative solutions such as multi-criteria decision-making and neural networks. Moreover, we must keep in mind that even successful implementations face unique challenges related to scalability, interpretability, and flexibility, necessitating adaptation to fit the changing needs of the organization. Overall, PBM offers a powerful decision-support tool that can provide significant value in a variety of situations, but also requires expertise, attention to detail, and teamwork to deliver results successfully.

## Priority Categories or Levels
The core idea behind PBM lies in assigning each task or project a priority level or category. Each category represents a certain degree of importance and urgency, ranging from very low to very high. There are usually four main categories: critical, important, normal, and low priority. 

Critical priority tasks require immediate action and should be undertaken immediately. Examples include emergencies, natural disasters, and medical procedures. Important priority tasks indicate crucial elements required for the overall success of the project. Examples include key product features, revenue targets, and quality requirements. Normal priority tasks are those that do not have a clear deadline or schedule. They range from routine maintenance activities to minor improvements. Low priority tasks are lower in terms of importance than normal priority tasks. Common examples include preparations for meetings and conference calls.

One advantage of assigning tasks to priority levels is that they enable teams to focus on the most pressing issues at any given point in time. Furthermore, higher priority tasks can easily slip through the cracks if they are not addressed appropriately or quickly enough. Lastly, setting clear guidelines around priority levels ensures consistency across the organization, thus enabling objective decision-making.

## Strategic Management Theory
Strategic management theory was originally introduced by George Bernard Shaw in his book, “Management’s Discourse: A Study of Business Organizations.” His purpose was to develop a theoretical foundation for understanding and managing organizations. He argued that a good manager should understand their organizations and navigate them towards achieving optimal performance. Strategic management consists of five stages:

1. Gathering Information: Collecting data on the current state of the organization, industry trends, and market opportunities is essential to identifying strategic directions.

2. Contextualize Data: Analyzing and synthesizing data helps establish a comprehensive picture of the organization’s strengths and weaknesses. This stage includes using metrics such as customer satisfaction scores, market share, and financial performance indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of existing operations.

3. Develop a Strategy: Once the context has been established, strategic thinking begins by formulating a strategy to guide future direction. This could involve aligning department goals, prioritizing investments, or improving operational efficiencies.

4. Design an Operating Model: The operating model highlights how the organization functions today and identifies ways to improve performance. It focuses on long-term planning and evaluation, as well as short-term improvement efforts.

5. Implement the Strategy: Once a strategy has been devised, the final step involves executing it. This could involve changing management styles, adopting new policies, or upgrading technology.

By integrating strategic management theory with PBM, organizations can make better decisions about where they allocate resources, what they focus on, and when. Strategic management theory helps organizations build a holistic view of the enterprise and avoids making decision-making biased by traditional business models. It also provides a structured way to measure progress, identify gaps, and adjust course accordingly.

In order to implement PBM, you need to follow three steps:

1. Define Objectives and Key Results (OKR): OKRs define the outcomes that you want to achieve and the measurable criteria to track your progress towards them. You should set specific target dates for achieving each outcome.

2. Create Hierarchy of Needs: Based on the strategic hierarchy, create a systematic list of tasks, projects, and initiatives. Assign each one a priority level or category depending on its criticality, importance, and urgency. Set milestones and deadlines for each activity.

3. Analyze and Evaluate Performance: After completing each milestone, review the results against the KRs to assess whether the goals were met. If necessary, adjust the plan based on lessons learned and continue iterating until all objectives are met. Keep track of changes made to the plan over time so that you can analyze how the priorities shift over time.

To apply PBM in a real-world scenario, let's consider an online education platform that wants to prioritize their content creation efforts across various platforms. Here are the steps to follow:

Step 1: Define Objectives and Key Results
Objectives: Increase user engagement on YouTube and other social media platforms.
Key Results:
Increase monthly subscriber count on YouTube by 10%
Improve average video length by 5%
Growing number of likes and shares on Facebook
Increased clickthrough rates on email campaigns
Improved conversion rates on landing pages
Increase views on homepage
Overall reach of website should increase by 10% annually
Create a detailed calendar showing the quarterly timeline for content creation efforts.

Step 2: Create Hierarchy of Needs
Content Creation Team
Product Marketing
Social Media Marketing
SEO Expert
Email Campaigns
Web Analytics Experts
Landing Pages
Finance & Administration
CMO/CXO
Marketing Director
Corporate Communications Manager
Operational Manager
CFO
Operations Department Head
Graphic Designer
IT Operations Specialist

For each task assigned a priority level, estimate its relative weight and duration (in months). Then assign each task to the relevant member of the Content Creation Team. Estimate the budget needed for each task per month and record who is responsible for each task. Record these details in a spreadsheet.

Step 3: Analyze and Evaluate Performance
After each milestone is complete, record the actual vs expected results. Use the weighted average formula to calculate the overall impact on each objective. Compare these results to the original KRs and revise the plan as needed. Repeat this cycle until all objectives are achieved. Keep a close eye on the progress and adjust as needed to maintain momentum.
