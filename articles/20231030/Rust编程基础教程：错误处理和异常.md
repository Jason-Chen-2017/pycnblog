# 1.背景介绍


Error handling and exception are two key features in any programming language. In this article, we will go through the basics of error handling and how it is implemented in the Rust programming language. We'll also discuss the related concepts like panic and result type which make our lives much easier while using error handling. Finally, we'll explore various ways to handle errors gracefully such as unwrap(), expect() or match statement.


# 2.核心概念与联系
Before delving into the implementation details, let's understand some important terms and their relationships with each other:
- Panic
- Result Type
- Unwrap() method
- Expect() method
- Match Statement
These terms help us to better understand error handling mechanisms in Rust programming language. 

### Panic
In Rust, a program can terminate abnormally due to an unrecoverable error called "panic". It happens when there is something unexpected that makes your program crash without being able to recover from it. When this happens, Rust prints out a message indicating where the error occurred and what caused the panic. This behavior can be disabled by defining a custom panic handler function. The term "panic" comes from the Latin word meaning "to throw suddenly upward and stun", which describes the severity and consequences of a panic.

Example: 

```rust
fn main() {
    let num = String::from("hello");

    // causes panic because `num` is not a number
    println!("{}", num + "world!");
}
```
Output:
```
thread'main' panicked at 'called `String::from_str(&s)` on an empty string', src/libcore/option.rs:1166:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.
```

### Result Type
The result type, denoted by the? symbol, is used to indicate whether a function has succeeded or failed, along with an optional value if successful. If an operation fails, you return Err(error) instead of returning a valid output. You use pattern matching to handle these errors appropriately.

Example:

```rust
enum MyError {
    ZeroDivisor,
    NegativeNumber,
}

fn divide(a: f64, b: f64) -> Result<f64, MyError> {
    if b == 0.0 {
        Err(MyError::ZeroDivisor)
    } else if b < 0.0 {
        Err(MyError::NegativeNumber)
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert!(divide(2.0, -1.0).is_err());
    assert_eq!(divide(2.0, 4.0), Ok(0.5));
}
```

### Unwrap() Method
This method returns the contained value (if the result is `Ok`), otherwise it will print an error message and exit the process with a non-zero status code. Use this method for situations where you know that the result must be ok and want to continue executing the rest of your program even if an error occurs.

Example:

```rust
let x: Option<u8> = Some(5);
match x {
    None => (),    // Do nothing
    Some(_) => {},   // Do something here regardless of its content
}

// Using `unwrap()` instead
assert_eq!("foo", "foo".to_string().as_str());
let y: i32 = "".parse::<i32>().unwrap();      // Produces a panic
println!("{}", y);        // Will never get executed since previous line panics
```

### Expect() Method
This method works similarly to `unwrap()`, but instead of printing an error message, it expects a string argument that should describe why an error occurred. Then it will again print an error message and exit the process with a non-zero status code. Use this method if you're unsure about why an error occurred or don't have a descriptive error message to provide.

Example:

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn open_file(path: &str) -> File {
    let file = File::open(path).expect("Failed to open file");
    file
}

fn read_file(mut file: File) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut buffer = vec![];
    loop {
        let chunk = file.read(&mut [0u8; 1024]).expect("Failed to read data");
        if chunk == 0 {
            break;
        }
        buffer.extend(chunk);
    }
    buffer
}

fn main() {
    let path = "/some/nonexistent/path";
    let file = open_file(path);     // Handles missing files
    let data = read_file(file);      // Returns empty vector if no data found
}
```

### Match Statement
The match statement allows you to check multiple possible outcomes for a single expression and execute different blocks of code based on those outcomes. If none of the patterns match, then a default block may be executed. In Rust, all expressions evaluate to either Ok(value) or Err(error), so they work well with the result type.

Example:

```rust
fn parse_number(input: &str) -> Result<i32, &'static str> {
    match input.parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(n) => Ok(n),
        Err(_) => Err("invalid input"),
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(parse_number("5").unwrap(), 5);
    assert_eq!(parse_number("abc"), Err("invalid input"));
}
```
