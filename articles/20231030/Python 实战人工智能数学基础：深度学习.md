# 2.核心概念与联系
## Linear Algebra
线性代数又称线性方程组的求解方法，它是数学的一个分支，它的核心是向量空间及其运算，为深度学习中的大多数模型提供支撑。

- Vectors and Matrices
- Operations on vectors and matrices
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Singular value decomposition (SVD) and low rank approximations
- Matrix factorization techniques such as SVD, PCA, NMF, and PLS.
- Other concepts related to linear algebra include the Fourier transform, matrix calculus, and determinant theory. 

## Probability Theory
概率论是指随机事件发生的可能性以及事件之间的各种联系。概率论的理论基础是数理统计学。深度学习模型训练、评估、调优等都离不开概率论。

- Random variables and probability distributions
- Conditional probabilities and independence
- Bayes' theorem and other probabilistic inference methods
- Continuous random variables and their representations using probability densities and cumulative density functions.
- Estimation of parameters for various probability distributions including maximum likelihood estimators, least squares estimators, and empirical estimates.

## Optimization Methods
优化方法是用来解决某些最优化问题的数学工具。深度学习的模型训练就是用优化方法找到最优的参数。

- Gradient descent method
- Stochastic gradient descent with momentum
- Adam optimizer
- Adaptive learning rate optimization algorithms like AdaGrad, RMSProp, and AdaDelta.
- Hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search and random search.

## Feedforward Neural Networks
深度学习的核心是神经网络，神经网络由多个层（Layer）组成，每一层接收上一层输出的数据并根据自己的规则进行计算，最后产生下一层的输出。其中，隐藏层（Hidden Layer）通常比较复杂，而且可以由许多神经元组成。输入层（Input Layer）接受外部数据，输出层（Output Layer）则是模型预测的结果。我们用链式法则（Chain Rule）来描述这些连接。

- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation algorithm and its variants such as stochastic gradients, adaptive learning rates, adagrad, etc.
- Common activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, softmax, elu, and leaky ReLU.
- Initialization strategies for weight matrices and bias vectors.
- Dropout regularization technique for reducing overfitting.
- Convolutional neural networks and pooling layers.
- Regularization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization and early stopping.

## Convolutional Neural Networks
卷积神经网络是一种特殊的神经网络，适用于处理二维图像数据。它主要由卷积层（Convolutional Layers）、池化层（Pooling Layers）、激活层（Activation Layers）三种层组合而成。

- Convolutional layer: Applies a filter to each patch of input data to produce feature maps or output activations. The filters are small matrices that learn patterns in the input data.
- Pooling layer: Reduces spatial dimensionality by aggregating multiple patches into one representative pixel. It also helps reduce computational complexity and enables subsampling without loss of information.
- Activation layer: Used to introduce non-linearity in the model, improving generalization ability. Popular activation functions include ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU, and selu.
- Padding and Strides: These two hyperparameters control how much padding is added to the input data before convolution and the stride size used during convolution. They can help increase receptive field size while maintaining computation efficiency.
- Filter and Kernel Size: Controls the size of the learned filters in the convolution layer, which determine the shape and depth of the feature maps produced. Larger kernel sizes capture more complex features at lower resolutions.
- Number of Filters: Controls the number of feature maps generated by the convolution layer. The larger this number, the deeper the network becomes but also increases memory usage and computational time.
- Maxpooling vs Averagepooling: In CNNs, maxpooling operations aggregate feature maps using the maximum value within each region defined by the kernel size and strides. On the other hand, average pooling computes the mean value within each region instead. Both have their pros and cons depending on the specific use case.
- Batch normalization: This technique normalizes the inputs to each neuron across all examples within a batch, i.e., it helps avoid vanishing or exploding gradients problem. 

## Recurrent Neural Networks
循环神经网络（Recurrent Neural Network，RNN）是深度学习中的另一种重要模型。它被广泛应用于自然语言处理、文本生成、音频处理等领域。

- Types of RNNs: One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. Each type of RNN has different properties, capabilities, and uses.
- Architecture of an RNN: An RNN consists of a sequence of layers where each layer takes in previous output(s), current input, and internal state information from the previous time step. The final output is then computed based on the combined outputs from all the time steps.
- LSTM and GRU cells: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells are popular choices for implementing an RNN. LSTM cells offer more flexibility than traditional RNN cells due to the inclusion of long-term memory units. While GRUs are smaller and faster, they may perform less accurately.
- Vanishing and Exploding Gradients Problem: The vanishing and exploding gradients problem is a common issue in deep neural networks when training large models with high dimensional inputs. It causes gradients to become very small or zero and thus slow down convergence. Several solutions to address this problem exist, some of them involve using dropout, batch normalization, and adjusting the learning rate schedule.

## Generative Adversarial Networks
生成对抗网络（Generative Adversarial Network，GAN）是深度学习中一种最新兴模型。它可以训练一个生成模型，该模型可以根据给定的真实样本生成类似的假样本。同时，训练另一个判别模型，该模型可以判断给定样本是真还是假。两者博弈，互相提高，最终达到生成真实样本的目的。

- Discriminator: A binary classifier that determines whether a given sample is real or fake. It receives both real and fake samples as inputs and produces a probability score indicating the confidence level of the prediction.
- Generator: A generator function that generates synthetic samples similar to those observed in the dataset. It receives noise inputs and attempts to fool the discriminator by generating samples that look plausible but are not actually part of the original distribution.
- Loss Functions: Two types of losses are commonly used in GANs, namely, cross entropy and Wasserstein distance. Cross entropy measures the difference between predicted class labels and true class labels, whereas Wasserstein distance measures the minimum amount of energy required to transport a set of points from one space to another. Wasserstein distance is often preferred because it encourages the generator to generate more diverse and creative samples compared to plain cross entropy.
