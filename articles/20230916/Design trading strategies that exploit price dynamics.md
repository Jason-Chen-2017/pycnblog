# 1.简介
  

The stock market is one of the most complex financial markets and it is changing rapidly over time with new technology, regulations and events. In recent years, algorithmic trading has emerged as a popular tool for investors to take advantage of this rapid change in the market environment. However, some fundamental issues still exist, such as high entry costs or slow exit. Traders often face challenges when designing trading strategies that exploit price dynamics. This article aims to provide an overview of common techniques used by traders to build their own algorithms based on price dynamics. Moreover, we will demonstrate how these methods can be implemented using Python programming language and open source libraries. Finally, we will discuss the potential advantages and limitations of these techniques and identify future research directions. 

# 2. 基本概念术语
In this section, we will introduce some important concepts related to technical analysis and risk management. The first concept is volatility (or stochasticity), which refers to changes in prices over short-term periods, measured by various statistical indicators. The second concept is momentum, which indicates the trend direction and strength of a security's current price relative to its historical movement. Momentum traders try to capture the momentum by buying or selling at extreme points. A third concept is trend following, which involves monitoring price movements to anticipate reversals in the direction of increasing or decreasing prices. Trend followers tend to trade sideways during downtrends while entering into new trends. Fourth, we have Average True Range (ATR) indicator, which measures volatility in different ways than simple moving average (SMA). The formula for calculating ATR is: ATR = E(price range) where price range is defined as the absolute difference between the highest and lowest prices within a specific period. Five, we also define Technical Analysis (TA) as a set of trading techniques involving both technical analysis and risk management. 

# 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Steps
Technical analysis helps traders determine patterns and trends from past data to make decisions on whether to enter or exit positions. There are several core principles behind technical analysis, including identifying trends, determining support and resistance levels, managing risk and adjusting position size accordingly. Here are the steps involved in building a technical trading algorithm based on price dynamics:

1. Select Data Source: Determine the type of data you want to analyze and select the appropriate sources. You could use publicly available APIs, web scraping tools, or local databases depending on your needs. 

2. Calculate Moving Averages (MA): Develop functions to calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA), Triple Exponential Moving Average (T3), etc., and keep track of their values across multiple time frames. 

3. Measure Volatility: Develop functions to measure the rate of change in prices using various indicators such as Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, etc. Use these calculations to assess the magnitude of volatility throughout a given time frame. 

4. Identify Trend: Look for shifts in the direction of prices over long periods of time and then extrapolate them to identify trends. Use traditional indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI), Mass Index, Williams Percent Range (WPR), Stochastic Trend Line (STC), etc. Alternatively, develop machine learning models to automatically detect trends and extract features from the data stream. 

5. Implement Position Sizing Rules: Determine rules for opening and closing positions based on the strength and direction of the trend. Set thresholds for entry and exit signals and utilize slippage settings to manage risk. Optimize position sizing parameters to reduce transaction costs and improve performance. 

6. Monitor Performance: Analyze the results of your strategy after it is in operation and continuously monitor the effectiveness of your approach. Review the logs to identify any unusual behavior and correct any errors. Test your strategy under different market conditions to ensure consistent performance.
