# 1.简介
  

Welcome to my new technical blog post! In this article I will cover the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP) using Python with some hands-on coding examples. You can expect a deep dive into popular NLP libraries such as NLTK or spaCy, but before we start let's get familiar with some fundamental terms and concepts that are used in NLP.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area of computer science that involves automatic analysis of human language and text data. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand and manipulate human languages naturally without being explicitly programmed to do so. This field has become increasingly important due to the explosion of social media content available on the web, and its applications ranging from sentiment analysis to machine translation.

To build effective NLP systems, it is essential to have a solid understanding of how to process and analyze large amounts of unstructured text data. Here are six key areas of knowledge that every developer should master to effectively work with NLP tasks in Python:

1. Text preprocessing
2. Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization techniques
3. Part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition
4. Vector representation techniques
5. Sentiment analysis and opinion mining
6. Topic modeling and document clustering 

In this article, we will focus on basic natural language processing techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and vector representation, while also demonstrating their implementation using Python libraries such as NLTK or spaCy. We will also discuss advanced topics such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling. At the end of the article, there will be a concluding section highlighting potential future research directions in NLP. By the way, if you enjoyed reading through all these sections and want more detailed explanations of each technique, feel free to ask questions or share your thoughts in the comments below.
# 2.Text Preprocessing
The first step towards building an effective NLP system is to clean and prepare the input text data. This includes removing stop words, punctuations, URLs, numbers, and other irrelevant characters, and converting all letters to lowercase or uppercase depending on our preference. Additionally, we may need to normalize some words, e.g., “didn’t” vs “do not”.

We typically perform several steps during text preprocessing:
1. Converting all text to lower case
2. Removing special characters and digits
3. Stemming or lemmatizing the remaining words

Stemming and lemmatization both refer to processes of reducing inflected (or derived) words to their root form. For example, the word "running" can be reduced to its base form "run". However, lemmatization uses morphological information about the language (e.g., verb endings), which helps in keeping meaningful words together even though they may look different at first glance. Therefore, the choice between stemming and lemmatization depends on the specific problem at hand.

Here is an example code snippet for cleaning and preparing text using NLTK library:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer

# download required resources
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# load sample text
text = '''This is a sample sentence with punctuation marks. 
URLs such as http://example.com must be removed, 
as well as emails <EMAIL>. Numbers 
12345 must be replaced by placeholders such as #number#.'''

# convert to lowercase
text = text.lower()

# remove special characters and digits
special_chars = "!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~0123456789"
for char in special_chars:
    text = text.replace(char, "")
    
# tokenize sentences and words
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
tokenized_sentences = []
for sentence in sentences:
    tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
    filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords.words("english")]
    tokenized_sentences.append(filtered_tokens)

# stem or lemmatize words
porter = PorterStemmer()
wnl = WordNetLemmatizer()
processed_sentences = []
for sentence in tokenized_sentences:
    processed_sentence = []
    for token in sentence:
        token = porter.stem(token)
        # token = wnl.lemmatize(token)   # use lemmatization instead of stemming here
        processed_sentence.append(token)
    processed_sentences.append(processed_sentence)
```

Note that the `stopwords` module comes preinstalled with NLTK, so no additional installation is necessary for downloading them. Also note that we could use regular expressions to replace email addresses and phone numbers with placeholders (`\b(\d{3}[-.]?)?\d{3}\b`) using the `re` module in Python, although this would increase complexity and requires more fine-tuning than simply replacing them with `#email#` and `#phone#`. Finally, we assume that any punctuation marks associated with certain words are relevant for analysis purposes and should not be removed. If desired, we could further preprocess the text to extract features such as part-of-speech tags or dependency trees using spaCy or another NLP library later on.
