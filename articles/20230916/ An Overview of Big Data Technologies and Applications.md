2.系统设计概述
The following illustration gives a high-level view of the Big Data Technology Architecture:

From left to right, the architecture diagram shows five layers:

- **Data Collection**: This layer involves collecting, storing, and analyzing large volumes of data generated from multiple sources. It includes technologies like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and HDFS.

- **Data Storage**: The collected data needs to be stored somewhere securely, which involves technologies like Amazon S3, Azure Blob storage, and Google Cloud Storage. These services offer scalability and fault tolerance capabilities making them ideal candidates for big data storage solutions.

- **Processing & Analysis**: Once the raw data has been stored, it must undergo a variety of processing steps before being able to extract meaningful insights. This layer comprises technologies like Hive, Pig, MapReduce, Impala, and SparkSQL. Each technology offers unique functionalities like parallel processing, advanced querying, and incremental processing.

- **Visualization & Reporting**: Analyzed data should be presented in a consumable format using visualization and reporting tools. This layer consists of technologies like Tableau, Power BI, QlikSense, and Zeppelin Notebook. With these tools, users can interact with analyzed data and gain valuable insights into various aspects of the business.

- **Business Intelligence**: Finally, organizations require real-time access to all types of data at various levels of granularity, providing fast-changing decisions based on historical data. This layer provides technologies like Hadoop ecosystem integration, data lakes, and OLAP cubes. Organizations can analyze massive amounts of data across multiple sources and create dashboards and reports that enable business leaders to make quick and accurate decisions.

It's worth noting that each layer contains varying components depending on the type of application or problem that needs to be solved. For example, if you want to perform complex queries over structured and semi-structured data, then you'll need to consider technologies like Hive, Presto, and Drill. Similarly, if you're dealing with unstructured or streaming data, then you may opt for technologies like Hadoop Streaming, Storm, or Flink. Overall, choosing the best combination of technologies depends on the requirements and goals of your project.

4.核心概念及其理解
## 1. 数据采集
Data collection refers to the process of gathering and extracting relevant information from different sources to form a comprehensive dataset. Some examples of popular data collection technologies include Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and HDFS. They allow businesses to collect large volumes of data, store it in a distributed manner, and perform real-time data analysis.

### 1.1 Apache Hadoop
Apache Hadoop is a framework designed to handle large datasets by distributing computation across clusters of machines. It was originally developed by Apache Software Foundation (ASF) as part of its flagship Hadoop project, but later became a standalone open-source software project in December 2013. 

Hadoop consists of three main components:

1. HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): This component stores data on multiple nodes in a cluster and enables file management, aggregation, and scaling up to petabytes of data.

2. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): This component schedules resources on the available nodes in the cluster for task execution.

3. MapReduce: This component allows developers to write programs that map input data sets onto key-value pairs, and reduce the output values back into a single result set. Developers can customize their code by writing user defined functions called “mappers” and “reducers”.

Overall, Hadoop uses parallelism to distribute computations across multiple servers for faster processing of large datasets. However, it also introduces other challenges like reliability and consistency due to its distributed nature. Besides, it requires a deep understanding of Java programming language and related libraries for efficient implementation of distributed systems.  

### 1.2 Apache Spark
Apache Spark is another popular big data processing framework. It provides APIs in Scala, Python, and R for developing highly optimized distributed applications. Unlike Hadoop, Spark operates in-memory instead of relying on disk I/O. Thus, it can handle much larger datasets than Hadoop without significantly increasing the memory footprint of each node. 

Spark provides several core abstractions:

1. Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD): This abstraction represents immutable, partitioned collections of elements that can be operated on in parallel. You can create RDDs from external datasets (e.g., HDFS files, Hive tables), transform them through transformation operations, and trigger actions to compute results.

2. DataFrame API: This is a higher level abstraction built upon RDDs that provides an easier way to work with structured data. It provides SQL-like queries and schema inference, allowing developers to easily manipulate and filter large datasets.

3. SQL API: This is a query engine that allows developers to issue SQL commands against any DataFrame or table in Spark. It supports powerful relational operators and data transformations, making it easy to build complex queries against large datasets.

4. Streaming: Spark also includes functionality for working with streams of data, enabling developers to quickly ingest, analyze, and respond to incoming events. 

Similar to Hadoop, Spark also requires a deep understanding of Scala and related libraries for efficient development of distributed applications. Furthermore, Spark is often used in conjunction with other big data processing technologies like Kafka and Cassandra for real-time data processing. 

### 1.3 Kafka
Apache Kafka is a distributed messaging system that is widely used for building real-time event-driven applications. It provides fault-tolerant message delivery and strong ordering guarantees between producers and consumers. 

Kafka implements two primary data structures:

1. Topic: A topic is a category or feed name to which messages are published. Producers send messages to topics and consumers subscribe to one or more topics to receive messages. 

2. Partition: A partition is a logical segment of a topic that is responsible for holding a subset of the messages. Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally by splitting up data into smaller chunks.

Producers typically batch up messages and transmit them to brokers, which store the messages until they are delivered to subscribers. Consumers can consume individual messages, batches of messages, or entire partitions, ensuring that each subscriber receives only the messages that they are interested in. 

Kafka is commonly used in conjunction with Apache Spark for performing real-time stream processing of large datasets. Moreover, Kafka can be integrated with other data processing technologies like Hadoop for building end-to-end data pipelines that move data from source to destination in near-real-time.

### 1.4 Cassandra
Apache Cassandra is a NoSQL database that serves widespread use cases like web session tracking, clickstream analysis, and recommendation engines. Its primary design goal is horizontal scalability and high availability, while achieving low latency for read and write operations.

Cassandra shares similar characteristics to both Hadoop and Apache Spark, in terms of having a distributed architecture and emphasizing ease of use. It also features several core abstractions:

1. Column Family: CFs represent rows of data organized by columns. Every CF belongs to a keyspace and can have multiple columns within itself. Columns can be sorted lexicographically, geographically, numerically, or indexed.

2. Secondary Index: Indexes improve performance by allowing queries to be performed efficiently on specific fields in a column family. Different types of indexes can be created, such as BTree, Hash, Spatial, and Text.

3. Consistency Level: Consistency controls ensure that reads always return the most recent version of a record, even during network partitions or failures.

Besides being a great fit for handling large datasets, Cassandra is known for its ability to handle complex queries with minimal overhead and seamless scalability. As a NoSQL DB, Cassandra integrates well with other big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark for real-time data processing.

### 1.5 MongoDB
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database platform written in C++ and typically runs as a separate server process. It is known for its flexibility, scalability, and speed. Its interface is very familiar to developers coming from traditional databases and makes it easy to integrate with modern applications.

MongoDB separates data into flexible documents, which can contain nested subdocuments and arrays. Documents are grouped together inside collections, which can be sharded across multiple servers. Databases are isolated from each other and accessed via a dedicated client driver.

Some of MongoDB’s key features include:

1. Query Optimization: MongoDB compiles queries to bytecode, reducing the amount of data to be processed and improving response times.

2. Aggregation Pipeline: MongoDB supports a rich pipeline model for aggregating and manipulating data.

3. Document Validation: MongoDB allows schemas to be defined for collections and verifies that new documents match the constraints before insertion.

Moreover, MongoDB integrates well with other big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark for real-time data processing. Additionally, MongoDB has an active community of developers and users that contribute features and fix bugs regularly.
