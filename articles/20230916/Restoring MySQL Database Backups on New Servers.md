# 1.简介
  

This article is the fifth part of a series about how to restore MySQL backups on new servers or restore databases from backup files when restoration fails due to server crashes, hardware failures and other problems. This article assumes that you have already taken regular backups of your MySQL database(s) using a tool such as mysqldump or xtrabackup. 

When restoring backups, it’s important to ensure that the target server has the necessary resources (memory, CPU, storage space etc.) before attempting to restore the backup file. Also, while restoring large databases, it’s essential to use tools like mysqlpump which can parallelize the import process for faster performance. If possible, also try out different options for optimizing MySQL's configuration settings during this phase so that the restored database performs well and runs smoothly after being imported. 

In this post, we will explore ways in which MySQL backups can be restored successfully even if there are issues with the original backup creation or restore operations. We will cover various scenarios where data loss may occur due to server crashes or hardware failure leading to incomplete or damaged backup files. We will look at methods used by experienced MySQL administrators to recover from these situations effectively without causing any permanent damage to their MySQL databases. Finally, we will consider future improvements that could make backing up and restoring MySQL databases more reliable and easier in the long run. 


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before we proceed further, let us understand some basic concepts related to MySQL backups. Here are a few terminologies:

1. **Backup**: A backup refers to creating a copy of all the important information stored in a computer system. It helps in ensuring that the system can be recovered in case of data corruption, accidental deletion, hardware failure, software bugs, etc. In MySQL, backup means taking a snapshot of the entire database and storing it off-site either locally or remotely. The primary purpose of backup is to protect the valuable data against loss or theft.

2. **Restore**: When a backup of a database is restored onto another server, its contents get copied over into the new system. This makes sure that the old system remains intact and the recovery point objective (RPO) of zero is met. In order to avoid losing critical data, it’s always recommended to perform a fresh install of the new system before performing the restore operation. Once the new server comes online, you can then apply the backups created earlier onto it. 

3. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: This is defined as the maximum time within which you can lose unrecoverable data, i.e., the amount of data that can potentially be lost during normal operating hours but still be acceptable. RPO determines the level of service required from an organization based on the number of hours it can afford to lose data. For example, if an RPO of five minutes is set, it means that in an hour of down-time, no more than five minutes worth of data should be lost. 

4. **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**: PITR enables you to restore a specific point in time to a new server. This feature allows you to quickly revert the database back to a previous state in case of any disruptions. You can specify a particular date and time to restore the database. PITR works by copying only those parts of the binary log that were generated after the specified timestamp, thus allowing very fast restores compared to full or incremental backups.

# 3. Core Algorithm and Steps
Here are the core algorithm and steps involved in restoring MySQL backups:

1. Validate Backup Integrity
   Before starting the restore operation, check whether the backup files are complete and valid. Verify checksums of each backup file to ensure that they haven't been corrupted. Additionally, verify backup files' size to see if they exceed the available disk space.

   ```mysqladmin --user=<username> --password=<<PASSWORD>> checksum <backup_file_name>```
   
  Example output:

  ```bash
  # Checking integrity of /var/lib/mysql/daily_full.xbstream... OK 
  ```

  >Note: Use the `checksum` command instead of `md5sum` because md5sums are not collision resistant and vulnerable to length extension attacks. Therefore, they cannot detect collisions between two identical files.
    
2. Stop Services
   While the validation step ensures that the backup files are ready to be restored, stop all services except the one responsible for MySQL (e.g., the Apache web server).

3. Restore Database Files
   Copy the backup files (.sql/.gz/.xb) to the destination directory (/var/lib/mysql/). Be careful not to overwrite any existing files or directories.

4. Start Services
   Start all stopped services again. Note that some MySQL programs need to restart automatically after importing the backup files. Check the logs for errors and fix them accordingly.

5. Verify Data Integrity
   After restoring the database files, start the MySQL server and connect to it using the same credentials as before. Run the following commands to check the tables' structure, row count, indexes and other metadata:

   ```mysql -u<username> -p<passwrd> -D<database_name> -e "SELECT * FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = '<database_name>'"```
   
   ```mysql -u<username> -p<passwrd> -D<database_name> -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table_name>"```
   
   ```mysql -u<username> -p<passwrd> -D<database_name> -e "SHOW INDEXES FROM <table_name>"```

6. Test Application Functionality
   Now that the data is verified, test the application functionality thoroughly to ensure that everything is working fine. Pay special attention to user-facing applications and features, since many issues might arise from misconfigured permissions or incorrect SQL queries. Consider setting up monitoring alerts for key metrics such as response times and error rates to keep track of any performance degradation caused by the restore operation. 
   
   Ensure that you create regular backups to prevent data loss and downtime. Always remember to validate backups' authenticity before restoring them.
