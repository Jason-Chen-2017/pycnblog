Few-Shot learning (FSL) is a new machine learning paradigm that aims at enabling machines to learn from only a few examples or samples of a given task, which are labelled as "support set" and used for model training while the rest of the data remains unseen during testing time. The support sets can be considered to be small in size because they provide limited context information about the target task, but these mini-batches allow models to quickly adapt to different tasks and improve generalization performance. In this paper, we review the fundamental concepts, techniques, and applications of FSL in natural language processing (NLP). We first cover how to construct an appropriate support set by randomly sampling examples from a corpus based on their similarity, structure, and semantic meaning. Then, we explain how to use transfer learning techniques such as meta-learning and fine-tuning to leverage pre-trained models in our own NLP tasks. Next, we explore how to apply various deep neural networks and recurrent neural network architectures such as transformers, convolutional neural networks, and graph neural networks for modeling language understanding tasks using FSL approaches. Finally, we discuss how to evaluate and compare the performance of these models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and BLEU score. We also look into future directions and challenges in designing effective FSL systems for natural language understanding applications. 

In summary, the aim of this survey article is to bring a comprehensive overview of Few-Shot learning in NLP through several sections covering core concepts, algorithms, applications, evaluation metrics, and potential future research directions. By reviewing these topics thoroughly, readers will gain an insight into how powerful the concept of Few-Shot learning has become and what more it could achieve in natural language processing applications. Overall, this paper provides a practical guide for researchers and developers who wish to understand Few-Shot learning better and take advantage of its potential advantages in solving natural language processing problems. This work can serve as a foundation for further research in NLP and related fields. Moreover, it helps establish new benchmarks and test hypotheses for evaluating and comparing FSL methods.

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved significantly over the past decade due to advancements in computer hardware, internet connectivity, and deep learning technologies. However, it still lacks substantial theoretical and empirical progress towards building advanced intelligent systems that can handle complex real world scenarios effectively. To address this shortcoming, there have been numerous attempts in recent years to develop specialized AI models that can perform specific tasks without explicitly being programmed. One such example is object detection where one simply trains a deep neural network on thousands of annotated images of different objects to recognize them accurately. Another is speech recognition where simple statistical models trained on audio recordings can automatically recognize spoken words even when the speaker’s accent is unknown. Despite their simplicity, these models often outperform humans in some domains and can assist in many critical decision-making processes. 

However, despite significant progress made so far, most of these solutions rely heavily on labeled datasets that require expensive manual annotation and human supervision. These limitations make them impractical for practical applications in healthcare, security, transportation, finance, and other real-world domains where large amounts of data are available but not always well-annotated. In response, various research teams have proposed semi-supervised learning techniques that utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to train machine learning models with high accuracy. Other works focus on adapting pre-trained models for novel tasks via transfer learning. Although successful in many cases, all of these techniques typically suffer from issues of scalability, interpretability, and robustness.

Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have fueled tremendous interest in the development of NLP tools that can understand text and derive meaningful insights from it. As a result, there has been an increasing demand for developing more powerful and efficient NLP systems that can process massive amounts of unstructured text with high accuracy and efficiency. Despite these requirements, most current NLP systems remain too slow and inefficient for handling large volumes of data with hundreds of millions of examples. Hence, the need for advanced Few-Shot learning (FSL) strategies becomes apparent.

## 3.1 Few-Shot Learning
Few-Shot learning is a machine learning technique that enables a machine to learn from a small amount of sample data rather than requiring a large dataset to build an accurate model. It involves training a model on a subset of the training data called a support set. The remaining part of the training data is termed as query set or episode. Few-Shot learning is particularly useful for solving complex real-world tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and question answering (QA). 

A standard protocol for Few-Shot learning involves four main components: 

1. Support Set: A pool of exemplar instances from which the model learns. Typically, each instance is paired with a corresponding label.

2. Query Set / Episode: A smaller subset of instances that represents the distribution shift between the support set and the target task. For instance, if the target task requires predicting whether a sentence is positive or negative, then the query set may contain sentences of mixed sentiment.

3. Meta-Learner: An inner loop algorithm that generates a list of hypothesis weights for updating the parameters of the base model. The meta-learner selects a set of hyperparameters from a predefined space and optimizes the base model's performance on a validation set. The learned weights define the importance of each training example within the support set.

4. Base Model: The classifier function that maps input features to labels. It consists of multiple layers of hidden units connected to input nodes and output nodes that produce probabilities for each class. Each layer contains weights that are updated iteratively to minimize the loss on the training data. Different base models are used depending on the complexity of the problem and the level of desired performance improvement. Common base models include feedforward neural networks (NNs), CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.

Few-Shot learning offers several benefits compared to traditional supervised learning:

1. Efficiency: Few-Shot learning reduces the number of samples required to train a model, leading to faster and cheaper iterations. Furthermore, since the model does not have to learn from scratch every time, it can take advantage of previous knowledge learned from different tasks and avoid catastrophic forgetting.

2. Flexibility: Few-Shot learning allows us to easily adjust the difficulty of the targeted task by varying the size of the support set. This makes it easy to identify suitable settings for transfer learning, improving model robustness and adaptability.

3. Interpretability: Since the base model is usually very complex, we can interpret the learned weights to gain insights into why certain classes were identified as important features. This enables us to debug and analyze the performance of the system and identify areas of weakness. 

4. Transferability: Few-Shot learning can be applied to a variety of NLP tasks, including those related to language modelling, parsing, and generation. Additionally, by applying transfer learning techniques, we can leverage pre-trained models and optimize the performance of our own NLP systems.

Overall, Few-Shot learning promises to enable machine learning systems to solve a wide range of challenging tasks with high accuracy and efficiency.

## 3.2 Transfer Learning
Transfer learning refers to the process of transferring knowledge gained from one domain to another. The goal is to simplify the process of building a deep learning model by taking advantage of a pre-existing model that has already learned a lot about the underlying patterns and structures in the data. Transfer learning is commonly used in deep learning for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP).

There are two key techniques involved in transfer learning:
1. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the source data using pre-trained feature extractors and add them as inputs to the target model. This approach is widely used in computer vision tasks where raw pixel values are not directly useful for determining the label of an object. Instead, feature extractors learn abstract representations of the visual scene that are sufficient to classify images. 

2. Fine-Tuning: Retrain the top layers of the target model on the new data using backpropagation, starting from random initial weights. This approach is common in NLP tasks where the vocabulary size is much larger than the number of unique word embeddings. Instead of training the entire model from scratch, we can selectively update the weight vectors associated with the embedding matrix and the output layer.

Both techniques involve minimizing the difference between the predictions on the target data and the original ones obtained using the pre-trained model. After training, the transferred model can be evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance on the target task. There are several factors to consider before deciding whether to use transfer learning for a particular task:

1. Size of Training Data: Whether the source data is large enough to learn a generalizable representation of the target task, especially considering the computational resources available. If the source data is small, it may not be possible to obtain good results with transfer learning.

2. Complexity of the Task: The depth and width of the pre-trained model affects the ability of the transferred model to capture the nuances and characteristics of the target data. If the target task is too complex or diverse relative to the pre-trained model, transfer learning might not be beneficial.

3. Cost of Pre-Training Models: Pre-training models typically require a lot of compute power and storage space, making them costly in terms of time and money. This factor should be taken into account when selecting the right transfer strategy for a given task.

4. Accuracy vs Transferability Tradeoff: Transfer learning can sometimes lead to a trade-off between improved accuracy and increased transferability. A model trained on a fixed set of features extracted from the source data may not necessarily be able to adapt to new domains and contexts. However, transfer learning can potentially save a lot of time and effort spent manually engineering features for each new task.

For assessing the quality of Few-Shot learning models, several popular evaluation metrics have been developed. Here, we briefly describe the most commonly used evaluation metrics used for evaluating Few-Shot learning models. 

### 4.1 Baseline Metrics

Before looking at more sophisticated evaluation metrics, let's first introduce some baseline metrics that can help quantify the quality of basic classifiers:
1. Zero-Shot Accuracies: Random guessing on the test set leads to an average zero-shot accuracy of around 50%. It means that if the model cannot detect any pattern among the test set categories, it performs poorly. Therefore, a low zero-shot accuracy indicates that the model needs additional training or annotations to achieve competitive performance on previously unseen tasks.

2. Top-K Accuracies: Select K% of the highest probability scores as predicted labels for each test instance, and calculate the percentage of correct predictions. A higher top-k accuracy shows that the model focuses on correctly identifying the most probable category labels. On average, a high top-k accuracy would correspond to a relatively conservative setting for choosing K. Conversely, a lower top-k accuracy corresponds to a liberal setting for choosing K, allowing the model to accept less confident predictions.


### 4.2 Classification Performance Metrics
Classification performance metrics summarize the overall performance of a binary classifier on a test set consisting of a collection of n instances belonging to k distinct categories. They are defined as follows:

#### 4.2.1 Precision/Recall/F1 Score: 
Precision measures the fraction of true positives (TP) among the total number of positive predictions (TP+FP). Recall measures the proportion of positive examples correctly classified (TP+FN). The harmonic mean of precision and recall is known as F1-score. It is calculated as:

    F1 = 2*(precision*recall)/(precision + recall)

where TP is the number of true positives, FP is the number of false positives, FN is the number of false negatives. A perfect classifier would have a high precision and recall value of 1, whereas a classifier that always returns negative would have a precision and recall value of 0.

#### 4.2.2 Area under Curve (AUC): 
Area under curve (AUC) measures the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the False Positive Rate (FPR) against the True Positive Rate (TPR) of a binary classifier. Higher AUC values indicate better performance, indicating that the classifier is capable of distinguishing between positive and negative examples. Specifically, the AUC is equal to the probability that a randomly selected positive example is ranked above a randomly selected negative example. A perfect classifier achieves an AUC value of 1.

### 4.3 Multilabel Classification Metrics
Multilabel classification consists of assigning multiple labels to each instance. Evaluation metrics specifically designed for multilabel classification focus on measuring the extent to which the model identifies all relevant labels correctly, regardless of the order in which they appear. Three commonly used multilabel classification metrics are weighted accuracy, macro averaging, and micro averaging.
