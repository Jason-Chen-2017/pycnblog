# 1.简介
  

Recommender systems have been one of the most popular applications of machine learning in recent years. They are widely used to recommend products or services based on user behavior data such as click records, purchase histories, search queries, etc., to improve customer experience and reduce operational costs. However, developing effective recommender systems requires a combination of statistical modeling techniques with deep neural networks. 

In this article, we will review two important algorithms that combine wide and deep models for recommendation tasks - Wide & Deep Neural Networks (W&D) and Neural Factorization Machines (NFM). We will first provide an overview of both algorithms, followed by detailed explanations of their core concepts, mathematical formulations, operation steps, code implementation and evaluation results. Finally, we will discuss future research directions and challenges. This comprehensive technical review will help readers understand how these algorithms work, when they should be applied, and why certain factors such as model complexity can significantly impact performance. It is essential for industry practitioners and researchers alike to understand the inner working of these powerful recommendation systems and apply them effectively in their businesses.  

# 2.Wide and Deep Model Overview
## 2.1 Wide and Deep Learning Approach
The W&D approach combines linear and non-linear models together through feature crossing and dimensionality reduction. The key idea behind this approach is to learn low-dimensional representations of sparse features using a linear model, while simultaneously capturing high-level patterns in dense features using a deep neural network. Together, these components capture complex interactions between different types of input data, making them more robust than traditional collaborative filtering approaches. 

Specifically, given a set of users $U$, items $I$ and contextual features $\Theta(i)$ for each item $i$, the goal of W&D is to predict the relevance score $r_{ui}$ between any pair of users and items $(u, i)$. This prediction is computed by combining the predicted scores from both linear and non-linear models: 


$$\hat{r}_{ui} = f_w(\Theta_{i}, w^T h_{\theta}(x_u)), \quad x_u = [\overline{\Theta}(u), {\bf v}_u], \quad v_u = [v_1^{(u)},...,v_k^{(u)}], $$


where ${\bf v}_u$ represents all the binary indicator vectors indicating whether a user has interacted with a particular item during training time. Here, $h_{\theta}$ is the hidden layer function of the DNN, which takes the concatenation of the learned representation of user contextual features ${\bf \Theta}(u)$ and item features ${\mathcal X}_i$ as inputs. The vector $[v_1^{(u)},..., v_k^{(u)}]$ captures the latent preferences of the user towards various categories represented in the contextual features $\Theta(i)$; it is obtained by applying a categorical embedding layer to transform the discrete values into continuous ones. 

To train the model, we use a triplet loss function to encourage the similarity between positive examples ($r_{ui}=1$) and negative examples ($r_{ui}\neq 1$) within each batch. At test time, we only need to compute the dot product between the user representation and item representation using the learned weights and pass it through the sigmoid function to get the final relevance score.



Figure 1: Illustration of the W&D model architecture. Both linear and non-linear models contribute to predicting the relevance score between pairs of users and items. The resulting combined scores are passed through a sigmoid activation function to obtain the final relevance score. Each component involves either a linear or a non-linear transformation of the input data. The use of sigmoid activation ensures that the output lies between zero and one, and may also prevent overfitting due to vanishing gradients or extreme values.

## 2.2 Neural Factorization Machine (NFM) Algorithm
Neural factorization machines (NFMs) are another algorithm that combines nonlinear functions and matrix factorization methods to address the cold-start problem. NFMs build upon the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) found in computer vision, but extend them to handle arbitrary structured inputs like sequences of texts or images. In contrast to CNNs, NFs do not require image size information, allowing them to process variable length inputs. 

The NFM's main concept is to encode the sparse input features into fixed-size embeddings using an attention mechanism that allows each embedding to focus on specific parts of the input. These embeddings are then multiplied together using weight matrices to generate higher-order interactions, leading to improved accuracy compared to standard regression models.

For example, let us consider the following input sequence $S = {a_1, a_2,..., a_n}$, where each element $a_i$ corresponds to a word in a sentence. The NFM learns a set of embedding vectors $E = {e_1, e_2,..., e_m}$, where each $e_j$ encodes some aspect of the vocabulary and defines its own space. For instance, if there are k distinct words in the dataset, $e_1,..., e_k$ could correspond to individual words or groups of related words. The attention mechanism at each position selects the subset of relevant embeddings from $E$ to attend to the current position $i$. Based on these selected embeddings, the contribution of $a_i$ to the output is calculated using a weighted sum of corresponding embeddings in $E$. Since multiple positions can attend to the same embeddings, the NFM generates sparser interaction coefficients compared to traditional matrix factorization models like SVD++. 

Once the embeddings are generated, the output is produced by computing the dot product between the resulting embeddings and multiplying them by a weight matrix $V$. The final score is obtained by passing the result through an activation function, such as ReLU or softmax. During training, the objective is to minimize the mean squared error between the true ratings and the predicted rating using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. Similarly, during testing, the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error or area under the ROC curve. 

Overall, the NFM provides better flexibility and interpretability compared to standard regression models, especially for text or image datasets. Additionally, it can efficiently handle long sequential inputs without padding, improving efficiency compared to other deep learning approaches. Nevertheless, unlike W&D, the NFM does not directly leverage user/item interaction information and therefore cannot capture rich contextual relationships beyond the local neighborhood of each feature.

# 3.Wide and Deep Model Details
We now describe the details of the W&D and NFM algorithms in greater detail, starting with the wide and deep model.

### 3.1 Wide and Deep Model Architecture
#### Linear Component
The linear part of the W&D model consists of an embedding layer that maps the categorical features of each item into a dense vector space. The resulting embeddings are concatenated with the user features before being fed into a fully connected layer for prediction.

#### Nonlinear Component
The non-linear component of the W&D model uses a deep neural network (DNN) consisting of several layers including fully connected and dropout layers. The output of the last fully connected layer is passed through a sigmoid activation function to produce the final probability value. Dropout regularization helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training.

### 3.2 Categorical Embedding Layer
In order to represent the user preference across various dimensions such as category, subcategory, brand, price range, etc., the W&D model applies a categorical embedding layer to map the discrete values into continuous ones. The embedding layer is simply a dictionary containing vectors representing each possible value. During training, the model updates the weights of the embedding layer after every iteration to optimize the representation quality.

### 3.3 Triplet Loss Function
Triplet loss function is used to train the model in an unsupervised way. Given three sets of samples $\{(u_i, p_i, n_i)\}^N_{i=1}$ consisting of a user sample $u_i$, a positive item sample $p_i$ and a negative item sample $n_i$, the aim of the triplet loss function is to maximize the distance between the positive and negative examples while minimizing the distance between them from different user samples. Mathematically, the objective function is given by:

$$L=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[f(u_i, p_i)-f(u_i, n_i)+\alpha]\tag{1}$$

Where $f$ is the scoring function that outputs a scalar for a pair of user-item vectors, $\alpha$ is a margin parameter that controls the tradeoff between maximizing the difference between positive and negative examples and keeping them at a small distance, and $N$ is the number of training samples. The optimal parameters are determined by solving an optimization problem called alternating least squares (ALS).

### 3.4 Training Procedure
During training, the model processes batches of training data and updates the parameters of the embedding layer and DNN according to the triplet loss function described above. After every epoch, the validation data is processed to monitor the convergence of the model. If necessary, the hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, alpha, etc., can be adjusted accordingly until convergence.

### 3.5 Evaluation Metrics
Two commonly used evaluation metrics for ranking task are Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@K. MRR measures the percentage of times a randomly chosen positive example appears before a randomly chosen negative example. Hits@K measures the percentage of times the correct item occurs among the top K recommended items.

### 3.6 Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques are employed to prevent overfitting. Commonly used techniques include L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling. L1/L2 regularization adds penalty terms to the cost function that promote smaller weights in the model. Early stopping stops the training process once the validation performance starts degrading. Learning rate scheduling reduces the learning rate gradually during the course of training to avoid diverging or oscillating solutions.

### 3.7 Alternate Optimization Methods
Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method is used to optimize the parameters of the model. This method iteratively refines the embedding and DNN parameters by performing coordinate descent updates of the objective function defined above. By alternating the updating steps, the effect of updated parameters is propagated throughout the whole network, ensuring that the parameters converge to a global optimum. This technique avoids the need for explicit regularization terms and improves generalization ability of the model.

### 3.8 Collaborative Filtering vs. Content-based Recommendation
Both collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation can be used to make recommendations. With collaborative filtering, users' past behaviors are taken into account to recommend new items similar to those preferred by others. On the other hand, with content-based recommendation, new items are recommended based on the descriptions and attributes of existing items. Although collaborative filtering usually leads to better performance in practice, content-based recommendation tends to produce more personalized recommendations and can deal better with new trends.

However, because collaborative filtering explores user preferences and preferences tend to become outdated over time, content-based recommendation might lead to less accurate predictions in real world settings. Therefore, hybrid recommendation strategies that combine the strengths of both approaches can achieve significant improvements in performance.
