# 1.简介
  

Cluster analysis or clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that involves grouping similar data points together into clusters. The goal of any clustering algorithm is to discover how the data can be grouped in such a way as to minimize some measure of intra-cluster (i.e., within-group) variance while maximizing the inter-cluster variance (i.e., between-groups). The types of clustering algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and self-organizing maps (SOM). In this article, we will focus on four common clustering methods: k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and SOM. We will also provide corresponding R and Python code for each method to help readers understand their underlying mechanisms better.

Clustering is an essential technique in various fields including biology, marketing, finance, information retrieval, pattern recognition, and more. By applying appropriate clustering techniques to different datasets, researchers and analysts are able to identify patterns and relationships that exist in the data and gain insights into the phenomena they are interested in. 

This article assumes readers have some familiarity with basic statistics concepts such as mean, standard deviation, distance metrics, correlation coefficients, etc. However, it does not require advanced knowledge in these topics and provides clear explanations alongside illustrative examples.

In addition, this article is written for non-technical readers who may not be familiar with programming languages like R or Python. We will use simple language to describe the theory behind clustering algorithms and present working implementations using popular programming languages. Readers should have some prior experience in data analysis using spreadsheets or statistical packages such as Excel or SPSS.

By the end of this article, you should feel comfortable implementing clustering algorithms from scratch and knowing when to choose which algorithm based on your specific needs. You will also have gained valuable insights into other powerful machine learning techniques by understanding why certain clustering techniques work well under particular conditions. Good luck!

Let's get started!
# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before jumping into detailed technical descriptions, let’s first clarify some important terms used in clustering. 

**Data**: This refers to a set of objects that we want to group together according to some feature or attribute. For example, if we were clustering customer purchase histories based on demographics like age, gender, income level, education level, location, etc., our dataset would contain many customers' purchase history records. Each record might represent one transaction made by a single customer. If we wanted to cluster the transactions based on the items purchased, each record could contain details about all the products bought. 

**Object**: An individual item or observation in the dataset. For example, in a dataset of customer purchase histories, each object represents a unique customer's transaction. In another dataset of sales records, each object might correspond to a single sale transaction. 

**Feature/Attribute**: A measurable property or characteristic of an object. For example, in a dataset of customer purchase histories, features might include age, gender, income level, education level, location, etc. These attributes define what makes up a “customer” and allow us to cluster them based on shared characteristics. Attributes can either numerical or categorical depending on whether they take continuous values or discrete categories. In general, the fewer features we have, the easier it becomes to cluster our data effectively.

**Label**: The output generated by a clustering algorithm that assigns each object to one of several groups based on its similarity to other objects in the same cluster. Depending on the context, labels might refer to subsets of the original data or new observations created by the clustering process itself. For example, in a dataset of customer purchase histories, labels might indicate which customers fall into each cluster. 

**Cluster**: A subset of objects that are homogeneous with respect to a given attribute or combination of attributes. Clusters can be formed explicitly based on a predetermined number of centroids or derived implicitly through some form of aggregation or dimensionality reduction algorithm. For example, if we were clustering customer purchase histories based on the items they purchased, each cluster might consist of customers who tend to buy the same types of products, even though they didn't necessarily share any exact feature values or combinations thereof.

**Distance Metric**: A metric that measures the dissimilarity between two objects based on their attributes. Distance metrics typically assume symmetry and triangle inequality, meaning that the shortest path between two objects and their closest neighbor cannot be greater than their second-closest neighbors. Popular distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, and cosine similarity. Different distance metrics have varying properties, such as interpretability and computational efficiency, and selecting the most suitable metric for your problem requires careful consideration.

To summarize, here are the main clustering terms and definitions:

 - Data: Set of objects we want to group
 - Object: Individual entity or observation in the data
 - Feature/Attribute: Property or characteristic of an object that defines what makes up a "thing" and allows us to group things together
 - Label: Output produced by a clustering algorithm assigning each object to a label based on its similarity to other objects in the same cluster
 - Cluster: Subset of objects that share some common feature(s)/attribute(s)
 - Distance Metric: Measure of dissimilarity between two objects based on their attribute(s)
 
# 3.核心算法原理及其具体操作步骤和数学公式讲解
Now that we know the basics of clustering terminology, we can start diving deeper into the core algorithms themselves. Before we proceed further, I want to emphasize that there are multiple ways to implement clustering algorithms, so the approach shown below may vary slightly depending on the programming language or environment you are using.  

## K-Means Algorithm
K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that forms k clusters by iteratively placing samples in nearest centroids until convergence. It has two primary steps:

1. **Initialization**: Choose k initial cluster centers randomly from the input space. 
2. **Assignment**: Assign each point to the nearest cluster center.
3. **Update**: Recalculate the position of the cluster centers to be the mean of all the points assigned to it. Repeat until convergence.

The final result is a partition of the data into k clusters, where each object belongs to exactly one cluster. 

### Mathematical Formulation

We can write down the mathematical formulation of K-Means in terms of vectors, matrices, and scalar variables:

Input: $X = \{x_1, x_2,..., x_n\}$ consisting of n d-dimensional data points

Output: Partition $\{C_1, C_2,..., C_k\}$ of X into $k$ sets of points $(x^c_1, x^c_2,..., x^c_m)$, where $|C_j|$ is the number of points in cluster j and $m= \sum_{j=1}^{k}|C_j|$ is the total number of elements in X.

Initialize parameters: Centroids $(C_1, C_2,..., C_k)$

Repeat {
    Assignment step: assign each element $x_i$ to the nearest cluster center $(C_j)$, i.e., $C_{ij} = argmin_{k}(||x_i-\mu_k||)$

    Update step: update the cluster centers by computing the means of the assigned points, i.e., $\mu_k = \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{x^c_l \in C_k} x^c_l$. 
} until convergence.

Where $|\cdot|$ denotes the cardinality (size) of a set and $\mu_k$ denotes the centroid of the $k$-th cluster. 

### Practical Notes

K-Means has several practical advantages compared to other clustering algorithms: 

1. Fast computation time: K-Means only requires relatively simple vector arithmetic operations and matrix multiplications, making it very efficient for large datasets.  
2. Interpretable results: K-Means produces interpretable clusters because it uses an intuitive notion of “closeness”. Clusters are defined by their centroids, which capture the “meaningful” parts of the data and make it easy to interpret what kind of data each cluster contains.  
3. Robustness: K-Means works well with highly varied data due to its speed and robustness to noisy inputs. It often converges faster and more accurately than other algorithms and can handle outliers without much difficulty.  
4. Scalability: Because K-Means only computes pairwise distances between objects and updates cluster centroid positions independently, it can scale well to massive datasets. 

However, K-Means has drawbacks as well:

1. Choosing k: One major issue with K-Means is choosing the correct value of k, which can significantly affect performance. There are several heuristic approaches to select k, such as elbow method and silhouette coefficient, but these rely on good initialization procedures or overly simplistic assumptions. Other alternatives include mini-batch K-Means or kernelized K-Means, both of which improve scalability at the cost of accuracy.  
2. Overfitting: Another potential issue with K-Means is overfitting, which occurs when the model memorizes specific training instances instead of capturing true structure in the data. To prevent overfitting, regularization techniques like L2 regularization or ridge regression can be applied, although they may reduce model flexibility and introduce bias.  
3. Selection of Features: Finally, K-Means relies heavily on meaningful features for successful clustering, which may not always be available or feasible. Nonetheless, tools like PCA or t-SNE can be helpful in transforming high-dimensional data into low-dimensional embeddings that can serve as effective features for clustering.   


## Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm
Hierarchical clustering is another commonly used clustering algorithm that operates recursively, starting with each object being placed in its own separate cluster. At each step, the algorithm merges pairs of adjacent clusters into a single larger cluster, continuing until all objects belong to a single large cluster. The merging criterion is determined by a linkage function that compares the proximity of objects in the merged clusters. Common linkage functions include average linkage, complete linkage, maximum linkage, and median linkage.

Similar to K-Means, hierarchical clustering has several benefits:

1. Easy interpretation: Since hierarchical clustering generates a tree-like hierarchy of clusters, it is easy to interpret and visualize the resulting clusters.  
2. Flexible choice of linkage function: Unlike K-Means, hierarchical clustering gives users control over the criteria used to determine which clusters to merge during each iteration. This enables the algorithm to adaptively produce clusters that best match the data distribution and application requirements.  
3. Automatic selection of k: Like K-Means, hierarchical clustering can automatically find the optimal number of clusters by analyzing the resulting dendrogram or branching factor.  
4. Preserves fine-grained structure: While K-Means focuses on finding broad clusters of similar objects, hierarchical clustering preserves the full structure of the data by separating objects into distinct branches whose extent depends on the strength of the associated links.  
  
However, hierarchical clustering also has some drawbacks:

1. Computationally expensive: Unlike K-Means, hierarchical clustering must compute pairwise distances between every pair of objects at every step, leading to significant computational overhead for large datasets.  
2. Requires tuning of linkage parameter: As mentioned earlier, the merging criterion determines how closely related clusters are merged during each recursive iteration. Incorrect choices can lead to poor clustering quality, especially when the linkage function fails to reflect the actual relationship between the data points.  
3. May ignore small clusters: Because the hierarchy is constructed recursively, small clusters may be lost after merging, rendering them difficult or impossible to recover.  

Overall, while hierarchical clustering has been widely used in scientific literature and industry, K-Means remains popular and more effective for smaller datasets and simpler cluster shapes.
