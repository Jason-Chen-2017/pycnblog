Supply chain management (SCM) is the process of planning and coordinating activities in a business enterprise to ensure that products are safely delivered from suppliers to customers within specified time frames and with acceptable quality levels. The key challenges in SCM include demand forecasting, inventory management, transportation management, risk assessment, human resources allocation, service level agreements (SLAs), pricing optimization, customer behavior analysis, etc. Despite several advancements in technologies and research, the traditional approaches based on mathematical optimization algorithms such as linear programming or integer programming have been limited by their inability to handle large-scale real-world problems due to the complexity and non-convexity of modern supply chains. To address these limitations, unsupervised learning techniques were proposed to automate some critical decision making processes during SCM. In this article, we will explore one particular type of unsupervised machine learning approach called clustering for optimizing supply chain management. 

Clustering is a popular technique used in many fields including computer science, biology, and economics. It involves grouping similar data points into clusters so that they can be analyzed more easily. Similarly, in the context of supply chain management, it aims at finding patterns and relationships among different parts of an organization's operations and resources, allowing organizations to make better decisions about where to allocate resources, when to change them, and how much to spend on each task. Clustering can provide insights into opportunities and threats, identify emerging trends and market segments, predict future demand, improve resource utilization, optimize shipping costs, manage inventory risks, etc., leading to significant improvements in efficiency and profitability.

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning approach called "model-based clustering" to optimize supply chain management. Model-based clustering combines two key ideas: first, it uses historical data to build statistical models that describe the underlying relationship between various variables; second, it applies a Bayesian inference methodology to estimate the probability distributions of unknown variables given the observed data, thus enabling us to generate plausible scenarios that satisfy certain constraints. Based on our study, we demonstrate that model-based clustering outperforms conventional supervised learning methods, especially when applied to complex real-world supply chain management problems. Moreover, we also showcase the effectiveness of using probabilistic modeling techniques to capture uncertainty and trade-offs across multiple objectives, which can help organizations balance between competing priorities and achieve optimum performance under uncertain conditions. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and applications of this work towards addressing other important aspects of supply chain management, such as supplier selection and routing, inter-organizational collaboration, and value-chain redesign.

## 2.1 非监督学习（Unsupervised Learning）
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that analyzes data without being provided any labeled training examples. Instead, the algorithm learns the structure of the input data itself by detecting common patterns and correlations. The goal of unsupervised learning is to learn “hidden” structures in the data, which may not always be obvious, and then use those learned characteristics to make predictions or classifications. Common tasks performed by unsupervised learning algorithms include cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. 

In contrast to supervised learning, there is no prescribed output variable associated with the inputs, and hence the focus is on identifying meaningful patterns in the data instead of predicting outcomes. Unlike deep learning, unsupervised learning has fewer layers, requiring less computational power and memory space. However, unsupervised learning can still perform well in certain situations, particularly when the available data is incomplete or highly skewed. One example is natural language processing, where unsupervised learning can group documents together according to shared topics or sentiment.

## 2.2 模型驱动聚类（Model-Based Clustering）
Model-based clustering is an unsupervised learning method that combines historical data with statistical models to generate plausible scenarios that satisfy certain constraints. Specifically, the approach involves building statistical models that describe the underlying relationship between various variables, applying a Bayesian inference methodology to estimate the probability distributions of unknown variables given the observed data, and generating new instances of the problem that match the estimated distributions. 

The basic idea behind model-based clustering is to leverage existing domain knowledge and experience in the form of historical data to develop statistical models that capture the variability and correlation patterns among various operational parameters, such as stock levels, demand, production rates, shipment schedules, cost factors, and skill sets. These models can then be used to automatically generate plausible scenarios that satisfy certain constraints, such as minimizing total costs while meeting delivery dates or satisfying specific service level requirements. By incorporating both historical data and domain expertise, model-based clustering can significantly outperform conventional supervised learning methods, especially when dealing with complex real-world supply chain management problems.

## 2.3 目标函数（Objective Function）
An objective function is a measure of the performance of the system under consideration. In the case of model-based clustering, the main objective functions typically involve balancing exploration versus exploitation, ensuring diversity among the generated scenarios, and achieving optimal trade-off among multiple objectives. For instance, the overall objective could consist of minimizing the average travel distance, maximizing safety margins, and meeting predefined service levels, all at once. Another commonly cited objective function is to minimize the expected number of disruptions caused by unexpected events or adverse weather conditions, which requires considering the impact of multiple variables on system reliability. Therefore, the choice of objective function depends on the specific application and goals of the SCM problem.

## 2.4 隐变量（Latent Variable）
A latent variable is a random variable whose true nature is not known but can be inferred from its observations. Among the most widely used types of latent variables in SCM, we find supply chain flow, inventory levels, and the movement of goods over long distances. Latent variables play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of the supply chain, because they reveal information about the constraints and dependencies involved in moving goods throughout the network. As a result, the choice of the appropriate set of latent variables should depend on the relevant features of the SCM problem.

## 3.1 概览
In order to apply the model-based clustering approach to optimize SCM, we need to follow three main steps:

1. Data Preparation
2. Statistical Modeling
3. Scenario Generation

Here’s a high-level overview of the workflow:



We start by cleaning and preprocessing the data. We remove irrelevant features, normalize numerical values, and transform categorical variables into numerical ones if necessary. Then, we split the dataset into train and test subsets. Next, we employ statistical modeling to fit the selected statistical distribution to the historical data. This step involves selecting suitable statistical distributions, determining appropriate hyperparameters, and estimating the parameter values using maximum likelihood estimation. Afterward, we validate the accuracy of the obtained model by comparing its predicted values with the actual values. If the validation results indicate that the model performs poorly, we refine the model until we reach the desired level of accuracy. Once the model is ready, we proceed to scenario generation.

Scenario generation involves generating candidate solutions to the optimization problem through simulation. In each iteration, we randomly sample initial states for the system from the possible scenarios that satisfy the constraints imposed by the business engineers. We then simulate the evolution of the system over time by iteratively updating the state of each component according to the physical laws and the model of the system. Eventually, we evaluate the fitness of each candidate solution based on the defined objective function and select the best performing solutions to move forward in the search process.

Finally, we return to the original optimization problem to choose the final configuration that satisfies all the constraints and meets the objective function criteria.

## 3.2 数据准备（Data Preparation）
Before proceeding to statistical modeling, we need to clean and preprocess the historical data. Typically, we want to eliminate duplicate entries, missing values, and outliers before applying any statistical techniques. Here are some common preprocessing steps:

- Handling Missing Values

    First, we need to identify and replace missing values with appropriate estimates. A simple way to do this is to simply drop rows containing missing values altogether. Alternatively, we can fill in the missing values using interpolation methods such as linear regression or nearest neighbor.
    
    
- Handling Outliers
    
    Detecting outliers is another common preprocessing step. We can use standard deviation, variance, minimum and maximum quartiles, and IQR (interquartile range) to identify outliers. Then, we can either discard them or substitute them with extreme values. 
    
    
- Transforming Categorical Variables
    Some machine learning algorithms cannot directly handle categorical variables, so we need to encode them into numerical representations. There are several ways to encode categorical variables, such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and ordinal encoding. One hot encoding assigns binary values to each category, whereas label encoding assigns numeric values to categories based on alphabetical order. Ordinal encoding replaces labels with numbers according to their order. 


After completing the data preparation stage, we are left with a cleaned and transformed dataset that we can use for statistical modeling.

## 3.3 统计模型构建（Statistical Modeling）
Once we have prepared the dataset, we can begin constructing statistical models. Typically, we assume that the system evolves as a Markov process, meaning that the current state depends only on its immediate neighbors and the history of the system up to that point. Thus, we represent the system as a stochastic transition matrix, i.e., a square matrix where entry $(i,j)$ represents the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$. Given the historical data, we can estimate the transition probabilities using maximum likelihood estimation.

To avoid overfitting, we often limit the degree of freedom of the model. That is, we constrain the size of the transition matrix so that it captures the essence of the system rather than capturing noise or redundant details. One common approach is to regularize the L1 norm or the L2 norm of the transition matrix, which penalizes large deviations from the identity matrix. Another approach is to add additional variables that control for the effects of individual components.

Next, we consider the control variables that allow us to adjust the relative importance of different components in the system. In practice, we typically assume that certain components have higher importance than others. For example, we might prioritize bringing inventory closer to the planned demand schedule, which would require greater attention to inventory management. To reflect this intuition, we introduce additional variables that determine the contribution of each component to the overall state of the system. We call these control variables state indicators. 

Lastly, we combine the transition matrix and the state indicators to obtain the full joint distribution of the system. Since the dimensions of the joint distribution grows exponentially with the number of states, we usually truncate the distribution after observing a few samples, obtaining a discrete approximation of the continuous joint distribution. We further reduce the dimensionality of the joint distribution by using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA allows us to summarize the joint distribution into a smaller set of basis vectors, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the problem. Using truncated PCA, we can represent the joint distribution compactly in a small number of dimensions, facilitating efficient computation and visualization.

Overall, the statistical modeling step involves designing a flexible model that captures the essential features of the SCM problem. The resulting joint distribution can be represented in a low-dimensional space that makes it easy to visualize and analyze, making the modeling process tractable even for large datasets.

## 3.4 生成场景（Scenario Generation）
Once we have built the statistical model, we can proceed to scenario generation. Scenarios are candidates to solve the optimization problem, and they can be generated using Monte Carlo simulations. Each scenario corresponds to a particular starting point for the system and describes the state of every component at that point in time. Our strategy is to iterate through numerous starting points and simulate the evolution of the system over time using the statistical model, gradually converging on the optimal solution. During each iteration, we draw random initial states for the system, update the state of each component based on the physical laws and the model of the system, and record the changes in the system state over time. At the end of each iteration, we evaluate the fitness of each candidate solution based on the defined objective function and select the best performing solutions to move forward in the search process.

One common approach to evaluating the fitness of a scenario is to compute the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values of the controlled quantities in the system state. We can also take into account the trade-offs between different objectives by adding additional penalty terms to the error term. Additionally, we can simulate different failure modes, such as adverse weather conditions, cyberattacks, and natural disasters, and accumulate damages experienced by the system over time. By taking into account these failures, we can indirectly reward scenarios that meet the user-defined SLAs and minimize the overall cost of ownership.

When we finish scenario generation, we return to the original optimization problem to choose the final configuration that satisfies all the constraints and meets the objective function criteria.
