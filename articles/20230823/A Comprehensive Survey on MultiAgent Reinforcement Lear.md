# 1.简介
  

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a research area that seeks to develop intelligent agents capable of cooperating in complex environments with multiple independent decision makers and learn from their interactions. The MARL literature has experienced tremendous growth over the past years due to its impactful applications in areas such as robotics, transportation systems, and emergency management. This survey article highlights the most significant advancements in this field by organizing them into five main categories: cooperation mechanisms, communication protocols, training objectives, exploration strategies, and evaluation metrics.

In general, multi-agent reinforcement learning can be classified into two subcategories based on whether they share or separate policies: centralized and decentralized. Centralized approaches involve a single policy controlling all agents, whereas decentralized approaches distribute responsibility among different policies. Decentralization techniques include actor-critic methods, Q-learning variants, and model-based algorithms.

Another important dimension to consider when designing an MARL algorithm is the ability to adapt to changing environments and contexts, which may require special handling or redesign. Dynamic programming and value iteration are common ways to handle such situations. Other dimensions include training time, computational resources required, and the tradeoff between sample efficiency and agent diversity. 

Finally, it is important to note that some advanced MARL techniques have achieved breakthrough results in challenging domains where traditional RL algorithms fail or fall short. These techniques often leverage techniques from deep reinforcement learning, representation learning, and meta-learning. In conclusion, there is still much room for research in this exciting new field and there is no one-size-fits-all solution for solving complex real-world problems using MARL. 


# 2.Background Introduction
Multi-agent reinforcement learning is defined as an area of machine learning and artificial intelligence concerned with developing autonomous agents able to interact with other agents within a shared environment and learn through interaction. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms treat each agent independently but sharing experience and information allows these agents to collaborate effectively towards achieving goals. However, several challenges exist in applying MARL to real-world scenarios, including adapting quickly to changes in dynamics and context, ensuring safety and security, coordination across multiple agents, and dealing with stochastic and uncertain agents’ behavior. To address these challenges, various solutions have been proposed, ranging from simplistic optimization methods to more sophisticated models trained end-to-end with a combination of neural networks and domain knowledge. Additionally, existing work typically focuses on a single type of agent, making it difficult to transfer learned skills to new tasks or environments. Finally, practical implementations of multi-agent systems are limited by scalability and system complexity. 

This survey presents an overview of current research progress in MARL, providing an up-to-date review of relevant algorithms, theory, and methodologies. It also provides insight into potential directions for future research and identifies gaps that need further investigation. Overall, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive guide to MARL and enable practitioners and researchers to choose appropriate tools for addressing specific requirements in their own projects.


# 3.Basic Concepts and Terminology
The following concepts and terminology are used throughout the rest of this survey:

1. **Environment**: An environment consists of objects or entities interacting with the agent(s). Examples include a virtual world like Minecraft, a game like Go or Chess, or a physical environment like a factory floor.
2. **Agent**: An agent is anything that acts in the environment and takes actions to maximize its reward signal. Agents can take any number of actions at each step and receive rewards based on the outcome of those actions. Some examples include a player character in video games, a self-driving car, or a remote control drone.
3. **Action space**: The set of possible actions that an agent can take. For example, in chess, the action space includes playing any available move. In Atari games, the action space includes moving left, right, up, down, or doing nothing. 
4. **Observation space**: The set of observable properties about the state of the environment. For instance, in a grid-world environment, the observation space might consist of the position of all walls, doors, and blocks, along with the agent's location and direction.
5. **Policy**: A function that maps observations to probabilities of selecting different actions. In simple cases, a policy could simply specify what probability each action should be taken under certain circumstances. More complex policies would incorporate prior beliefs, preferences, or implicit constraints. Commonly used policies include random selection, epsilon-greedy, softmax, and linear Q-policies.
6. **Reward function**: A function that evaluates the agent's performance during an episode. It takes into account both immediate and long-term goals, such as collecting coins while avoiding obstacles. Reward functions commonly use positive and negative rewards for good and bad behaviors.
7. **Value function**: A function that estimates the expected return obtained by taking a given action in a particular state. Value functions are closely related to quality measures such as the utility of an item or the satisfaction of a service provided to the customer. They play a crucial role in determining how the agent selects actions, as well as in guiding exploration decisions. One way to estimate values is to simulate the effect of taking each action and keeping track of the total return until termination. Alternatively, we can directly optimize for the value of each state using reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning or actor-critic methods.
8. **Dynamics model**: A model of the underlying process that generates the next state based on the previous state and the chosen action. Dynamics models help us understand the relationship between states and rewards, allowing us to plan better routes, prevent cycling, and improve our understanding of the environment.
9. **Exploration strategy**: A mechanism for encouraging the agent to explore unknown parts of the state space and discover new strategies. Exploration strategies can be based on randomly sampling from the action space, adding noise to the actions, or modeling the distribution of outcomes conditioned on the state. Epsilon-greedy, UCB, Thompson Sampling, and Bayesian bandits are popular exploration strategies used in practice.
10. **Cooperation mechanism**: A mechanism for creating joint decision-making between multiple agents. Cooperation mechanisms allow multiple agents to coordinate their actions so that they can achieve common goals together. Three types of cooperation mechanisms are centralized, decentralized, and mixed. Centralized mechanisms involve a single agent responsible for deciding actions, whereas decentralized mechanisms involve agents with separate policies acting independently without awareness of others' actions. Decentralization can be implemented using intrinsic motivation or extrinsic rewards, where agents seek to maximize their own individual reward signal while contributing to the collective goal. Mixtures of centralized and decentralized agents can create flexible and robust cooperative behaviors.
11. **Communication protocol**: A mechanism for exchanging information between agents. This enables the agents to coordinate their actions and generate more effective solutions than if they were operating in isolation. There are three basic communication protocols - broadcast, decentralized critic, and consensus protocols. Broadcast protocols transmit messages to all neighbors every timestep, whereas decentralized critic protocols maintain separate local copies of the other agents' actions and selectively update their internal models based on feedback received from neighbors. Consensus protocols rely on agreement among neighboring agents before updating their models, leading to higher stability and convergence rates.

Overall, the key challenges faced by multi-agent reinforcement learning include ensuring safety and security, adapting quickly to changes in dynamics and context, managing conflicts between competing actors, and dealing with unpredictable and non-stationary behavior. Several advancement technologies have been developed to address these issues, from improved exploration methods to model-based planning techniques. However, most works remain underexplored, requiring careful consideration of fundamental principles and parameters to guarantee competitive performance in challenging environments.
