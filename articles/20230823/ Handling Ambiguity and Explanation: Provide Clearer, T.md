# 1.简介
  

通过文本生成，AI模型可以自动生成适当长度的文本，并且能够通过文本生成引擎帮助人们进行更高质量的对话。然而，即使在最好的情况下，生成的文本也可能会存在一些不易发现的问题。例如，生成的文本可能过于模糊、含糊不清或难以理解，甚至会导致出现令人困惑的错误。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了一种方法——反应式简洁通顺的语句生成算法，基于“结构化抽象”的方法。该算法同时考虑文本的生成、理解和归纳总结，同时避免了因词不达意而产生的误导性描述。

## 2.1 Text Generation (文字生成)
Text generation is the task of generating natural language text that conveys a specific set of meanings or intentions based on given input texts. It can be used for several applications such as chatbots, article writing, marketing copywriting, social media posts, etc., among others. The major components of text generation systems are the sequence-to-sequence models, which map sequences of words to their corresponding probability distributions, and the decoding algorithms, which use these distributions to generate a sequence of words. There are many approaches available for text generation using deep learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, GPT-3, etc.
## 2.2 Natural Language Processing (自然语言处理)
Natural language processing refers to a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers to understand, analyze, and manipulate human language in ways that they would not be able to otherwise do. NLP tasks include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modeling, and question answering. Some common methods used in NLP involve rule-based approach, statistical machine learning, and neural network-based approaches. In recent years, advances in NLP have led to significant improvements in various areas including speech recognition, translation, and summarization.
## 2.3 Structured Abstraction (结构抽象)
Structured abstraction is a method of representing complex ideas in terms of simpler concepts that are easier to reason about. Structured abstractions make it possible to create higher level concepts by combining multiple simpler ones into more complex structures with clear relationships between them. This makes it easier to perform deeper reasoning and gain insights from large amounts of data. For example, we could represent the concept "mountain range" as consisting of smaller parts such as mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, etc. Similarly, we can abstract away the details of how cities are organized, so that we only need to focus on the relationship between different regions within the city.

In structured abstraction, we define a hierarchy of concepts, where each concept represents some level of complexity in the real world. We start at the top of the hierarchy, and work our way down to lower levels. At each level, we identify the basic building blocks that underlie all the concepts below it. These building blocks will eventually form the basis of our final abstractions. Each level contains both high-level and low-level abstractions, allowing us to capture aspects of the real world at varying levels of detail. By defining a unified framework for creating abstractions, we can make it easier to develop new concepts and apply existing knowledge to new situations.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for structured abstraction, called Reactive Clean Shorthand (RCS), that generates descriptive statements that are concise yet precise. RCS works by decomposing larger sentences into their component elements and then recombining them according to a predefined grammar. The goal of RCS is to produce clear and fluent explanations that provide essential information without going overboard with unnecessary jargon or idioms.

The main idea behind RCS is to break down complex sentences into small parts, which can be explained individually. We call these parts reactive fragments, because they reflect the underlying logic of the sentence rather than being fixed syntactic units like adjectives or verbs. We also introduce a lightweight notation system that allows users to specify the roles of each fragment, making it easy to communicate what each element means without relying on context clues or extra descriptions. Finally, we use clustering algorithms to automatically group similar fragments together and assign labels to describe groups that can be combined into bigger abstractions. With this process, RCS produces highly informative, straightforward explanations that follow a consistent style guide.
