Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are widely used for semantic segmentation tasks. In this article, we will discuss the basic concepts of FCNs, as well as its implementation in TensorFlow 2 using Keras API. We will also provide examples to show how to train an FCN model on various datasets such as Pascal VOC and Cityscapes. Finally, we will briefly mention some limitations and future research directions. The reader is assumed to have knowledge of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, as well as object detection and image segmentation techniques. 

In order to provide a clear understanding, let us first understand what is semantic segmentation? Semantic segmentation refers to the task of assigning labels to each pixel in an input image based on their visual characteristics, i.e., not just the color but other features present in the image like edges, textures, etc. This enables machine learning models to learn and recognize objects from images with different appearances. It has applications in self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging analysis, surveillance systems, and many more.

Therefore, the goal of our work is to build an FCN model that can perform semantic segmentation on various datasets with high accuracy and efficiency. For instance, we will use the PASCAL VOC dataset which consists of 20 categories of object instances. Our FCN model should be able to accurately segment all these object instances without any false positives or negatives. Similarly, we will use the Cityscapes dataset which contains over 500 object classes.

Now, let’s get started! Let's start by discussing the fundamental building blocks of an FCN - convolutional layers and pooling layers. Then, we will implement an example code in TensorFlow 2 using Keras API to demonstrate how to train an FCN model on Pascal VOC dataset and evaluate it on the test set. Afterwards, we will talk about potential limitations of the current approach and suggest future research directions. Here are the main sections:

# 2. Fundamentals
A fully convolutional network (FCN) takes advantage of the properties of convolutional neural networks to perform dense prediction tasks on larger spatial regions than standard CNNs. It does this by replacing the fully connected layers at the end of traditional CNN architectures with appropriate upsampling operations. Specifically, instead of predicting class probabilities for each location using global average pooling or max pooling, FCNs directly output predictions for each pixel in the input image, giving rise to a full resolution map of semantic information. Upsampling is performed using interpolation or learned deconvolutional filters.

The key idea behind FCNs is to apply skip connections between consecutive convolutional layers in the network architecture, allowing them to transfer contextual information from one layer to the next. This means that the final result does not rely solely on individual local features, but rather combines rich spatially consistent representations across multiple pixels. Therefore, FCNs require significantly fewer parameters than traditional CNNs because they share weights among neighboring pixels.

## **Convolutional Layers**
CNNs consist of several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, whose functions are explained below:

1. Convolutional Layer: A convolutional layer applies a filter or kernel to the input image and produces feature maps, which are essentially a collection of filtered images produced by sliding the kernel over the input image. Each feature map typically corresponds to a specific feature type or concept that may exist within the image, such as edges, corners, or textures. The size of the filter defines the receptive field of the convolutional unit and controls the degree of spatial granularity of the features extracted. 

2. Activation Function: An activation function is applied after each convolutional layer to introduce non-linearity into the model. Popular choices include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), LeakyReLU, tanh, sigmoid, softmax, and ELU (Exponential Linear Units). The choice of activation function affects the performance of the model and hence is crucial to achieving good results.

3. Pooling Layer: Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps generated by the previous convolutional layers. They do so by progressively reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, resulting in smaller feature maps compared to the original input image. There are two types of pooling layers commonly used in CNNs – Max Pooling and Average Pooling. These layers extract maximum values or average values from small regions of the feature maps to produce a single value per feature map. Max pooling captures both spatial relationships and maximum intensity values while averaging discards spatial information. Common pooling sizes range from 2x2 to 7x7.

## **Upscaling Operations**
An FCN uses transposed convolutional layers to increase the spatial dimensions of the predicted outputs. Transposed convolutional layers combine the benefits of convolutional layers with those of deconvolutional layers, which are widely used in computer vision. Deconvolutional layers are essentially upsampling layers, where a kernel is convolved with the output of a previous layer to recover lost information. On the other hand, transposed convolutional layers reverse the process by producing a new tensor by flipping the filters of normal convolutional layers along certain axes. 

Transposed convolutional layers can be used to obtain the same size or larger output as the corresponding input by padding zeros around the borders, depending on the selected mode of operation. The combination of convolutional layers and transposed convolutional layers allows FCNs to propagate contextual information throughout the entire network and capture multi-scale features. As a result, FCNs can achieve very high accuracy on complex data sets such as natural scenes and videos.

However, there are tradeoffs associated with using transposed convolutional layers in place of upsampling layers. Firstly, large amounts of memory are required to store the intermediate activations produced by these layers during training. Secondly, the gradients computed by backpropagation tend to vanish or explode if the loss function becomes highly non-convex due to repeated downsampling and upsampling operations. Thirdly, it is computationally intensive to compute the backward pass through transposed convolutional layers, especially when the depth of the network increases. To address these issues, modern FCNs often employ a combination of convolutional and bilinear upsampling layers.

## **Example Architecture**
Here is an illustration of an example architecture for performing semantic segmentation using an FCN:
