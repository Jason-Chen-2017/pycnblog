Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a type of probabilistic dimensionality reduction technique that aims at capturing the underlying structure in high-dimensional data and generating low-dimensional representations with meaningful information loss. It has been shown to perform better than standard PCA on certain tasks such as image compression, speech recognition, and bioinformatics analysis. In this article, we will explain PPCA from a practical perspective by implementing it in Python using scikit-learn library. We will also discuss its advantages over other types of dimensionality reduction techniques like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). 

In general, most machine learning algorithms use principal component analysis (PCA) to extract features from high dimensional data into lower dimensions. However, standard PCA assumes all variables are independent while ignoring any dependencies between them. This leads to loss of important information due to correlations between different variables. On the other hand, PPCA models these relationships explicitly as distributions, which allows for more accurate feature extraction. Additionally, PPCA can handle missing values or outliers without significantly impacting the results. Finally, PPCA provides confidence intervals for estimated parameters that can be useful in various applications such as model selection and anomaly detection.

2.PPCA Algorithm: The PPCA algorithm involves modeling the data distribution in each variable separately using multivariate normal distributions (MNDs), and then combining these MNDs to estimate the joint probability density function (PDF) of the full dataset. Here's how the algorithm works: 

1. Data pre-processing: Remove any missing or categorical variables if they exist and normalize the data so that each variable contributes approximately equally to the variance in the data. 

2. Model training phase: For each variable, fit an MND to the corresponding column of the normalized data. The mean vector and covariance matrix of each MND correspond to the maximum likelihood estimates of those parameters given the observed data points. 

3. Combination phase: Combine the individual MNDs to obtain the joint PDF of the entire dataset. This involves computing their product alongside appropriate normalization factors based on the amount of uncertainty in the individual components. 

4. Feature extraction: Compute the marginal distributions of each variable and multiply them together along with their respective uncertainties to obtain the final representation of the input data.

5. Prediction and evaluation: Use the learned transformation matrix to transform new data into the reduced space and evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve, etc.

In practice, PPCA requires iterative optimization to find good initial estimates of the MND parameters and update them until convergence. There are several optimization methods available such as Gradient Descent, Variational Inference, Expectation Maximization, and EM Algorithm. The choice of optimization method depends on the specific problem at hand and the size of the dataset. 

The key advantage of PPCA over LDA is that it captures non-linear relationships between the variables in addition to linear ones. LDA only considers the directions of maximal variations between classes but ignores any higher order interactions between variables. Thus, PPCA can capture complex relationships among multiple variables that may not be captured by traditional PCA.

3.Python Code Implementation: To implement PPCA in Python, we first need to install the required libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn. Once installed, let's load some sample data and preprocess it.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal
np.random.seed(0)

# Load sample data
data = pd.read_csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/'
                  'iris/iris.data', header=None)
y = data.iloc[0:100, 4].values
y = np.where(y == 'Iris-setosa', -1, 1)
X = data.iloc[0:100, [0, 2]].values

# Standardize the data
X = (X - X.mean(axis=0)) / X.std(axis=0)

# Split the data into train and test sets
split = 50
X_train, y_train = X[:split], y[:split]
X_test, y_test = X[split:], y[split:]
```

Next, we can define our custom implementation of PPCA by following the steps outlined above. 

```python
class CustomPCAPCA:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.components = None
        
    def fit(self, X, num_comp=2):
        
        # Initialize mean vectors and covariances
        n_samples, n_features = X.shape
        self.mu = np.zeros((n_features,))
        self.sigma = np.zeros((n_features, n_features))
        
        # Iterate through columns of X to compute mean and cov matrices
        for j in range(n_features):
            xj = X[:, j]
            
            mu_j = np.mean(xj)
            sigma_j = np.cov(xj) + 0.0001 * np.eye(len(xj))
            
            self.mu[j] = mu_j
            self.sigma[j, :] = sigma_j
            
        # Estimate best rank k via eigenvalue decomposition
        eigval, eigvec = np.linalg.eig(np.dot(self.sigma.T, self.sigma))
        idx = eigval.argsort()[::-1][:num_comp]
        self.components = eigvec[:, idx]
        
    def transform(self, X):
        return np.dot(X - self.mu, self.components.T)
    
model = CustomPCAPCA()
model.fit(X_train)
X_pca = model.transform(X_train)
```

We have implemented PPCA using an MLE approach where we directly estimate the parameters of the Gaussian distributions associated with each feature. We iterate through the columns of X, calculate the means and variances of the corresponding Gaussians, and then combine the resulting estimators to obtain the joint distribution of the data set. We can visualize the transformed data by plotting the projection onto the two largest eigenvectors obtained after fitting the model. 

```python
plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], c=y_train)
plt.xlabel("First PC")
plt.ylabel("Second PC")
plt.show()
```

Finally, we can predict the labels of the test set using our trained model and evaluate its performance using various metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, AUC, and ROC curves.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report, roc_curve, auc

pred_prob = model.transform(X_test)
pred_labels = np.sign(pred_prob.dot(np.array([[-1],[1]])))

accuracy = sum(pred_labels==y_test)/len(y_test)
confusion = confusion_matrix(y_test, pred_labels)
precision = precision_score(y_test, pred_labels)
recall = recall_score(y_test, pred_labels)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, pred_labels)
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, pred_prob.ravel())
auc_score = auc(fpr, tpr)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1 Score:", f1)
print("AUC Score:", auc_score)
print("ROC Curve:")
plt.plot(fpr, tpr)
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], '--')
plt.xlim([-0.05, 1.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)')
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()

print(classification_report(y_test, pred_labels))
```

This completes the tutorial on understanding and implementing PPCA in Python using scikit-learn.
