In May of this year, the AI language model “BERT” has been released as an open-source software package for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, bringing with it unprecedented advancements in performance on a wide range of NLP problems. Moreover, such large language models can now be trained effectively using high-performance computing clusters and cloud services provided by modern big data companies like Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This new training pipeline is designed to strengthen the skills of medical researchers who are developing novel machine learning algorithms or working with existing ones, which involve working with massive amounts of textual data. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the latest initiatives made by Google to improve the training pipeline for medical experts in precision medicine research and development. Specifically, we will discuss: 

1. How BERT was developed and why it performed so well? 
2. What is meant by “reproducibility and reliability” for building trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that handle real world healthcare data? 
3. How GCP’s High Performance Clusters were used to train BERT at scale while also ensuring reproducibility and reliability? 
4. How these practices have helped improve the overall quality of medical AI research and development, and how they may help other medical fields as well?

# 2.背景介绍
Medical expertise plays a crucial role in improving patient care and outcomes, yet achieving the highest levels of accuracy remains elusive for many clinical specialties due to the complexities involved in diagnosing, treating, and managing illness. Accurate diagnoses require accurate treatment plans and effective therapy approaches based on evidence from medical literature and empirical evidence gathered through clinical trials. Despite improved advances in technology, however, it still takes significant resources and time to develop predictive models that accurately identify diseases and suggest optimal treatments for patients. To address this issue, numerous organizations have started investing heavily in precision medicine research, including genomics, radiology, imaging, and oncology. One area where there is clear need for advanced AI technologies is in precision medicine research and development. 

Medical experts often use complex statistical techniques and numerical simulations to simulate disease dynamics and make predictions about the evolution of different diseases over time. However, despite years of progress, researchers still struggle to create accurate and reliable models due to limitations in both computational resources and available datasets. Recently, a large body of research has focused on applying machine learning algorithms to solve various problems related to biomedical informatics. While several deep neural network architectures have shown promising results in some domains, they remain challenging to apply to biomedical scenarios due to their complexity, sparsity of input data, and non-i.i.d nature of biomedical data. Furthermore, without strong support for reproducible and reliable AI systems, medical research and development efforts may not achieve the expected level of accuracy. 

Google Cloud Platform offers powerful tools and infrastructure that could greatly enhance the training process for medical experts interested in developing novel machine learning algorithms or working with existing ones that involve working with massive amounts of textual data. By leveraging these services and features, Google hopes to foster innovation within the field of medical AI research and development by accelerating the pace of scientific discovery and improvement, establishing confidence in medical AI systems, and promoting transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI-based solutions. In summary, Google’s approach to AI training for medical experts involves using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, scalable hardware infrastructure, and easy access to cloud services to efficiently and cost-effectively build robust and reliable artificial intelligence systems that can handle real-world healthcare data.
