# 1.简介
  

PyTorch Lightning is a lightweight PyTorch wrapper for high-performance AI research. It simplifies your code by organizing your models, optimizers and datasets into one class that can be trained on multiple GPUs or TPUs using the same code as single GPU training. You get all these benefits without having to change any of your existing model code. With PyTorch Lightning you can quickly prototype ideas, run small experiments and start scaling up to large-scale experiments with minimal effort. 

In this article we will cover some core concepts in PyTorch Lightning and learn how to use it to train an image classification model. We’ll also go over some more advanced features like how to handle multi-node training and how to integrate lightning modules within other frameworks such as FastAI and Pytorch-Ignite. In summary, PyTorch Lightning provides a simple and flexible way to build and train deep learning models with support for both CPUs and GPUs, which makes it suitable for most machine learning tasks.  

# 2.基本概念与术语
Before diving into the details of PyTorch Lightning, let's first understand some basic terminology and concepts used in Deep Learning. Here are the main terms:

1. **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**: Deep neural networks are a type of artificial neural network (ANN). They consist of multiple layers of connected units or nodes. The input data flows through each layer from left to right, passing through nonlinear processing elements known as activation functions. Each unit learns to extract information from its inputs and passes the output on to the next layer until the final output is produced. DNNs have many advantages including ability to solve complex problems and increase accuracy compared to traditional ANNs. However, they require a lot of computation power and time to train effectively.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Convolutional neural networks are a subclass of DNNs specifically designed for computer vision applications. These types of networks usually involve convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input data, aggregating similar patterns together. Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps by extracting dominant features. Finally, fully connected layers perform classification by combining the outputs of the convolutional and pooling layers. CNNs achieve impressive performance on image recognition tasks but may not scale well when applied to larger datasets due to their computational complexity. 

3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are another type of feedforward neural networks typically used for sequential data such as text or audio. RNNs work by iteratively applying the output of previous steps to the current step. This allows them to capture long term dependencies between data points and make predictions based on past events. Several variants exist such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which add memory and control mechanisms to improve the predictability of the model. Although RNNs have been successful at capturing long term dependencies, they can suffer from vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, making it difficult to train even moderately sized models efficiently.

4. **Transformer**: Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in NLP literature in 2017. Similar to RNNs, transformers aim to encode input sequences using attention mechanism while preserving the order of the sequence. Unlike RNNs, however, transformer models do not suffer from either vanishing or exploding gradient problem and can process long sequences efficiently. There are several variants of transformers such as BERT, GPT-2, etc., but they share some common characteristics such as self-attention and position encoding.

5. **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)** : Backpropagation through time refers to the method used to calculate gradients in recurrent neural networks. During backpropagation, the gradients are propagated through time and multiplied by appropriate weights to update the parameters during training. Traditionally, RNNs were trained using truncated BPTT algorithm, which splits the sequence into fixed length chunks and applies forward propagation and backward propagation separately to each chunk. However, this approach does not take advantage of parallelism available in modern hardware, leading to slow training times.

6. **Dropout** : Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons or connections are temporarily removed during training to prevent overfitting. When dropout rate is set to zero, the model becomes equivalent to a standard neural network. Dropout has shown significant improvements in model generalization and reduces overfitting.  

7. **Data Parallelism**: Data parallelism refers to parallelizing computations across multiple processors or devices. It involves splitting a dataset across multiple devices and running computations simultaneously on each device. While CPU processors have become faster than GPU processors in recent years, the overall speedup achieved by data parallelism remains limited.

8. **Gradient Accumulation**: Gradient accumulation is a technique used to simulate larger batch sizes on smaller GPUs. Instead of updating the parameters after computing the gradients for each mini-batch, the gradients are accumulated over multiple mini-batches before updating the parameters. This improves convergence and reduces the number of iterations required to converge to a local minimum.
