# 1.简介
  

DocumentDB 和 MongoDB 是两种开源 NoSQL 数据库，它们在当前云计算环境下都备受关注。对于 AWS、Azure、GCP 用户而言，Amazon DocumentDB 和 MongoDB 在存储和查询数据的能力上处于明确优势地位，分别提供基于键值对的文档型数据库和面向文档的数据库服务。

本文将详细阐述两者之间的区别与相似点，并通过实际案例，帮助读者选择适合自己的产品或服务。阅读完毕后，读者应该能够清楚地了解到何时使用哪个数据库以及其各自的优缺点。

# 2.基本概念及术语说明
## 2.1 数据模型
- Document-Oriented（文档驱动）：MongoDB 是面向文档的数据库，它把数据记录存储为 BSON (Binary JSON) 对象。每个对象代表一个文档，其中字段是键值对形式存在的。BSON 对象可以嵌套，因此可以创建复杂的数据结构。
- Schemaless（模式无关）：MongoDB 不需要定义表结构，而是在插入数据时动态生成字段，使得不同类型的数据可以存入同一个集合中。这种灵活性也给了开发人员更多的创造性空间。
- Embedded Documents（内嵌文档）：除了 BSON 对象，还可以使用文档作为另一种数据结构的内嵌文档。这样做可以实现更高级的查询功能。

## 2.2 查询语言
- SQL：MongoDB 提供了丰富的 SQL 查询支持，包括查询语言、索引优化器、查询优化器等。
- Aggregation Pipeline：Aggregation Pipeline 是 MongoDB 的高级查询特性，它提供了对数据进行过滤、转换和聚合等一系列操作的方法。

## 2.3 分布式集群
- Sharding：MongoDB 支持分布式集群，通过分片方案将数据分布到多个节点上。这使得 MongoDB 可以横向扩展，并可用于处理超大规模的数据集。
- Replica Set：Replica Set 是 MongoDB 的高可用副本集机制，可以自动处理硬件故障、网络分区、主服务器故障等问题。

## 2.4 事务处理
- ACID（Atomicity、Consistency、Isolation、Durability）：ACID 是传统关系数据库管理系统提倡的标准保证，它要求事务必须满足四个属性才能被提交。但是 MongoDB 没有完全遵守 ACID 规范，它只保证了数据一致性和持久性。

## 3.1 MongoDB vs. Amazon DocumentDB: Comparing the Two for Cloud Databases by David Kimball
In this chapter we will discuss some of the similarities and differences between MongoDB and DocumentDB as two popular open source databases used in cloud computing environments. Specifically, we will look at how they are optimized for storing and querying data, which features make them ideal for certain use cases, and why you might choose one over the other based on your requirements and specific needs. 

Let’s get started!

### Overview
Both MongoDB and DocumentDB offer high performance, scalability, and availability through a distributed architecture with horizontal scaling capabilities to handle large datasets. However, there are also some key differences that should be considered when choosing either database product or service. Here is an overview of each product and their primary focus areas:

1. MongoDB: MongoDB was built from the ground up to support flexible schemas and has a query language that supports aggregation and map/reduce operations. It provides a rich ecosystem of tools including drivers, admin interfaces, monitoring systems, and backup solutions. 

2. DocumentDB: DocumentDB was designed specifically for workloads requiring document-oriented storage, complex queries, and global distribution across multiple regions. The DocumentDB API exposes advanced functionality such as change tracking, conflict detection, and transactional guarantees. Additionally, it offers a serverless option for small applications and low cost options for larger applications.

Now let's dive into the detailed comparison between these products:

### Core Differences

#### Data Model
Both MongoDB and DocumentDB store data records as documents represented using Bson objects. However, there are some fundamental differences in the way they represent relationships within the data model. With respect to relationships, MongoDB uses references between collections, while DocumentDB relies upon automatic indexing of related fields. This means that if you have a collection of orders and customers where each order belongs to exactly one customer, MongoDB requires you to create separate collections for orders and customers but DocumentDB can index both fields automatically making it easier to search and filter data. For example, given a set of employees and departments, MongoDB may require creating separate collections for employee details and department information, whereas DocumentDB would allow us to index directly on the department field without having to define additional collections. Similarly, for nested structures like hierarchical trees, MongoDB requires creating separate collections for every node, whereas DocumentDB allows for easy traversal of the tree structure via its nested indexing feature. Overall, the choice between MongoDB and DocumentDB depends on what kind of relationship and schema design you need to implement.

#### Query Language Support
While both MongoDB and DocumentDB provide a powerful SQL-like query language, they differ slightly in syntax and semantics. While MongoDB supports most standard SQL constructs and functions, not all DocumentDB APIs are compatible with the SQL spec. Additionally, aggregations in MongoDB are limited compared to those available in DocumentDB. Finally, although MongoDB allows for full text searching and indexing of textual content, DocumentDB only supports simple searches on indexed strings and does not currently include full-text search features. In summary, the choice between MongoDB and DocumentDB depends on whether you prefer to write queries using SQL or a more familiar declarative style with less boilerplate code.

#### Transactions
Both MongoDB and DocumentDB support transactions, but they do so at different levels of granularity. MongoDB provides support for multi-document transactions through the use of the findAndModify() method. On the other hand, DocumentDB provides support for cross-partition transactions through the use of stored procedures, triggers, and user defined functions (UDFs). In addition, MongoDB supports client-side locking, meaning that clients can take control of the lock level during reads and writes, whereas DocumentDB enforces strong consistency throughout the system, ensuring that all updates are applied atomically and consistently. Both approaches offer benefits and tradeoffs depending on your specific use case.

#### Scalability
As mentioned earlier, both MongoDB and DocumentDB scale horizontally to meet demand for large datasets. To achieve high throughput rates, however, they must balance replication factors with hardware resources. In MongoDB, the default setting is to replicate data across three nodes in a replica set. Each node is capable of handling around 700 - 1000 requests per second. Given the increased workload required to handle gigabytes of data, adding more replicas typically results in higher costs and slower performance. To mitigate this issue, many companies rely on technologies such as sharding and data partitioning to distribute data across multiple servers rather than replicating it excessively. In contrast, DocumentDB distributes data across physical partitions spanning multiple regions globally, providing resilience against region outages and faster access times. By choosing the right solution based on your specific needs, you can ensure optimal performance, scalability, and reliability.

#### Availability and Recovery
One thing to note about both MongoDB and DocumentDB is the ability to recover from failures and maintain consistent state. MongoDB uses replication to protect against node failure and automatic failover to standby nodes in the event of a failure. If necessary, users can manually initiate a manual failover to recover the cluster quickly. On the other hand, DocumentDB takes advantage of automatic partition-level replication to ensure continuous availability even in the face of regional outages. As a result, no action is needed from the user in most situations, allowing DocumentDB to remain highly available even in the face of unforeseen events.

### Choosing One Over the Other Based on Your Requirements and Needs

To help readers understand when to use MongoDB or DocumentDB, I'll now provide some concrete examples of when you might want to consider using one over the other. These examples are intended to give readers a clearer idea of when and why you might choose one over the other. Remember, the decision between MongoDB and DocumentDB ultimately comes down to your specific business requirements and needs, so these examples are just suggestions to get you thinking. 

#### Examples

##### IoT Time Series Data Analysis

When analyzing time series data from devices, MongoDB would be suitable due to its flexible data model. Since we don't necessarily know the exact schema of the incoming data beforehand, we can simply store the raw data as documents within a single collection and later perform aggregation queries as needed. Furthermore, MongoDB's widespread adoption among developers makes it a preferred platform for developing real-time analytics applications.

On the other hand, if you're working with very large amounts of structured data and need to efficiently retrieve, process, and analyze this data, then DocumentDB would likely be a better fit. You could store structured data as documents within a single collection, and then apply indexes to any relevant fields to enable efficient queries. Additionally, since DocumentDB doesn't enforce strict schemas, you won't run into issues like compatibility errors when processing heterogeneous data sources. Also, DocumentDB can easily scale horizontally to handle a growing volume of data by adding new regions or increasing the number of partitions.

##### Web Application Analytics and Reporting

If your web application generates significant traffic and needs to track visitor behavior and interactions, MongoDB would be a good choice because it supports flexible schemas and complex queries. You could store individual page views, referral links clicked, session information, and usage statistics as documents within a single collection, enabling fast and accurate reporting and analysis. Since MongoDB scales horizontally, you could add more nodes to increase the capacity and performance of your infrastructure as needed.

On the other hand, if you're building a specialized real-time analytics tool that requires constant ingestion of streaming data, DocumentDB would be a better fit. Since DocumentDB stores data as documents, it natively supports indexing of related fields, making it easier to aggregate and analyze data. Additionally, the API includes several real-time features such as change notifications, conflict detection, and cross-partition transactions, making it well-suited for real-time analytics and processing. Lastly, if your company is looking for a fully managed, reliable, and scalable solution, you could consider Amazon DocumentDB, which offers enterprise-grade security, compliance, and operational support.

Overall, the choice between MongoDB and DocumentDB depends on your specific requirements and use case. Before selecting a product, always consult with your team and stakeholders to ensure that the technology stack meets your specific needs.
