# 1.简介
  

Microservices is a software development approach that involves breaking down large-scale applications into smaller, independent services running on their own processes and communicating with each other over well-defined APIs. Each service runs in its own environment and only interacts with the other services it requires to complete a task or provide a specific functionality. In this article, we will explore microservices architecture, understand key terms and concepts, and delve deep into how they work and why they are used. 

In the rest of this article, I’ll introduce you to microservices through examples and explain what makes them unique from traditional monolithic applications. We'll also look at various design patterns and anti-patterns related to microservices to help you decide when to use them and how to implement them correctly. Finally, we'll discuss some best practices for building and deploying microservices architectures. Let's get started!

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
## What Is A Microservice?
A microservice is an individual application or service that performs a small set of functionalities within a larger system. It consists of several components, such as databases, message brokers, and web servers, but these may be hosted on different machines or containers, making communication between services more efficient than using a monolithic architecture. Within a microservice architecture, all code, data, and configuration files must be defined and owned by a single team or organization, allowing developers to collaborate effectively. They can deploy new versions of services independently without affecting the others, which helps ensure continuous delivery of features and improvements.

## Why Use Microservices Architecture?
### Scalability
Modern cloud platforms have made it easier than ever to scale horizontally and vertically, both up and out as demand increases. By distributing services across multiple instances, rather than requiring a whole lot of resources in one place, microservices allow you to scale efficiently to meet increasing loads while keeping costs low. This means you don't need to worry about provisioning expensive hardware just to handle peak traffic spikes anymore.

### Resilience
Microservices enable you to build systems that are more resilient against failure. Since each service has its own process and state, if any one component fails, it won't take down the entire system. Instead, failed services can quickly failover to other healthy ones, freeing up capacity for other parts of your system to continue functioning normally. Additionally, each service can be designed with appropriate monitoring and logging capabilities, allowing you to detect and isolate issues before they become bigger problems.

### Flexibility
Microservices make it easy to change technologies or frameworks as requirements change. If you want to switch from Ruby on Rails to Node.js, or from MySQL to MongoDB, you simply need to redeploy your services instead of having to rewrite everything. You also benefit from the ability to experiment with new technologies, integrations, and implementations without disrupting your production systems.

### Independent Deployments
Microservices encourage independent deployments because each service can be updated and deployed independently without affecting the rest of the system. This allows for faster feedback loops between teams and avoids common pitfalls like downtime and version conflicts. Furthermore, deployment automation tools can be configured to automatically update all services whenever changes are pushed to source control, ensuring that all changes go live simultaneously, reducing risk and improving quality.

### Ease Of Testing And Maintenance
Microservices simplify testing and maintenance because there is no shared infrastructure. Rather than spending time figuring out how to test and maintain complex integration tests, you can focus on testing individual pieces of functionality. Services can be tested end-to-end without involving the entire stack. Additionally, since each service owns its codebase, it's easy to pinpoint where bugs might exist and improve the overall quality of the system.

### Team Autonomy
Microservices create space for developers to operate autonomously, working on distinct functional areas or domains. This can result in better collaboration between developers, faster delivery times, and improved productivity due to less overlap in responsibilities. Teams can also choose their preferred programming languages and frameworks based on the strengths and weaknesses of their members, further enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

### Cost Effectiveness
Microservices offer significant cost benefits compared to a monolithic architecture. Since each service can be deployed separately and scaled independently, they're typically much cheaper to run than monoliths. Moreover, microservices often require fewer hardware resources per instance than monoliths do, enabling you to reduce costs and run more efficiently. As your system grows, so does the potential economies of scale created by microservices.

## Design Principles For Building Microservices Architectures
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The SRP suggests that a class should have only one reason to change. Here, "reason" refers to either the complexity of the class itself or the impact on other classes depending on its behavior. Microservices should adhere to the SRP, meaning that each service should perform a single role within the larger system, handling requests only for its area of responsibility. Doing so ensures that each service is highly cohesive and focused, resulting in increased flexibility and agility during development and testing.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The OCP states that entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. In practice, this means that you shouldn't modify existing code when adding new functionality, unless absolutely necessary. Instead, you should extend existing modules to add new behaviors or functionality as needed. Microservices follow the OCP because services should be designed in a modular way that doesn't rely too heavily on a particular technology stack or framework. This enables greater flexibility and interoperability amongst different services.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The DIP encourages high-level modules not to depend on low-level modules; rather, both should depend on abstractions. This principle is closely linked to the idea of separation of concerns, meaning that different concerns should be separated and managed by different objects. Microservices should strictly adhere to the DIP because loose coupling and flexible design patterns help ensure that services can be easily swapped out or replaced if required.

### Shared Kernel Pattern
The shared kernel pattern promotes the creation of a common kernel that contains core business logic and functionality, allowing microservices to share information and functionality seamlessly. This saves duplication of effort, improves consistency of behavior, and reduces coupling between services. Microservices following this pattern should communicate directly with each other using standardized protocols, such as RESTful API endpoints or messaging queues.

### Separate Ways To Communicate Between Services
One important aspect of microservices architecture is the way they communicate with each other. Traditionally, most applications were built around a single monolithic architecture that contained all the necessary functionality. However, moving towards a microservices architecture requires careful consideration of how information flows between services. There are several ways to accomplish this:

1. Service Registry: One option is to use a service registry to keep track of available services and their locations. When a request comes in, the client contacts the registry to find the correct endpoint(s).

2. API Gateway: An API gateway acts as a front door for incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice. It provides a single point of entry for clients, aggregating responses from various microservices, caching results, and providing additional features like rate limiting and authentication.

3. Message Brokers: Another option is to use message brokers to establish a publish-subscribe channel between services. Clients send messages to a broker, which routes them to subscribers who have registered interest in certain types of messages. Services can also broadcast events via message brokers, informing other services that something interesting has happened.

4. Remote Procedure Calls (RPC): Yet another approach is to use remote procedure calls (RPC) to invoke functions on remote services. RPC works by sending a request message to a remote server, asking it to execute a specific method and return the result back. RPC is commonly used for non-idempotent operations, such as database updates or file manipulations, where retries or rollbacks need to be handled manually.

It's essential to consider the specific needs of your application when choosing the communication mechanism between services. Choosing the right technique depends on the type of operation being performed and the nature of the data being transmitted.

## Anti-Patterns For Microservices Architecture
Here are some common anti-patterns and challenges associated with building microservices architecture:

1. Monolithic Data Stores: Microservices architecture presents a challenge for database design. Databases should be partitioned based on business capability or usage scenario, not simply based on tables and rows. Using separate databases for every service creates an unnecessary level of replication and synchronization, leading to performance degradation and unpredictable behavior.

2. Cascading Failures: In a distributed system, things can fail anywhere, including in dependencies or downstream services. When failures cascade, they can cause widespread service outages and damage to customers. Therefore, microservices architecture requires careful planning and design to avoid cascading failures.

3. Overloaded Messaging Queues: When message volumes increase, especially in real-time scenarios, it becomes difficult to keep up with processing speeds. Proper load balancing techniques and dynamic scaling can help prevent queue overload, but excessive volume could still lead to delays and timeouts. Consider batch processing or event streaming for heavy volume streams.

4. Distributed Transactions: When dealing with transactions across multiple microservices, distributed transactions pose significant challenges. Microservices should favor eventual consistency and minimize cross-service interactions until the last possible moment. Eventually consistent solutions like Kafka or Elasticsearch can be used for temporary data storage and coordination between services.

5. Complex Configuration Management: Configuring and managing hundreds or even thousands of microservices can be challenging. Centralized configuration management tooling plays a crucial role in achieving consistent configurations across the fleet. However, implementing centralization can also complicate troubleshooting and debugging, causing friction and wasted time.

6. Lack Of Contract Tests: Writing contract tests for microservices can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. Contract tests verify that the contracts between microservices remain intact over time, catching errors early and helping to mitigate unexpected consequences later. However, writing comprehensive contract tests can be daunting and time-consuming, especially for enterprise-sized systems.

Overall, microservices architecture offers many advantages and benefits, but it also introduces new challenges and risks. Be prepared to navigate these challenges and develop practical strategies for designing, developing, and operating microservices architectures that can help you achieve optimal scalability, reliability, and cost effectiveness.
