Online shopping has become a critical component of modern life. With online shopping, consumers can shop from anywhere in the world with ease and convenience. However, it also creates new challenges for businesses that want to keep up with the ever-evolving marketplace. The following are some common problems that companies face while managing their ecommerce business:

1. Customer loyalty: While consumers have come to expect high-quality products at reasonable prices, many online retailers struggle to retain customers after they have left the store.

2. Product quality: As more people shop on various platforms, there is an increased risk of inadequate or outdated products being sold. Additionally, consumers are becoming increasingly skeptical about the authenticity and quality of products before purchasing them. 

3. Brand equity: In an increasingly competitive global economy, brands need to establish strong relationships with both suppliers and consumers. To do so, they must share information effectively across multiple channels and ensure that their actions impact positive outcomes for all stakeholders involved. 

4. Sales insights: Understanding customer behavior, preferences, needs, and expectations enables businesses to provide personalized experiences based on past interactions. This leads to better conversion rates and increased revenue. 

The goal of this article is to introduce businesses to key concepts and technologies needed to monitor online shopping behavior, improve product quality and satisfaction, as well as create brand equity and achieve sales growth. We will focus specifically on how to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze customer behavior and use this data to make predictions about future purchases. We will cover several real-world use cases demonstrating how these models can be applied to optimize performance and generate value for the business. Overall, we hope this article provides valuable insights into how to develop effective strategies for optimizing online shopping behavior within your organization.

## 2.1. Retail Analytics
Retail analytics refers to the process of analyzing transactional data related to retail stores. It involves tracking transactions, capturing important metrics such as sales figures, profit margins, inventory levels, etc., and applying mathematical analysis to understand trends and patterns within the data. The main objective of retail analytics is to inform decision making processes throughout the retail supply chain, enabling managers to forecast demand, prioritize inventory management practices, and plan logistics operations accordingly.

In our context, retail analytics encompasses techniques used to extract meaningful insights from customer interaction data generated through online shopping activities. This includes understanding what customers prefer, why they made certain purchases, where they visited, which items they bought together, among other factors. Retail analytics is essential to enable organizations to manage their ecommerce businesses effectively.

Some popular tools used for retail analytics include Google Analytics, Adobe Experience Cloud, BigQuery, Looker, Tableau, and Power BI. These tools help organizations capture customer behavior data, gain insights into customer preferences, and track customer engagement.

## 2.2. Data Science & Machine Learning
Data science and machine learning are two disciplines that are often confused with each other. Data science focuses on examining large datasets and deriving meaningful insights using statistical methods and natural language processing. Machine learning on the other hand, builds models using training sets and tests its accuracy on test sets. Both fields require specialized skills and expertise from computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and domain experts.

For example, retail analytics could involve identifying patterns and correlations between consumer demographics, behaviors, preferences, and buying habits. A machine learning algorithm might utilize clustering techniques to group similar customers together based on their purchase histories. Similarly, you can apply deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify images, text, or videos. You would typically train the model on labeled dataset and then test its accuracy on unseen data. All of these techniques contribute towards achieving higher levels of accuracy and precision, leading to improved business outcomes.

## 2.3. Predictive Modeling
Predictive modeling is the process of building models that accurately predict outcomes based on input variables. There are three types of predictive models commonly used in retail analytics: regression, classification, and clustering.

### Regression Models
Regression models are used when the outcome variable takes continuous values, like price or sale amount. Linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression are some examples of traditional linear regression. Tree-based models, such as random forest, gradient boosted trees, and support vector machines (SVM), are also used in retail analytics.

### Classification Models
Classification models are used when the outcome variable takes categorical values, like whether a customer will respond positively to a promotion or not. Logistic regression, decision tree classifiers, naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors are some examples of traditional classification models. Neural networks are also widely used for classification tasks.

### Clustering Models
Clustering models are used when the purpose is to group similar objects together based on certain features. K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering are some popular clustering algorithms used in retail analytics.
