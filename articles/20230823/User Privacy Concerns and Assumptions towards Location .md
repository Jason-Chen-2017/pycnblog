# 1.简介
  

Location tracking technology is widely used in the mobile applications that rely heavily on location-based services such as navigation, maps, social media platforms, etc., to provide various functionalities. However, there are significant concerns about privacy issues arising from these technologies. Despite efforts made by various organizations to address privacy concerns through law enforcement agencies, companies still struggle with user privacy awareness and intentional practices. Moreover, mobile application developers have no control over how their users share their data or what type of personal information they provide for these purposes, leading to potential security risks if sensitive information is shared unintentionally. This article aims to identify and summarize current research findings on user privacy concerns and assumptions related to location tracking technologies in big data applications and proposes a systematic review of available literature. The goal is to understand existing knowledge and gain insights into possible gaps in this area and take steps to address them.
# 2.基本概念、术语说明
We first need to define some basic concepts, terminologies, and acronyms. We can use the following list as a reference:

1. **Big data** - refers to large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data generated by different sources across various domains such as social media, IoT devices, online shopping platforms, healthcare providers, among others.

2. **Privacy** - refers to any private or confidential information held by an individual or organization including name, age, occupation, income, sexual orientation, race, religious beliefs, political views, marital status, physical or mental ability, family members’ names and addresses, trade secrets, photographs, videos, audio recordings, computer programs, other proprietary documents, employment history, education records, financial information, medical history, and so forth.

3. **Location tracking** - refers to collection, storage, analysis, and presentation of geographic location data collected via GPS or Wi-Fi signals. It involves both passive and active methods. Passive method uses Bluetooth Beacons, Geofencing, Wi-Fi APs/stations, cellular base stations, or other sensors embedded in smartphones, which transmit their position periodically at regular intervals. Active method utilizes smart phones, tablets, wearables, or headsets equipped with dedicated hardware for capturing and processing location data such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, GPS receivers, radios, and network connectivity.

4. **User behavior** - refers to interactions between individuals using digital products and includes actions like browsing, searching, sharing content, interacting with ads, attending events, purchasing items, engaging with customer service, communicating with friends, posting messages on social media sites, making phone calls, sending emails, and many more.

5. **Personalization** - refers to the process of tailoring individualized experiences based on user preferences, interests, demographics, behaviors, and activities. Personalization is typically achieved by analyzing user behavior patterns, predicting future behavior, recommending products and services, adapting content recommendations, and enhancing search results.

6. **Data protection laws** - refer to regulations established by governments, organizations, businesses, and individuals to protect individuals' rights and freedoms under data privacy regulations worldwide. There are several data protection laws in place around the world including California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), EU General Data Protection Regulation (eGDR) and UK General Data Transfer Protection Regulation (UK GDTR). 

7. **Data breaches** - refers to when sensitive data of individuals is accessed without authorization or improper disposal causing loss, damage, or alteration. Examples include hacking attacks, natural disasters, criminal activities, government intrusions, and terrorism.

8. **Cloud computing** - refers to a model of computing where remote servers host and manage computational resources and data centres work together to perform specific tasks. Cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, and economies of scale compared to traditional on-premise servers.

9. **Geolocation** - refers to determining the precise location of an object based on its longitude and latitude coordinates. Geolocation helps us determine our physical location and provides valuable context to make better decisions, such as finding nearby shops, restaurants, attractions, or services, routing traffic, and identifying crime hotspots.

10. **Third-party cookies** - third party cookies are small text files placed by websites on your browser while visiting them. They enable web pages to store and retrieve information on your device, enabling them to offer you additional services. Third parties also collect information about your activities on the website, which allows advertisers to target you with customized advertising according to your interests and behavior. 

In summary, we have reviewed the important concepts and terms related to location tracking technologies in big data applications and the general principles of privacy. Within the next section, we will dive deeper into the core algorithms, operations, and mathematical formulas involved in the implementation of location tracking systems.
