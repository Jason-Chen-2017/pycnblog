# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular machine learning technique in the field of artificial intelligence that enables an agent to learn by interacting with its environment and taking actions based on reward signals. RL has been used successfully in a wide range of applications such as robotics, game playing, autonomous driving, etc. However, it faces several challenges when dealing with more complex environments where agents need to solve complex tasks under uncertain conditions and interact with multiple entities simultaneously. In this article, we will introduce Evolutionary Computation (EC), which provides a powerful alternative methodology to deal with complex environments. We will use EC to improve the performance of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and achieve better solutions for challenging problems like multi-agent navigation and adversarial games. Finally, we hope our work could inspire other researchers to explore new ways to apply EC in solving complex RL problems and inspire us to pursue further research directions towards building robust AI systems.

3.问题描述
The problem of improving the performance of deep reinforcement learning algorithms under complex environments is becoming increasingly critical. Several recent papers have proposed approaches using evolutionary computation techniques to address these challenges. This article focuses on two specific issues arising from applying evolutionary computation methods to deep reinforcement learning models: how to generate candidate neural networks, and how to evaluate their fitness. We also provide insights into how to select the best candidates for model improvement based on their evaluations and suggest future research directions. 

Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are able to train highly complex policies that can easily outperform human level performance in certain environments. Despite being highly effective, however, they still face challenges in handling complex environments due to their high dimensionality and non-stationarity of the state space. To overcome these challenges, some works have proposed evolutionary computation techniques to generate candidate neural network architectures and evaluate their fitness based on the training results. These methods have shown impressive results in addressing various optimization problems, but have not been widely adopted or applied to deep reinforcement learning yet. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both evolutionary computation and deep reinforcement learning to enhance the performance of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Specifically, we first design an algorithm to generate candidate neural network structures while leveraging the advantages of genetic programming. Then, we integrate this algorithm within deep reinforcement learning algorithms to automatically optimize the policy parameters during training. Finally, we assess the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on challenging benchmark environments, including multi-agent navigation and adversarial games. Based on our experimental findings, we believe that combining EC and deep reinforcement learning offers significant benefits compared to conventional methods and promises a promising direction for further research.
