# 1.简介
  

Self-supervised learning refers to the machine learning technique where the model learns to perform a task without any labeled data in an unsupervised way using various self-supervision techniques such as pretext tasks or weak supervision. It can be useful for tasks like image classification, anomaly detection, and representation learning. In this paper, we will review the current state-of-the-art in self-supervised learning research with emphasis on new advancements in the field of contrastive learning based approaches, large scale pretraining methods, and continual learning paradigms.

## Contrastive Learning
Contrastive learning is a type of deep neural network training approach that involves teaching the model how different samples should be related through a set of intermediate representations called embeddings. The key idea behind contrastive learning is to train the model by comparing the similarities between pairs of samples embedded into high-dimensional space. 

In recent years, several methods have been proposed for applying contrastive learning to images and videos. These include Siamese networks, Triplet networks, SwAV, MoCo, SimCLR, and BYOL. All these methods use a siamese architecture with shared weights but separate biases for each branch. During training, they compare two images from the same video pair or across different frames in the same image pair and minimize their distance while maximizing the distance between different pairs. This allows them to learn effective representations of the input data while achieving good performance on downstream tasks. 

## Pretraining
Pretraining is a process used to improve the generalization capabilities of a deep learning model by introducing knowledge transfer from an external dataset. Pretrained models are often trained on large datasets of common objects, animals, and vehicles. Pretraining enables models to achieve better accuracy on limited data and has become a popular method for many natural language processing tasks. However, it requires significant computational resources and time to obtain large amounts of annotated data.

Several pretraining methods have been proposed in the past few years for vision tasks such as ResNet and VGG. They involve fine-tuning the pretrained model on a small subset of the original dataset, which provides the network with an initial embedding layer that captures higher level features than what the pretraining was originally designed to capture. Examples of pretraining methods include SimCLR, SwAV, MoCo, Reptile, and Vision Transformer. These methods do not require labelled data and leverage unlabelled data indirectly through the usage of the cross-entropy loss function during finetuning.

## Continual Learning
Continual learning is a machine learning paradigm where a machine learning model is trained incrementally over multiple phases, or tasks, rather than being trained all at once on one big batch. Traditional machine learning algorithms cannot handle online learning scenarios where inputs arrive sequentially over time, making them prone to catastrophic forgetting when encountering new tasks after training on previous ones. One approach to address this problem is to use a replay memory that stores previously seen examples, and apply regularization techniques to limit the impact of old tasks on the latest ones.

Recent works have explored continual learning techniques for computer vision, speech recognition, and text generation tasks. Examples of continual learning strategies include multi-task learning, incremental class learning, synaptic intelligence, and progressive growing of GANs. While most of these techniques aim to improve long-term performance, there is also room for future exploration of more efficient ways of managing catastrophic forgetting problems due to distractor injection, weight decay, or other regularization techniques.

### Contrastive Learning
#### Contrastive Loss Functions
Two commonly used contrastive loss functions for the Siamese and Triplet Networks are the following:

1. Contrastive Cross Entropy Loss Function:
The contrastive cross entropy loss encourages the output vectors of the two branches of the siamese architecture to be highly correlated. The loss is computed as follows:

$$L(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z}) = -\frac{(1-\alpha)\cdot y_i^T \mathbf{z} + \alpha \cdot (\max\{0, m+||\mathbf{z}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}||^2_2-||\mathbf{y}-\bar{\mathbf{y}}||^2_2\})\cdot y_j}{\mid \mathcal{D}\mid}$$

where $\alpha$ controls the trade-off between enforcing positive similarity constraint ($\max\{0, ||\mathbf{z}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}||^2_2-||\mathbf{y}-\bar{\mathbf{y}}||^2_2<0$) and negative similarity constraint $(\max\{0, ||\mathbf{z}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}||^2_2-||\mathbf{y}-\bar{\mathbf{y}}||^2_2>0)$, $m$ is a margin hyperparameter that determines the minimum separation between positive pairs, and $\bar{\mathbf{y}}$ and $\bar{\mathbf{z}}$ are the average of all pairs' targets and outputs respectively. The $\mathcal{D}$ denotes the set of training pairs consisting of both positive and negative examples. For the case of siamese networks, $\mathbf{y}=f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_i), \mathbf{z}=f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_j)$, and for triplet networks, $\mathbf{y}=f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_a), \mathbf{z}=f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_p), \mathbf{w}=f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_n)$. 

2. Online Triplets Selection Strategy:
Online triplets selection strategy improves the convergence rate of the training algorithm by selecting only those triplets whose predictions violate the desired formulation for similarity metric. There are three types of formulations: conventional, softmargin, and semihardmargin. Conventional formulation selects hard triplets, i.e., anchors are usually close to positives while negatives are far away. Softmargin formulation reduces the hardness of the triplets by allowing some incorrect triplets to occur while still minimizing the overall error rate. Semihardmargin formulation combines the benefits of softmargin and conventional formulations by penalizing only the incorrectly classified anchor-negative pairs. Given a mini-batch of unlabeled data points, each point is assigned to either the positive or negative class based on its closeness to the corresponding centroid and then selected randomly along with another unlabeled point. Finally, the pairs are fed into the contrastive loss function as usual.

#### Architecture Details
In order to achieve great performance on complex computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, Siamese Networks have proven themselves as powerful tools. The architecture consists of two identical sub-networks that share the feature extraction layers followed by two heads, each responsible for predicting binary labels indicating whether two given examples belong to the same category or not. During training, each example is paired with a random other example from the same category or background, and a contrastive loss function is applied to optimize the parameters of the two networks jointly. Since the two sub-networks are synchronized, they can exchange information during training and effectively leverage each others' strengths.

Triplet Networks exploit the concept of triplet loss, which is a special instance of contrastive loss. Unlike traditional contrastive loss functions, triplet loss focuses on finding dissimilar pairs of samples in a specific semantic relationship. Therefore, instead of requiring two samples to be perfectly similar, triplet loss aims to push them apart towards each other until they meet a certain threshold value. Triplet Networks differ from Siamese Networks because they use a third sample that belongs to the opposite semantic category as the anchor. Moreover, the number of negative examples is restricted to half of the total number of possible combinations of anchor-positive/anchor-negative pairs. This leads to faster convergence compared to Siamese Networks while providing competitive results.

Both Siamese Networks and Triplet Networks have advantages over traditional architectures that rely heavily on manually designed features. However, there are drawbacks too. First, the learned features may not generalize well to new categories. Second, the choice of loss function may lead to suboptimal results especially for imbalanced datasets. Third, the learning curve is much slower since the model must be trained twice per epoch. To mitigate these issues, several modifications have been proposed including domain adaptation, multi-class constraints, and momentum term optimization.

#### Fine-tuning Strategies
Despite having shown impressive results in standard computer vision tasks, the effectiveness of self-supervised learning has yet to be fully exploited for real-world applications. Common challenges faced by practitioners are slow convergence and lack of interpretability. To solve these issues, several fine-tuning strategies have been introduced to improve the generalization capacity of the learned features and interpret the underlying reasons for successful predictions. Here are a few examples:

1. Metric Learning Based Approach: 
This approach uses a metric learning framework to align the learned embeddings of different classes into meaningful clusters, typically manifolds or distributions. Cluster centers provide insights about the distribution of each cluster, enabling us to identify outliers or anomalies. In addition, the mapping between individual samples and their closest neighbors within the same class allow us to estimate missing values, reduce noise, and augment the dataset.

2. Adversarial Training:
Adversarial training is a popular technique for improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. It involves generating synthetically corrupted versions of the input data to confuse the classifier and force it to produce misleading decisions. By backpropagating gradients from the discriminator, the generator learns to generate realistic synthetic examples that are difficult to distinguish from the true data, resulting in improved performance on a variety of tasks.

3. Interpretable Representation Extraction Techniques:
The last line of defense in computer vision systems is to extract human-interpretable visual concepts such as scenes, actions, and objects from the learned features. Several techniques have been proposed for this purpose, ranging from clustering techniques to dimensionality reduction techniques. Each extracted concept may reveal a unique characteristic of the visual world, enabling us to analyze and understand how the system makes sense of its surroundings.

Overall, Contrastive Learning is widely used for self-supervised learning and offers several advantages over other self-supervised techniques. The contributions of the previous papers make it essential to keep pace with the rapidly evolving literature in self-supervised learning. With the right combination of contrastive learning, pretraining, and continual learning techniques, we can develop reliable and scalable self-supervised systems capable of solving challenging computer vision problems.
