# 2.Basic Concepts and Terms
##  2.1 What is change management?
Change management is the process of planning, executing, monitoring, analyzing, evaluating, and taking action to deliver improved products or services to customers while minimizing unintended consequences or negative impacts. Within the context of IT systems, change management typically refers to a combination of procedures, policies, standards, tools, and resources designed to manage change and evolution in organizational processes, infrastructure, and end-user needs. The goal is to provide support, guidance, and institutional frameworks that enable organizations to move quickly and effectively towards better productivity, quality, reliability, and value through continual improvement. Therefore, change management is essential for any industry, sector, or size due to the complex nature of modern businesses and the constant pace of change and innovation. 

The concept of change management may sound simple but there are many challenges associated with it. For example, organizations need to consider the following factors when determining the appropriate level of change management involvement:

1. Size and complexity - Large organizations require more extensive and specialized change management capabilities compared to smaller companies or startups.
2. Frequency of change - Fast-paced environments demand frequent and rapid response to new requirements, constraints, and regulations.
3. Time-to-market focus - Short development cycles and limited budgets necessitate quick turnaround times for features and fixes.
4. Culture of innovation and change - Organizations must develop high levels of motivation, ownership, and flexibility to adopt emerging technologies and drive continuous improvement.

Ultimately, good change management requires an awareness of the changing environment, strong people skills, and technical know-how to implement effective solutions that meet the specific needs of each project. As organizations face these challenges, they need a systematic approach to change management that integrates a range of strategies and tactics across the entire enterprise, working closely with top-level executives, diverse constituencies, and stakeholders.  

## 2.2 Key terms and concepts 
Let's briefly go through some commonly used terms and concepts related to change management. 

1. **Scope:** This refers to the targeted area or object being affected by a change request. Common examples include the whole organization, a single department, a team or group, or a specific application.

2. **Roles and Responsibilities:** Roles and responsibilities play a crucial role in developing and maintaining a well-functioning change management program. These roles often include the Chief Information Officer (CIO), CEO, Director of Operations, Vice President of Business Development, Head of People Operations, and Executive Sponsor.

3. **Communication Channels:** Communication channels can vary depending on the scale of the organization and the scope of the change request. They might include email, phone calls, online messaging, video conference calls, or even physical meetings. 

4. **Feedback Loops:** Feedback loops are important because they help inform the next steps after each change has been deployed. Whether feedback is received or not, feedback loops offer valuable insights into how users respond to the deployment and what kind of improvements are still needed. 

5. **Risk Mitigation:** Risk mitigation involves assessing potential threats, vulnerabilities, and opportunities that may arise during implementation of a change. Although it cannot completely eliminate all risk, proper risk management measures can significantly reduce overall costs and time required to deploy changes. 

6. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Stakeholder engagement ensures that everybody involved in a change process has a shared understanding of its intended outcomes and benefits. While it is important to involve relevant stakeholders early on, regular communication and collaboration across the company brings clarity, consistency, and accountability to the program. 

# 3.Core Algorithm and Techniques
Now let us dive deeper into the core algorithm and techniques that can be applied to successfully implement a change management process within your organization. We will first look at general principles followed by several concrete examples.

## 3.1 Guiding Principles for a Successful Program 
1. Communication: Ensure that everyone knows what is expected of them and understands the implications of any given change before it is approved. Communicate frequently and clearly with stakeholders, providing updates on status, concerns, actions taken, and any necessary follow-up activities.
2. Approval: All proposed changes must be reviewed and approved by senior management. Approvals can come from directors, vice presidents, or C-suite executives. Changes should also be subjected to peer review and testing if applicable.
3. Monitoring: Continuously monitor the progress of projects and report findings to leadership at appropriate intervals. Keep track of metrics such as lead time, cycle time, completion rate, and any other KPIs that matter to the company. Use this information to adjust priorities and determine which changes to prioritize further.
4. Rollback: When problems occur, revert back to previous versions or roll forward to resolve conflicts. Maintain documentation and records for reference purposes. 
5. Training: Develop training plans and materials to educate stakeholders on change management processes, best practices, and guidelines. Promote awareness and increase participation to foster a culture of transparency and inclusiveness.
6. Collaboration: Cross-functional teams collaborate together to execute changes, coordinating among multiple departments and offices to ensure alignment and reduce risk. Establish cross-departmental lines of communication and expectations to prevent unnecessary conflict.
7. Emergency Response Plan: Create an emergency response plan to address urgent situations without compromising long-term operating procedures. Include immediate escalation points and contact details for backup personnel.
8. Replacement Plan: Identify and communicate alternatives to decommissioned assets or other third-party software or hardware that may still be utilized by the organization. Record reasons for replacement and add them to change approval requests.

Some common examples of using above principle can be found below: 

### Example 1: Coordinated Release Schedule
To coordinate release schedule for new feature releases, Company X uses a quarterly calendar to allow engineers to work simultaneously on multiple projects, resulting in higher productivity and less downtime. Instead of releasing one big batch of features every six months, they break down tasks into smaller chunks according to priority and assign them to individuals for faster delivery. Each engineer works on only a few features, thus enabling them to complete each task within a shorter period of time. Overall, this leads to lower defect rates and increased customer satisfaction.

### Example 2: Continuous Improvement Planning Meetings
Company Y maintains a strategic plan that outlines the roadmap and strategy for the organization. To ensure that the plan remains up-to-date and improves over time, Company Y holds monthly meeting called “Continuous Improvement” where senior management reviews the progress made toward objectives and makes suggestions on ways to improve the plan. Additionally, each department conducts annual performance evaluations to analyze strengths and weaknesses, and identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.

### Example 3: Automated Testing and Deployment Pipeline
The Umbrella Corporation wants to automate their database migration process. They use CI/CD pipelines to automatically build, test, package, and deploy databases to production. Before launching the pipeline, they perform manual tests to validate functionality and compatibility with existing applications. Once automated testing is completed, Company Z can safely transition to full automation and release the final version of their software.

These are just three examples of using principles outlined above to create a successful change management program. Of course, there are many other ways to apply the same principles and achieve similar results. 

# 4.Case Study: How Facebook Implemented a Comprehensive Change Management Program and Why it Was So Successful

Facebook started out with a basic idea for a change management program called Operational Change Request System (OCRS). The purpose of OCRS was to make it easier for employees to file and manage operational changes at their company. However, building such a system proved to be challenging as the company had very little capacity to maintain it and no dedicated change management team. Desperate to overcome this challenge, the company hired two experienced leaders to pilot a comprehensive change management program. 

One of the leaders was a former engineering manager who owned the operational change management function, and he taught others about the benefits of introducing a change management process. He also encouraged them to think creatively to find ideas for how to improve employee safety and happiness. Another leader, also a former engineering manager, thought of something different. He did not have deep experience in change management, yet he wanted to learn and implement a fully functional solution. He recruited four additional leaders from different fields and began developing a comprehensive framework for the change management program. 

During the pilot phase, the program became famous for its rigorous execution, including rigorous scheduling and deadline setting for each step. The program also ensured that staff were fully prepared for the change by holding orientation sessions to introduce the new process and trainings to staff on how to submit change requests. Over time, the program gained traction and eventually took over most aspects of daily operations, driving significant positive changes for the company. 

Here is a summary of how the program worked:

1. Initiation: Employees fill out a change request form on a website or app.

2. Submission: After receiving approval from executive leadership, change requests are submitted to the change management team for consideration. During submission, staff collectively prepare a detailed description of the requested changes and attach supporting evidence, if any. 

3. Review: The change management team evaluates the severity, risk, and feasibility of the proposed changes, considering both internal and external factors. Based on analysis, the change management team decides whether to approve or reject the request. If rejected, staff receive feedback and recommendations to revise the proposal accordingly. 

4. Approval: Once the change request passes the initial evaluation, it is moved to the appropriate department for approval. After discussion with stakeholders, executive sponsors, and other stakeholders, the change request is either accepted or declined. 

5. Execution: Once approved, the change management team prepares detailed plans to carry out the requested changes, incorporating all approvers' inputs and other relevant expertise. Staff are trained on how to execute each step of the plan. 

6. Post-Execution Evaluation: Once the changes are complete, staff give a detailed post-change assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the change. The result is then reported to the management chain for decision-making purposes. 

7. Continuous Improvement: The program continues to evolve as more and more changes are introduced and executed. New features and functions are added to the program year after year, allowing for continuous optimization and improvement. 

Overall, Facebook's comprehensive change management program enabled it to quickly respond to evolving business needs and remain competitive in a highly competitive marketplace. Despite the challenges of building such a complex system, the program provided a major shift in the way Facebook approaches change management and transformed its practice of managing changes.
