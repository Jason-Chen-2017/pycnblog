Neural networks are known as the most powerful and versatile machine learning models in existence today. They have been used for various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, sentiment analysis etc. Despite their immense capabilities and success, they also possess certain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to perform malicious actions or even break them completely. In this article, we will discuss how backdoors work and some of the common attacks on neural networks using backdoor techniques like adversarial examples and model poisoning. We will explore the following aspects:

1. How neural networks learn?
2. What makes a network vulnerable to backdoors?
3. Types of attacks on neural networks
4. Adversarial Examples - Attack technique and implementation 
5. Model Poisoning - Attacks and Defenses with an example

After going through each aspect, I will demonstrate the code snippets that can help understand the mathematical concepts involved and then explain what is happening underneath it. Finally, I will conclude with future research opportunities and challenges faced by these types of attacks and how security practitioners should evolve towards preventing them from harming their systems.

## 2.1 Neural Networks
A neural network (NN) is a type of machine learning algorithm which can recognize patterns and relationships between data inputs. It consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, where information flows in one direction from input layer to output layer. Each node represents a neuron and has its own set of weights connected to all the incoming nodes. The activation function determines whether a neuron fires or not based on the summation of weighted inputs and thresholds. The overall goal of a NN is to learn and predict the outputs accurately given the inputs provided. A deep neural network (DNN) is a special case of NNs where there are several hidden layers between the input and output layers. DNNs achieve high accuracy and generalization ability due to their architecture and use of non-linearity functions within the hidden layers. There are many variations of different architectures available in modern NNs but the simplest ones consist of fully connected layers. An illustration of a simple NN structure is shown below: 


In the above figure, we can see the basic components of a simple neural network having two input features, three hidden units, and one output unit. Input features are first multiplied by respective weight matrices and added up to get the total input into each neuron. The resulting value is passed through a nonlinear activation function, such as ReLU, Tanh, or Sigmoid. This process happens for both the input and hidden layers. Once the final results from the output layer arrive at the output unit, they are processed further to make predictions or classify the inputs accordingly. 

## 2.2 Activation Function
The purpose of an activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the neural network so that it becomes capable of modeling complex relationships between the input variables and output variable(s). Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU. Below are brief explanations of each of these functions: 

1. Sigmoid function: The sigmoid function takes any real number as input and maps it onto a scale of 0 to 1. Mathematically, it computes S(x)=1/(1+e^(-x)). When x is negative, S(x) approaches zero while when x is positive, S(x) approaches 1. Hence, the sigmoid function can be interpreted as probability. For binary classification problems, a threshold of 0.5 can often be used to convert probabilities into class labels. However, during training, sigmoid suffers from vanishing gradient problem since the slope of the curve becomes very small as x goes to infinity. 

2. Tanh function: Similar to the sigmoid function, tanh squashes any real number onto a range of -1 to 1. However, unlike sigmoid, tanh avoids saturation when x is large and hence helps avoid vanishing gradients. The derivative of tanh is equal to 1-tanh(z)^2 and thus enables easier calculation of gradients. 

3. Rectified linear unit (ReLU): The rectified linear unit (ReLU) is another widely used activation function. Unlike other activation functions, ReLU does not saturate and remains mostly constant in negative regions. Its main advantage over other activation functions lies in its simplicity and ease of computation. During forward propagation, if the input is less than zero, it returns zero; otherwise, it passes the input unchanged. Thus, it cannot be used directly in place of other activation functions because it skips over some values without affecting the result much. Instead, it is usually combined with other activation functions alongside dropout regularization to reduce overfitting. 

In our discussion of backdoors, we focus mainly on the last activation function, i.e., the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which is commonly found in neural networks. Other activation functions may be vulnerable too, depending on the context. Nevertheless, understanding their behavior is essential for effective defense against backdoors later on. 

## 2.3 Gradient Descent Optimization
Gradient descent optimization is a key mechanism behind training neural networks. It involves computing the gradient of loss function with respect to the parameters (weights and biases) of the network and updating those parameters iteratively until convergence or until a predefined stopping criterion is met. The specific optimization strategy depends on the nature of the cost function being optimized and the hardware resources available for processing. Popular optimizers include stochastic gradient descent, Adam, AdaGrad, RMSprop, and more. Here's a simplified version of the algorithm:

Repeat {
    Compute gradient of loss wrt network parameters
    Update network parameters using optimizer step
} Until converged OR maximum iterations reached

The cost function measures how well the predicted outputs match the actual targets. For example, in supervised learning scenarios, it is typically measured by cross entropy error between predicted outputs and true target values. Gradients tell us how to change the weights and biases in order to minimize the cost function. The optimizer updates the weights and biases using the computed gradients. The idea is to find the minimum point on the cost surface defined by the current parameter values. By repeating this process many times, we can eventually find a local minima or a global minimum depending on the choice of hyperparameters. Here are some popular optimization strategies:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): This is a standard approach for training neural networks and works well in practice. At each iteration, we compute the gradient only for a single sample rather than for the entire batch. This makes it faster and requires smaller batches compared to mini-batch methods like momentum. Other variants of SGD involve adaptive learning rates, nesterov accelerated gradient, and others. 

2. Momentum: This method adds additional term to the gradient update that encourages the movement in the direction of previous gradients instead of taking a random walk. It introduces a velocity term that captures the direction of previous gradients and projects them ahead. Another benefit of momentum is that it prevents oscillations and improves stability of the optimization process. However, choosing the appropriate hyperparameters such as the momentum coefficient and the learning rate can be challenging. 

3. Adagrad: This method adjusts the learning rate for individual parameters based on the historical gradient square. It calculates an exponentially weighted average of squared gradient values and divides the learning rate by the root mean squared value to ensure that no individual parameter dominates the contribution of the gradient. This method is designed to handle sparse or noisy gradients and produces smoother updates. 

4. RMSprop: This method similar to Adagrad but uses a moving average of second moments of the gradient instead of just the square. It ensures that the gradient update is unbiased and works better with sparse gradients. Moreover, it provides adaptive learning rate tuning. 

In summary, we need to understand the basics of neural networks, activation functions, and optimization algorithms before delving into backdoor attacks on them. Let's move on to the next section.
