Gradient descent (GD) is a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning and deep learning to minimize the loss function of a model or a neural network during training process. However, GD has several drawbacks, such as slow convergence speed, non-convex optimization problem and no guarantee for global minimum. The random gradient descent algorithm (RGD) was proposed by Wang et al., 2017, which is an improved version of traditional GD that addresses these issues. RGD explores different directions at each step of the training process instead of always using only one direction to avoid being trapped in local minima. It uses mini-batches of randomly sampled data points to update parameters and improve the generalization ability of the model. 

In this article, we will first introduce some basic concepts related to GD and its variants, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), batch gradient descent (BGD) and mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD). We will then describe how RGD works, and present concrete examples with detailed explanations and code implementation. Finally, we will discuss future trends and challenges for RGD in the field of AI and applications in finance, medical imaging and natural language processing.

To fully understand this article, readers are required to have a strong background knowledge in linear algebra, calculus, probability theory and statistics, and programming skills in Python or other languages. In addition, they should be familiar with popular deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.

 # Introduction
Gradient descent is a widely used optimization technique in machine learning and deep learning to find the optimal solution of an objective function by iteratively moving towards a minimum of that function's value. Before discussing about RGD specifically, let’s briefly review what GD is and its key features:

1. Objective function: GD can be applied to any objective function of interest, typically cost functions in supervised learning settings or negative log likelihood in unsupervised learning settings. 

2. Optimization direction: In conventional GD, we start from an initial point and move our way towards a minimum along a specific direction based on the gradient of the objective function at that point. This direction is determined automatically by calculating the derivative of the function with respect to each parameter. 

3. Step size: As the name suggests, the step size controls the size of the movement at each iteration, i.e., how far we move away from the current position before taking another step. Too large a step size may lead us outside of the basin of attraction where the objective function has its minimum, while too small a step size may result in very long computation times or even divergence. 

However, there are several limitations to traditional GD when it comes to handling complex problems or models. These include:

- Slow Convergence Speed: Traditional GD is not guaranteed to converge to the global minimum because it relies on a single direction and does not explore different directions across iterations. This makes it difficult to escape local minima if there are many minima in the search space.
- Non-convex Optimization Problem: Since GD updates the parameters according to the gradient at the current point, the curvature of the surface around the current point affects the direction of the update and thus also the rate of convergence. Therefore, if the objective function has multiple local minima or has high curvature regions, traditional GD might struggle to find the global minimum. 
- No Guarantees for Global Minimum: Although GD is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum, the exact location of the global minimum cannot be determined globally since we do not know which direction we started out from and there is no guarantee that our starting point is within the basin of attraction. 


Random Gradient Descent (RGD) is an extension of traditional GD designed to address these issues and overcome them by exploring different directions at each iteration using mini-batches of randomly sampled data points. RGD differs from traditional GD mainly in two aspects:

1. Exploration: Instead of always moving along a fixed direction, RGD moves along a set of candidate directions called "directions of exploration" at each iteration. Each direction corresponds to a perturbation of the previous parameter values, resulting in a new updated parameter vector. By doing so, RGD generates a wider range of possible solutions and can explore more promising areas of the search space than traditional GD. 

2. Mini-batch sampling: Unlike traditional GD, RGD processes batches of data points instead of individual data points. Batches provide better memory efficiency and reduce noise by reducing the correlation between samples. Moreover, mini-batch sampling allows the use of both batch-level and sample-level information to update the parameters.


By combining the exploration capability of RGD with mini-batch sampling, it yields significant improvements in terms of performance, stability and robustness compared to traditional GD. Furthermore, RGD can effectively handle non-convex optimization problems and ensure global convergence despite the presence of multiple local minima or complicated surfaces. Overall, RGD represents a paradigm shift in modern machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
