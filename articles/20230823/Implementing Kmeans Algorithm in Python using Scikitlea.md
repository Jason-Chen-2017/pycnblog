# 1.简介
  

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters based on their feature similarity. It works by iteratively assigning each data point to a cluster center, and then recomputing the centroid of each cluster as the mean of all its member points. The algorithm terminates when the desired number of clusters has been achieved or when none of the data points change their assigned cluster during an iteration.

In this article, we will implement the k-means algorithm from scratch using Python's scikit-learn library. We'll also explore different ways to choose the optimal number of clusters for our dataset, such as elbow method and silhouette score. Finally, we'll discuss some potential issues with k-means clustering, including how it can fail if there are too many outliers or irrelevant features in our dataset. 


By the end of this article, you should be able to perform k-means clustering efficiently and accurately on your own datasets using Python's scikit-learn library. Good luck!


# 2. 预备知识
Before starting implementing k-means clustering in Python, let’s first understand some important concepts and terms used in k-means clustering.

## 2.1 Clustering 
Clustering refers to the task of grouping similar objects together into groups or clusters. In other words, given a set of data points, we want to group them into different subsets (clusters), where each subset contains only data points that are similar to one another according to certain criteria. In simpler terms, the goal is to identify patterns and trends in data by separating different elements into distinct categories.  

Clusters may represent various types of observations, such as customers who purchase similar products, employees working at similar jobs, or flights flying through the same route. In contrast, individual data points within a cluster usually share common characteristics, such as age, gender, income level, or location. By identifying patterns and relationships between different subsets of data, clustering algorithms help businesses make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, and optimize resources. 

## 2.2 Feature Vector
A vector represents a collection of values ordered by position. For example, consider the following two vectors A = [a1, a2,..., ak] and B = [b1, b2,..., bk]. Each element in A and B corresponds to a specific feature, such as height, weight, salary, etc., and they both belong to a particular person or object. When we try to compare two people based on their attributes, we create a feature vector consisting of these attributes and use it to determine whether they are alike or dissimilar. We don't know the actual value of any feature, but we do know which ones are most important to us and what their relative strengths are compared to one another. This process is known as dimensionality reduction, and it helps to simplify the analysis of large sets of data.

## 2.3 Euclidean Distance
Euclidean distance measures the length of the straight line connecting two points in space. Specifically, it calculates the distance between two n-dimensional vectors x=(x1,...,xn) and y=(y1,...,yn). The formula is:

$$d(x,y)=\sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2 +...+(x_n-y_n)^2}$$

This distance measure is commonly used in clustering because it ensures that similar objects are placed closer to each other than dissimilar objects. Moreover, it satisfies several desirable properties, such as non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, triangle inequality, and the positive definiteness of $d$. 

The key idea behind k-means clustering is to divide a set of N data points into K clusters, where each cluster represents a subset of data points whose features are closest to the cluster center. The optimization process involves updating the positions of cluster centers until convergence, i.e., until no further changes occur in the assignment of data points to clusters. Once converged, each cluster becomes a dense region of high density separated by low density regions, corresponding to local maxima and minima in the density function of the input data. In practice, we use an initialization technique called random partition, where we randomly assign initial cluster centers without regard for the underlying distribution of the data points.

# 3. Basic Concepts and Terms

Now that we've learned about the basics of clustering and feature vectors, let's dive deeper into k-means clustering. To start off, let's define some vocabulary related to k-means clustering:
