# 1.简介
  

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique that helps us in understanding complex relationships between different variables in our datasets. In this article, we will explore how PCA works and implement it using Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy. We'll also discuss its advantages and limitations, as well as potential use cases for applying PCA. 

PCA can be used in various fields such as finance, marketing, biology, and physics. It is commonly used in exploratory analysis and in pattern recognition tasks like face recognition or object detection in computer vision systems. However, it's important to note that PCA is not recommended for large datasets as it requires both computational resources and high memory storage space due to its size. Moreover, it may lead to overfitting if the number of features exceeds the sample size. Nevertheless, it remains an effective technique for reducing complexity and visualizing high dimensional data sets. 

In summary, PCA is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing multivariate data with fewer dimensions than the original feature space. It has many practical applications across numerous industries including banking, insurance, healthcare, transportation, retail, and manufacturing. Let’s dive deeper into how PCA works under the hood.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before we get started implementing PCA, let's understand some basic concepts and terminology associated with it.

1. Data: A matrix of numbers representing observations on multiple variables. For example, consider a dataset containing heights, weights, shoe sizes, etc. of several individuals. The rows represent each individual while the columns represent their corresponding measurements. 

2. Features: Columns in the data matrix that capture meaningful patterns or characteristics of the observed phenomenon. These could be age, gender, education level, income, etc.

3. Observations/Samples: Rows in the data matrix representing specific instances of the phenomenon being studied. For instance, one row could correspond to a particular person's measurement values.

4. Variance: Measure of dispersion or spread around the mean. Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2] where X represents a random variable and E[] denotes the expected value operator. Higher variance indicates higher degree of spread or dispersion around the mean.

5. Covariance Matrix: Square matrix that measures the inter-dependence amongst the different features. Cov_ij = E[(x_i - E[x_i]) * (x_j - E[x_j])] where x_i and x_j are two random variables representing the i^th and j^th features respectively. 

6. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: Two concepts related to the covariance matrix that are essential for the PCA algorithm. Eigenvalues tell us about the magnitude of each eigenvector, whereas eigenvectors point in the direction of maximum variability in the data. If you have a vector V, its eigenvalue will be V^T.Cov.V and its eigenvector will be equal to V.

Now, we can move onto the details of how PCA works mathematically and implement it using Python code. Here are the steps involved:

1. Compute the mean of the dataset and subtract it from each observation to center them at the origin. This is necessary since PCA seeks to maximize the variance of each feature within the same scale.


2. Calculate the covariance matrix of the centered data. The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix represent the variances of each feature, while the off-diagonal elements measure the covariances between pairs of features. 


3. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Eigendecomposition gives us the vectors pointing towards the directions of maximum variability and their corresponding magnitudes. Sort the eigenvectors based on their eigenvalues in descending order and select k eigenvectors that explain the majority of the variance. Note that k should be chosen based on the explained variance percentage required.
   
   
   Here is the Python implementation of step 3 using NumPy:
   
   ```python
   # compute the covariance matrix
   cov_mat = np.cov(data_centered.T)

   # perform eigendecomposition
   eig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)

   # sort eigenvectors by decreasing order of eigenvalues
   idx = eig_vals.argsort()[::-1]
   eig_vals = eig_vals[idx]
   eig_vecs = eig_vecs[:, idx]
   ```

4. Create the projection matrix P using the selected k eigenvectors. Multiplying the centered data matrix by the projection matrix converts it into a lower dimensional space.
   
   
   Here is the Python implementation of step 4 using NumPy:
   
   ```python
   # project data into lower dimensions
   W = eig_vecs[:, :k]
   data_proj = np.dot(data_centered, W)
   ```

5. Visualize the projected data using scatter plots or other techniques. By observing the distribution of points in the transformed space, we gain insights into the underlying structure of the data.
