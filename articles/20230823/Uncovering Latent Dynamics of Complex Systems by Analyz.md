# 1.简介
  

Complex systems are a combination of diverse components working together to create patterns and behavior that are difficult to observe or predict directly. A key challenge in studying such systems is understanding how their internal states evolve over time due to the interactions between different components. 

In this paper we propose an approach called **latent space dynamics** (LSD) for analyzing sequences of images captured from complex system as they interact with each other during operation. LSD explores the dynamic structure of latent representations learned through deep neural networks, which capture the temporal evolution of individual elements within the complex system, while also identifying meaningful changes in the underlying system behavior. We present an end-to-end framework consisting of image analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and prediction models that can be trained on large datasets of sequence data. The resulting predictions reveal insights into the structural and temporal characteristics of the complex system's behavior.

The primary motivation behind our work is to address one of the biggest challenges facing researchers in this field: finding ways to leverage domain expertise and physical intuition when interpreting complex behavior observed via visual observations. By unifying multiple views of a system and enabling statistical inference, we hope to enable more comprehensive interpretations of complex systems' behavior and identify interesting trends and mechanisms hidden within them.

## 2.1 Complex System
A complex system is defined as any system that consists of many interacting components, including both autonomous and non-autonomous entities. It encompasses social, biological, chemical, mechanical, electronic, computer, and other types of systems. Examples of complex systems include civilizations, societies, economies, and transportation networks. Some examples of specific types of complex systems are shown below:

### Social networks
Social networks connect people across geographies and cultures, providing opportunities for communication, interaction, and collaboration. They constitute a complex system of actors, relationships, and resources, all of which have a significant impact on the overall functioning of society. Examples of social networks include Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn.

### Biochemical reactions
Biochemical reactions combine various organic compounds to produce new products and/or modify existing ones. This process requires several steps involving numerous molecular interactions, coordination of chemical transformations, and electrochemical energy transfer. Biochemical reactions play a crucial role in biology, chemistry, medicine, and engineering. Examples of biochemical reactions include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), transcription factor binding site identification (TFBS), cell cycle progression, and DNA repair.

### Transportation networks
Transportation networks are critical infrastructure services provided by governments, companies, and individuals, providing passengers with information about routes, times, prices, and fares. These networks involve complicated interdependencies among various modes of transportation such as railways, roads, airplanes, and boats. Examples of transportation networks include Google Maps, Uber, AirBnB, and Deliveroo.

## 2.2 Image Analysis
Image analysis involves techniques used to extract useful information from digital images, especially those acquired by sensors or cameras. Many applications of image analysis in complex systems include monitoring environmental conditions, detecting anomalous events, surveillance, robotics, and security. In particular, image analysis has been widely applied to analyze sequences of images generated by complex systems such as transportation networks and medical imaging.

Common tasks involved in image analysis are segmentation, feature detection, object recognition, motion tracking, and pattern recognition. Segmentation refers to the partitioning of an image into multiple regions or segments based on certain properties like color or texture. Feature detection identifies distinctive features like edges, corners, and curves in an image, allowing us to locate and track these objects throughout its lifetime. Object recognition involves recognizing categories of objects in an image using machine learning algorithms. Motion tracking helps in locating moving objects in videos and identifying their trajectories. Pattern recognition involves identifying patterns or correlations in the data obtained from images.
