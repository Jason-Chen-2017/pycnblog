Overall, our goal is to provide an accessible yet comprehensive introduction to the field of deep learning for those who are newcomers or experts in the field.
# 2.基本概念术语说明
The following terms and concepts should be known before diving into the core content of the book:
- Neural Network: A neural network is a type of artificial intelligence model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain called the neuron. The basic building block of a neural network is a node which represents a mathematical operation on its inputs. These nodes are connected together via weights which determine the strength of each connection between them. An input vector can be passed through the network and transformed based on the connections and weighted sums until it reaches the output layer. There are different types of neural networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Different layers of these networks perform specialized operations on the data.
- Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is one of the most commonly used optimization techniques in machine learning. It involves updating the parameters of the model iteratively in order to minimize the cost function. At each iteration, the gradient of the cost function w.r.t. the model's parameters is computed and then updated using a step size determined by the algorithm. Commonly used variants include stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and mini-batch SGD.
- Backpropagation: Backpropagation is the process of computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters during training. This helps the optimizer update the model's parameters to minimize the error in prediction.
- Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons within a layer are ignored during forward propagation to prevent co-adaptation among them. During backpropagation, only the active neurons contribute to computing the gradients leading to better generalization performance.
- Batch Normalization: Batch normalization is a technique used to improve the stability of neural networks during training by normalizing the inputs to each hidden unit. It brings down the dependence on initialization and makes the training faster and more stable.
- Hyperparameters: Hyperparameters are variables whose values cannot be learned from the data but need to be set before training begins. They control the complexity of the model, such as the number of layers, nodes per layer, activation functions etc. Hyperparameter tuning is crucial in order to obtain good results while avoiding overfitting.
# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
This section explains the major concepts and ideas behind various deep learning architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short term memory networks (LSTM). We will not go into details of how they work technically but instead focus on providing intuition around their design decisions and mathematically derived formulas.
### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used for analyzing visual imagery, often in the form of images, videos or other 2D or 3D data sets. CNN's main idea is to extract features from the input image by convolving multiple filters across the input image. Each filter responds to different parts of the input, thereby extracting different features. The resulting feature maps are then passed through a series of fully connected layers to produce the final output. Here is a graphical representation of a simple CNN architecture:


In traditional neural networks, the data is flattened and fed into the first layer of neurons, which processes it as a sequence of numbers. However, in case of images, convolutional neural networks use filters to extract features at different spatial scales. Filters are small sliding windows that move across the input image, multiplying corresponding pixel values and producing outputs at specific locations. Features at different scales can capture complex patterns and textures present in the input image, increasing the ability of the network to recognize objects and classify them effectively. Additionally, pooling layers can further reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and preserve the most important information. 

Mathematically, let X denote the input matrix with dimensions [m x n], where m and n are the height and width of the input image respectively. Let F denote the weight matrix with dimensions [f x f] and K denote the number of filters k. Then the output matrix Y obtained after applying the convolutional layer with k filters is given by:

Y[i,j] = sum_{p=0}^{m-f+1}sum_{q=0}^{n-f+1}{X[i+p,j+q]F^T[p,q]}

where ^T denotes transpose operation. The bias vectors bk are added elementwise to each filter before multiplication. The non-linearity g is applied elementwise to the output of each filter to introduce non-linearity into the model. Pooling is done using max or average pooling depending upon the requirement. 

Here is a detailed explanation of individual steps involved in performing a single forward pass of a CNN:

1. Input Image -> Filter -> Convolve -> Add Bias -> Non-Linearity -> Activation Map
2. Max Pooling / Average Pooling -> Flatten -> Fully Connected Layer -> Output

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are powerful models used for sequential data such as text, audio, video, and other time dependent data. RNNs consist of cells that operate on sequences of inputs, maintaining internal states that hold contextual information across timesteps. RNN's key advantage is their ability to capture temporal dependencies between events in the sequence. 

A common type of RNN is the LSTM cell, which consists of three gate mechanisms - input, forget, and output gates. The input gate controls whether the new information entered into the cell should be added to the old state, the forget gate controls what information to throw away from the cell, and the output gate decides which part of the cell’s hidden state to expose as output at each timestep. LSTMs make use of tanh and sigmoid functions to regulate the gates' activation levels, allowing them to learn long range dependencies efficiently without suffering vanishing gradient problems caused by naive implementations. 

Mathematically, let Xt denote the input vector at timestep t, and ht−1 the previous hidden state. The equations for calculating ht for any given t are:

C[t] = ft * C[t-1] + it * (Xt @ Wx + Ht-1 @ Wh)
ht = ot * tanh(Ct)

where ft, it, ot, Ct, Wx, Ht-1, Wh denote the forget, input, output, cell state, input weights, hidden state weights, and hidden state-to-hidden state weights respectively. The ct term is calculated as a linear combination of xt and the previous cell state multiplied by the forget gate value.

To train an RNN, the backpropagation algorithm is typically used to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters, similar to traditional feedforward neural networks.

### Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) are another type of RNN that captures long-term dependencies by introducing a special memory cell that can store information for longer periods of time than traditional RNNs. The primary difference between LSTMs and standard RNNs is that LSTMs maintain both long-term memory and short-term memory separately, enabling them to handle variable length input sequences.

An LSTM cell works similar to a traditional RNN cell, except that it includes two additional gates, the cell input gate ci and the cell output gate co. Additionally, the cell state ct is passed through a tanh function before being used as input to the next cell. Similar to traditional RNNs, LSTMs make use of tanh and sigmoid functions to regulate the gates' activation levels, allowing them to learn long range dependencies efficiently without suffering vanishing gradient problems caused by naive implementations.

Mathematically, let Xt denote the input vector at timestep t, and ht−1 the previous hidden state. The equations for calculating ht for any given t are:

ft = σ(Wfxt + bf) # Forget Gate
it = σ(Wixt + bi) # Input Gate
ot = σ(Woxt + bo) # Output Gate
ct = tanh(Wcxt + bc) # Cell State

C[t] = ft * C[t-1] + it * ct # Update Cell State

ht = ot * tanh(C[t]) # Hidden State

The cf, ifo, ct and ht terms represent the forget, input, output, cell state, and hidden state respectively at each timestep. The forget gate determines which information to discard from the cell state, the input gate determines which new information to add to the cell state, and the output gate decides which part of the cell's hidden state to expose as output at each timestep. Finally, the tanh activation function is used to bound the cell state within the (-1,1) interval and encourage the cell to stay close to zero.

Training an LSTM is very similar to training an RNN, except that dropout can be employed to prevent overfitting and increase regularization. As an example, here is a summary of how an LSTM can be trained to predict the next word in a sentence using mini-batches of sentences:

1. Initialize h0 = zeros, c0 = zeros
2. Load batch of sentences (X) and targets (Y) 
3. Perform Forward Pass:
   - Compute i = σ(Wix + bx)
   - Compute f = σ(Wfx + bf)
   - Compute o = σ(Wox + bo)
   - Compute c't = tanh(Wcx't + bc')
   - Compute ct = f*c't + i*Ct
   - Compute yh = softmax(Whyh + byh)
4. Calculate Loss Function: 
   - Cross Entropy Loss (loss(yi, yh))
5. Perform Backward Pass:
   - ∂L/∂Wyh = ((yh - y)/mb) x h
   - ∂L/∂bc' = (∑(c't - C')) / mb
   - ∂L/∂Wd = (∑d*(tanh(Wt(st−1) + Uh))) / mb
   - ∂L/∂bu = (∑d) / mb
   - δt = (∑((∂L/∂ft)*(f*(1-f))))
   - δt = δt + (∑((∂L/∂if)*(i*(1-i))))
   - δt = δt + (∑((∂L/∂Ct)*(((f*Ct)+i*(c't-c))*sigmoid(Ot))))
   - st = st−1 + η*((∑(δt))/mb)
