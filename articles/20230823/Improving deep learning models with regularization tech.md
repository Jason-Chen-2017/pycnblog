# 2.基本概念术语说明
## Dropout
Dropout是一种正则化方法，其定义是在神经网络中，随机丢弃一定比例的节点输出，使得每个节点都要学到比较独特的特性，从而避免了过拟合现象。


如图所示，红色节点输出被随机丢弃，蓝色节点没有被丢弃。在测试阶段，所有节点都参与计算。

## Batch Normalization(BN)
BN是在神经网络每一层输入数据之前加入归一化处理，目的是消除输入数据分布中的均值与方差的影响，从而使各层的数据分布更加一致，提高模型的收敛速度和稳定性。


如图所示，BN首先计算当前层输入数据的均值和标准差，然后用这些参数代替原始输入数据，减少了层间协调的问题。

## Regularization Techniques in Deep Learning 
Regularization techniques in deep learning are used to reduce the overfitting problem of machine learning models that have a high degree of complexity. The main goal of regularization is to prevent the model from being too complex and unable to fit training data well. 

There are two types of regularization techniques:

1. **Weight Decay**: This technique helps to minimize the magnitude of weights during training by adding an additional penalty term to the loss function.
2. **Early Stopping**: This method monitors the validation error on the training set and stops the optimization process when it starts increasing again. It helps to avoid overfitting of the model which means reducing the generalization error.

In addition to these, there are several other regularization techniques such as L1, L2, Data Augmentation, etc., but they are not frequently used in deep learning. Dropout and BN methods are widely used due to their effectiveness in reducing overfitting problems while improving accuracy. In this article, we will discuss how they work and apply them in different tasks for better performance.

## Dropout
### Introduction

Dropout has been shown to be effective at reducing overfitting in deep neural networks (DNNs). Overfitting occurs when a DNN model fits the training dataset very well but does not perform well on unseen test data. To address this issue, researchers proposed using dropout layers after fully connected or convolutional layers in the DNN architecture. During training, each node outputs from the dropped out nodes are multiplied by zero, effectively dropping them out of the network’s computations. This forces the remaining neurons to learn more robust features that are relevant to the task at hand. As a result, the overall complexity of the DNN model decreases, leading to improved generalization capability. 


### How it works?

Dropout can be applied to both fully connected layers and convolutional layers. For example, let's assume that we have three hidden layers in our DNN with 500 units per layer. We want to use dropout between the first and second hidden layers. During training time, for every mini-batch of examples, we randomly drop out some of the hidden units in the first layer. Each unit output is then multiplied by zero, so its contribution to the next layer input becomes zero. However, another copy of the unit remains in the network, acting as a noise source for other units in the previous layer. 

This approach trains multiple independent copies of the same network, resulting in increased diversity in the learned representations. By doing so, Dropout can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.


To achieve optimal performance, the ratio of kept to dropped units should be chosen empirically based on the size of the network and the desired level of modeling capacity. A common choice is to keep only the top $p$% most active units during training and discard the rest. This strategy provides a balance between reducing overfitting and encouraging feature selection. Additionally, a higher value of $p$ may lead to faster convergence and reduced memory usage compared to lower values.

### Formula

The mathematical formula for dropout is given below:

$$y = \frac{x}{p} * r $$

where x is the input, p is the probability of keeping a unit, and r is a random binary variable equal to either 1 or 0 with equal probabilities. If r=1, the output y equals x divided by p; otherwise, it equals 0. The average rate at which y is nonzero is equal to the inverse of p. Hence, dropout is equivalent to averaging over many randomly perturbed versions of the inputs, where each version has zero mean and variance one. Therefore, the expectation and variance of the output are both approximately preserved under dropout, making it a good regularization technique for deep neural networks.



### Benefits of using Dropout
As mentioned earlier, dropout reduces the complexity of the DNN model, enabling it to learn more robust features that are useful for predicting new data points. Dropout also prevents co-adaptation of neurons, which can accelerate the learning process and improve generalization capabilities. Moreover, dropout enables us to train large-scale DNNs on smaller datasets, which saves computational resources and improves speed and scalability. Finally, dropout is less prone to dead neurons because any inactive unit has no role in computing the forward pass of the network, thus helping to remove the tendency for neural networks to become stuck in local minima. Overall, dropout results in better generalization and leads to significant improvements in various deep learning applications, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
