Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this article, we will learn how SVR works in detail with the help of Python scikit-learn library. We will also implement an example problem of predicting house prices based on various features using SVR model. Finally, we will analyze the results obtained from our implementation. This article assumes some familiarity with linear algebra and basic concepts of machine learning algorithms such as training data, feature vectors, hyperparameters, loss functions etc. If you are new to these topics, please refer to other articles or tutorials before continuing with this one. 

Support vector machines (SVMs), along with neural networks, have been widely used in modern machine learning applications. The advantages of using support vector machines over traditional methods like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests are known. However, they require careful handling of outliers, high dimensionality, and nonlinearity issues. Thus, it has become increasingly popular to use kernel methods to transform input data into higher dimensional space where standard linear models like SVMs can work better than deep neural networks. 

Similarly, SVR allows us to handle non-linear relationships between variables by using kernel function to map them into a higher dimensional space. Kernelized SVR is often referred to as kernel SVR, which uses Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. In this article, we will see how to use RBF kernel for implementing SVR in Python scikit-learn library.

## Supervised Learning Problem:
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, meaning that each sample is associated with a target variable that needs to be predicted. Examples of supervised learning problems include classification problems, where the goal is to assign samples to different categories, and regression problems, where the goal is to estimate a continuous value for the target variable. For example, we may want to predict the price of a house based on its attributes such as number of rooms, area, location, and year built.

In this article, we will focus on building a support vector regression (SVR) model to predict house prices based on certain features. Here's what the dataset looks like:

Each row represents a house and contains information about its area, number of rooms, location, year built, and sale price. The goal here is to build a model that takes in several features such as the size of the house (area), number of bedrooms, age of the property, number of floors, and proximity to schools, and outputs a predicted sale price for the house.

## Model Definition:
A support vector regression (SVR) model consists of two main components - a set of hyperparameters, and a similarity function called the kernel function. The goal of SVR is to find the best hyperplane that fits the training data while satisfying certain constraints specified by regularization parameters. Hyperparameters control the complexity of the model and must be tuned carefully to avoid overfitting or underfitting. Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that discourages complex models. The kernel function maps the original input data into a higher dimensional space where standard linear models like SVMs can work better. There are many types of kernels available such as radial basis function (RBF), polynomial, and sigmoidal. In general, RBF kernel performs well when dealing with non-linear relationships between variables and gives good accuracy in most cases.

The mathematical representation of an SVR model includes three key elements - a predictor function $\hat{y}(x)$, a cost function $J(\theta)$, and optimization criterion. Predictor function represents the output of the model given a set of inputs $X$. Cost function measures how well the model fits the training data and is defined as follows:

$$ J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}_{i}-y_{i})^{2}+\lambda\left \| \theta \right \| _{2}^{2}$$

where $\hat{y}$ is the predicted value for a particular observation, $y$ is the actual value, m is the total number of observations, $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, and $\| \cdot \|_{2}^{2}$ denotes the squared L2 norm of a matrix or vector. Optimization criterion specifies the method used for finding the optimal values of $\theta$, such as gradient descent or Newton's method.

We can simplify the above equation further as follows:

$$ J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{y}_{i}-y_{i})^{2}+\frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{n}{\theta_{j}^{2}} $$

Here n is the number of parameters in $\theta$. By minimizing the cost function, we try to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Adding regularization helps prevent overfitting and improves the overall performance of the model.

Finally, the support vector regression model can be written mathematically as follows:

$$ y(x)=\text{constant}+f(x)+\epsilon,$$

where f(x) is the hypothesis function that depends on the parameters theta and the input X, constant is a bias term that shifts the entire curve upwards or downwards depending on the intercept parameter c, and epsilon is a random noise term added to ensure that the model is not exactly fitting the training data perfectly. Mathematically speaking, the prediction made by the SVR model for any given point is simply the dot product between the hypothesis function and the corresponding coefficients in theta.

## Training Data:Training data refers to the subset of all available data used to train the model. It consists of pairs of input features and their corresponding expected output values. The goal is to choose the hyperparameters that result in the lowest possible error rate on the training data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on unseen data.
