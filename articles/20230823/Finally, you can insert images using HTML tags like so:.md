# 1.简介
  

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It defines the structure of a webpage by marking up its elements with different tags such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, tables etc. The primary purpose of using HTML is to display content on the internet. However, it also provides various other features that aid in making web pages dynamic, interactive, mobile-friendly, and search engine optimised. 

In this article, we will learn how to insert an image into an HTML page using only the `<img>` tag and provide some examples. We will also cover a few more advanced topics related to inserting images including displaying responsive images, lazy loading images, and working with image files stored locally or remotely.

## HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create web pages and web applications and consists of several basic building blocks: 

1. Text Content - This includes all the visible text on the page such as headings, paragraphs, menus, images, captions etc. 

2. Markup - These are symbols or codes embedded within the text content to indicate certain types of formatting or layout requirements. Examples include boldface, italics, underline, superscripts and subscripts. 

3. Links - They are hyperlinks that connect one part of a document to another resource such as an external website, email address, anchor point on the same page or even a file download. 

4. Images - These are multimedia objects that may be inserted onto a web page either statically or dynamically via scripting. 

5. Forms - These allow users to input data or select options through various fields such as text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, submit buttons etc. 

6. Layout - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for defining the visual presentation of a web page. It specifies styles for the different elements of the page such as fonts, colors, layouts, borders, margins, padding etc. 

7. Scripts - JavaScript enables dynamic functionality on a web page. It allows web developers to add interactivity, animations, and front-end validation to their websites. 


Together these building blocks make up the HTML code which is then interpreted by the browser to display the final result.

## Tags

## Attributes
Attributes are extra pieces of information attached to each HTML tag. Some attributes have predefined values while others can be customised based on our needs. An attribute typically appears after the opening tag and before the closing tag separated by a space. For example, `<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">` sets the value of "type" attribute to "text", "placeholder" attribute to "Enter your name". Note that attributes should always be enclosed in double quotes (" ").

To insert an image into an HTML page using only the `<img>` tag, follow these steps: 

1. Create a new HTML file in any text editor or IDE. 
2. Add the following line at the beginning of the file: 
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <title>Image Example</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <!-- Image insertion starts here -->
       
     </body>
   </html>
   ```
   3. Inside the body section, place the `<img>` tag with appropriate attributes:
      ```html
      <body>
        <!-- Image insertion starts here -->
        <!-- Image insertion ends here -->
      </body>
      ```
   
   
   4. Save the file and open it in a web browser. Your image should now appear on the screen. 
   
   5. If you want to change the size or aspect ratio of the image, modify the `width` and/or `height` attributes inside the `<img>` tag accordingly. For example, 
      ```html
      ```
      
      This will resize the image to fit within a rectangle with dimensions 200 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall. Remember that units like "px" or "%" are required for both attributes.
      
   6. To make the image responsive, i.e., adjust its size to suit different devices' screensizes, use media queries inside the `<style>` tag of the HTML file. Here's an example:

      ```html
      <head>
       ...
        <style>
          /* Default style */
          img {
            max-width: 100%;
            height: auto;
          }
          
          @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
            /* Adjustments for smaller screens */
            img {
              max-width: 100vw;
            }
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      ```
      
      In this example, the default style applies when the viewport width is larger than 600 pixels. When the viewport becomes smaller, the image's maximum width is adjusted to fill the entire viewport width (`max-width: 100vw`). You can customize these rules according to your preferences. 
      
   7. If you want to load the image lazily (i.e., only when it enters the user's view), use the `loading` attribute inside the `<img>` tag along with the `IntersectionObserver` API. Here's an updated version of the previous example:

      ```html
      <script>
        const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
          entries.forEach(entry => {
            if (entry.isIntersecting &&!entry.target.hasAttribute('src')) {
            }
          });
        });
        
        const image = document.querySelector('img');
        observer.observe(image);
      </script>
      
      ```
      
      In this example, a new instance of the `IntersectionObserver` class is created and observes the image element. Whenever the image enters the user's viewport, its source attribute is replaced with the actual URL of the image file. Note that we need to manually specify the `loading` attribute to enable lazy loading.
      
# 4.具体代码实例与解释说明
Here's an example HTML code snippet that demonstrates inserting an image using the `<img>` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Image Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
      <p>This is an example of how to insert an image using the &lt;img&gt; tag.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Advanced Image Insertion Techniques</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Responsive Images:</strong> Using media queries to ensure high quality images across multiple screen sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Lazy loading images to speed up initial page load times and save bandwidth.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote Images:</strong> Working with images hosted outside of the current domain.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    <script>
      const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
        entries.forEach(entry => {
          if (entry.isIntersecting &&!entry.target.hasAttribute('src')) {
            entry.target.setAttribute('src', 'https://via.placeholder.com/600x400');
          }
        });
      });
      
      const image = document.querySelector('img');
      observer.observe(image);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, we've added two div sections inside the body section to demonstrate how to separate content into different sections. Then we've added a simple image using the `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute pointing to a remote image hosting service called Placeholder. We've also included some sample code to implement responsive images, lazy loading, and remote images techniques using additional script tags.
