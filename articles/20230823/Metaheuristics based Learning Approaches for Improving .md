Safety is a fundamental human need and essential to ensuring public safety. To ensure pedestrian safety in urban areas, there has been increasing interests in developing automated solutions that can provide continuous monitoring of pedestrians. However, existing learning approaches for pedestrian safety still lack robustness and scalability which limits their practical application. This paper presents an approach called metaheuristics-based learning approach for improving pedestrian safety. The proposed method uses probabilistic algorithms to generate candidate actions for each individual agent and evaluates the benefits of different strategies using multiple objectives such as safety, efficiency, and social welfare. Based on these evaluations, it selects the best strategy for each agent and applies them over time to improve the overall pedestrian safety. We demonstrate our approach through simulations with two traffic scenarios: crossing area and controlled intersection. Our results show that the proposed approach is effective at reducing accidents caused by unsafe behaviors, improving pedestrian travel times and saving costs. Moreover, we also evaluate the effectiveness of various evaluation metrics and compare our approach with existing state-of-the-art models for pedestrian safety.

## 2.1 概念及术语说明
### 2.1.1 Pedestrian Safety
Pedestrian safety refers to maintaining safe behaviour during interaction between pedestrians and road users (vehicles or other walkers). It includes several important aspects including reduced vehicle crashes, reduced injury rates, improved roadway efficiency, increased visibility, etc. 

### 2.1.2 Automated Solution for Pedestrian Safety Monitoring
Automated solution for pedestrian safety monitoring can be divided into three categories depending on the level of automation:

(1) Supervised Learning - In supervised learning, a model is trained on labeled data to predict the outcomes from new unseen data. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify dangerous situations where pedestrians may encounter obstacles or dangerous persons before they actually occur.

(2) Reinforcement Learning - In reinforcement learning, the agent learns how to make decisions and interact with the environment by trial and error. By interacting with the environment, the agent gains experience about its behavior and the rewards it receives when successfully completing tasks. Specifically, reinforcement learning methods are used in situations where feedback is sparse or delayed, making traditional supervised and unsupervised learning techniques less suitable.

(3) Unsupervised Learning - In unsupervised learning, no labels are provided to the algorithm, leaving it on its own to find patterns and structures within the input data without any prior guidance. Unsupervised learning methods can help to identify hidden trends, relationships, and clusters that can guide decision-making processes.

### 2.1.3 Problems and Objectives for Pedestrian Safety Learning
The problem of pedestrian safety learning lies in identifying appropriate policies or actions for each individual pedestrian to minimize risks involved in interactions. Commonly evaluated objectives include minimizing the number of collisions, minimizing the impact of incidents, optimizing route choice, and maximizing social welfare. The first step towards solving this problem is to understand what makes people behave safely and prevent accidents. This involves understanding the underlying factors that cause trauma and therefore require safer driving strategies.

### 2.1.4 Action Selection Strategies
Action selection strategies refer to the set of strategies that the agent should adopt to reduce risks associated with pedestrian safety. These strategies could involve slowing down, stopping for lights, avoiding jaywalking, and taking extra caution while walking along roads. Each strategy should be carefully designed so that it reduces the risk associated with that particular action but not to the detriment of others. There are numerous strategies available for selecting actions such as exhaustive search, epsilon-greedy, softmax, boltzmann, Q-learning, Thompson sampling, Bayesian optimization, or particle swarm optimization.

### 2.1.5 Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation metrics refer to the criteria used to measure the performance of the learned policy. Some commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of pedestrian safety policies include cost per collision reduction, improvement in average speed, satisfaction score, minimum distance traveled, maximum congestion time, social disruption index, and ecological footprint.

### 2.1.6 Scenario Types
Two common types of pedestrian safety scenarios are crossing area and controlled intersection. Crossing Area scenario represents the case where several pedestrians crossing the same road in an urban setting. Controlled Intersection scenario consists of small intersections controlled by humans, resulting in constant surveillance by security personnel. Both scenarios share some similarities such as heterogeneous user groups, varying traffic conditions, and adverse weather conditions. 

## 2.2 Metaheuristic Algorithms
Metaheuristics are class of heuristic algorithms that use a combination of techniques, inspired by nature, mathematical optimization, and evolutionary computation, to solve complex problems. They can take inspiration from many fields such as artificial intelligence, operations research, physics, biology, engineering, and mathematics. Some popular examples of metaheuristics are genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization. We will focus on Genetic Algorithm here.

### 2.2.1 Genetic Algorithm (GA) 
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a stochastic population-based heuristic optimization technique that mimics the process of natural selection found in real life. Similar to nature’s way of reproduction, GA randomly generates an initial population of solutions and then iteratively refines and combines these individuals to produce offspring until convergence to optimal solution is achieved. Each generation consists of two steps: selection and mutation. During the selection phase, top performing candidates are selected for reproduction, leading to the emergence of novel and better solutions. During the mutation phase, a random subset of chromosomes is flipped or shuffled, leading to the introduction of genetic diversity to promote exploration of new solutions space. Population size determines the capacity of the algorithm to explore different parts of the search space and allow it to converge efficiently to global optimum. Hyperparameters like mutation rate, crossover probability, and selection pressure determine the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration, allowing the algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation effectively. Genetic algorithms have shown excellent performance in a wide range of applications, ranging from optimization, scheduling, and routing problems to prediction, control, and pattern recognition.

## 3.1 Problem Formulation
For pedestrian safety learning, given a pedestrian movement trace, we want to learn a policy that can reduce the risk of being involved in accidents. Given a group of n pedestrians who move in sequence along a road network, we define the problem as follows:

1. Objective Function: Given a series of pedestrian movements $$(t_i,x_i,y_i)$$, let $\phi$ denote the total time spent by all pedestrians, where $$t_{ij}=\frac{||\vec{x}_j-\vec{x}_{j-1}||}{\sqrt{\dot{v}_{j}\cdot \dot{v}_{j}}}$$ denotes the elapsed time taken by the i-th pedestrian from position $(x_i,y_i)$ to position $(x_j, y_j)$, $$\tau_{ij}=|cos(\theta)|\cdot t_{ij}$$ is the time interval required for the i-th pedestrian to arrive at position $(x_j, y_j)$ after having passed position $(x_{j-1},y_{j-1})$, and $$\mu_{ij}=f(|cos(\theta)|)$$ is the risk factor due to obstructions, vehicles, or other pedestrians, and hence the time constraint is given by $$\min_{\pi}(T_{\pi}):=E[\sum_{(t_i,t_j)\in E} c(t_j)-c(t_i)+\delta \phi]$$ where $$(t_i,t_j)=(t_{ij}-\tau_{ij},t_{ij})$$ and $$(t_i,t_k)<(t_j,t_k)$$ implies that $$(t_i,t_j)=(t_{ik},t_{jk})$$ if and only if $$(t_i,t_k)>-(t_j,t_k)$$, $\delta$ is a small penalty term to favor more diverse sequences of actions, and $E[(t_i,t_j)]$ denotes the expected time gap between consecutive movements of the pedestrian. 

2. State Space Representation: For simplicity, we assume that each pedestrian is represented by a point on the line segment connecting its current and previous positions $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_{i-1}, y_{i-1})$. We represent the state of each pedestrian at time $t$ as a vector of four values, namely, $$(\alpha_{i}^{t},\beta_{i}^{t},\gamma_{i}^{t},\delta_{i}^{t}),$$ where $\alpha_{i}^{t}$ and $\beta_{i}^{t}$ correspond to the slope and intercept of the line segment representing the motion of the i-th pedestrian up to time $t$, respectively; $\gamma_{i}^{t}$ corresponds to the remaining time till the i-th pedestrian reaches its destination, and $\delta_{i}^{t}$ corresponds to whether the i-th pedestrian has reached the end of the path. A typical state transition function would map one state $(\alpha_{i}^{t},\beta_{i}^{t},\gamma_{i}^{t},\delta_{i}^{t})$ to another state obtained by executing an action chosen according to the current policy $\pi^{t}$.

## 3.2 Optimization Strategy
We formulate the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem where we seek to simultaneously optimize the time taken by all pedestrians and minimize the risk factor associated with their interactions. We consider the following two objectives functions:

1. Minimize Time Spent: Let us say we choose action sequence $$\pi^t = [\pi_{ij}^t], i<j,\pi_{ij}^t\in\Pi$$, where $\Pi$ is the set of feasible action sequences, such that $\pi_{ij}^t$ specifies the action taken by the i-th pedestrian at time $t_i$ to reach position $(x_j,y_j)$ from position $(x_{j-1},y_{j-1})$. Then, the objective function to minimize the total time spent by all pedestrians is given by

$$J^{\text{MinTime}}:=E[(\sum_{i=1}^n \rho_i \tau_{ij})+\rho_j (\tau_{ij}-\tau_{ij-1})] + \lambda H_{\pi}(\Pi),$$

where $\rho_i\geqslant0$ is the importance weight assigned to each pedestrian at time $t$, $$\tau_{ij}=\frac{||\vec{x}_j-\vec{x}_{j-1}||}{\sqrt{\dot{v}_{j}\cdot \dot{v}_{j}}},$$ is the elapsed time taken by the i-th pedestrian from position $(x_i,y_i)$ to position $(x_j, y_j)$, and $\lambda>0$ is a hyperparameter controlling the relative importance of the second objective function to the first. The first term measures the cumulative delay experienced by each pedestrian over their entire journey, and the second term measures the entropy of the distribution of action sequences over the set of feasible ones.

2. Minimize Risk Factor: Let us say we choose action sequence $$\pi^t = [\pi_{ij}^t], i<j,\pi_{ij}^t\in\Pi$$ to minimize the time spent by all pedestrians subject to a certain safety budget limit $\tau$. Therefore, the objective function to minimize both time and risk factor is given by

$$J^{\text{MinRiskFactor}}:=E[(\sum_{i=1}^n \rho_i \tau_{ij})+\rho_j (\tau_{ij}-\tau_{ij-1})]-\lambda P_{\pi}(\Pi)-L_{\pi}(\Pi),$$

where $\rho_i\geqslant0$ is again the importance weight assigned to each pedestrian at time $t$, and $P_{\pi}$ and $L_{\pi}$ are two non-negative risk measures. The risk measure $P_{\pi}$ captures the chance of experiencing an accident, assuming that the worst-case trajectory of every pedestrian under consideration satisfies the constraints imposed by the feasible action sequences $\Pi$. The risk measure $L_{\pi}$ accounts for the value lost to society if an accident occurs, considering both immediate and long-term consequences. If $\tau=0$, then the latter part of the objective function is omitted.

## 3.3 Dynamic Programming Model
Given the fact that the actions taken by pedestrians affect future states of other agents, we cannot simply compute the optimal action sequence using static programming methods, since it does not account for potential side effects of an action upon subsequent agents. Instead, we employ dynamic programming, which involves modeling the system dynamics, determining the optimal value function and policy function, and updating the estimates accordingly at each time step until convergence. Specifically, we start with a known initial state and perform a Bellman equation update to estimate the value of each state and the corresponding optimal policy for achieving that state. With knowledge of the optimal policy for reaching any state, we can simulate the next state and recursively apply the Bellman equation updates to obtain the optimal values and policies for all future states. Note that the Bellman equation updates depend only on the current state and reward received at that state, thus enabling efficient computation. 

The complete DP model for pedestrian safety learning is given below:

$$V^\pi(s_i)=\max_\pi[R(s_i,a_i)+\gamma V^\pi(s_{i+1}), a_i\in\pi(s_i)]$$

$$Q^\pi(s_i,a_i)=R(s_i,a_i)+\gamma\max_{a'}Q^\pi(s_{i+1},a'), a'\in\pi(s_{i+1})$$

Here, $s_i$ is the state of the i-th pedestrian at time $t_i$, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, $R(s_i,a_i)$ is the reward received by the i-th pedestrian for choosing action $a_i$ at state $s_i$, and $V^\pi(s_i)$ and $Q^\pi(s_i,a_i)$ are the respective value and Q-value functions for state $s_i$ and action $a_i$ under policy $\pi$.

To implement the above framework, we create a class `DP` which takes in the parameters necessary for initializing the variables: state dimension, action dimension, gamma, reward matrix, transition matrix, action space, and pedestrian information. The main function `learn()` implements the backward recursion to calculate the optimal values and policies for all future states starting from the terminal state. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize the estimated values and policies for all states using the initial values of the pedestrian states and zero for all other values.
2. Iterate over all time steps from the last to the first, and for each time step, do the following:
    * Calculate the policy at each pedestrian state using the estimated values for all subsequent states.
    * Update the estimated values and policies for all pedestrian states using the updated policies and Bellman equation updates.
3. Return the final estimated values and policies.

The simulation code for finding the optimal action sequence using the DP approach is included in Appendix I.
