Text summarization is the process of condensing a written piece into a shorter form that highlights its main ideas or points without losing relevant details. It helps to save time and make it easier for readers to comprehend large amounts of text by providing a concise summary while still retaining key information. Although text summarization techniques have been around since the late 19th century with various methods such as abstraction, keyword selection, and topic modeling, they have evolved over the years and several new approaches are being developed nowadays. In this article, we will review the most commonly used text summarization techniques along with their strengths and weaknesses and present an overview of recent advances in text summarization research. We will also provide insights into future trends and challenges in text summarization research.

In general, text summarization can be classified into two categories: extractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization involves selecting specific sentences or phrases from the original document that contribute to the overall meaning or theme of the document. On the other hand, abstractive summarization involves generating new concepts or topics from the content of the document while keeping some semantic similarity between them. 

The purpose of this systematic review and outlook paper is to explore the current state-of-the-art in text summarization technologies and identify opportunities for improvement. The aim is to provide guidance to practitioners and researchers on how to choose appropriate techniques based on factors like length, complexity, diversity, coherence, readability, and suitability for different types of documents. Furthermore, by identifying emerging research directions and problems, our work aims to inform decision-making processes and stimulate further research efforts. This paper provides a comprehensive view of the field and identifies potential areas for future development. By analyzing the literature, we hope to help advance the field and enable more effective text summarization technology. Additionally, we anticipate that the reviews provided here will lead to collaborations among AI, NLP, linguistics, computer science, and related fields to develop solutions that effectively address these important issues.

In conclusion, the goals of this paper are to (1) offer an extensive review of existing text summarization techniques and identify common patterns and trends; (2) identify upcoming research opportunities and challenges in the field and suggest directions for future research; (3) foster dialogue within the communities surrounding natural language processing, including machine learning, natural language generation, and computational linguistics; and (4) provide practical guidelines for choosing appropriate techniques based on different factors such as length, complexity, diversity, coherence, and readability. These steps should promote progress towards greater human-computer collaboration in natural language processing and support applications in diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, social media analysis, and scientific publishing.  

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Text Summary
A text summary is a brief yet accurate representation of a longer document or corpus. It contains the most important and salient ideas or thoughts from the source material and offers a high-level understanding of the subject matter at hand. Text summarization allows users to quickly understand complex texts and obtain essential information quickly, thereby enhancing their ability to focus on what matters most. In contrast to traditional summarization which focuses solely on reducing the size of the entire text, text summarization relies on the idea of highlighting the salient parts of the text and only leaving out the irrelevant ones. Despite this difference, both types of summarization share many similarities and similar terminologies. 

Some basic terms and concepts that apply to both extractive and abstractive summarization include:

1. **Document:** A unit of writing typically consisting of multiple paragraphs, headings, figures, tables, equations, and references. Examples of typical document formats include journal articles, books, essays, research papers, news reports, and blog posts. 

2. **Summary:** The result generated by text summarization algorithms when applied to a given document. The summary includes the most significant points and ideas found in the original document. 

3. **Sentence:** A single instance of a paragraph containing one or more complete thought units. Sentences are often formed by breaking up larger passages using punctuation marks and spacing.

4. **Word:** A sequence of characters that represents a meaningful concept or idea in a sentence.

5. **Theme/Concept:** The central idea or concept that motivates and drives a piece of writing. Themes may be defined based on the sentiment behind certain statements, the organization of the text, or the underlying rhetorical strategies employed in the discourse. 

Extractive summarization refers to the task of extracting specific sentences from a document based on predefined criteria such as importance, relevance, and proximity to the theme/concept. Abstractive summarization involves developing new concepts or themes from the content of a document without resorting to exact phrase matches.

Some additional concepts and terminology that apply specifically to extractive summarization include:

1. **Importance score:** Assigns a numerical value to each sentence in relation to its position in the order of appearance. Importance scores can vary depending on the algorithm used and can take values such as TF-IDF, PageRank, or word embeddings. Higher importance scores indicate sentences that contain more salient information about the theme/concept. 

2. **Relevance score:** Determines whether a particular sentence is deemed relevant to the theme/concept of the whole document. Relevance scores can come from a variety of sources, including keyword matching, statistical measures, and heuristics. Relevant sentences are identified based on their presence in search queries, frequently mentioned in web pages, or having a significant impact on the final summary. 

3. **Proximity score:** Determines the distance between adjacent sentences within a document. Proximity scores measure the amount of space taken up by consecutive sentences and can affect the ordering of the selected sentences in the summary. Shorter distances indicate closer relatedness between sentences, while longer distances represent less related sentences that might not add much insight to the overall message.  

## 2.2 Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation metrics are used to quantify the performance of text summarization models. There are several evaluation metrics used for text summarization tasks, including ROUGE (Ranking Overlap Estimation), ROGUE-SUQAD (Ranking Quality Evaluation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation), and SARI (Semantic Adjustment Score). Each metric has its own set of pros and cons that need to be considered before deciding which one to use for a particular application. Below we give a brief description of each of these evaluation metrics. 

1. **ROUGE (Ranking Overlap Estimation):** ROUGE is a popular automatic evaluation metric for evaluating the quality of text summaries produced by automatic summarization systems. It takes into account recall and precision measurements for individual sentences and calculates the average overlap across all pairs of sentences. ROUGE was originally proposed for evaluating peer reviewed summaries but has been extended to evaluate unsupervised domain adaptation tasks where the system produces summaries without reference to any external data. However, it suffers from low correlation with human judgements due to its strict definition of overlapping segments. 

2. **ROGUE-SUQAD (Ranking Quality Evaluation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation):** ROGUE-SUQAD evaluates the quality of ranking lists produced by unsupervised domain adaptation systems for text summarization. It compares the output rankings against gold standard annotations collected from a labeled test dataset. ROGUE-SUQAD requires separate annotation datasets for training and testing and assumes that the input sentences are already preprocessed according to the same tokenization scheme as those used during training. ROGUE-SUQAD also uses special tokens to handle cases where identical sequences occur in the input and target sentences.  

3. **SARI (Semantic Adjustment Score):** SARI measures the degree to which a model assigns higher weights to highly relevant sentences compared to less relevant ones. It does not require a reference summary or labels for comparison, instead relying solely on the predicted probabilities assigned by the model. SARI is widely used in industrial applications such as natural language advertising campaigns and online customer feedback surveys, where annotated summaries are expensive or impossible to collect. SARI therefore serves as a complementary metric for evaluation in these contexts where judgments are scarce or unreliable. 

# 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
To generate summaries, text summarization algorithms must follow three fundamental operations: sentence extraction, sentence scoring, and sentence ordering. 
## 3.1 Sentence Extraction
The first step in the text summarization process is to select the subset of sentences that are relevant to the theme/concept of interest. To do so, text summarization algorithms usually rely on either manually curated rules or automatically learned patterns extracted from the document. For example, if the goal is to produce a short email summary, a simple approach could be to remove all nonessential headers and footers and retain only the sections dedicated to the subject matter. Another option would be to filter out redundant or irrelevant text, such as ads or promotional messages. Regardless of the method chosen, sentence selection becomes the prerequisite for performing subsequent operations. 

## 3.2 Sentence Scoring
Once the relevant sentences have been selected, the next step is to assign a weight or score to each sentence indicating its importance relative to the rest of the document. Different scoring schemes exist, including manual assignment through expert annotators, automatic calculation based on features such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and neural networks trained on labeled examples. The resulting scores can then be used to determine the optimal ordering of the remaining sentences in the summary. 

## 3.3 Sentence Ordering
Finally, once the sentence scores have been calculated, the last step in the summarization process is to arrange them in a logical and intuitive manner. Various approaches exist, including greedy algorithms such as top k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and simulated annealing, and heuristic approaches such as merge sort and bubble sort. All of these approaches depend on the desired level of granularity and clarity of the summary, and the tradeoffs involved in achieving it. The end result is a text summary that presents a concise, coherent, and engaging narrative that captures the core ideas and concepts of the original document.

# 4. Recent Developments in Text Summarization
Over the past few decades, numerous new techniques have been introduced to improve the accuracy and efficiency of text summarization systems. Some of the most prominent developments in text summarization research are described below:
1. **Query-driven summarization:** Query-driven summarization systems analyze user queries and generate summaries that are tailored to the needs of each individual user. They leverage crowdsourcing platforms and user behavior analysis tools to gather massive amounts of user preferences and feedback. Such systems combine search query analysis and topic modeling techniques to identify the most relevant sentences and construct an appropriate summary. Google's Ask HN! platform is an example of query-driven summarization technique that generates real-time summaries of newly posted hacker news stories. 

2. **Multi-document summarization:** Multi-document summarization systems consider the context of related documents and generate a unified summary that covers all of them. They build upon earlier works in multi-document summarization, which focused on creating a summary of long documents composed of unrelated topics. The main challenge in multi-document summarization is to determine how to select relevant documents and balance their contributions to the final summary. Popular multi-document summarization approaches include Gregor et al.'s Doc2VecSum and Luong et al.'s XLNetSum. Both models involve representing the documents using a vector embedding, calculating cosine similarity between them, and selecting the most representative ones for inclusion in the summary.

3. **Abstractive summarization:** Abstractive summarization systems generate summaries by developing new concepts and topics rather than simply copying fragments of text. Many techniques attempt to achieve this by leveraging deep learning architectures such as transformer models or GPT-3. Two prominent approaches that have achieved impressive results include BART (Facebook AI Research) and T5 (Google AI Language). BART is a sequence-to-sequence model that jointly learns to predict words and generate a summary while considering the context of the document. T5 is a multilingual transformer model that pre-trains itself on a large corpus of unlabelled data and applies transfer learning to generate high-quality summaries across a wide range of languages. 

4. **Simultaneous translation and summarization:** Simultaneous translation and summarization systems translate the full document into another language while simultaneously producing a summary in English. The primary benefit of this approach is to generate summaries that are closely aligned to the intended audience and meet the local cultural expectations. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of simultaneous translation and summarization techniques in various domains such as medical records, technical documentation, and product reviews.

Overall, the rapid growth in the field of text summarization research has resulted in an immense array of techniques and resources available to developers and researchers alike. The systematic review presented in this paper provides a broad overview of the current state-of-the-art in text summarization and points to promising avenues for future exploration.
