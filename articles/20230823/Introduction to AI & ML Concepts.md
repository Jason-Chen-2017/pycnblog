# 1.简介
  

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the two main pillars of modern technology. By utilizing these technologies, machines can perform tasks that were previously thought impossible or too difficult for humans. Therefore, they have become increasingly essential in our lives and provide a lot of value to businesses and organizations. In this article, we will briefly introduce you to the fundamental concepts and principles behind AI and ML. Then we will dive into the details of each concept by walking through examples and explanations. Finally, we will discuss how AI and ML are transforming various industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, education, etc., and what’s next for us.

This is an advanced-level technical article intended for professionals who want to understand the fundamentals of AI and ML and apply them effectively in their daily work life. It should also be useful for anyone interested in exploring new trends and opportunities related to AI and ML.
# 2.基本概念、术语及其定义
## 2.1 人工智能（AI）
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines that exhibit human-like abilities such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. These capabilities make artificial intelligence systems capable of performing a wide range of complex tasks, from simple visual recognition to complex problems like speech recognition, natural language understanding, and autonomous driving. There are many different types of artificial intelligence including machine learning, neural networks, expert systems, and statistical models. 

In general, AI refers to any system that has the ability to learn and achieve goals in a manner similar to that of a human being. The term "artificial" comes from the fact that these systems do not actually exist in nature, but rather, are engineered to mimic some aspects of its behavior. For example, AlphaGo, a program that defeated the world champion Go player, demonstrates that computers can play well enough at games even though they do not physically possess the necessary game playing skills or strategies. Similarly, Siri, Alexa, and Cortana are all built using artificial intelligence algorithms to help users accomplish various tasks more efficiently than ever before.

In summary, AI is defined as the study of computer programs that can simulate intelligent behaviors of animals and humans and improve upon them with experience over time. 

## 2.2 機器学习（Machine Learning）
Machine learning (ML) is the process of teaching a computer to recognize patterns and relationships between data without being explicitly programmed to do so. This technique involves feeding large amounts of training data to the algorithm, which learns to identify patterns and relationships within it automatically. Machines then use this knowledge to make predictions or decisions based on new input data. Within machine learning, there are several subcategories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Supervised learning means that the algorithm is trained on labeled datasets, while unsupervised learning involves identifying patterns in unlabeled datasets without any prior labels. Reinforcement learning focuses on imitating actions taken by a person towards rewards generated by the environment, while deep learning enables machines to analyze complex data structures and extract insights from large volumes of data.

In summary, machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides machines with the capability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It relies on algorithms that discover patterns and predict outcomes on new inputs.

## 2.3 模型、训练数据集、特征、标签
Model - A mathematical model that represents the relationship between features and labels.

Training Data Set - A set of data used to train a model.

Feature - An attribute or variable that describes an individual object or event that may be relevant to the outcome of a prediction problem. For example, age, income, location, gender, and so on. Features can be numerical or categorical.

Label - The output or result predicted by a model when given certain features. For example, whether someone makes money or loses credit card debt, fraudulent transactions detected, or disease diagnosed. Labels can be binary or multiclass.

## 2.4 数据、样本、特征空间、目标函数
Data - Collection of information gathered from sources, usually represented as rows and columns.

Sample - Single instance of data collected from a dataset, often described by a feature vector consisting of one or more values.

Feature Space - The set of possible feature vectors that describe samples. Each feature vector corresponds to a sample.

Target Function - Function that maps the feature space to the target domain. It assigns a label or category to every sample in the dataset according to its attributes. Target functions can be linear or non-linear. Examples of target functions include classification (predicting discrete categories), regression (predicting continuous values), and ranking (predicting relative rankings).

## 2.5 分类问题、回归问题、聚类问题、标记问题
Classification Problem - Predicting a categorical response based on input variables. Common examples include spam detection, sentiment analysis, and facial recognition.

Regression Problem - Predicting a continuous response based on input variables. Common examples include forecasting sales prices, inventory levels, and material properties.

Clustering Problem - Identifying groups of similar samples in a dataset. Common applications include market segmentation, customer grouping, and document clustering.

Tagging Problem - Assigning predefined tags or keywords to pieces of text or images based on contextual clues. Common applications include image annotation, keyword extraction, and text categorization.
