# 1.简介
  

本文旨在分享我参与到HTC Vive项目中的一些经验教训。这个项目的主要目的是开发一个基于HTC Vive头戴设备上的真实感(Mixed Reality)游戏。为了完成这个项目，我们需要使用UE4引擎、SteamVR平台和其他相关的工具。由于我的水平有限，并不是一个专业的工程师或软件架构师，所以在写作过程中难免会有疏忽和错误。因此，希望通过本文能够帮助到读者。
# 2.前置条件
## 硬件准备
1. HTC Vive VR headset
2. HTC VIVE Pro Eye Camera (Optional) - Used to add an in-game view of our character's eyes. The free version does not provide this functionality but the Pro model offers it. 
3. SteamVR Drivers and Tools installed on your machine
4. A sound card that supports DirectSound output (such as RealTek HD Audio, Intel HD Audio or NVidia High Definition Audio). This will allow us to hear sounds from our game using the microphone inside the Vive headset.
5. Windows 10 with Developer Mode enabled so we can install the UE4 engine and SteamVR on our local machine.
6. An Internet connection (to download the required drivers and tools), along with access to Unity Asset Store (for some assets such as SteamVR plugin and Cesium ion terrain toolkit). You also need a GitHub account if you want to contribute back to the project by creating a pull request.

## 安装软件
We'll be installing several software packages during this tutorial:

1. SteamVR: This is a virtual reality platform developed by Valve Corporation which provides hardware integration, tracking, and input support for developers. It also includes the necessary SteamVR driver package to run games developed for HTC Vive in SteamVR environment.
2. SteamVR Plugin: This allows us to integrate SteamVR into our Unreal projects.
3. Unreal Engine 4: This is our primary development environment used for developing our mixed reality applications. We'll use the Unreal Marketplace to purchase additional assets for our project. 
4. UnrealCV: This is a plug-in that allows us to interface with various components of the HTC Vive system within Unreal Editor. It enables real-time object detection, tracking and recognition, and motion capture data collection through the Vive sensors. 

Make sure you have all these prerequisites before beginning the installation process.

# 3. Installing Required Software
## Install SteamVR


## Install SteamVR Plugin for Unreal Engine 4
To get started with the development process, we first need to ensure that our Unreal Engine editor has SteamVR support available. Open up your Unreal Editor and navigate to Plugins section under Window menu. Search for "SteamVR" plugin and select it. Click 'Enable' button to enable the plugin. Once done, close and reopen the Unreal Editor. 

Now let's configure the plugin. Navigate to Project Settings -> SteamVR Plugin tab and enter the API Key shown after activating SteamVR in your Steam library. This key will give SteamVR access to the HTC Vive hardware features including controllers, trackers, and other devices connected to the headset.  


Next, check the checkbox labeled "Use Stereo Rendering Path", which will make our app render both left and right eye views simultaneously for each frame. Check "Launch VR Monitor when App Launches". Finally, press Save & Restart button at bottom of the page to apply the changes and restart the Unreal Editor.


## Install UnrealCV
This step involves downloading the UnrealCV plug-in from the Unreal Engine marketplace. Open up the Unreal Engine launcher application and search for 'UnrealCV'. Select the entry and press the blue Install button. Once the installation completes, activate it in the Installed plugins section of the Project Settings panel. Close and reopen the Unreal Editor once more to load the new plugin.


# 4. Setting Up Our Scene
Before proceeding further, create a new empty level in Unreal Editor. Let's name it 'MyScene'. Next, drag and drop the 'VRCameraParent' actor from the Content Browser onto the scene. This will serve as our root camera for the VR experience. Create another Actor by searching for 'Static Mesh' asset type in the Content Browser. Drag the sphere mesh from Content Browser onto the viewport and move it around until its position matches the location where you want to place your player character. Call it 'PlayerPawn'. Add some primitive collision capsule below the player pawn. We will attach a Character Movement component to this capsule later on. For now, disable collisions between the two actors by selecting them and pressing the F key.
