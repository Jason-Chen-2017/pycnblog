# 1.简介
  

In this article we will explain how we combined multiple object detection models into one system to achieve high-accuracy detection and reduce the number of false positive predictions by prioritizing the most relevant ones based on their predicted scores. We will also discuss about challenges faced while using different methods for combining these models such as data imbalance issues, computational complexity and the need to make trade-offs between precision and recall during model combination. Finally, we will provide an example implementation of a multi-model system with the use of Faster R-CNN (FRCN) and YOLOv3 for object detection task in PyTorch framework. In addition, we will evaluate our proposed approach through performance metrics such as mean average precision(mAP), area under curve(AUC) and confusion matrix analysis. The trained model can be used for various applications including image/video surveillance systems, real-time monitoring systems etc., where accurate and timely information extraction is critical. 

# 2.基本概念和术语
Multi-object detection refers to the process of detecting multiple objects in images or videos. One common challenge associated with multi-object detection systems is that it may lead to many redundant detections or misses. This happens when the same object is detected by multiple detectors or the detectors do not perform well due to various reasons like occlusion, low resolution, and varying lighting conditions. Thus, it becomes important to combine multiple models together to take advantage of each individual's strengths while making sure they do not conflict with each other. To solve this problem, several approaches have been developed over the years. Some of them include:

1. Multi-scale detector - Different scales of input images are fed to separate detectors at different stages of the pipeline. For instance, two detectors could work independently but for small objects, both detectors might output low confidence results while the larger object may be missed altogether if only one detector is used. 

2. Model aggregation - A weighted sum of outputs from multiple detectors is computed instead of applying the best-performing detector solely. This approach helps to improve the robustness of the system against noise and errors caused by any single detector. However, it requires careful selection of weights and training criteria which may depend on the application domain.

3. Cascade detectors - Several stages of detectors are cascaded together so that more complex objects are detected first before simple objects. This approach combines the advantages of global context and local details provided by previous layers of the network.

The following terms are commonly used while discussing multi-object detection and related topics:

1. Precision - Recall is defined as TP/(TP+FP). It measures the ability of the detector to identify all the true positives correctly.

2. Recall - Precision is defined as TP/(TP+FN). It measures the ability of the detector to correctly identify all the relevant instances i.e. the instances being classified as positive.

3. False Positive Rate - It is defined as FP/(TN+FP). It measures the percentage of incorrect decisions made by the detector, where TN stands for True Negative, i.e., those instances which should have been classified as negative but were actually classified as positive.

4. mAP - Mean Average Precision. It is a metric to measure the overall performance of a multi-class object detector. It takes into account the precision, recall and F1 score at various intersection over union (IoU) thresholds.


# 3.核心算法原理与操作步骤
To combine multiple object detection models into one system, we need to create a unified prediction strategy that considers the relative importance of each model’s contribution towards the final decision. Since each model has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, we must balance their contributions accordingly. Therefore, we need to come up with some methodical approach to selectively combine these models.

We propose the following algorithm to accomplish this goal:

1. Select few representative samples of images and annotations labeled with corresponding bounding boxes for each object category. These samples can be obtained either manually or via automated techniques.
2. Train each object detector separately on these samples using standard image classification algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). 
3. Once the detectors are trained, fine-tune them on additional annotated datasets to increase their accuracy and generalize better to new unseen environments. 
4. During inference, apply each detector independently on an input image and aggregate their predictions. If there is overlap between bboxes produced by two or more detectors, we would prefer the detections generated by the detector with higher confidence. 
5. Compute the aggregated detection scores and threshold them according to a certain criterion like IoU threshold, which determines the minimum overlap required for two bboxes to be considered as a match. Only keep the highest scoring bbox for each matched pair of detectors. 
6. Refine the selected matches by performing post processing steps like NMS(non maximum suppression) and non-maximum regression(NMR). 


Now let us dive deeper into the step-by-step procedure mentioned above. 

## Step 1: Training Object Detectors
For each object category, we randomly choose a subset of the annotated images to train an object detector. To ensure balanced dataset distribution across classes, we can split the total number of samples equally among all categories. 

We typically use transfer learning technique to pretrain a CNN classifier on a large scale ImageNet dataset. After training on the smaller dataset, we further finetune the classifier on the target object detection dataset to obtain improved performance. 

At this point, we can save the trained detectors along with their respective checkpoints for future use. 

## Step 2: Inference
During inference phase, we pass each test image through each of the trained detectors separately. Depending on the size of the test set and computational resources available, this step can take a significant amount of time. To speedup inference, we can parallelize the computation using CUDA GPUs or multi-processing libraries like multiprocessing in Python.

Once the detectors generate their predictions, we need to aggregate their outputs to produce a single unified prediction result. For this purpose, we assign a weight to each prediction based on its detector’s confidence level and select the top k candidates based on the resulting scores. Here, k represents the desired number of predictions per image and should be determined experimentally depending on the desired tradeoff between precision and recall. Alternatively, we can compute the softmax score over all detectors and select the top-k entries, however, this approach may not be preferred since it does not take into consideration the relative performance of the detectors. 

Next, we refine the selected candidate pairs by computing the IOU between the predicted bboxes and selecting the ones with high overlap. We then discard overlapping regions and retain only the region of interest(ROI) containing the object whose bounding box was assigned the highest confidence.

Finally, we filter out duplicate detections by checking whether the bboxes predicted by two or more detectors cover exactly the same object or partially overlap. When this occurs, we merge these detections and assign a single score to represent their consensus. This can be done using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) or Non-Maximum Regression (NMR).

After obtaining the final unified prediction results, we need to evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, mAP and AUC.

# 4.具体代码实现

In the next section, we will implement our multi-model system for object detection task using popular frameworks like PyTorch and OpenCV library. For simplicity, we will assume that we are working on a simple binary classification task of identifying cats vs dog breeds in images. But the concept can easily extended to handle multi-class problems or even object tracking tasks. We will start by installing the necessary packages and importing the necessary modules.<|im_sep|>
