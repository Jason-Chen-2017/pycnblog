In recent years, negotiations have become increasingly more complex as the number of parties involved increases, due to new challenges such as real-time decision making, multiple stakeholders, uncertain information, and language barriers. To address these challenges, several intelligent agents have been proposed that can extract knowledge from structured data sources and use it to make decisions on a human level. However, this review article aims at providing an overview of existing research efforts towards developing intelligent agents for negotiation and identifying areas where future work is needed. We will also discuss key challenges and opportunities that are faced by the field of artificial intelligence in negotiation. Specifically, we will cover the following topics:

1) Introduction: The aim of this section is to introduce the reader to the basics of negotiation and its importance for artificial intelligence. It will provide background information about different types of negotiations, their roles in negotiation dynamics, and possible outcomes or consequences. 

2) Terminology: This section introduces relevant terminologies used in the context of AI in negotiation, including concepts like dialogue systems, beliefs, preferences, goals, strategies, emotions, scenarios, resources, limitations, assumptions, and perspectives.

3) Agents: In this subsection, we will survey various agent architectures and approaches that can be used in AI in negotiation. These include rule-based agents, probabilistic reasoning agents, natural language processing (NLP) based agents, learning agents, hybrid agents, simulation-based agents, and multi-agent systems with negotiation components. Each architecture will be briefly discussed alongside its pros and cons, followed by potential applications and ethical considerations. Additionally, we will touch upon several practical issues associated with designing and implementing intelligent agents in negotiation, including computational complexity, scalability, deployment, privacy, safety, and fairness.

4) Knowledge Representation: In this section, we will talk about how knowledge representation plays a crucial role in the development of intelligent agents in negotiation. Although there has been significant progress in building robust representations for domain-specific tasks, there is still much room for improvement. Several NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, coreference resolution, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing can help to build deeper understanding of textual input while enhancing performance. We will explore the current state-of-the-art methods for knowledge representation and identify promising directions for future research.

5) Dialogue Management: Another critical component of intelligent agents in negotiation is dialogue management. Here, we will look into the various techniques used to manage interactions between agents during negotiation. Different dialogue models such as goal-oriented dialogues, task-oriented dialogues, interactive dialogues, and cooperative dialogues can be implemented using various algorithms, such as rule-based systems, statistical models, machine learning, and neural networks. Moreover, we will discuss techniques such as model compression, self-training, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning that can aid in improving performance and reducing resource consumption.

6) Ethics: Despite the advancements in AI technologies, negotiation remains a difficult topic not only because of its complex nature but also because it involves people with diverse cultural backgrounds and personalities. Therefore, we will highlight some ethical concerns related to AI in negotiation, such as bias in training data, transparency of conversation, monitoring and intervention, overfitting, and legal liabilities. We will then suggest some avenues for further research and discussion on addressing these concerns. 

Finally, we will propose several open problems and future research directions that can benefit the field of AI in negotiation. Some examples of these areas are trustworthiness, intelligent modeling of participants’ intentions and motivations, awareness of each other's positions, long-term planning, and automated decision-making mechanisms. Overall, this review article provides an excellent starting point for anyone interested in advancing the area of AI in negotiation.
