# 1.简介
  

Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is a type of linear dimensionality reduction technique that aims to learn a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving most of its information content [1]. PPCA is often used for tasks such as face recognition, image compression, and gene expression analysis. 

In this paper, we review recent literature on probabilistic PCA and propose an innovative theoretical framework for explaining how it can be made more robust against noise and outliers [2] with the help of a statistical learning theory perspective. Based on our findings, we provide insights into designing novel algorithms for improving the performance of PPCA. Finally, we present a discussion on how to use these improved methods effectively in practical applications.

Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art research on probabilistic PCA, highlighting key technical challenges and opportunities for future work. It also presents new techniques for making PPCA more robust by using well-established statistical learning concepts and methods such as shrinkage priors and Gaussian processes.

# 2.Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis(PPCA)
## Introduction
Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is a variant of principal component analysis (PCA), which aims to find a low-dimensional approximation of the input data while being able to capture most of its structure or "variance" [1]. In other words, PPCA tries to find a set of directions in which the data vary independently from each other. The key idea behind PPCA is to model the covariance matrix between the variables as a Gaussian process, where each sample has a certain uncertainty due to measurement errors and correlation among them [2].

The primary advantage of PPCA over traditional PCA is that it can handle high-dimensional data efficiently because it reduces the dimensionality through a low-rank transformation of the original variable space. However, since PPCA relies on modeling the covariance structure of the data using a Gaussian process, it may not always produce the best results if the data exhibits noisy or irregular patterns [3]. Additionally, PPCA requires careful parameter selection beforehand, making it difficult to determine what is the appropriate number of dimensions or hyperparameters to achieve desired accuracy levels [4]. Therefore, there is a need for developing robust algorithms for PPCA, so that it can accurately represent complex datasets with different types of noise and outliers.


## Key Concepts and Terminology
### Covariance Matrix
A covariance matrix represents the joint variation between two random variables [5]:

$$C = \frac{1}{n} X^T X$$,

where $X$ is a collection of n data points $\{(x_i)^T\}_{i=1}^n$. Each element $(c_{ij})$ of the covariance matrix indicates the covariation between the i-th and j-th random variable at a given point in the feature space.

### Gaussian Process Prior
The Gaussian process prior describes the distribution of possible realizations of the target function under a finite population of potential functions (i.e., regression models). Mathematically, a GP prior consists of a mean vector and a kernel function:

$$f \sim \mathcal{GP}\left(\mu(x), k(x, x')\right)\tag{1}$$

where $\mu(x)$ and $k(x, x')$ are known functions of the inputs $x$ and $x'$, respectively. We assume that $\mu(x)$ is zero, indicating that the function does not depend on any unobserved external factors; instead, we consider only the variation within the observed dataset, which captures the core assumption underlying probabilistic PCA. Thus, we have the following definition for a Gaussian process prior based on a covariance matrix $C$:

$$f|\mathbf{y}=y_1,\ldots, y_N|=\mathcal{N}(m(x), K(x, x))\tag{2}$$

where $K(x, x')=(C+I)^+\tag{3}$ and $(C+I)^+$ denotes the inverse of $C+I$. This formulation assumes that all entries in the covariance matrix $C$ are positive, which ensures that the variance values do not become negative due to numerical instability or machine rounding errors. 


### Shrinkage Prior
The shrinkage prior encourages sparsity in the estimated coefficient vectors obtained after fitting the PPCA model [6], leading to better interpretability and reduced model complexity. Specifically, the shrinkage prior adds a small term to the log likelihood function during training:

$$\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i^TK^{-1}_iy_i - \lambda\frac{1}{2}\Vert K^{-1}\Vert _F^2.\tag{4}$$

Here, $\lambda>0$ controls the tradeoff between sparsity and regularization strength, and $K^{-1}$ is defined according to Equation (3). By default, $\lambda$ is set to 1/n, where $n$ is the number of samples in the dataset. This formula penalizes the magnitude of the coefficient vectors relative to their expected value, resulting in sparser solutions that retain most of the explained variance in the data. 

### Outlier Detection
Outlier detection refers to identifying observations that deviate significantly from the majority of the data [7]. One common method for detecting outliers is called Local Outlier Factor (LOF), which computes the local density deviation of a given observation around other similar ones [8]. Other outlier detection approaches include isolation forests and distance-based clustering techniques like DBSCAN [9]. These techniques can identify both global and local outliers, but require specifying a threshold for defining outliers and dealing with missing values appropriately.

### Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning
Automatic hyperparameter tuning involves selecting optimal hyperparameters for the Gaussian process prior and the shrinkage prior using automated optimization techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization [10]. While effective in some cases, these techniques can still be time-consuming to tune multiple parameters and rarely result in significant improvements over non-tuned settings.


# 3.Statistical Learning Theory Perspective
## Notation and Assumptions
Before diving into the main body of the paper, let's clarify some notation and assumptions used throughout the rest of the paper. First, we denote the full data matrix $\mathbf{X}=[x^{(1)},...,x^{(n)}]$ where each row corresponds to one instance in the dataset, and each column contains the features of that instance. Let us further assume that the data is normally distributed with zero mean and covariance matrix $C$. We will use bold lower case letters ($\mathbf{\bold{z}}$,$\mathbf{\bold{u}}$,$\mathbf{\bold{w}}$,$\mathbf{\bold{v}}$,$\mathbf{\bold{\theta}}$) to refer to the latent variables associated with the full data matrix, including the hidden means $\mathbf{\bold{z}}$ and latent components $\mathbf{\bold{u}}$ of the first principal component, the hidden variances $\mathbf{\bold{w}}$ and loading vectors $\mathbf{\bold{v}}$ of the second principal component, and the hyperparameters $\mathbf{\bold{\theta}}$ of the model.

Next, we will make several assumptions regarding the covariance matrix $C$ that characterize the nature of the underlying generative process for the data. We assume that $C$ is block diagonal, meaning that it is composed of submatrices that correspond to individual blocks in the full data matrix. Moreover, we assume that the blocks in the covariance matrix can be modeled as independent Gaussians centered at specific locations and with varying variances [11]. For example, we might assume that the first block in the covariance matrix corresponds to the covariance between the features of instances belonging to group 1, the second block corresponds to the covariance between the features of instances belonging to group 2, etc.

We can derive many properties of the covariance matrix $C$ using tools from multivariate statistics, particularly spectral decomposition [12]. Under these assumptions, the Gaussian process prior can be written as follows [2]:

$$p(\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{V}|\mathbf{Y}=y_1,\ldots, y_N)=\prod_{j=1}^{L}\prod_{\substack{i=1\\l=1}}^{\infty} p(z_i|\theta_j)p(u_il|\mathbf{z}_i)p(w_i|\alpha)p(v_ik|\mathbf{u}_i)\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{Z}|m, K)$$

where $p(z_i|\theta_j)$ is a Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter $\theta_j$, representing the probability of selecting a particular cluster assignment for each instance, $p(u_il|\mathbf{z}_i)$ is a categorical distribution with probabilities $\text{softmax}(\mathbf{z}_i)$ indicating the membership probabilities for each instance to its corresponding cluster, $p(w_i|\alpha)$ is a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $\alpha$, representing the inverse variance of the noise terms, and $p(v_ik|\mathbf{u}_i)$ is a normal distribution with mean $\mathbf{u}_i^T\mathbf{V}_k$ and precision matrix $(I-\mathbf{V}_k^\top\mathbf{V}_k)^{-1}$, representing the contribution of each feature to the second principal component. Note that $K$ is determined implicitly by specifying the choice of blocks in the covariance matrix. Also note that we drop the constant factor of $1/L!$ due to the fact that all distributions except the Dirichlet distribution are conjugate to the same base measure.



Now we turn to deriving the marginal likelihood and evidence lower bound (ELBO) for the probabilistic PCA model. To start, we write the marginal likelihood of the PPCA model as follows:

$$p(\mathbf{Y}=y_1,\ldots, y_N|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{\theta})=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\int_{\mathbb{R}^L} \cdots \int_{\mathbb{R}^K} p(\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{V}, \mathbf{Y}=y_1,\ldots, y_N|\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{V})\mathrm{d}\mathbf{Z}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{U}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{W}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{V}.\tag{5}$$

To simplify the integral, we assume that the conditional distributions of the various latent variables are fully specified (i.e., given all others), which allows us to integrate over all combinations of values of those variables directly. Using the change of variables rule [13], we obtain the following approximate marginal likelihood:

$$\begin{aligned}
&p(\mathbf{Y}=y_1,\ldots, y_N|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{\theta}) \\
&\approx \sum_{\mathbf{q}(Z)}\sum_{\mathbf{r}(U)}\cdots\sum_{\mathbf{h}(V)}p(\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{V}, \mathbf{Y}=y_1,\ldots, y_N|\mathbf{q}(Z), \mathbf{r}(U), \cdots,\mathbf{h}(V)),
\end{aligned}\tag{6}$$

where each summand is an expectation taken over the posterior distribution of the latent variables conditioned on the observed data and the hyperparameters. Intuitively, the inner summand represents the product of all possible configurations of the latent variables, whereas the outer summand corresponds to integrating over the posterior distribution of the latent variables themselves. Note that the quality of the approximations depends critically on the choice of approximate posteriors for the latent variables.

To compute the ELBO, we introduce an auxiliary variational distribution $\hat{q}(Z),\hat{r}(U),\cdots,\hat{h}(V)$ and maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) with respect to $\hat{q}(Z),\hat{r}(U),\cdots,\hat{h}(V)$ subject to the constraints of the true posterior distribution $q(Z), r(U),\cdots, h(V)$:

$$\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}&=\int_\Theta \log p(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{V}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{\theta}) d\Theta \\
&\geq \int_\Theta \log q(\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{V}|\mathbf{Y}) + \log p(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{V}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{\theta}) d\Theta \\
&\equiv \text{ELBO}(\hat{q}, \hat{r}, \cdots,\hat{h}),
\end{align*}\tag{7}$$

where the equality holds thanks to the fact that the integration over the entire space of hyperparameters does not affect the minimization of the ELBO. The goal of maximizing the ELBO is to choose the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the hyperparameters that maximizes the expected log likelihood of the observed data under the approximate posterior distribution.


# 4.Robustness Properties of PPCA
There are three important robustness properties of PPCA that make it suitable for handling highly corrupted or noisy data. They are described below.

## Shrinkage Regularization
The first property of PPCA is related to the shrinkage penalty introduced earlier, which improves the stability and convergence of the algorithm. Specifically, if we take the negative log likelihood loss rather than the risk, then adding the shrinkage penalty causes the solution to converge towards a sparse solution with fewer zeros in the coefficient vectors [6]. This leads to higher accuracy when dealing with very large datasets, where the curse of dimensionality can make exact inference challenging even for relatively simple models like PPCA.

Another benefit of using the shrinkage penalty is that it forces the model to select only relevant features, reducing the risk of overfitting the data [6]. This makes the learned representations more meaningful and informative, especially for tasks such as gene expression analysis.

## Sampling Noise Variance Estimation
One way to account for the intrinsic stochasticity of the data is to add additional noise terms to the observations and estimate their variance using a separate model [6]. Specifically, we fit another model to the sampled versions of the data generated by sampling from the noise covariance matrix of the GP prior [14]. This approach guarantees that the predictions of the PPCA model remain consistent even when applied to previously unseen data, regardless of the actual noise characteristics of the data itself.

## Statistical Models for Corrupted Data
An alternative approach to improve the performance of PPCA is to use more flexible statistical models that can capture the covariance structure of the noise terms separately [6]. Two popular choices are ARD (Automatic Relevance Determination) regression and the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) [15][16]. Both of these models allow the user to specify the degree of freedom of the tail dependence of the error terms. As a result, they can better model the structure of the noise terms without assuming that the error terms follow a fixed distribution. 

Furthermore, these statistical models can also automatically adjust the hyperparameters to minimize the reconstruction error of the data under the model. This helps to avoid overfitting the data and produces more accurate reconstructions of the original signal [6]. Overall, these advances suggest that PPCA could become a more widely useful tool for analyzing large datasets containing substantial amounts of noise and outliers.

# 5.Improving PPCA Performance
Finally, we discuss four main strategies for improving the performance of PPCA beyond the basic ideas discussed above. These include using efficient sampling schemes, increasing computational efficiency, incorporating domain knowledge, and employing ensemble methods [17][18][19].

## Efficient Sampling Schemes
One challenge for applying PPCA to large datasets is that the cost of computing the posterior predictive distribution grows exponentially with the size of the dataset [2]. To address this issue, several efficient sampling schemes have been proposed [20][21]. These include mini-batch SGD (stochastic gradient descent) [20] and Gibbs sampling [21]. These methods reduce the computational burden of generating the complete posterior predictive distribution by considering only a subset of the data at every iteration, which can lead to faster convergence rates and more memory-efficient computations.

## Increased Computational Efficiency
One key bottleneck of PPCA is its dependence on fast matrix multiplication operations. Currently, most modern machines support hardware acceleration for floating-point matrix multiplications, but this technology has not yet been adopted extensively for deep neural networks. In light of this limitation, several strategies have been proposed for speeding up computationally intensive parts of PPCA [22][23][24]. These include reducing the number of principal components, utilizing parallelism for multi-core CPUs, and exploiting specialized hardware instructions [22][24].

## Domain Knowledge Incorporation
Another area of active research is incorporating domain knowledge about the structure of the data into PPCA. Some promising avenues for doing this include using structured prediction techniques to extract dependencies across groups of features [25], enforcing smoothness constraints to ensure that the learned representations preserve the local geometry of the data [26], or incorporating priors derived from physically motivated principles [27]. 

All of these techniques involve modifying the objective function of the PPCA model and/or introducing additional latent variables to accommodate the extra structure. These modifications usually come with the promise of increased predictive power but require careful hyperparameter tuning and experimentation to attain the desired level of performance.

## Ensemble Methods
Ensembling techniques can further enhance the predictive power of PPCA by combining multiple estimates of the hidden states [17][18][19]. This involves creating multiple models trained on randomly selected subsets of the data, which combine their output to produce an overall prediction [17][18][19]. Several variations of this strategy have been proposed [28][29][30]. These methods can boost the predictive performance of the model by focusing on areas of the data where the uncertainties are highest, which can help to avoid overfitting and improve robustness. On the other hand, ensembles can sometimes perform poorly when faced with highly noisy or ill-behaved datasets, requiring careful attention to the effects of ensemble members on the final outcome.
