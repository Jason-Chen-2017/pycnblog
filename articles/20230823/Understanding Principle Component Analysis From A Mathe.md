Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular method for dimensionality reduction in machine learning and data science applications such as image processing, pattern recognition, bioinformatics, and genomics. In this article we will first introduce the basic concepts of PCA and how it works using mathematical language and algorithms from the perspective of a mathematician. We will then apply PCA to some real-world examples and demonstrate its usefulness in different scenarios. Finally, we will discuss potential future research directions that may benefit from improved understanding of PCA techniques. 

# 2.Background Introduction
The key idea behind principal component analysis (PCA) is to find a low-dimensional representation of the original high-dimensional dataset by transforming it into a new set of uncorrelated variables known as principle components or eigenvectors. The intuition behind PCA lies in representing the data points in a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of their information and discarding noisy features. For example, consider the following two-dimensional dataset:


If we want to reduce this dataset to one dimension, say x axis, which represents variations along its length, we can use PCA to project these points onto the line y=x+k where k is an unknown constant offset. This projection effectively captures the shape and orientation of the cloud of points. By choosing the direction of projection based on the largest variance among the projected points, we minimize the loss of information while preserving the structure of the underlying cloud. Similarly, if we choose to project the points onto the line perpendicular to y=x+k, we would obtain a second principle component along which there are fewer variations in the original dataset. These components capture higher-order variations that cannot be captured by simple linear projections. 

However, finding a low-dimensional representation without any noise remains challenging even in the simplest cases like the above example. In practice, datasets often contain multiple sources of correlated noise, making it difficult to identify informative dimensions. Moreover, the choice of the number of dimensions to retain depends on various factors such as computational cost, accuracy requirements, and interpretability concerns. To address these issues, several variants of PCA have been proposed over the years, including kernel methods, sparse methods, and iterative solvers. However, all these approaches require careful tuning of hyperparameters and tradeoffs between model complexity and performance. Therefore, developing effective tools for analyzing and visualizing PCA results remains a crucial challenge.

# 3.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Components and Variance
Let X denote a matrix containing n samples each with p features. Let Σ be the covariance matrix of X. Then, the eigendecomposition of Σ is given by:

Σ = W^T * D * W

where W is a matrix whose columns are the right eigenvectors of Σ sorted by decreasing order of corresponding eigenvalues, and D is a diagonal matrix containing the square roots of the eigenvalues in decreasing order. Thus, the i-th column of W corresponds to the i-th principle component of X, and the corresponding value in D gives the proportion of total variation explained by the i-th component. The m-th row and j-th column of the transformed matrix Y = X*W reduces the dimensionality of X from p to m, where m ≤ p.

## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Similar to PCA, SVD also factorizes a matrix X into three matrices U, S, V = VT. The decomposition is given by:

X = U * S * V^T

Here, U and V are unitary matrices, and S contains the singular values of X arranged in descending order. The m-th row and j-th column of the transformed matrix Y = U*S reduces the dimensionality of X from p to m. Note that S may not necessarily form a diagonal matrix due to numerical errors, but rather a diagonal matrix T is obtained through:

S = diag(sqrt(T))

This formula ensures that the transformed vectors have unit Euclidean norm and thus satisfy the condition of being normalized eigenvectors of X^T*X. Furthermore, since S consists of the variances of the left singular vectors multiplied by the transposed covariances of the left singular vectors, they reflect the intrinsic geometry and distribution of X.

# 4.PCA Algorithm
The general steps involved in performing PCA are as follows:

1. Compute the mean vector of the input data: μ = mean(X).
2. Subtract the mean from each sample to center the data around zero.
3. Compute the scatter matrix: Σ = (1/(m−1))*X'*X, where m is the number of samples and X' is the transpose of the centered matrix X.
4. Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of Σ using an eigensolver such as QR algorithm or SVD. The first k eigenvectors correspond to the k principle components of the input data.
5. Transform the input data by multiplying it with the eigenvectors corresponding to the chosen k principle components. The resulting transformation has reduced dimensionality to k.

Some important notes about PCA include:

1. PCA assumes that the input data has zero mean. If your data does not have zero mean, you should either remove the mean or subtract it before applying PCA.
2. PCA finds the directions of maximum variance in the data and projects the data onto those axes. It does not determine whether the directions found lie in the feature subspace or in the null space of X'. 
3. PCA transforms the input data into a new basis formed by the top k eigenvectors of Σ. This means that PCA identifies the patterns that contribute most to the variance of the data. You can interpret these patterns by assigning weights to them according to their importance. However, note that PCA does not assign equal weight to all the patterns identified. Instead, it normalizes the weights so that they sum up to 1.
