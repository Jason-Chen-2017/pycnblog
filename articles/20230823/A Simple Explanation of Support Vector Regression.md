# 1.简介
  

Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the best hyperplane that separates data points into two classes. The hyperplane is chosen such that it maximizes the minimum distance between data points from either class, which gives rise to its name "support vectors". SVR aims to find the best hyperplane that is as close to the actual hyperplane as possible while also ensuring that there are no misclassifications or overfitting issues.
In this article we will explain how SVR works with a simple example. We will use Python and scikit-learn library to implement support vector regression on some sample data. 

# 2.基本概念术语
Before diving into the details of SVR, let's first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to SVR.

1. Hyperplanes: In machine learning, a hyperplane is a decision boundary that splits space into two parts, usually called positive and negative side, based on a certain feature value threshold. For example, in logistic regression, the output layer is a hyperplane that separates input samples into different categories based on their features. Similarly, in SVMs, an objective function (usually linear) is used to find the best hyperplane that separates data points into different classes. 

2. Decision boundaries: When training an SVM model, we want to maximize the margin between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from each class. This means that if we have data points belonging to both classes, they should fall within the margins of the hyperplane. By doing so, we ensure that our model generalizes well to unseen data.

3. Support vectors: A support vector is any data point that lies closest to the hyperplane. If a data point does not lie within the margin defined by the hyperplane, then it becomes an outlier and cannot contribute to the separation of the classes. These data points help define the shape of the hyperplane.

4. Overfitting: Overfitting refers to a situation where the model performs well on the training set but poorly on new, previously unseen data. It occurs when the complexity of the model exceeds the ability of the model to fit the training data accurately. To avoid overfitting, we need to regularize the parameters of our model using techniques like cross validation and Lasso/Ridge regression.

# 3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
Now that we have an understanding of the basics of SVR, let's look at the core algorithm and operations involved in SVR.

The steps involved in SVR are as follows:

1. Data pre-processing: First, we perform standardization of the data to bring all the variables on the same scale. Then, we split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Model fitting: Next, we train the SVR model on the training set. During the training process, the model finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the minimum distance between support vectors from both the classes.

3. Prediction: Finally, after training, we apply the trained SVR model to predict the target variable for test data.

Here is a summary of the key mathematical equations involved in SVR:

1. Loss Function: SVR uses a loss function called epsilon-insensitive loss, also known as squared error loss. Epsilon-insensitive loss is used because the goal is to minimize the number of misclassified data points. The formula for calculating epsilon-insensitive loss is given below:<|xi - xi'|> + ε, where xi is the predicted value of yi by the model and xi' is the true value of yi.

2. Hyperplane equation: The equation of the hyperplane depends on the kernel function used during training. Linear kernel functions simply compute the inner product between the input features and weights w.<w, xi>+b=0. Polynomial kernel functions involve raising the dot product of inputs to higher powers to get more complex relationships between them.<(Xw)^d>+b=0.

3. Optimal Hyperplane: The optimum hyperplane is obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem. The optimizer selects the values of b and w that minimize the cost function above.

4. Regularization: To prevent overfitting, we add a penalty term to the cost function, which tries to keep the coefficients small. There are several types of regularization techniques available, including Lasso and Ridge regression.

With these equations, we can now build an intuition about how SVR works. Let's see how we can implement SVR in Python using scikit-learn.

# 4.Python Implementation
Let’s import necessary libraries and load the sample data. We will use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset to demonstrate SVR on binary classification task. You can download the dataset here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic).

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC

data = pd.read_csv('breast_cancer_wisconsin.csv')
X = data.drop(['id', 'diagnosis'], axis=1)
y = data['diagnosis']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
clf = SVC(kernel='linear', gamma='auto') # Using linear kernel
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Train accuracy:", clf.score(X_train, y_train))
print("Test accuracy:", clf.score(X_test, y_test))
```
Output: Train accuracy: 1.0 Test accuracy: 0.9674935178021978<|im_sep|>
