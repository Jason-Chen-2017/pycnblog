# 1.简介
  

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular and widely used dimensionality reduction technique for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data. It helps to identify the underlying structure of complex datasets by transforming them into a new set of uncorrelated variables that explain maximum variance in the original dataset.

In this article, we will discuss what PCA is, why it's important and how it works. We'll also provide examples and applications to help you understand its value.

## 2.1 Data Manipulation
PCA can be thought of as a process of transforming a large matrix of observations into a smaller one with fewer dimensions while preserving most of the information from the original matrix. The resulting transformed space can then be plotted or analyzed further using standard techniques such as clustering algorithms, regression models etc.

We start by defining a large matrix $X$ where each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature:

$$ X = \begin{bmatrix} x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1p}\\
                      x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2p}\\
                      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
                      x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \cdots & x_{np}\end{bmatrix}$$
                      
where $x_{ij}$ refers to the jth feature of the ith observation. In other words, the rows represent individual entities, while the columns are their attributes or features. For example, if we have collected data on tennis players' heights, weights, and speeds, our table would look like this:

| Height | Weight | Speed   |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 178    | 90     | 12.8 km/h|
| 169    | 84     | 13.4 km/h|
| 171    | 88     | 12.5 km/h|
|...    |...    |...      |

Note that there may be missing values in the data and different scales could affect the results. Therefore, before applying any machine learning algorithm, it's always recommended to normalize the data first so that all features contribute equally towards the variance. Normalization involves scaling each feature to a common range between zero and one, which makes sure that no single feature dominates the analysis.

Next, let's define a target variable y, i.e., some continuous variable that we want to predict based on the input features. We assume that $y$ has a linear relationship with the input features, but not necessarily a perfect one, which means that there might still exist some noise or random variations in the data.  

## 2.2 Principal Components Analysis (PCA) 
PCA is a statistical method that converts a multi-dimensional dataset consisting of correlated variables into a set of principal components. Each principal component captures a direction along which the highest variance exists in the dataset, and hence represents a possible explanation for the total variation in the data. By choosing a subset of these principal components, we can capture the relevant parts of the data and discard irrelevant ones, leading to a lower-dimensional representation of the original data. This reduces the computational cost associated with running various machine learning algorithms, especially when dealing with large datasets with many features. 

The main idea behind PCA is to find a low-rank approximation of the data that minimizes the sum of squared distances between the original points and their projected counterparts onto each principal component. Mathematically, we can write down the optimization problem as follows:

$$\underset{\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_k}{\min}\left \| X - \sum_{i=1}^{p} \mu_ix^{(i)}\right \|^2,$$

where $\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_k$ are the k eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix of $X$. Intuitively, we're trying to find the best way to project each point onto the directions of maximum variance in the dataset while staying as close as possible to the original coordinates.

After finding the eigenvectors, we obtain a transformation matrix A as follows:

$$A=\begin{bmatrix}\mu_1& \cdots & \mu_p \\
               \vdots&\ddots &\vdots\\
               0&\cdots &\mu_p
              \end{bmatrix}.$$

Now, given any point x ∈ R(p), we can compute its projection onto the reduced subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of A as follows:

$$z_i = (\mu_1^\top x^{(i)}, \ldots, \mu_p^\top x^{(i)})^\top.$$

Finally, we can reconstruct the original dataset X by adding back the mean vector minus the product of A with z_i for each observation:

$$\hat{X} = X + E_1 + \cdots + E_k,$$

where E_i is the error term corresponding to the i-th eigenvector $\mu_i$, calculated as follows:

$$E_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n [(x^{(j)}-\bar{x})(\mu_i^\top x^{(j)})].$$

This formula shows that the errors introduced by approximating the data with only k eigenvectors can be estimated using simple linear algebra operations and don't require any additional modeling assumptions about the data generating process beyond linearity. Moreover, the reconstruction procedure doesn't change the distribution of the data; rather, it simply replaces each observed data point with its contribution to the k largest eigenvalues, thus reducing the number of dimensions in the dataset without losing much information.
