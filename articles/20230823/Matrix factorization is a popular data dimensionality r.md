Matrix factorization, also known as collaborative filtering or latent factor model, is a commonly used approach for recommendation systems. It aims to find users' preferences from their behavior on various items. There are three main approaches:

1. User-based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF): This approach measures similarity between different users based on their past behaviors on similar items. Based on the similarity score, we can predict how much each user would rate an unseen item. However, it has some drawbacks such as cold start problem when there are new users who have not rated any item before. Therefore, UBCF is less preferred than other methods. 

2. Item-based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF): Similarly, IBCF uses the similarities among different items instead of users to recommend users' preferences. Here, we try to estimate the preference value of a particular user for an item based on his/her ratings on similar items. IBCF still suffers from the cold start issue because no historical information about these similar items exists for new users.

3. Latent Factor Model (LFM): LFM applies a probabilistic generative model to learn the underlying structure of the user-item rating matrix. Specifically, we assume that each user is described by a set of latent factors, and each item is likewise characterized by a set of latent factors. By comparing the strength of the predicted ratings of different pairs of user-item, we can infer the hidden preferences of individual users and items.

In summary, matrix factorization finds common features of users’ interests across multiple items, which makes it suitable for large-scale online recommendation systems where data size is typically very large. Several variants of LFM have been proposed with different interpretations and objectives. Popular ones include SVD++, NMF, and probablistic matrix factorization. These models aim to capture the interplay between users and items through the learned latent factors. However, all these methods suffer from the sparsity issue, i.e., only a small percentage of the entries in the original rating matrix are nonzero due to the limited number of observations. To address this challenge, several recent works have focused on preserving both sparsity and low-rank properties of the latent representations while using more advanced optimization techniques such as alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and stochastic gradient descent. Although they achieve competitive performance compared to conventional methods, further research is required to optimize the hyperparameters of these algorithms and improve the robustness and interpretability of their recommendations. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
To understand what matrix factorization is, let's break down its key components:

## Matrix Decomposition
The matrix factorization technique decomposes the user-item rating matrix into two low-rank matrices, namely the user feature matrix and the item feature matrix. Mathematically, given a rating matrix $R$, we want to approximate the true rating matrix $\hat{R}$ by the dot product of two low rank matrices, $\hat{U} \cdot \hat{V}^T$. We can write this as follows:

$$\hat{R}= \hat{U} \cdot \hat{V}^T $$

where $\hat{U}$ is the user feature matrix with dimensions ($m$ x $k$) and $\hat{V}$ is the item feature matrix with dimensions ($n$ x $k$). The entry $(u,i)$ of $\hat{R}$ approximates the true rating $r_{ui}$ with error at most $|r_{ui}-\hat{r}_{ui}|$. 

We usually use singular value decomposition (SVD) to compute the best approximation of the user feature matrix and the item feature matrix. The basic idea behind SVD is to find the best left and right singular vectors of the input matrix. If the input matrix is a sparse matrix, then only few of the columns of the output matrices will be filled up with non-zero values. Hence, the computed user feature matrix $\hat{U}$, and item feature matrix $\hat{V}$, capture the important patterns of user preferences and item attributes respectively.

## Objective function
The objective function plays a crucial role in determining the optimal solution to the matrix factorization problem. While several choices exist such as mean squared error, rooted mean squared error, and Frobenius norm, the choice of objective function directly impacts the quality of the recommendations obtained by the system. One of the most commonly used loss functions for matrix factorization is quadratic loss function defined as follows:

$$\mathcal{L}(R,\hat{U},\hat{V})=\sum_{(u,i)\in R} (\hat{r}_{ui}-r_{ui})^2+\lambda_U\left(\|\hat{U}\|_F^2+\frac{\rho}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sigma_j^2 \right)+\lambda_I\left(\|\hat{V}\|_F^2+\frac{\rho}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sigma_j^2 \right)$$

where $R$ is the ground truth rating matrix, $\hat{U}$ and $\hat{V}$ are the estimated user feature matrix and item feature matrix, respectively. The regularization term controls the tradeoff between fitting the training data exactly and avoiding overfitting. $\lambda_U$ and $\lambda_I$ control the relative importance of these terms towards the total cost function. The subscript $F$ denotes the Frobenius norm, which captures the overall magnitude of the difference between the predicted rating matrix and the ground truth. Finally, $\rho$ and $\sigma_j$ are the sparsity parameters and scaling factors of the corresponding row and column.

## Optimization Algorithm
There are many optimization algorithms available to solve the matrix factorization problem. Some of the popular ones include Alternating Least Squares (ALS), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Randomized Subspace Iteration (RSI). ALS is an iterative procedure that updates the user and item feature matrices simultaneously until convergence. At each iteration, it solves the following optimization problems separately:

$$\min_{\hat{U}}\max_{\hat{V}} \mathcal{L}(R,\hat{U},\hat{V}) \\ \text{subject to } ||\hat{U}||_{*} \leq 1,||\hat{V}||_{*} \leq 1,$$

where $||\cdot||_*$ denotes the nuclear norm of a matrix. The superscript $*$ indicates that it is a maximization problem. The constraints ensure that both matrices are normalized so that their elementwise products preserve the length of each vector within reasonable limits. Other optimization algorithms may relax these constraints to allow larger errors in the predicted ratings, but this comes at the expense of slower convergence. SGD is another optimization technique that updates the matrices one element at a time based on mini-batches of examples. RSI is inspired by the COLLABORATIVE LEARNING RECOMMENDER SYSTEM algorithm of Perron et al. and is optimized for speed by reducing the dimensionality of the tensors involved in computing predictions. Overall, the choice of optimization algorithm determines the accuracy and computational efficiency of the final results.
