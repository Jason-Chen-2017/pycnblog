DBSCAN, or Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, is a popular clustering algorithm that can identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes in large datasets. However, as the size of datasets continues to grow, the original DBSCAN algorithm has become increasingly inefficient. In this article, we will explore the process of parallelizing the DBSCAN algorithm to improve its performance on large datasets.

## 1.1 The Need for Parallelization

As data sizes grow, the original DBSCAN algorithm becomes increasingly inefficient. The algorithm's time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, which can be prohibitive for large datasets. Additionally, the algorithm's core operations, such as neighborhood querying and core point identification, can be further optimized.

Parallelization can help address these issues by distributing the workload across multiple processing units, reducing the overall processing time. This is particularly important for large-scale data clustering tasks, where the goal is to identify clusters in datasets with millions or even billions of data points.

## 1.2 Overview of the DBSCAN Algorithm

DBSCAN works by identifying clusters of data points that are closely packed together, based on a user-defined distance threshold (ε) and a minimum number of points required to form a dense region (MinPts). The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Select an arbitrary data point from the dataset.
2. Retrieve the set of neighboring points within the ε-distance.
3. If the number of neighboring points is greater than or equal to MinPts, form a cluster and expand it by recursively adding neighboring points that are within the ε-distance.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all data points have been processed.

In the next section, we will discuss the core concepts and mathematical models behind the DBSCAN algorithm in detail.
