## 3.1.Linear Regression
Linear regression is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a linear equation.

The linear regression model can be represented as:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon
$$

Where:

- $y$ is the dependent variable (target)
- $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ are the independent variables (features)
- $\beta_0, \beta_1, \cdots, \beta_n$ are the coefficients to be estimated
- $\epsilon$ is the error term

To estimate the coefficients, we can use the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of squared errors between the observed and predicted values. The optimal coefficients can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
$$

Where:

- $X$ is the matrix of features
- $y$ is the vector of target values
- $\hat{\beta}$ is the estimated coefficients

## 3.2.Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is an extension of linear regression used for predicting categorical values (binary or multi-class). It models the probability of a certain class using a logistic function, which maps the linear combination of features to a value between 0 and 1.

The logistic regression model can be represented as:

$$
P(y=1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_nx_n)}}
$$

Where:

- $P(y=1 | x)$ is the probability of the dependent variable (target) being 1 given the features
- $\beta_0, \beta_1, \cdots, \beta_n$ are the coefficients to be estimated
- $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm

To estimate the coefficients, we can use the maximum likelihood estimation method, which maximizes the likelihood of observing the given data. The optimal coefficients can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^T W X)^{-1} X^T W y
$$

Where:

- $X$ is the matrix of features
- $y$ is the vector of target values
- $W$ is a diagonal matrix with elements $w_{ii} = P(y=i)$
- $\hat{\beta}$ is the estimated coefficients

## 3.3.Decision Trees
Decision trees are a non-parametric machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the values of the features, creating a tree-like structure.

The decision tree algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Select the best feature to split the data based on a criterion (e.g., information gain or Gini impurity).
2. Split the data into subsets based on the selected feature.
3. Recursively apply steps 1 and 2 to each subset until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth or minimum number of samples).
4. Assign the majority class or average value to each leaf node.

## 3.4.Random Forest
Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the overall performance and reduce overfitting. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of features, and the final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all trees (e.g., by taking the majority vote for classification or averaging for regression).

The random forest algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Draw random samples without replacement from the original dataset (with replacement for bootstrap aggregating).
2. Grow a decision tree on each random sample.
3. Aggregate the predictions of all trees to get the final prediction.

## 3.5.Gradient Boosting
Gradient boosting is another ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the overall performance and reduce overfitting. Unlike random forests, gradient boosting trains trees sequentially, where each tree tries to correct the errors made by the previous tree.

The gradient boosting algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the prediction model (e.g., a constant value or the mean of the target).
2. For each tree, calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the prediction model.
3. Grow a decision tree that minimizes the negative gradient of the loss function.
4. Update the prediction model by adding the contribution of the current tree.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of trees or convergence).

## 3.6.Support Vector Machines
Support vector machines (SVM) are a family of supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. They work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes with the maximum margin.

The SVM algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Transform the data into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function.
2. Find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.
3. Use the optimal hyperplane to classify new data points.

## 3.7.Principal Component Analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform the data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much information as possible. It works by finding the linear combinations of features that explain the most variance in the data.

The PCA algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Standardize the data (e.g., by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation).
2. Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data.
3. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
4. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the top k eigenvectors.
5. Project the data onto the k-dimensional subspace spanned by the selected eigenvectors.

## 4.1.Linear Regression Example

```python
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

# Load the data
data = spark.read.format("libsvm").load("data/mllib/sample_linear_regression_data.txt")

# Assemble the features into a single column
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["feature1", "feature2"], outputCol="features")
assembled_data = assembler.transform(data)

# Split the data into training and test sets
(training_data, test_data) = assembled_data.randomSplit([0.6, 0.4])

# Train the linear regression model
linear_regression = LinearRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="label")
model = linear_regression.fit(training_data)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
test_predictions = model.transform(test_data)
evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(metricName="rmse", labelCol="label", predictionCol="prediction")
rmse = evaluator.evaluate(test_predictions)
print(f"Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): {rmse}")
```

In this example, we load the data, assemble the features into a single column, split the data into training and test sets, train the linear regression model, and evaluate the model on the test set using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric.

## 4.2.Logistic Regression Example

```python
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler, IndexToString, StringIndexer

# Load the data
data = spark.read.format("libsvm").load("data/mllib/sample_logistic_regression_data.txt")

# Assemble the features into a single column
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["feature1", "feature2"], outputCol="features")
assembled_data = assembler.transform(data)

# Index labels, adding metadata to the label column
label_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="label", outputCol="indexedLabel").fit(assembled_data)
label_indexed = label_indexer.transform(assembled_data)

# Split the data into training and test sets
(training_data, test_data) = label_indexed.randomSplit([0.6, 0.4])

# Train the logistic regression model
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="indexedLabel", maxIter=10)
model = logistic_regression.fit(training_data)

# Make predictions on the test set
test_predictions = model.transform(test_data)

# Select example rows to display.
test_predictions.select("prediction", "label", "features").show(5)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(rawPredictionCol="prediction", labelCol="indexedLabel", metricName="areaUnderROC")
auc = evaluator.evaluate(test_predictions)
print(f"Area under ROC (AUC): {auc}")
```

In this example, we load the data, assemble the features into a single column, index the labels, split the data into training and test sets, train the logistic regression model, make predictions on the test set, and evaluate the model on the test set using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) metric.
