# 4. Code Examples and Explanations
# 4.1 Creating a Graph
To create a graph in Amazon Neptune, you can use the following code:

```python
import boto3

# Create a client for Amazon Neptune
client = boto3.client('neptune')

# Create a graph
response = client.create_graph(
    GraphName='energy-utilities',
    Description='Energy and Utilities Graph',
    GraphType='UNDIRECTED'
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

This code creates a new graph called `energy-utilities` with the description `Energy and Utilities Graph` and the graph type `UNDIRECTED`.

# 4.2 Adding Nodes and Edges
To add nodes and edges to the graph, you can use the following code:

```python
# Add a node for a generator
response = client.run_graph_query(
    GraphName='energy-utilities',
    Query='CREATE (g:Generator {id: 1, name: "Generator 1", capacity: 100})',
    ReturnOptions='CONSOLIDATED'
)

# Add a node for a transmission line
response = client.run_graph_query(
    GraphName='energy-utilities',
    Query='CREATE (t:TransmissionLine {id: 1, capacity: 1000})',
    ReturnOptions='CONSOLIDATED'
)

# Add an edge for the generation-transmission relationship
response = client.run_graph_query(
    GraphName='energy-utilities',
    Query='CREATE (g:Generator)-[:GENERATES]->(t:TransmissionLine)',
    ReturnOptions='CONSOLIDATED'
)
```

This code adds a node for a generator with the id `1`, name `Generator 1`, and generation capacity `100`. It also adds a node for a transmission line with the id `1` and transmission capacity `1000`. Finally, it adds an edge for the generation-transmission relationship between the generator and the transmission line.

# 4.3 Querying the Graph
To query the graph, you can use the following code:

```python
# Query the graph for all generators
response = client.run_graph_query(
    GraphName='energy-utilities',
    Query='MATCH (g:Generator) RETURN g',
    ReturnOptions='CONSOLIDATED'
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

This code queries the graph for all generators and returns the results in a consolidated format.

# 4.4 Updating Nodes and Edges
To update nodes and edges, you can use the following code:

```python
# Update a generator node
response = client.run_graph_query(
    GraphName='energy-utilities',
    Query='MATCH (g:Generator {id: 1}) SET g.name = "Generator 2"',
    ReturnOptions='CONSOLIDATED'
)

# Update a transmission line edge
response = client.run_graph_query(
    GraphName='energy-utilities',
    Query='MATCH ()-[r:GENERATES]->() SET r.capacity = 200',
    ReturnOptions='CONSOLIDATED'
)
```

This code updates the name of the generator node with the id `1` to `Generator 2`. It also updates the capacity of the generation-transmission edge to `200`.

# 4.5 Deleting Nodes and Edges
To delete nodes and edges, you can use the following code:

```python
# Delete a generator node
response = client.run_graph_query(
    GraphName='energy-utilities',
    Query='MATCH (g:Generator {id: 1}) DELETE g',
    ReturnOptions='CONSOLIDATED'
)

# Delete a transmission line edge
response = client.run_graph_query(
    GraphName='energy-utilities',
    Query='MATCH ()-[r:GENERATES]->() DELETE r',
    ReturnOptions='CONSOLIDATED'
)
```

This code deletes the generator node with the id `1`. It also deletes the generation-transmission edge.
