### 2.1 FoundationDB Core Concepts

FoundationDB is a distributed, key-value store database that is designed to handle large-scale, complex data workloads. It is a NoSQL database that provides ACID-compliant transactions, strong consistency, and high availability.

#### 2.1.1 Distributed Key-Value Store

A distributed key-value store is a database that stores data in key-value pairs, where the key is a unique identifier for the value. In a distributed key-value store, the data is stored across multiple servers, which allows for high availability and scalability.

#### 2.1.2 ACID-Compliant Transactions

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are properties of a database transaction that ensure that the transaction is executed correctly and that the data is consistent.

#### 2.1.3 Strong Consistency

Strong consistency means that all replicas of the data are updated simultaneously, ensuring that the data is always consistent across all replicas.

#### 2.1.4 High Availability

High availability means that the database is always available, even in the event of a server failure.

#### 2.2.2 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset. The algorithm learns to find patterns or structures in the data without any prior knowledge of the labels.

#### 2.2.3 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment. The algorithm receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and learns to make decisions based on this feedback.

### 2.3 FoundationDB and Machine Learning

### 3.1 Supervised Learning Algorithm: Linear Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input variables. The algorithm finds the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values.

#### 3.1.1 Linear Regression Equation

The linear regression equation is given by:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon
$$

where $y$ is the predicted target variable, $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are the input variables, $\beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_n$ are the coefficients to be learned, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

#### 3.1.2 Cost Function

The cost function for linear regression is given by:

$$
J(\beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_n) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x_i) - y_i)^2
$$

where $J$ is the cost function, $m$ is the number of training examples, $h_\theta(x_i)$ is the predicted value for the $i$-th training example, and $y_i$ is the actual value for the $i$-th training example.

#### 3.1.3 Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that is used to minimize the cost function. The algorithm updates the coefficients iteratively by taking steps proportional to the negative of the gradient of the cost function with respect to the coefficients.

### 3.2 Unsupervised Learning Algorithm: K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to group similar data points into clusters. The algorithm finds the centroids of the clusters and assigns each data point to the nearest centroid.

#### 3.2.1 K-Means Equation

The k-means equation is given by:

$$
\text{argmin}_C \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{x_j \in C_i} ||x_j - \mu_i||^2
$$

where $C$ is the set of clusters, $k$ is the number of clusters, $x_j$ is the data point, and $\mu_i$ is the centroid of the $i$-th cluster.

#### 3.2.2 Cost Function

The cost function for k-means clustering is given by:

$$
J(C) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{x_j \in C_i} ||x_j - \mu_i||^2
$$

where $J$ is the cost function, $k$ is the number of clusters, $x_j$ is the data point, and $\mu_i$ is the centroid of the $i$-th cluster.

#### 3.2.3 K-Means Algorithm

The k-means algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Initialize the centroids randomly.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. Update the centroids by taking the mean of the data points assigned to each centroid.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly.

### 3.3 Reinforcement Learning Algorithm: Q-Learning

Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to learn the value of an action in a given state. The algorithm uses a Q-table to store the values of the actions in each state.

#### 3.3.1 Q-Learning Equation

The Q-learning equation is given by:

$$
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a')) - Q(s, a)
$$

where $Q(s, a)$ is the value of the action $a$ in the state $s$, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, $r$ is the reward, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $a'$ is the action taken in the next state $s'$.

#### 3.3.2 Q-Learning Algorithm

The Q-learning algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Initialize the Q-table randomly.
2. Choose an action $a$ in the current state $s$.
3. Take the action $a$ and observe the reward $r$ and the next state $s'$.
4. Update the Q-table using the Q-learning equation.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the algorithm converges.
