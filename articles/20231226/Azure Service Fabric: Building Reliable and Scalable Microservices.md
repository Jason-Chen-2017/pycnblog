# 2.核心概念与联系

## 2.1 What is a microservice?

A microservice is a small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable unit of software that performs a specific function or set of functions. Microservices are designed to be easy to develop, deploy, and scale, and to fail gracefully. They are typically built using lightweight frameworks and technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, and are often organized around business capabilities rather than technical constraints.

## 2.2 What is a stateful service?

A stateful service is a microservice that maintains state, or data, across multiple requests or invocations. Stateful services are typically used for tasks such as storing data, managing sessions, or maintaining application state. Stateful services can be more complex to deploy and manage than stateless services, as they require careful consideration of data persistence, replication, and consistency.

## 2.3 What is a stateless service?

A stateless service is a microservice that does not maintain state, or data, across multiple requests or invocations. Stateless services are typically used for tasks such as processing requests, performing calculations, or executing business logic. Stateless services are easier to deploy and manage than stateful services, as they do not require consideration of data persistence, replication, or consistency.

## 2.4 What is a container?

A container is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained unit of software that includes everything needed to run the application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Containers are typically used to package and deploy microservices, and are often built using technologies such as Docker.

## 2.5 What is a cluster?

A cluster is a group of computers or virtual machines that work together to provide a single, unified resource pool. Clusters are commonly used to deploy and manage distributed applications, such as those built using Azure Service Fabric.

- **Scalability**: Service Fabric provides built-in support for both horizontal and vertical scaling, with features such as auto-scaling and partitioning.

## 3.2 Health monitoring and repair

Service Fabric provides built-in health monitoring and repair features to ensure the reliability of distributed applications. Health monitoring is used to track the health of individual services and their underlying resources, while repair is used to automatically recover from failures.

## 3.3 Load balancing

Service Fabric provides built-in load balancing features to ensure the scalability and performance of distributed applications. Load balancing is used to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of a service, and can be configured using a variety of algorithms, such as round-robin, least connections, and consistent hashing.

## 3.4 Security

Service Fabric provides built-in security features to ensure the security of distributed applications. Security features include encryption, authentication, and authorization, and can be configured using a variety of protocols, such as TLS/SSL and OAuth.

## 4.1 Creating a stateless service

To create a stateless service in Azure Service Fabric, you can use the Service Fabric SDK to define a service class and implement the required interfaces. Here is an example of a simple stateless service:

```csharp
public class CalculatorService : StatelessService
{
    public CalculatorService(StatelessServiceContext context)
        : base(context)
    {
    }

    protected override IEnumerable<ServiceInstanceListener> CreateServiceInstanceListeners()
    {
        return new[]
        {
            new ServiceInstanceListener(serviceContext => new KestrelCommunicationListener(serviceContext, "CalculatorServiceType", ServiceInstanceListenerOptions.AllowSynchronousCalls), "CalculatorServiceEndpoint", ServiceInstanceListenerBindingProvider.GetBindingProvider<CalculatorService>())
        };
    }

    public async Task<int> Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CalculatorService` class inherits from `StatelessService`, which is an abstract class that provides a base implementation of the `StatelessService` interface. The `CalculatorService` class overrides the `CreateServiceInstanceListeners` method to define how the service should listen for incoming requests. The `Add` method is an example of a stateless operation that can be performed by the service.

## 4.2 Creating a stateful service

To create a stateful service in Azure Service Fabric, you can use the Service Fabric SDK to define a service class and implement the required interfaces. Here is an example of a simple stateful service:

```csharp
public class CounterService : StatefulService
{
    private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, int> _counters = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, int>();

    public CounterService(StatefulServiceContext context)
        : base(context)
    {
    }

    protected override IEnumerable<ServiceReplicaListener> CreateServiceReplicaListeners()
    {
        return new[]
        {
            new ServiceReplicaListener(serviceContext => new KestrelCommunicationListener(serviceContext, "CounterServiceType", ServiceReplicaListenerOptions.AllowSynchronousCalls), "CounterServiceEndpoint", ServiceReplicaListenerBindingProvider.GetBindingProvider<CounterService>())
        };
    }

    public async Task Increment(string key)
    {
        _counters.TryAdd(key, 1);
    }

    public async Task<int> Get(string key)
    {
        return _counters.GetOrAdd(key, key => 0);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CounterService` class inherits from `StatefulService`, which is an abstract class that provides a base implementation of the `StatefulService` interface. The `CounterService` class overrides the `CreateServiceReplicaListeners` method to define how the service should listen for incoming requests. The `Increment` and `Get` methods are examples of stateful operations that can be performed by the service.
