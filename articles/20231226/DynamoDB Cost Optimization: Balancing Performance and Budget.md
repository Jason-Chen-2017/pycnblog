## 1.1. DynamoDB Overview
DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that supports both document and key-value store models. It is designed to provide fast and predictable performance at any scale, and it offers several features that make it a popular choice for many applications. Some of the key features of DynamoDB include:

- **High performance**: DynamoDB is designed to provide fast and predictable performance, even at very large scales. It uses a distributed architecture with multiple replicas of your data, and it automatically scales to meet demand.
- **High availability**: DynamoDB is designed to provide high availability, even in the event of a hardware or network failure. It uses a distributed architecture with multiple replicas of your data, and it automatically fails over to a healthy replica if a failure occurs.
- **Scalability**: DynamoDB is designed to scale automatically, without any intervention from you. It uses a distributed architecture with multiple replicas of your data, and it automatically scales to meet demand.
- **Security**: DynamoDB is designed to provide security, even in the event of a hardware or network failure. It uses a distributed architecture with multiple replicas of your data, and it automatically fails over to a healthy replica if a failure occurs.
