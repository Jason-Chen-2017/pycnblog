Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system that is used in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. It is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from requests and responses. Memcached is used by many high-profile websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia.

In this article, we will discuss the deployment and management strategies for Memcached in the cloud. We will cover the following topics:

## 1. Background Introduction

Memcached was initially developed by Danga Interactive, a company that provided web hosting services. It was later maintained by a group of volunteers and is now maintained by the Memcached Development Team.

The main goal of Memcached is to reduce the load on databases and improve the performance of web applications. It achieves this by caching the results of expensive database queries and serving them directly to the client.

Memcached is a distributed system, which means that it can be deployed across multiple servers to provide high availability and scalability. It uses a client-server architecture, where clients send requests to the Memcached server, and the server responds with the requested data.

In the cloud, Memcached can be deployed on virtual machines or containers, and managed using cloud-based tools and services. This allows for easy scaling and management of the system, as well as reduced costs.

In the next section, we will discuss the core concepts and relationships in Memcached.
