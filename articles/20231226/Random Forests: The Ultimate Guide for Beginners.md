Random Forests, also known as Random Decision Forests, are a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. The idea behind Random Forests is to create a collection of decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data, and then combine their predictions to get a more accurate and stable result.

The concept of Random Forests was introduced by Leo Breiman in 2001. Since then, it has become one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, especially in the field of data mining and bioinformatics. Random Forests are known for their high accuracy, ease of use, and ability to handle large datasets with many features.
