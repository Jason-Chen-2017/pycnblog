# 4. Code Examples and Explanations

## 4.1 Example 1: Interactive Data Analysis and Visualization

In this example, we will perform an interactive data analysis and visualization using Apache Zeppelin. We will use the following steps:

1. **Create a new notebook:** Create a new notebook using Zeppelin's web-based interface.
2. **Write code:** Write the following code in the notebook:

```
%spark
val data = sc.textFile("path/to/data.csv")
val headers = data.first()
val rows = data.subtract(headers)
val parsedData = rows.map(_.split(","))
val numbers = parsedData.map(_.toDouble)
val sum = numbers.sum()
val avg = sum / numbers.count()
```

3. **Execute code:** Execute the code to perform data analysis and visualization.

4. **Visualize data:** Visualize the data using the following code:

```
%spark
val data = sc.textFile("path/to/data.csv")
val headers = data.first()
val rows = data.subtract(headers)
val parsedData = rows.map(_.split(","))
val numbers = parsedData.map(_.toDouble)
val sum = numbers.sum()
val avg = sum / numbers.count()

val plot = new org.apache.spark.deploy.python.PythonRDDFunction() {
  def call(rdd: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[Double]): org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[String] = {
    import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
    import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

    val spark = SparkSession.builder().appName("Zeppelin").getOrCreate()
    val df = spark.createDataFrame(rdd.map(x => ("value", x)).toDF())
    val avgValue = df.agg(avg("value")).collect().map(_.getDouble(0)).head

    val plotData = rdd.map(x => s"value: $x, average: $avgValue")
    plotData
  }
}
plot(numbers)
