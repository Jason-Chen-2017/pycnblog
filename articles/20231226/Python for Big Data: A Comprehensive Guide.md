## 1.2. Python for Big Data: Core Concepts
Before diving into the specifics of Python for big data, let's briefly review some core concepts:

- **Big data**: Refers to large and complex datasets that traditional data processing techniques cannot handle efficiently. Big data often involves distributed processing, parallelism, and real-time analysis.
- **Data processing**: The process of transforming raw data into meaningful information. This can involve cleaning, filtering, aggregating, and analyzing data.
- **Distributed computing**: A computing paradigm that involves dividing a large task into smaller subtasks and executing them concurrently on multiple machines.
- **Parallelism**: The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously to improve performance and efficiency.
- **Scalability**: The ability of a system to handle increased workload without significant degradation in performance.

With these concepts in mind, let's move on to the core principles and techniques of Python for big data.
