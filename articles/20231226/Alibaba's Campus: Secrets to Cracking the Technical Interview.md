    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = arr[:mid]
    right = arr[mid:]

    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)

    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    left_index = right_index = 0

    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):
        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:
            result.append(left[left_index])
            left_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[right_index])
            right_index += 1
