Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained significant attention in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence. They have been successfully applied to various tasks such as image synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation. Keras, a high-level neural network library, provides an easy-to-use interface for implementing GANs. In this guide, we will provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to build and train a GAN using Keras.

## 1.1 What are Generative Adversarial Networks?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models that consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained in a game-theoretic framework. The generator tries to produce realistic samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated samples. The two networks are trained simultaneously in a zero-sum game, where the improvement of one network comes at the expense of the other.

## 1.2 Why use Keras for GANs?
Keras is a high-level neural network library that is easy to use and highly modular. It provides a simple and efficient interface for building and training GANs. Keras also has a large community of users and developers, which means that there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.

## 1.3 Overview of the tutorial
In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to GANs and Keras
- Building a simple GAN with Keras
- Training a GAN with Keras
- Advanced GAN techniques with Keras
- Future trends and challenges in GANs

Now that we have introduced GANs and Keras, let's dive into the core concepts and algorithms.
