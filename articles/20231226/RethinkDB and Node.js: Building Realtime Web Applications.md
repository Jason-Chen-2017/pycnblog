### 4.1 RethinkDB Code Example

Here is an example of a RethinkDB code that queries data from a collection and filters it based on a specific value:

```javascript
const r = require('rethinkdb');

r.connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 28015 }, (err, conn) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }

  r.table('users').filter({ age: 25 }).run(conn, (err, cursor) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      process.exit(1);
    }

    cursor.toArray((err, results) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        process.exit(1);
      }

      console.log(results);
      conn.close();
    });
  });
});
```

### 4.2 Node.js Code Example

Here is an example of a Node.js code that listens for events and responds to them in real-time:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Hello, world!');
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Not found');
  }
});

server.on('request', (req, res) => {
  console.log(`Received request: ${req.url}`);
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
});
