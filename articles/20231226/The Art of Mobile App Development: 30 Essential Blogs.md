### 4.1 Native App Development Examples

Here are some code examples for native app development on popular platforms:

- **iOS**: Swift is the primary programming language for iOS development. Here's a simple example of a Swift function that calculates the area of a rectangle:

  ```swift
  func calculateRectangleArea(width: Double, height: Double) -> Double {
      return width * height
  }
  ```

- **Android**: Java is commonly used for Android app development. Here's a simple example of a Java method that calculates the factorial of a number:

  ```java
  public static int factorial(int number) {
      if (number <= 1) {
          return 1;
      } else {
          return number * factorial(number - 1);
      }
  }
  ```

### 4.2 Hybrid and Cross-platform App Development Examples

Here are some code examples for hybrid and cross-platform app development using popular frameworks:

- **React Native**: A popular framework for building cross-platform apps using JavaScript and React. Here's a simple example of a React Native component that displays a greeting message:

  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';
  import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

  const Greeting = () => {
      return (
          <View>
              <Text>Hello, World!</Text>
          </View>
      );
  };

  export default Greeting;
  ```

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building cross-platform apps using the Dart programming language. Here's a simple example of a Flutter widget that displays a greeting message:

  ```dart
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

  void main() => runApp(MyApp());

  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return MaterialApp(
        title: 'Flutter Demo',
        theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        ),
        home: MyHomePage(title: 'Hello, World!'),
      );
    }
  }

  class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
    final String title;

    MyHomePage({required this.title});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text(title),
        ),
        body: Center(
