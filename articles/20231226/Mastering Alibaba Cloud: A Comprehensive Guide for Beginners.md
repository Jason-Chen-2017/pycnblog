# 2. Mastering Alibaba Cloud: A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners

Now that we have a basic understanding of Alibaba Cloud and its services, let's dive into the core concepts, algorithms, and techniques used in Alibaba Cloud.

## 3.1. Core Concepts

### 3.1.1. Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of creating virtual instances of physical resources, such as servers, storage, and networks. This allows multiple virtual instances to run on a single physical resource, improving resource utilization and reducing costs.

### 3.1.2. Scalability

Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increased workloads without a decrease in performance. In cloud computing, scalability is achieved by adding more resources, such as virtual servers, storage, and networks, as needed.
