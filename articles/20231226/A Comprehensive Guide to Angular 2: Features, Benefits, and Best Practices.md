Angular 2 is a powerful and flexible web application framework that is widely used for building modern web applications. It is the successor to AngularJS (also known as Angular 1.x), and it brings a host of new features and improvements over its predecessor. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the features, benefits, and best practices of Angular 2. We will also provide detailed code examples and explanations to help you get started with this powerful framework.

## 2.核心概念与联系
### 2.1 Angular 2的核心概念
Angular 2 is built on several core concepts, including components, directives, services, and dependency injection. These concepts are the building blocks of Angular 2 applications, and they provide a powerful and flexible way to build web applications.

- **Components**: Components are the basic building blocks of Angular 2 applications. They are responsible for defining the structure and behavior of a part of the application. Components are created using the @Component decorator, which specifies the template, style, and other metadata for the component.

- **Directives**: Directives are used to define custom HTML tags, attributes, and classes that can be used in the template of a component. Directives can be used to create reusable UI components, apply styles and classes to elements, and manipulate the DOM.

- **Services**: Services are used to define shared logic that can be used across multiple components. Services are created using the @Injectable decorator, and they can be injected into components using dependency injection.

- **Dependency Injection**: Dependency injection is a design pattern that is used to manage the dependencies between components and services. It allows for loose coupling between components and services, making it easier to test and maintain the application.

### 2.2 Angular 2与AngularJS的联系
Angular 2 is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, and it introduces several new features and improvements over its predecessor. Some of the key differences between Angular 2 and AngularJS include:

- **TypeScript**: Angular 2 is built using TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. This allows for better tooling support, type checking, and refactoring capabilities.

- **Components and Directives**: Angular 2 introduces a new component-based architecture, which is more modular and easier to understand than the previous controller-based architecture.

- **Dependency Injection**: Angular 2 introduces a new dependency injection system, which is more powerful and flexible than the previous system in AngularJS.

- **Two-way Data Binding**: Angular 2 introduces a new two-way data binding system, which makes it easier to manage the flow of data between the model and the view.

- **Modules**: Angular 2 introduces a new module system, which allows for better organization and management of the application code.

## 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
### 3.1 TypeScript基础
TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. TypeScript is used as the primary language for building Angular 2 applications.

#### 3.1.1 TypeScript类型
TypeScript supports several built-in types, including number, string, boolean, array, tuple, and enum. It also supports custom types, which can be defined using interfaces and type aliases.

#### 3.1.2 TypeScript接口
Interfaces are used to define the shape of an object, including its properties and methods. Interfaces can be used to enforce type safety in TypeScript applications.

#### 3.1.3 TypeScript类
Classes are used to define custom types in TypeScript. Classes can have properties, methods, and constructors, and they can inherit from other classes.

### 3.2 Angular 2组件
Angular 2 components are used to define the structure and behavior of a part of the application. Components are created using the @Component decorator, which specifies the template, style, and other metadata for the component.

#### 3.2.1 Angular 2组件的元数据
The @Component decorator has several properties, including:

- **selector**: The HTML selector that is used to select the component in the template.
- **template**: The HTML template that is used to render the component.
- **style**: The CSS styles that are used to style the component.
- **directives**: The directives that are used in the component's template.
- **providers**: The providers that are used to provide services to the component.

#### 3.2.2 Angular 2组件的生命周期
Components have a lifecycle that consists of several events, including:

- **ngOnChanges**: This event is triggered when the input properties of the component change.
- **ngOnInit**: This event is triggered when the component is initialized.
- **ngDoCheck**: This event is triggered when the component needs to be checked for changes.
- **ngAfterContentChecked**: This event is triggered after the component's content has been checked for changes.
- **ngAfterViewChecked**: This event is triggered after the component's view has been checked for changes.
- **ngAfterViewInit**: This event is triggered when the component's view has been initialized.
- **ngOnDestroy**: This event is triggered when the component is destroyed.

### 3.3 Angular 2服务
Angular 2 services are used to define shared logic that can be used across multiple components. Services are created using the @Injectable decorator, and they can be injected into components using dependency injection.

#### 3.3.1 Angular 2服务的生命周期
Services have a lifecycle that consists of several events, including:

- **ngOnInit**: This event is triggered when the service is initialized.
- **ngOnDestroy**: This event is triggered when the service is destroyed.

#### 3.3.2 Angular 2服务的依赖注入
Dependency injection is a design pattern that is used to manage the dependencies between components and services. In Angular 2, services are injected into components using the @Injectable decorator and the @Component decorator's providers property.

### 3.4 Angular 2模块
Angular 2 modules are used to organize and manage the application code. Modules can import other modules, declare components, directives, and services, and provide services to the application.

#### 3.4.1 Angular 2模块的元数据
The @NgModule decorator has several properties, including:

- **imports**: The modules that are imported by the current module.
- **declarations**: The components, directives, and pipes that are declared by the current module.
- **providers**: The providers that are provided by the current module.
- **bootstrap**: The components that are used to bootstrap the application.

#### 3.4.2 Angular 2模块的加载顺序
Modules are loaded in the order in which they are imported. The components, directives, and services that are declared in a module are available to all of the modules that import it.
