## 3. Core Algorithms and Mathematical Models

### 3.1 Supervised Learning Algorithms

#### 3.1.1 Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous output value.

#### 3.1.2 Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where the output is either 0 or 1. It extends linear regression by using the logistic function to model the probability of the output classes.

#### 3.1.3 Support Vector Machines

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs aim to find the optimal hyperplane that separates data points from different classes with the maximum margin.

### 3.2 Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

#### 3.2.1 K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into k distinct, non-overlapping clusters. It iteratively assigns data points to clusters based on their similarity to cluster centroids.

#### 3.2.2 Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters by recursively merging or splitting smaller clusters. It results in a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, which represents the nested relationships between clusters.

### 3.3 Deep Learning Architectures

#### 3.3.1 Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning architecture designed to process grid-like data, such as images. CNNs consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which automatically extract features and classify images.

#### 3.3.2 Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of deep learning architecture designed to handle sequential data, such as time series or natural language. RNNs maintain a hidden state across time steps, allowing them to capture temporal dependencies and contextual information.

#### 3.3.3 Transformer Networks

Transformer networks are a type of deep learning architecture used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization. They rely on self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of input tokens relative to each other, allowing for efficient parallel computation and long-range dependencies.

Object detection and tracking are critical components of autonomous vehicle systems. Techniques like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), and DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) are commonly used to detect and track objects in real-time video streams.

#### 4.1.2 Motion Planning and Control

Motion planning and control involve generating safe and efficient trajectories for autonomous vehicles based on their surroundings and driving objectives. Techniques like Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) are used to ensure smooth and collision-free navigation.

### 4.2 Intelligent Traffic Management

Intelligent traffic management systems use AI to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance safety. These systems can include adaptive signal control, incident detection, and dynamic routing.
