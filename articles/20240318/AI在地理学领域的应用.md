## Core Algorithms and Mathematical Models

### Machine Learning Overview <a name="mloverview"></a>

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn patterns in data without explicit programming. ML includes various techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning.

### Supervised Learning <a name="supervised"></a>

Supervised learning involves training an algorithm on labeled data, where each input corresponds to a known output. The goal is to learn a mapping function between inputs and outputs, which can then be used to predict new outputs given new inputs. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests.

### Unsupervised Learning <a name="unsupervised"></a>

Unsupervised learning involves training an algorithm on unlabeled data, where only inputs are provided without corresponding outputs. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data, such as clusters, dimensions, or anomalies. Common unsupervised learning algorithms include k-means clustering, principal component analysis, and autoencoders.

### Deep Learning <a name="deeplearning"></a>

## Best Practices: Code Examples and Explanations

### Clustering Neighborhoods with K-Means <a name="kmeans"></a>

K-means clustering is a simple yet effective unsupervised learning algorithm for grouping similar data points. In this example, we will use k-means to cluster neighborhoods based on their median household income and population density.
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import folium

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('neighborhoods.csv')

# Preprocess data
X = df[['income', 'density']].values

# Train k-means model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Add cluster labels to data
df['cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

# Visualize results using folium
m = folium.Map()
for i, row in df.iterrows():
   folium.CircleMarker(location=(row['latitude'], row['longitude']),
                      radius=5,
                      color='red',
                      fill_color='red').add_to(m)
m
```
This code first loads a dataset of neighborhoods with their median household income and population density. It then preprocesses the data by extracting the relevant features and normalizing them. Afterward, it trains a k-means model with three clusters and adds the cluster labels to the original dataframe. Finally, it visualizes the results using the folium library, showing the location of each neighborhood colored according to its cluster.

### Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression <a name="linearreg"></a>

Linear regression is a simple supervised learning algorithm for predicting continuous outcomes based on one or more input features. In this example, we will use linear regression to predict house prices based on their square footage and number of bedrooms.
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('houses.csv')

# Preprocess data
X = df[['square_footage', 'bedrooms']].values
y = df['price'].values

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train linear regression model
lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model performance
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print('MSE:', mse)

# Use model to make predictions
new_house = [[1500, 3]]
price = lr.predict(new_house)
print('Price:', price[0])
```
This code first loads a dataset of houses with their square footage, number of bedrooms, and prices. It then preprocesses the data by extracting the relevant features and splitting them into training and testing sets. Afterward, it trains a linear regression model on the training set and evaluates its performance on the testing set using mean squared error. Finally, it uses the trained model to make predictions on a new house with given square footage and number of bedrooms.

### Image Segmentation with U-Net <a name="unet"></a>

U-Net is a popular deep learning architecture for image segmentation, which involves classifying each pixel in an image into different categories. In this example, we will use U-Net to segment buildings from satellite imagery.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, concatenate, UpSampling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Define input shape and channels
input_shape = (256, 256, 3)

# Define U-Net architecture
inputs = Input(input_shape)
conv1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(inputs)
pool1 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv1)
drop1 = Dropout(0.5)(pool1)

conv2 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(drop1)
pool2 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv2)
drop2 = Dropout(0.5)(pool2)

conv3 = Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(drop2)
pool3 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv3)
drop3 = Dropout(0.5)(pool3)

conv4 = Conv2D(512, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(drop3)
pool4 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv4)
drop4 = Dropout(0.5)(pool4)

up5 = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(drop4)
merge5 = concatenate([conv3, up5], axis=3)
conv5 = Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(merge5)

up6 = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(conv5)
merge6 = concatenate([conv2, up6], axis=3)
conv6 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(merge6)

up7 = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(conv6)
merge7 = concatenate([conv1, up7], axis=3)
conv7 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(merge7)

outputs = Conv2D(1, (1, 1), activation='sigmoid')(conv7)

# Compile U-Net model
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load data and train model
train_ds = ...
val_ds = ...
model.fit(train_ds, validation_data=val_ds, epochs=50)

# Use model to segment new images
image = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
image = tf.image.resize(image, input_shape[:2]) / 255.0
segmentation = model.predict(tf.expand_dims(image, 0))
segmentation = tf.squeeze(segmentation, axis=0)
```
This code defines the U-Net architecture, compiles it with binary cross entropy loss and accuracy metric, and trains it on a dataset of labeled satellite images. It also shows how to use the trained model to segment a new image by preprocessing it, feeding it through the model, and postprocessing the output.
