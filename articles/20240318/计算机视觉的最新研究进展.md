## 1. Background Introduction

### 1.1 Definition of Computer Vision

Computer vision (CV) is a field of study that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, in much the same way that humans do through their eyes. By automating this process, machines can analyze images and videos to extract useful information, recognize objects, people, and scenes, and even make decisions based on what they "see."

### 1.2 Historical Overview

CV has its roots in fields such as image processing, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence, with early research dating back to the 1960s. Over the years, advances in hardware, algorithms, and deep learning have significantly improved the performance and applicability of CV systems, making them an integral part of various industries, including robotics, healthcare, entertainment, and security.

### 1.3 Importance and Impact

CV has the potential to revolutionize numerous aspects of modern life by enabling machines to perceive and interact with the visual world more effectively. This technology has already shown promising results in applications ranging from autonomous vehicles and robotic surgery to facial recognition and augmented reality. As CV continues to advance, it will likely play an increasingly important role in shaping our future.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

### 2.1 Digital Image Processing

Digital image processing involves manipulating digital images using mathematical operations to improve quality, extract features, or prepare for further analysis. Key concepts include image filtering, edge detection, feature extraction, and morphological transformations.

### 2.2 Object Detection and Recognition

Object detection aims to identify and locate objects within an image or video sequence. It typically involves detecting bounding boxes around objects and classifying them into predefined categories. Object recognition goes one step further, identifying specific instances of objects, such as differentiating between individual cars or faces.

### 2.3 Scene Understanding

Scene understanding refers to the ability of a system to comprehend the layout and semantic content of a scene, including objects, their relationships, and the overall context. This capability enables higher-level tasks, such as activity recognition, event prediction, and decision-making.

### 2.4 Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that employs artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex representations of data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer architectures are popular choices for CV tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical features, model temporal dependencies, and handle sequential data.

## 3. Core Algorithms and Mathematical Models

### 3.1 Image Filtering and Enhancement

Image filtering involves applying mathematical functions, called kernels, to digital images to enhance or suppress certain features. Common filters include Gaussian blur, median filter, and sharpening filters. These filters can be used to reduce noise, smooth surfaces, or emphasize edges.

#### 3.1.1 Mathematical Model: Convolution Operation

The convolution operation, denoted as $\otimes$, combines a kernel $K$ and an input image $I$ to produce a filtered output image $O$:

$$O = K \otimes I$$

### 3.2 Edge Detection and Feature Extraction

Edge detection is the process of identifying points in an image where there is a rapid change in intensity. Popular edge detection methods include the Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny operators. Feature extraction involves identifying distinctive patterns or regions within an image, which can then be used for object detection, recognition, or classification.

#### 3.2.1 Mathematical Model: Canny Edge Detector

The Canny edge detector consists of five main steps:

1. Noise reduction using a Gaussian filter
2. Gradient calculation using the Sobel operator
3. Non-maximum suppression
4. Double thresholding
5. Edge tracing

### 3.3 Object Detection: You Only Look Once (YOLO)

YOLO is a real-time object detection algorithm that treats object detection as a single regression problem, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously. It divides the input image into a grid, where each cell is responsible for detecting objects within its boundaries.

#### 3.3.1 Mathematical Model: YOLO Loss Function

The YOLO loss function consists of three components:

1. Bounding box coordinate error
2. Classification error
3. Objectness error

$$L_{YOLO} = \sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\sum_{j=0}^B\lambda_{coord} [(x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2 + (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2] + \lambda_{noobj}\sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\sum_{j=0}^B[C_i log(\hat{C}_i) + (1-C_i)log(1-\hat{C}_i)] + \sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\sum_{j=0}^B\lambda_{class}[p_i log(\hat{p}_{ij}) + (1-p_i)log(1-\hat{p}_{ij})]$$

where $x_i$ and $y_i$ represent the center coordinates of the ground truth bounding box, $\hat{x}_i$ and $\hat{y}_i$ denote the predicted coordinates, $C_i$ is the ground truth objectness score, $\hat{C}_i$ is the predicted objectness score, $p_{ij}$ represents the ground truth class probability, and $\hat{p}_{ij}$ denotes the predicted class probability.

### 3.4 Object Recognition: ResNet

ResNet (Residual Network) is a deep residual learning framework that facilitates training very deep neural networks by introducing skip connections, allowing gradient information to flow more easily through the network.

#### 3.4.1 Mathematical Model: ResNet Architecture

A typical ResNet architecture includes several "residual blocks" consisting of multiple convolutional layers and activation functions, followed by batch normalization. Skip connections enable the output of one block to be added to the output of another, forming a deeper network without compromising performance.

### 3.5 Scene Understanding: Scene Graph Generation

Scene graph generation involves parsing a visual scene into a graph structure, where nodes represent objects and edges represent spatial or semantic relationships between them. This approach allows for higher-level understanding of scenes, enabling applications such as question answering and visual reasoning.

#### 3.5.1 Mathematical Model: Scene Graph Representation

A scene graph is represented as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ denotes the set of nodes representing objects and $E$ represents the set of edges denoting relationships between objects. Nodes and edges have associated attributes, such as object categories, spatial locations, and relationship types.
