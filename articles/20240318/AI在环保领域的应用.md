# Preprocess data
X = data.drop(['failure'], axis=1)
y = data['failure']

# Train random forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)
clf.fit(X, y)

# Detect objects in image
height, width, channels = image.shape
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image, 1/255, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
net.setInput(blob)
output_layers = net.getUnconnectedOutLayersNames()
layerOutputs = net.forward(output_layers)
boxes = []
confidences = []
classIDs = []
for output in layerOutputs:
   for detection in output:
       scores = detection[5:]
       classID = np.argmax(scores)
       confidence = scores[classID]
       if confidence > 0.5:
           box = detection[0:4] * np.array([width, height, width, height])
           (centerX, centerY, width, height) = box.astype("int")
           x = int(centerX - (width / 2))
           y = int(centerY - (height / 2))
           boxes.append([x, y, int(width), int(height)])
           confidences.append(float(confidence))
           classIDs.append(classID)

# Count animals
animal_count = len(np.unique(classIDs))
print(f'Number of animals detected: {animal_count}')
```
