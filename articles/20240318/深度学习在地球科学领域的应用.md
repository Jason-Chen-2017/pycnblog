### FAQ

**Q: What is the difference between a neural network and a deep neural network?**

A: A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons. A deep neural network is a neural network with multiple hidden layers, allowing it to learn more complex representations of input data.

**Q: How does backpropagation work in deep learning?**

A: Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks by minimizing a loss function. It involves computing gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias parameter in the network, and then adjusting these parameters in the direction of steepest descent.

**Q: Can deep learning be used for time series forecasting?**

A: Yes, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of deep learning model that can be used for time series forecasting. RNNs process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are variants of RNNs that can learn long-range dependencies and are better suited for time series forecasting tasks.
