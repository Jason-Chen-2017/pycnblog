The field of Data Science has grown immensely over the years with applications ranging from business intelligence, finance, healthcare, social media analysis, and many others. Many job opportunities are available in this fast-growing industry as well as internships for aspiring Data Scientists who can help them transition into a full-time career within their organization or startups looking for talented engineers. 

To find an entry-level position in Data Science or any other technical role, we often face numerous interview questions which test our skills in different areas such as machine learning algorithms, statistical modeling, big data technologies, programming languages, databases, etc. However, it becomes increasingly difficult for individuals without prior experience to pass these interviews on their own due to lack of knowledge and understanding of various concepts related to the specific area they have been asked. Moreover, candidates might not be familiar with all the libraries and tools used in the Data Science projects, making it more challenging for them to communicate their findings effectively during the interview. To address this issue, some companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and LinkedIn have created online coding challenges called LeetCode, HackerRank, and GeeksforGeeks, which provide readymade code templates and platform to practice problem solving skills while helping employees hone their technical skills through hands-on approach. Despite the availability of resources and platforms like these, there still exists a significant barrier for potential employers to assess a candidate's proficiency in Data Science. This article aims at providing insights into how Data Science Interviews work and what steps should be taken to improve your chances of landing an entry-level job offer.

2.Basic Concepts & Terminologies:
Before proceeding further, let’s understand few basic concepts that will come handy during our journey in Data Science world. Here are a list of frequently used terms that you need to know before diving deep into Data Science.

#### Supervised Learning:
Supervised Learning involves training models using labeled datasets where the input variables (features) are known to the model. These inputs along with the output variable (target label) is provided to the algorithm to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs. The supervised learning algorithms typically fall under two categories - Classification and Regression. In classification, the target labels belong to a predefined set of classes (categories), whereas in regression, the target labels take continuous values. Popular supervised learning algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM).

You'll also gain deeper understanding of each concept and its importance in the context of Data Science projects.

3.Core Algorithms and Techniques:

Now that we have covered the basics, let's dive into core algorithms and techniques that are relevant to Data Science jobs. As mentioned earlier, Data Science involves various aspects such as machine learning, statistics, mathematics, programming, databases, and optimization. Let's briefly discuss each topic in detail below:


### 3.1 Statistical Techniques
Statistical techniques play a crucial role in Data Science as they allow us to clean, prepare, and analyze data. Frequentist and Bayesian methods are both widely used in Data Science to ensure proper error control and uncertainty quantification. We mainly focus on describing the math behind frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

3.1.1 Frequentist Approach:

Frequentist statistics is a branch of statistics that emphasizes on counting and hypothesis testing. It assumes that the observed data follows a normal distribution and provides p-values for hypothesis testing. The main steps involved in frequentist methodology are as follows:
1. Define null and alternative hypotheses
2. Collect data
3. Determine the sample size required to obtain desired level of confidence
4. Calculate the standard deviation and mean for the population from which the data was collected
5. Compute the test statistic (Z score or T score) using the formula z = (x - μ)/σ
6. Use the computed Z score value to calculate the critical value from the Standard Normal Distribution Table
7. Compare the calculated Z score value with the critical value to determine the significance of the result and conclude whether the null hypothesis can be rejected or failed to reject the alternate hypothesis. 

P-value tells us the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the actual result if the null hypothesis were true. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (α), then we cannot reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis. Otherwise, we must reject the null hypothesis.

3.1.2 Bayesian Approach:

Bayesian statistics is a probabilistic framework that relies heavily on prior probabilities to update the likelihood of an event occurring. It treats every parameter as a random variable and calculates the posterior probability after observing new evidence. Bayesian inference involves four main steps:
1. Prior Knowledge: We assume certain beliefs about the parameters that we want to study, based on previous experiences and prior assumptions. 
2. Likelihood Function: This function represents the degree of plausibility of observing the data given a particular hypothesis. 
3. Posterior Distribution: This is the updated version of the prior distribution after incorporating the new evidence. 
4. Sampling / Optimization: Once we have a good approximation of the posterior distribution, we can generate samples or optimize parameters using optimization techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation. 

The final step is to select a region of practical equivalence, where the new hypothesis would produce similar results as the old one. For example, if we change our mindset and believe that the new hypothesis is actually true, but we haven't received enough evidence to justify changing our original beliefs, we shouldn't adopt it lightly. 

3.2 Mathematics
Mathematics plays a vital role in Data Science because it provides us with fundamental tools needed to tackle real-world problems. In general, we use mathematical techniques such as linear algebra, calculus, optimization, and probability to develop statistical models, construct predictive models, and evaluate performance metrics. Some common topics include matrix decompositions, distance measures, clustering techniques, and neural network architectures.

3.2.1 Linear Algebra
Linear algebra refers to the branch of mathematics dealing with vector spaces and matrices. It is essential in many machine learning algorithms, especially those involving distances, angles, and projections. Several linear algebra algorithms that are commonly used in Data Science include SVD, PCA, Cholesky Decomposition, Eigendecomposition, and QR Factorization.

3.2.2 Calculus
Calculus is another crucial tool in Data Science that is used to derive equations, integrate functions, and compute gradients. One of the most common calculations in Data Science is calculating the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights of a neural network. Other operations performed in calculus include finding derivatives and integrals.

3.2.3 Probability Theory
Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that studies events and their possible outcomes. It is particularly useful in Data Science as it provides us with ways to describe and reason about uncertainty and risk. We primarily focus on two types of probability distributions - discrete and continuous. Discrete distributions represent countable number of outcomes, while continuous distributions represent infinite number of outcomes. Continuous distributions require integration, while discrete distributions do not.

3.2.4 Optimization
Optimization is a technique that consists of identifying the best solution among a set of possible solutions to a problem. It is widely used in Data Science to find the optimal values of hyperparameters such as learning rate, regularization strength, and feature scaling factor. Various optimization algorithms such as Gradient Descent, Newton's Method, Conjugate Gradient, and Quasi-Newton are commonly used in Data Science.

3.3 Programming Languages and Libraries
Programming languages and libraries are essential parts of any Data Science project. They provide us with tools for writing efficient and maintainable code. Popular programming languages include R, Python, Java, Scala, Julia, C++, and MATLAB. Most common libraries include NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, and PyTorch. Some common functionalities offered by each library include data manipulation, visualization, preprocessing, modeling, and postprocessing.

3.4 Database Management Systems
Database management systems play a critical role in managing large datasets. They enable organizing, storing, retrieving, and manipulating data efficiently. Different DBMS products include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, MariaDB, and Microsoft SQL Server. Some common database operations include schema creation, indexing, querying, and updating data.

3.5 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses computer science to analyze, interpret, and manipulate human language. It involves converting textual data into numerical formats that can be processed by computers. NLP tools are used in Data Science to automate tasks such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and document classification. Some common NLP techniques include stemming, lemmatization, bag-of-words representation, and word embeddings.

3.6 Computer Vision
Computer vision is a technique that leverages digital image processing techniques to identify and locate objects, faces, and scenes. It is widely applied in mobile devices, security systems, self-driving cars, and biometric systems. OpenCV, Dlib, and Tensorflow are some popular computer vision libraries in Data Science. Some common computer vision tasks include object detection, image segmentation, and face recognition.

3.7 Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is an area of machine learning inspired by behavioral psychology and animal learning. It involves training an agent to maximize a reward signal. Applications include robotics, gaming, and trading. We focus on two subfields of reinforcement learning - Model-based RL and Model-free RL. 

3.7.1 Model-based RL
Model-based RL builds a probabilistic model of the environment and updates it whenever the agent interacts with it. The model captures the current state of the system, including the dynamics, constraints, and rewards. The learned model is then used to plan ahead and choose actions accordingly. A popular model-based RL algorithm is POMDPs, which involves representing the environment as a Markov decision process. 

3.7.2 Model-free RL
Model-free RL does not rely on a model of the environment and instead explores the space of possible actions directly. Instead of trying to build a perfect model, it uses trial and error to learn from the experience it receives. A popular model-free RL algorithm is Q-learning, which involves maintaining a table of action-state pairs and updating them iteratively. Another famous model-free RL algorithm is Deep Q-Learning, which applies deep learning techniques to train an agent to solve complex environments. 


### 3.4 Distributed Computing Frameworks
Distributed computing frameworks allow us to scale computationally intensive tasks across multiple nodes. They are used extensively in Data Science due to their scalability and fault tolerance capabilities. Popular distributed computing frameworks include Hadoop, Spark, and Storm. Some common distributed computing tasks include file sharing, resource scheduling, and workload partitioning.

3.5 Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis involves extracting valuable insights from time-dependent data. It is widely used in industries such as finance, economics, energy, telecommunications, and healthcare. One common type of time series analysis is forecasting, where we attempt to predict future trends based on past patterns. We use several techniques such as moving average, autoregressive integrated moving average, and support vector regressions to accomplish this task.

3.6 MapReduce and Streaming
MapReduce and streaming are two popular distributed computing paradigms used in Data Science. Both of them are suitable for handling large datasets that cannot fit into memory. MapReduce operates on key-value pairs and applies computations over partitions. Streaming considers the stream of incoming data as a sequence of events and processes it incrementally.

3.7 Scalability and Fault Tolerance
Scalability and fault tolerance are central features of distributed computing frameworks used in Data Science. When we run a computation across multiple nodes, we need to ensure that the overall system remains responsive and reliable even under heavy loads. This requires robust communication protocols, automatic recovery mechanisms, and transparent load balancing strategies.

3.8 Big Data Technologies
Big Data technologies are used in Data Science to handle petabytes of data. We use various technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases to store, process, and analyze the data. Some popular big data technologies include Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Apache Hive, Apache Phoenix, Apache Drill, Apache Impala, Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, and Apache Solr.
