Debugging is an important skill for any developer who works with programming languages like C++, Java or Python. In this article we will learn the nine different ways of debugging programs in C++. These techniques can help you identify and fix errors effectively and efficiently. 


# 2.Debugging Techniques Overview
There are various types of debugging techniques available for C++ programmers:

1. Print Statements: The simplest form of debugging technique involves adding print statements at specific points of code where you want to see what values are being assigned and used by the program during runtime. This can be a time-consuming process as it requires recompiling the program multiple times while running it under debugger to find the issue. However, it can save a lot of time if you have already identified the area(s) of the program that needs more attention.


2. Logging Information: If your application generates a large amount of data which might be useful in debugging the program, enabling logging capabilities within the application itself would greatly simplify the task of identifying the source of the problem. You could use libraries such as log4cxx, boost::log or spdlog for this purpose. 


3. Breakpoints: Using breakpoints at certain areas of the code can allow you to step through the execution of the program one line at a time and examine its state at each point. This helps you understand how the program behaves when executed differently from its expected behavior. You should also set conditions on these breakpoints to control exactly when they trigger so that you don't end up executing code you don't need to debug.


4. Exception Handling: While error checking is essential for writing secure and robust software applications, sometimes bugs slip through due to unforeseen scenarios. By using exception handling mechanisms, you can catch exceptions thrown by your program at run time and take appropriate action instead of crashing. This way, you can isolate the cause of the bug and focus on fixing the root cause instead of chasing down all possible sources of the problem.


5. Unit Testing: Writing unit tests can help ensure that individual components of your program work correctly without affecting other parts. This makes it easier to detect problems early and prevent them from reaching production. Once you've established that a particular module is working correctly, you can add integration testing to check the interaction between different modules. 


6. Code Coverage Analysis: Keeping track of what percentage of your code is actually executed during automated testing can provide valuable insights into the degree of test coverage in your project. A high level view of the areas of your code that are being tested can help reveal potential gaps in testing and highlight areas that may need additional testing effort. 


7. Memory Leaks Detection: Because memory management is an aspect of every modern programming language, it's crucial to carefully manage resources in order to avoid memory leaks. Tools such as Valgrind, Intel Inspector and Memcheck can help identify memory issues such as heap overflow, use after free or lost allocations. 


8. Program Instrumentation: Some compilers offer built-in tools for profiling and analyzing the performance of your program. With such tools, you can analyze which functions are taking the most time to execute, identify hotspots in the code and locate bottlenecks in the system architecture. 


9. GDB Debugger: GNU GDB (GNU Project Debugger) is one of the leading open source debugging tools available for Linux, Windows and Mac operating systems. It allows you to inspect variables and trace program execution in real-time, making it an effective tool for finding and fixing bugs in your code. 

In summary, there are several debugging techniques available for C++ developers, but choosing the right ones depends on the complexity and size of the codebase being debugged, the type of errors encountered, and the ability to quickly iterate on fixes. When faced with a complex and interrelated codebase, it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the problem; however, following best practices for debugging and optimizing code can significantly reduce the time spent tracking down and fixing bugs.
