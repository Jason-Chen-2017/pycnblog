# 1.简介
  

Topic Modeling is a type of statistical machine learning technique used to identify the topics present in a set of documents or text data. In this article we will learn about two popular topic modeling techniques i.e., LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization(NMF). We will also implement these algorithms using python libraries such as scikit-learn, gensim and nltk for better understanding. After that, we will discuss how to evaluate our models and select the optimal number of topics for further analysis. Finally, we will apply this technique on some real world datasets like Amazon Reviews, Twitter Sentiment Analysis and news articles to explore its applications. Let’s get started!

# 2.相关术语定义
- Documents: A document could be any unit of text consisting of words, sentences or paragraphs.
- Corpus: A corpus refers to a collection of documents and is typically used as input for topic modeling algorithms. It can contain various types of texts such as news articles, blog posts, social media posts etc.
- Vocabulary: The vocabulary consists of all unique words occurring across all the documents in the corpus.
- Word Frequency: The word frequency refers to the count of occurrences of each word in the entire corpus. This helps us understand which are the most important words in the corpus and what their relative importance is.
- Topics: Topics refer to the groups of words that have similar semantic meaning or represent common themes throughout the corpus. These topics may not always make sense logically but they provide an overview of the overall contents of the corpus.
- Density: Density refers to the extent to which the distribution of words within each topic follows a predefined probability distribution known as the Dirichlet distribution. The higher the density value of a topic, the more representative it is of the underlying probability distribution.
- Coherence Score: The coherence score is another evaluation metric used to measure the quality of the topics generated by the model. It assigns weights to individual terms based on their relevance to the topic and then computes the average similarity between pairs of terms in different topics. Higher values indicate better coherence.


# 3.Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA)
LDA is a commonly used method for topic modelling. It assumes that each document is a mixture of a fixed number of topics and that each topic is a probability distribution over a vocabulary of words.

In LDA, we first choose a fixed number of topics K, which determines the dimensionality of the latent space. Then, we randomly initialize the parameters alpha and beta. Alpha is a K dimensional vector where alpha[i] represents the prior belief that there exists a topic with index i. Beta is a K x V matrix where beta[k][v] represents the prior belied that word v belongs to topic k.

We then iterate through the documents one at a time and perform the following steps:
1. For each document d, assign it to the topic with highest probability (determined by the product of topic probabilities under the current parameter settings).
2. Update the parameters alpha and beta given the new document assignments and observed word counts. Specifically, let Nw = sum_{w \in doc} count(d, w), nw = #(doc containing w) and Nk = sum_k #(doc assigned to k). Then update:
   - alpha = gamma + alpha 
   - beta[:,w] = eta + beta[:,w] + ndw / Nw * beta[:,w] 
   - beta[k,:] = lambda + beta[k,:] + ndmk / Nk * beta[k,:] 

where gamma and eta are hyperparameters controlling the strength of the prior beliefs. Once we have finished iterating through all the documents, the final estimates of alpha and beta give us information about the topic proportions and distributions of words in those topics.

Finally, we can use these estimated values of alpha and beta to estimate the probability of each document belonging to each topic. We can then select the top K words associated with each topic as the basis of our topic vectors. By selecting only the top words, we ensure that our representation is sparse and easier to interpret.

Let's now see how to implement this algorithm using python libraries.

# 4.Implementation Using Scikit-Learn
Scikit-learn provides easy implementation of LDA using the `LatentDirichletAllocation` class from the `sklearn.decomposition` module. We just need to pass the corpus, the desired number of topics, and several other optional arguments if required. Here is an example code snippet:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

# Load dataset
data = fetch_20newsgroups()

# Vectorize data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=1000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(data['data'])

# Fit LDA model
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=10, random_state=0)
doc_topics = lda.fit_transform(X)

print(lda.components_) # topic vectors
print(lda.explained_variance_) # perplexity of the model
```

Here, we loaded the "20 Newsgroup" dataset from the sklearn library and converted them into bag-of-words format using the `CountVectorizer`. We chose the maximum feature size to be 1000 because LDA tends to work better when the number of features is relatively small. Next, we fitted the LDA model with 10 components using the `fit_transform()` function. The resulting `doc_topics` variable contains the predicted topic assignment for each document.

To extract the learned topics, we access the `components_` attribute of the LDA object after fitting it. Each row of this matrix corresponds to a topic and each column corresponds to a term in the vocabulary. We can then use these values to obtain visualizations or insights into the learned topics. 

# 5.Evaluation
Before evaluating the performance of the LDA model, we must define some metrics for measuring the quality of the topics. One such metric is the coherence score, which measures the degree to which the words in each topic cluster together in meaningful ways. There are many methods for computing the coherence score, including c_v, u_mass, c_uci, c_npmi, and others. Here, I will explain how to compute the c_v score using gensim. Other methods require installing additional packages, so I recommend using gensim unless you want to experiment with different approaches.

The coherence score takes into account both the likelihood of a pair of words appearing together in the same topic and the distance between the occurrence of the pair of words in different topics. Intuitively, high coherence scores indicate that the model has correctly identified the natural groupings of related words within and across topics. To calculate the coherence score, we first need to transform the word-topic probabilities computed by the LDA model into a pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix. PMI measures the correlation between two variables by counting the number of times each combination of values occurs. It is calculated as:

pmi(w,z|x) = log2 [ p(w,z,x)/p(w,z)*p(w|x) ]

where w is a word, z is a topic, and x is a document. p(w,z,x) is the joint probability of the word w, the topic z, and the document x. p(w,z) is the marginal probability of the word w and the topic z, and p(w|x) is the conditional probability of the word w given the document x.

Once we have obtained the PMI matrix, we can use the formula provided in Manning et al.'s book "Introduction to Information Retrieval" to compute the coherence score. We start by sorting the PMI values in descending order and grouping them according to their difference in position. If two adjacent words are highly correlated, they should appear in close proximity within the same topic, while farther apart in different topics. Groups of highly correlated words closer than a certain threshold receive greater weight in the calculation of the coherence score.

Using this approach, we can easily compute the coherence score for the topics produced by the LDA model as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from gensim.models import CoherenceModel
from scipy.stats import entropy

def coherence_score(model):
    """Compute the coherence score."""

    dictionary = Dictionary(data["data"])
    corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text.split()) for text in data["data"]]

    cm = CoherenceModel(
        model=model, 
        corpus=corpus, 
        dictionary=dictionary, 
        coherence="c_v", 
    )
    
    return cm.get_coherence()


# Calculate coherence score for LDA model
cv = coherence_score(lda)
print("Coherence Score:", cv)
```

Here, we first transformed the dataset into a gensim compatible format using the `Dictionary` and `doc2bow` functions. We passed this corpus along with the LDA model to the `CoherenceModel`, specifying the choice of coherence metric as c_v (the default option). Finally, we called the `get_coherence()` method to compute the coherence score.

Note that calculating the coherence score requires iterating through the entire corpus once, which may be computationally expensive depending on the size of your dataset. Also, increasing the number of iterations in the coherence model will reduce the variance of the score but increase the computational cost. Therefore, you should try to find an appropriate tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency before applying the model to new unseen data.

Another way to evaluate the performance of the LDA model is to analyze the perplexity of the model. Perplexity measures the effective number of bits needed to encode a sample from the trained model. Lower perplexities indicate better generalizability of the model to out-of-sample data. We can calculate the perplexity of the LDA model as follows:

```python
def perplexity(X, model):
    """Compute the perplexity of the LDA model"""
    
    ll = model.score(X) / len(X)
    perplexity = np.exp(-ll)
    
    return perplexity

# Calculate perplexity of LDA model
pp = perplexity(X, lda)
print("Perplexity:", pp)
```

As expected, the lower the perplexity value, the better the quality of the model. However, note that this metric does not directly capture the interpretability of the topics, so it may still be useful for selecting the best number of topics.

# 6.Application Examples
Now, let's apply our knowledge of LDA to solve some practical problems. Firstly, we will focus on sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie review dataset. Secondly, we will showcase topic modeling on tweets using the twitter API. Thirdly, we will demonstrate how to create interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash and streamlit open-source tools.
