End-to-end learning (E2E) refers to training a single model that can learn multiple tasks with the same architecture and train data. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware loss function for E2E multi-task learning, which incorporates uncertainty estimation from both input features and output predictions into the final objective function. We evaluate our method on two datasets: the MultiNLI dataset and the TREC question answering dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all evaluation metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate how our proposed approach is able to leverage unlabeled or weakly labeled data by considering uncertainties when choosing examples for each task. This leads to significant improvements over previous methods, particularly when there are limited amounts of labeled data available. The experimental results also indicate that our proposed method generalizes well across different architectures and hyperparameter settings. Therefore, it may serve as a useful tool for improving robustness and interpretability of deep neural networks in multi-task scenarios. 

In this paper, we present the first end-to-end framework for multi-task learning with uncertainty-aware loss functions. By leveraging uncertainty estimates during training, our method enables us to effectively handle challenging cases where some tasks have high degrees of uncertainty due to input noise or ambiguous output labels. Furthermore, we propose a novel technique called uncertainty-guided balancing, which dynamically adjusts the relative importance of the losses assigned to individual tasks based on their predicted probabilities of being incorrect. Finally, we provide empirical evidence demonstrating that using our method leads to significant improvements over existing techniques while maintaining good performance on standard benchmarks. 

Overall, our proposed method provides a new way of thinking about multi-task learning by integrating uncertainty into the decision making process and enabling dynamic adaptation to different tasks depending on their severity of misclassification. It opens up a wide range of possibilities for building more effective and interpretable models in real-world applications.

# 2. Background Introduction
Multi-task learning has emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning recently. Within such frameworks, multiple related tasks share the same underlying architecture and shared inputs/outputs. These types of models have been shown to perform better than monolithic models trained solely on one task because they can use interdependent information between them. However, dealing with the complexities associated with multi-task learning remains a challenge as traditional approaches either require specialized designs or large amounts of labeled data which limits its scalability and ability to generalize well to new environments.  

Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have led to breakthroughs in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Despite their success, these DNNs still struggle with handling multi-task learning situations, primarily due to issues like catastrophic forgetting and instability in training. To address these challenges, various methods have been developed to build more sophisticated and adaptive models capable of handling diverse combinations of tasks. One promising approach involves using domain adaptation techniques like transfer learning, where a pre-trained CNN is fine-tuned on a target domain's data to learn specific patterns relevant to the target task. However, despite the effectiveness of transfer learning, it requires extensive supervision and does not necessarily improve accuracy on unseen tasks unless combined with strong regularization techniques.

Another approach involves developing adversarial training strategies, which involve generating synthetic samples with intentionally distorted versions of the original ones to disrupt the coherence of the gradients flowing through the network. While effective at reducing mode collapse and encouraging DNNs to converge towards more stable solutions, adversarial training only focuses on solving a small subset of the overall problem. Moreover, adversarial training is computationally expensive and slows down convergence rate. On the other hand, uncertainty estimates can provide valuable insights into the difficulty of performing accurate classification in certain contexts.

Together, these recent advances motivate the need for a unified solution that combines the strengths of deep neural networks and uncertainty analysis. As a result, several papers have attempted to develop a multi-task learning framework that addresses the challenges faced by traditional multi-task learning algorithms. Among those are MT-LSTM, Task Specified Networks, and Multitask Ridge Regression. All of these methods propose variations of conventional loss functions that take into account both the correctness and confidence of the model’s prediction, but none of them propose any end-to-end optimization strategy. Thus, in this article, we will introduce a novel end-to-end framework for multi-task learning with uncertainty-aware loss functions. 

The key idea behind our approach is to represent the uncertainty of each example in terms of a probability distribution over possible classes rather than a single point estimate. Specifically, we consider the entropy of the class probability distributions generated by each model alongside the correctness label to formulate a composite loss function that balances the contribution of these two factors according to their prior beliefs. During training, we minimize this composite loss function jointly across all models to ensure consistency among their outputs, even if some models make mistakes on rare or ambiguous examples. We further include a term that penalizes the sum of negative log-likelihoods of each model’s predicted distributions, leading to an additional level of uncertainty awareness. The intuition behind this approach is that examples with higher entropy should be treated with greater suspicion by the learner, since they might contain ambiguous, noisy, or wrong signals. This allows the model to focus on less confident regions of the input space, thus ensuring that its decisions are more consistent and reliable. 

To achieve this, we use Monte Carlo dropout, a probabilistic inference algorithm that simulates the effects of randomly dropping out units in a neural network. Dropout can effectively reduce the variance of the gradients estimated during backpropagation, resulting in faster convergence and reduced overfitting. We employ MC-dropout during training to simulate uncertainty by generating multiple instances of each example, allowing us to compute the expected value of the entropies of the corresponding class probability distributions. Next, we define a composite loss function that takes into account the expected entropy values computed from MC-dropout, as well as the correctness label of each example. Specifically, given a set of n models $M_1,\ldots, M_n$, we assign a weight w_i ∈ [0,1] to each model i, where $\sum_{j=1}^n w_j = 1$. Then, the composite loss function becomes:

$$L(\theta)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} L_i(f_{\theta}(x_i), y_i)+w_{KL}\cdot KL[q_\phi||p_\psi],$$

where $x_i$ denotes the input feature vector of sample i, $y_i$ represents the correct label of sample i, $f_{\theta}$ is the forward propagation function of model $i$, $p_\psi$ is the true distribution for sample i, and $q_\phi$ is the predicted distribution produced by model $i$ under MC-dropout. Here, $w_{KL}$ controls the balance between the expected entropy term and the cross-entropy term, which measures the difference between the predicted distribution and the true distribution. Understanding the tradeoff between minimizing expected entropy and maximizing cross-entropy helps us select appropriate values for this parameter. At test time, we simply average the predicted class probabilities computed by all models to obtain the final prediction. 

To avoid mode collapse, we apply a form of adaptive weight adjustment inspired by ridge regression. For a fixed combination of weights $(w_1,\ldots,w_n)$, we optimize the following objective:

$$min_{\theta,w_1,\ldots,w_n} ||Y - \sigma(W\cdot X + b)||^2+\lambda||w||_2.$$

Here, Y is the matrix of observations, W is the weight matrix connecting the input layer to the hidden layer, and X is the matrix of input features. The lambda parameter controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the weights. Although this technique alone cannot completely prevent mode collapse, it usually yields better performance than non-adaptive approaches that directly optimize the entire loss function.

By introducing uncertainty into the decision-making process, our proposed method enables dynamic adaptation to different tasks depending on their severity of misclassification. The relative importance of each task’s loss function is adjusted during training based on the predicted probabilities of error. Specifically, we treat each task independently, using MC-dropout and computing the entropy values for each model. We then use these entropy values to construct a weighted average of the task losses, where the weights depend on the exponentially decaying uncertainty scores. This ensures that we prioritize examples with lower uncertainty scores for which the model’s predictions are most uncertain, thereby improving the overall stability of the model and helping it deal with varying levels of uncertainty encountered in different tasks.

Finally, we implement an uncertainty-guided balancing mechanism that modifies the relative importance of each task based on the uncertainty score assigned to it. We do so by updating the per-example weights assigned to each task after every iteration of gradient descent. Specifically, at iteration t+1, we compute the mean entropy value of the models' predictions for each task, and update the weights accordingly. If a task’s uncertainty score exceeds a predefined threshold, its per-example weight is increased, whereas otherwise it is decreased. This dynamic adjustment allows us to fine-tune the relative importance of each task, taking into consideration the level of uncertainty represented by its model’s predictions. Overall, this approach improves the overall stability and reliability of the learned model, and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets.
