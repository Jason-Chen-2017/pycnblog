# 1.简介
  


Natural language processing (NLP) refers to a branch of artificial intelligence that helps machines understand human language as it is spoken or written. It involves the use of computational linguistics techniques such as natural language understanding, statistical machine learning, information retrieval, speech recognition, and text-to-speech synthesis. 

The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of NLP blogs and articles published on the web by different experts in this field including data scientists, developers, researchers, AI language models, industry experts, and more. The list will be continuously updated based on the new posts and discussions around NLP. We hope it will help you make better decisions when choosing your next NLP tool for your project!

We recommend using Google Scholar to search for related papers, blog posts, and projects in order to find out the most reliable sources for NLP knowledge. You can also visit our blog, Medium, or LinkedIn profile pages for further resources.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology

Before we dive into details, let's first define some basic concepts and terminologies used in NLP:

1. **Corpus**: A corpus is a collection of texts, usually stored in a digital format such as text files, audio files, video files, images, etc., which are processed to extract relevant information from them. Corpora can be divided into two main types depending on their size:

   - Small corpora: These include smaller collections of documents like news articles, tweets, medical records, etc. They are typically small in terms of size but they cover a wide range of topics and contexts.

   - Large corpora: These include large amounts of text data with high quality and relevance. Examples of these include the Penn Treebank Project dataset (over one million words), Common Crawl dataset (over five billion words), Wikipedia dumps, and many others. 

2. **Tokenization**: Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sentence or paragraph into individual tokens, which could be either words or subwords (usually n-grams). Each token represents a meaningful element in the original sentence/paragraph. Some examples of commonly used tokenizer algorithms are whitespace splitting, regular expression matching, and sentence boundary detection.

3. **Stop Word Removal**: Stop word removal is the process of removing common English stop words from the input text, which do not carry much meaning. There are several ways to remove stop words, such as manually selecting specific stop words to exclude or automatically identifying stop words based on their frequency in the corpus.

4. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Stemming and lemmatization are both techniques used to reduce words to their base form, i.e., reducing words to their root forms while retaining important parts of speech. For example, "running", "runner" and "ran" may all be reduced to the stem "run". However, stemming may result in incorrect spellings being removed and losing valuable contextual clues. On the other hand, lemmatization requires dictionary lookups, so it produces less errors but it takes longer time to compute than stemming. Both stemming and lemmatization can improve performance by grouping together multiple words with similar meanings without considering their actual surface forms.

5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Named entity recognition consists of identifying and classifying named entities in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, times, quantities, percentages, currencies, etc. Many tools exist for performing NER tasks, such as Stanford NLP Suite, spaCy, CoreNLP, TextBlob, NLTK, and many more.

6. **Part-of-speech tagging (POS)** and **Dependency Parsing**: Part-of-speech tagging assigns a part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in the input text. Dependency parsing identifies relationships between words and constituents in a sentence and connects words with their heads or modifiers to build a parse tree.

Now that we have defined some basic concepts and terminologies used in NLP, let's move onto the core algorithmic techniques and operations involved in building NLP systems.
