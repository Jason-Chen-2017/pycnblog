Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as dimensionality reduction or factor analysis, is a statistical method used to identify and extract the most important features from large datasets consisting of multiple variables. The basic idea behind PCA is that any set of observed variables can be represented by a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. These components are constructed using linear combinations of the original variables, which maximizes the variance explained by each component. Thus, the resulting dimensions capture most of the information in the dataset without losing too much of it due to noise or redundancy. PCA has many useful applications including:

1. Data preprocessing: PCA can help reduce the amount of data needed for modeling, enabling faster model training and reducing overfitting issues. It may also improve accuracy by removing redundant or irrelevant features that do not contribute significantly to the outcome variable. 

2. Visualization and understanding: By projecting the data onto the new basis defined by the first few principal components, PCA allows us to visualize the structure of the high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions, making it easier to detect patterns and relationships. This helps researchers better understand complex systems and make predictions about their behavior. 

3. Feature selection: PCA can also be used to select a subset of relevant features from a larger collection of variables, based on how they explain the variability in the data. This can greatly simplify the analysis process and enable more efficient machine learning models to be trained. 

In this article, we will explore some fundamental concepts related to PCA and demonstrate how it can be applied to different real-world problems. We will then go through the math involved in implementing PCA step by step and examine several examples of how it can be applied in practice. Finally, we will discuss potential future directions and challenges in applying PCA. 

We assume readers have a solid background in statistics and linear algebra.

## 2.1 Introduction
Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as dimensionality reduction or factor analysis, is a technique used to convert a set of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly independent variables while retaining maximum possible information about the underlying system. In other words, PCA finds the axes that best explain the largest portion of the variation in a multivariate dataset, allowing us to study only those factors that contain significant information. It works by computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a covariance matrix obtained from the centered input data, where each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature. The eigenvectors represent the directions of the new coordinates, while the corresponding eigenvalues measure the importance of each direction. The projection of the input data onto these new directions minimizes the reconstruction error between the original and transformed data sets.

The main steps of PCA include:
* **Data pre-processing**: First, the raw data is cleaned, missing values are removed, and outliers are identified if necessary.
* **Centering the data**: Next, we center the data around the mean value so that the transformation does not affect the relative scale of the variables.
* **Computing the covariances matrix**: Then, we compute the covariance matrix between all pairs of features in the centered data, representing the degree to which each pair is dependent on each other.
* **Eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix**: After obtaining the covariance matrix, we perform an eigendecomposition to obtain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Here, the eigenvectors correspond to the principal components, and the eigenvalues represent the proportion of variance captured by each component.
* **Choosing the number of principal components**: Based on the magnitude of the eigenvalues, we choose the number of principal components that we want to retain.
* **Projecting the data onto the PC space**: Finally, we use the selected principal components to transform the data into a lower-dimensional space where the variance is maximized.

Overall, PCA aims to find the directions of maximum variation in the data by identifying the directions that maximize the likelihood of explaining the data well. While various techniques exist to estimate the principal components and their variances, they generally follow the same general procedure outlined above.

## 2.2 Terminology
### Input data
The input data is a matrix $X$ of size $m\times n$, where $m$ is the number of observations (samples) and $n$ is the number of features (variables). Each row of $X$ corresponds to one observation and each column corresponds to one feature. For example, in our housing price prediction problem, we might have $m=200$ house prices across New York City block groups, with $n=19$ variables such as average age, median income, poverty level, education levels, transportation distance to employment centers, etc.

### Mean vector
The mean vector $\mu$ is simply the mean value of each feature across all samples, calculated as follows:

$$ \mu = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}x_i $$

where $x_i$ refers to the $i$-th sample vector in the input matrix $X$.

### Centered data
After calculating the mean vector, we subtract it from every element in the input data to get the centered data matrix $X_{\text{centered}}$:

$$ X_{\text{centered}} = X - \mu $$

This results in a zero-mean version of the input data, giving more weight to the directions of highest variation.

### Covariance matrix
To calculate the covariance matrix, we first need to normalize the data by dividing each element by the standard deviation of the entire dataset. The normalized data becomes the design matrix $Z$. We can calculate the covariance matrix as follows:

$$ Z = \frac{1}{\sigma}\begin{bmatrix}
  x_1\\
  x_2\\
  \vdots \\
  x_n
\end{bmatrix}, ~~\sigma^2=\frac{1}{mn}\sum_{i=1}^mx_ix_i^T $$

where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the normalized dataset. Now, we take the dot product of each row in $Z$ with itself, creating a symmetric matrix containing the covariances between all pairs of features:

$$ Cov(X_{\text{centered}}) = \frac{1}{m-1}(X_{\text{centered}}\cdot X_{\text{centered}})^T $$

### Eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix
Once we have computed the covariance matrix, we can perform an eigendecomposition to obtain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors correspond to the principal components, and the eigenvalues measure the importance of each component.

First, we create the following diagonal matrix $\Lambda$ containing the eigenvalues:

$$ \Lambda = \begin{bmatrix}
    \lambda_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
    0 & \lambda_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & \cdots & \lambda_n
\end{bmatrix}$$

where $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n$ are the sorted eigenvalues.

Next, we compute the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix as follows:

$$ V = X_{\text{centered}}\cdot X_{\text{centered}}^T $$

where $V$ is the correlation matrix, obtained after normalizing the data and taking the transpose. We obtain the eigenvectors as follows:

$$ V\Lambda^{-1} $$

Finally, we sort the columns of $V\Lambda^{-1}$ in descending order according to the eigenvalues, forming the matrix of eigenvectors:

$$ P = [v_1,\ldots, v_k] $$

where $v_1$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, $v_2$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue, and so on.

### Choosing the number of principal components
While PCA tries to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the variation as possible, we typically don't want to lose too much information during the decomposition process. Therefore, we often choose the number of principal components that we want to keep, based on the magnitude of the eigenvalues. Typically, we keep at least five percent of the total variance, up to the point where adding additional components no longer improves the explained variance ratio. However, in certain cases, we may decide to increase the number of principal components instead.

### Projection onto the PC space
Once we have chosen the number of principal components, we project the centered data onto the PC space using the top k eigenvectors as follows:

$$ Y = XP $$

Here, $Y$ is the transformed matrix containing the original data in the new basis defined by the top k eigenvectors. If we only want to preserve the first few principal components, we drop the remaining columns of $P$ except the first $k$ ones. Otherwise, we can either plot the data in the original or transformed space, depending on our goals.
