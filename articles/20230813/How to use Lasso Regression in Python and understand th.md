Lasso regression is a type of regularization technique that is used for feature selection while training models with large amounts of data. It adds a penalty term which helps to reduce the complexity of the model by forcing some coefficients to zero. The name "lasso" comes from the fact that it was originally developed as a statistical method called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Today, it has become widely used due to its ease of interpretability, better performance on small datasets than ridge regression, and ability to handle multicollinearity problems. In this article, we will learn how to use Lasso regression in Python and understand the basics of Lasso regression. We will also discuss related concepts such as cross-validation and tuning parameters. Let's get started!

Before going into details about Lasso regression, let us quickly review some important terms and concepts:

1. Feature Selection
Feature selection is a process where you select the relevant features or predictors that are most useful for your machine learning problem. This process reduces overfitting and improves accuracy. You can perform various types of feature selection techniques such as Filter Methods, Wrapper Methods, Embedded Methods, and Hybrid Methods. Some popular feature selection methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression. 

2. Cross Validation
Cross validation is a method to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm by training and testing the algorithm on different subsets of the dataset. One common approach is K-fold cross validation, where the dataset is divided into k equal parts, and the algorithm is trained and tested on each part separately. Another approach is Leave-one-out cross validation, where each observation is left out once, and the remaining observations form the test set. Cross validation is essential when evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms because it avoids overfitting and gives an unbiased estimate of the true generalization error.

3. Tuning Parameters
Tuning parameters refers to adjusting the hyperparameters of a machine learning algorithm to improve its performance on a specific task. There are many ways to tune hyperparameters including grid search, randomized search, Bayesian optimization, and hyperband. Grid search involves trying all possible combinations of hyperparameter values, which can be computationally expensive. Randomized search randomly selects a subset of hyperparameter configurations and tests them, which makes it more efficient. Bayesian optimization uses probabilistic models to optimize hyperparameters based on past results, making it faster and more robust than grid search. Hyperband is another adaptive strategy for hyperparameter tuning that gradually eliminates unnecessary evaluations using a predefined resource constraint. 

Now that we have reviewed some fundamental concepts and terminology, let’s move on to learn about Lasso regression in detail.

## 3.1 Introduction
Lasso stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. It is a type of regularization technique that is used for feature selection while training models with large amounts of data. It adds a penalty term which helps to reduce the complexity of the model by forcing some coefficients to zero. As mentioned earlier, "lasso" came from the fact that it was originally developed as a statistical method called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Despite its reputation, today, Lasso is being increasingly used for almost any supervised learning problem involving regression analysis. Its benefits include higher stability compared to Ridge regression, reduced variance in the estimated coefficients, and better control over the selected variables. In this article, we will see how to use Lasso regression in Python and understand the basics of Lasso regression.

## 3.2 Algorithmic Principle
The basic idea behind Lasso regression is simple - instead of just minimizing the mean squared error between predicted and actual values, we add a penalty term proportional to the sum of absolute values of the coefficients. The larger the absolute value of the coefficient, the greater the impact of that variable on the overall fit. To make the solution unique, we need to choose one of two approaches: ordinary least squares (OLS) or l1 regularization. OLS simply computes the best linear approximation of the data without adding any penalty term. However, since there may exist sparse regions in the data, we want to avoid coefficients that are close to zero. On the other hand, Lasso adds a penalty term which encourages sparsity among the coefficients. Therefore, it penalizes large absolute values of the coefficients so that they are smaller in magnitude and help in reducing the computational cost and improving the interpretability of the model. Finally, Lasso applies a thresholding rule after computing the coefficients, eliminating any coefficients below a certain threshold.

Here is the mathematical equation of Lasso regression:

$$\underset{\beta}{\text{argmin}}\left\{ \frac{1}{N}||y-\mathbf{X}\beta||_2^2 + \lambda ||\beta||_1 \right\}$$

where $\beta$ represents the vector of coefficients, $N$ is the number of samples, $y$ is the target variable, $\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix consisting of predictor variables, and $\lambda$ is a user-specified hyperparameter that controls the strength of the regularization effect. 

Note that if we take $\lambda=\infty$, then Lasso regression becomes equivalent to OLS. If we take $\lambda=0$, then we obtain the same solution as OLS but without any regularization effect.

We can simplify the above equation further by replacing the second order norm with the L1 norm, giving rise to:

$$\underset{\beta}{\text{argmin}}\left\{ \frac{1}{N}||y-\mathbf{X}\beta||_2^2 + \lambda ||\|\mathbf{w}\|_{1} \right\}$$

where $\mathbf{w} = [\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p]$ is the weight vector consisting of the individual coefficients, and $\|\cdot\|_{1}$ denotes the L1 norm. Similarly, we can represent Lasso regression as a constrained version of ridge regression:

$$\underset{\beta}{\text{argmin}} \left\{ \frac{1}{N}||y-\mathbf{X}\beta||_2^2 + \lambda ||\beta||_2^2 \right\}$$
subject to $$|\beta_j|<t$$ for all j.

In practice, the choice of whether to minimize $$\|\beta\|_1$$ or $$\|\beta\|_2^2$$ depends on the nature of the data and the desired level of sparsity. If the input features exhibit heavy collinearity, choosing $$\|\beta\|_2^2$$ might be preferred because it forces all coefficients to be nonzero at the cost of introducing bias. Alternatively, if the structure of the data allows for few nonzero coefficients, choosing $$\|\beta\|_1$$ could lead to simpler solutions and faster convergence times.

Finally, note that Lasso regression can be implemented in multiple ways depending on the programming language used. For example, scikit-learn provides a built-in implementation of Lasso regression, whereas statsmodels offers a formula interface for specifying Lasso regression models using R-style notation. Additionally, libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide implementations of Lasso regression as well.
