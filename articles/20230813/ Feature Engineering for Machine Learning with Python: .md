Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying pattern in the data and help improve machine learning models' performance. In this tutorial, we will use a simple example to demonstrate how feature engineering can be applied to improve the accuracy of a binary classification model using logistic regression algorithm.

In supervised learning, a dataset typically contains both input variables (X) and output variables (y), where X represents the predictors/features, and y represents the response variable or target variable. A common practice before training a machine learning model is to preprocess the data by creating new or derived features from existing ones that are likely to have greater impact on the prediction task. This step is known as feature engineering. 

The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the basic principles behind feature engineering and practical implementation steps using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc. The examples used in this article are based on the famous Titanic dataset which is commonly used in introductory machine learning courses. However, other datasets may also work well depending on the complexity and size of the problem being tackled. Also, since the focus is not on any particular algorithm, it should be noted that different algorithms and techniques might require slightly different feature engineering strategies. Finally, the code used in this tutorial does not aim at achieving state-of-the-art results but rather highlights some best practices in applying feature engineering techniques to build accurate machine learning models.


## 1.背景介绍
Binary classification problems refer to those problems where there are only two possible outcomes or classes, either positive or negative. These problems can include medical diagnosis, spam detection, fraud detection, disease prediction, and many more. Classification problems usually involve predicting discrete categories such as "spam", "not spam", "healthy" vs. "sick", etc. 

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where labeled data is available for training the model. The most popular types of supervised learning models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. For each model, its objective function involves calculating the likelihood of observing the true class label given the input features. Therefore, the key challenge in solving these classification problems is to find appropriate features that maximize the likelihood of correctly identifying the target variable (y).

To create good features, one must understand what information they contain and their relationship to the target variable. Often times, the presence of noise or irrelevant features cause overfitting, leading to poor generalization performance. Hence, feature engineering is crucial to improving the overall performance of the models and reducing overfitting issues. Here's a brief summary of the main tasks involved in feature engineering:

1. Data exploration and understanding: One of the first things to do after acquiring the dataset is to explore the data to gain insights about its structure and content. We need to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current set of features, check if there are any missing values or duplicated rows, and try to figure out any patterns in the data distribution.

2. Data cleaning and preprocessing: Once we've identified the initial quality of the data, we then need to clean it up by removing any duplicates, incorrect or incomplete entries, and handling missing values. Typically, we'll also standardize or normalize our numerical columns so that they have similar scales. 

3. Feature selection: Next, we need to select the relevant features that contribute most significantly to our predictions. We can do this through various methods such as correlation analysis, mutual information calculation, recursive feature elimination, etc. 

4. Feature transformation: After selecting the important features, we can transform them into a more meaningful representation using various techniques such as binning, scaling, normalization, PCA, etc. Transformations like logarithmic transformations and polynomial features play a crucial role in non-linearly separable data, while other techniques like k-means clustering or gaussian mixtures could help us handle categorical features. 

5. Balancing the data: To avoid imbalance in our training data, we often perform a balancing operation such as oversampling minority class instances or undersampling majority class instances. 

6. Handling imbalanced data: If our dataset has significant imbalance, we can apply various resampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) or Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) to balance the dataset.  

In conclusion, feature engineering is an essential step in building effective machine learning models and managing complex high-dimensional data sets. By following sound principles and best practices, we can achieve improved accuracy, reduced overfitting, and optimized computational efficiency by effectively preparing the data for modeling.
