# 1.简介
  

Google Cloud Platform offers a wide range of services including compute engine, container engine, cloud storage, machine learning APIs like AutoML, and more. It provides a flexible and scalable way to run your ML models at scale. In this article, we will discuss how you can train and deploy your machine learning model using Docker containers in the GCP environment. We will also look into different ways of deploying these models as AI platform endpoints or TensorFlow serving models.

To start with, let's understand what is a docker container? What are its benefits over virtual machines (VMs)? Also, we need to know about Dockerfile which is used to create a new image for our docker container. 

Then, we'll dive deep into training our machine learning models. How do we use Tensorflow Estimator API for building our machine learning models? And finally, we'll see how we can deploy these trained models as AI platform endpoints or TensorFlow Serving models using GCP's command line interface and RESTful APIs respectively. 

Let's get started by understanding basic concepts and terms related to Docker containers before moving forward further.
# 2.Concepts and Terms
## Docker Container
A Docker container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so that it can be easily deployed and executed across platforms. Docker containers are lightweight and portable, meaning they can be created, started, stopped and moved from one computing environment to another without any issues due to differences in operating systems, hardware configurations, etc. This makes them ideal candidates for microservices-based applications, IoT projects, data analysis, and more. They offer several advantages compared to VMs:

1. Environmental consistency: Docker containers share the same underlying kernel and libraries as the host system, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of where they are running. 

2. Isolation and security: Each Docker container runs within its own isolated process, making it easy to securely run complex applications while still achieving isolation between processes. 

3. Resource allocation: Because each Docker container has exclusive access to system resources such as CPU, memory, and network interfaces, they are highly efficient even when managing large numbers of small tasks. 

4. Portability: Docker containers can be copied and shared easily, enabling developers to build, test, and deploy their apps anywhere, on any platform, with minimal setup overhead. 

5. Scalability: Docker containers can be scaled horizontally by adding additional instances, providing elasticity and fault tolerance capabilities for distributed environments.

## Virtual Machines (VMs) vs Docker Containers
Despite having similarities, Docker containers and VMs have some key differences worth noticing:

1. VM hypervisor: A Hypervisor is responsible for allocating physical resources to virtual machines. It allows multiple guest operating systems to run concurrently on a single server, sharing the same hardware resources. However, each guest OS runs inside an independent Virtual Machine instance. On the other hand, Docker uses a low-level containerization technology called Linux Containers, which does not require a separate virtual machine manager.

2. Image size: The size of a Docker image is generally smaller than the equivalent size of a VM image because it only contains the application binaries and necessary configuration files, instead of entire operating systems and development tools.

3. Build times: Building Docker images typically takes less time than creating identical VMs since there is no need to install the full OS and develop tools every time. Additionally, containers can be quickly spun up on any computer with Docker installed, whereas VMs usually require specialized tooling to be built and maintained.

4. Security: Since containers share the same kernel as the host system, they inherit most of the host’s security measures, reducing risk of vulnerabilities and attacks. However, containers may still be susceptible to certain exploits that compromise the host system, especially if unpatched updates are not applied regularly.

## Dockerfile
Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image(s), commands to execute during the build process, any required environment variables, and ports to expose. Here's an example Dockerfile:

```
FROM python:latest
COPY. /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD [ "python", "./main.py" ]
```

This Dockerfile starts with Python latest version and copies the contents of the current directory to `/app` folder in the Docker image. Next, it sets the working directory to `/app`. Finally, it installs the required Python modules specified in `requirements.txt`, and launches the app using `main.py` script whenever a new instance of the container is launched. 

Note that the above Dockerfile assumes that the project structure follows a standardized convention, with the main entry point being defined in the `./main.py` file. If the conventions differ, then modifications might be needed to make sure that the container runs correctly.
