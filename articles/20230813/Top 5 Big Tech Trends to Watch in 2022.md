及背景介绍
Big data has been around for a long time, but it's only recently that we have become aware of its potential and the importance of building an effective infrastructure to support it. As more organizations continue to adopt big data technologies, companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft are poised to accelerate their growth with significant new initiatives.

In this article, we will discuss five of these trends:
1. AI/ML - Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML), which has been widely recognized as a crucial player in technology development over the past decade. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving revolutionary changes in businesses and industries like healthcare, finance, transportation, and retail.

2. Edge computing - This refers to the ability of hardware devices like IoT gateways or edge servers to act as computational power centers by processing large volumes of data quickly, effectively, and reliably. With increased computing capabilities on the edge, network traffic can be analyzed in real-time, enabling valuable insights into user behavior and use patterns.

3. 5G networks - This refers to the next generation wireless networking technology that aims to improve connectivity and provide unprecedented levels of speed and capacity. At this point, various services, applications, and devices will begin using 5G networks to enhance mobility, security, and performance.

4. Virtual Reality (VR)/ Augmented Reality (AR) - These technologies offer immersive visual experiences that involve users being able to interact with digital objects and environments. VR and AR help people feel connected to the physical world while experiencing virtual content.

5. Blockchain - A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that uses cryptography to record transactions across multiple nodes in a network without any central authority. It enables fast, secure transaction processing among users, merchants, financial institutions, governments, and other interested parties.

## 2.1. AI/ML
Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Computer Science that involves computers utilizing algorithms to imitate human decision making. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 

Supervised learning involves training models based on labeled data where the model learns from examples provided. Unsupervised learning involves identifying hidden patterns within unlabelled data. In reinforcement learning, an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback. Examples include AlphaGo, self-driving cars, and game playing agents. 

## 2.2. Edge Computing
Edge computing is a technique used to deliver computing resources closer to the end-users than traditional cloud computing solutions. It involves local processing of data that requires quick response times and low latency. The architecture includes one or more edge servers that handle incoming requests from clients. 

The benefits of edge computing include faster access to data, reduced bandwidth consumption, improved responsiveness, and enhanced privacy and security. Popular IoT protocols include LoRa, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Zigbee, Thread, WiFi Direct, and Wi-Fi 6.

## 2.3. 5G Networks
Next-generation wireless networking technology (5G NWT) is expected to pave the way for widespread use of internet-connected devices, enabling ultra-fast connections at high speeds. It provides unparalleled security and reliability compared to previous generations, including encryption, advanced radio techniques, and advanced satellite communications systems. 

5G can enable better connectivity between all types of users, from consumers to enterprises and government agencies. Various services, applications, and devices will start to use 5G networks to enhance mobility, security, and performance.

## 2.4. Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR) 
Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) both use computer graphics software and video feeds to create immersive virtual environments. Both allow users to experience virtual content that is often enhanced by sound or haptic feedback.

With advances in rendering techniques and processors, VR and AR are becoming increasingly accessible to everyone. For example, several companies are developing software tools that leverage this technology for entertainment and medical purposes. Some researchers are exploring ways to make VR even more interactive through interfaces that integrate spatial cognition.

## 2.5. Blockchain
A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple nodes in a peer-to-peer network without a central authority. Each node maintains a copy of the ledger, ensuring that there are no tampering or interceptions. The mechanism relies on cryptographic hashing functions to generate unique identifiers called "blocks" and keeps track of them sequentially using blockchains. Transactions made on the network are verified by nodes who check the validity of each transaction before adding it to the chain.

Blockchain technology offers several benefits, including lower transaction fees, enhanced security, and openness. Large players like Visa and Mastercard have already started experimenting with blockchain technology, but many other organizations and individuals are working towards adopting it.
