近年来，深度学习在图像、语音、文本、视频等领域取得了惊人的成就，对于许多企业而言，拥有高性能计算能力的同时，也希望能够运用机器学习的技术来解决实际的问题。然而，真正用于生产环境中的深度学习模型往往具有巨大的参数量，这使得它们很难应用于任务繁重的实际场景中。因此，需要考虑如何有效地减少训练模型所需的时间和资源消耗。最近几年里，基于迁移学习的模型发展成为主流。它可以将部分预训练好的模型的参数转移到目标任务上，从而加快训练速度并降低内存占用，同时提升准确率。本文将主要介绍基于迁移学习的深度学习模型在大数据集上的工作机制。

# 2.基本概念术语说明

2.1 Transfer Learning: transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model is used as the starting point of another task with smaller dataset to significantly reduce the training time and computational resources needed. It can be divided into two categories, fine-tuning and feature extraction. In fine-tuning, the parameters in the pre-trained model are updated based on the new data, whereas in feature extraction, only the output layer(s) from the pre-trained model are retained while the weights of other layers are fixed or randomly initialized. 

2.2 Pre-Trained Model: A pre-trained model refers to a type of neural network that has been trained on a large corpus of data, such as ImageNet (ILSVRC), GloVe, etc., which contains more than one million images, hundreds of thousands of text documents, millions of videos, and so on. The goal of these pre-trained models is to provide us with good initial values for our own tasks, thus reducing the amount of work required to train our models. Commonly, we use pre-trained models as the foundation for building complex neural networks by stacking multiple fully connected layers on top of them. Therefore, it’s easy to fine-tune their parameters for our specific application.

2.3 Dataset Size: The size of the dataset determines how many iterations need to be performed during training, which also affects the memory usage and the speed of training. To achieve good performance, we typically want to have at least several thousand examples per class in our labeled dataset. However, if the size of our dataset is too small, there may not be enough data available to effectively learn the underlying patterns, leading to suboptimal results. On the contrary, if the size of our dataset is too big, we risk losing valuable information due to overfitting, making our models less generalizable.

2.4 Fine-Tuning vs Feature Extraction: Fine-tuning involves updating all the parameters in the model except those belonging to the output layer(s). This allows us to adapt the pre-trained model to our own problem domain by tuning its hyperparameters. For instance, we might adjust the number of neurons in each hidden layer to match our needs or change the activation function. Feature extraction focuses solely on retaining the output layer(s) and freezing all other layers. We then add a few additional fully connected layers to our model using the learned features as input. 

Overall, both methods aim to save time and resources by leveraging knowledge gained from extensive training on larger datasets. However, fine-tuning tends to result in better accuracy compared to feature extraction, especially when dealing with highly imbalanced datasets.

# 3.Core Algorithm and Operation Steps

Here are the basic steps for transfer learning using TensorFlow:

1. Load the pre-trained model and freeze its parameters.

2. Add custom layers on top of the frozen layers to create a new classifier.

3. Train the newly added classifier on your target dataset using cross-entropy loss and an optimizer such as Adam.

4. Freeze the base layers again and retrain some of the last layers on your original dataset.

5. Repeat step 4 until convergence.

We will now go through the core algorithmic details in detail.

Algorithm Details:

1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the pre-trained image net dataset. These values are usually stored in the file called "imagenet_mean.npy" and "imagenet_std.npy". These values should be subtracted from each pixel value of every image before passing it to the neural network.

2. Resize all the images to a consistent size and normalize them using the mean and std calculated earlier.

3. Split the dataset into three parts - Training Set, Validation Set and Test Set.

4. Define the architecture of the network you wish to build. Use the tf.keras API provided by TensorFlow to define the neural network. You can either load a pre-defined network like VGG16 or ResNet or start with scratch and customize it according to your requirements. Make sure to include the necessary input shape for the images (in this case, the resized image dimensions).

5. Initialize the weights of the first layer with random values obtained from the normal distribution.

6. Compile the model by defining an appropriate loss function and optimizer. Since we are working on a classification task, we will use categorical cross entropy as our loss function. An optimizer such as Adam is commonly used.

7. Train the model on the training set using batch size of 64, epochs of around 10-20 and monitor validation loss. When the validation loss stops decreasing, stop training.

8. Once the model is trained, evaluate it on the test set to see how well it performs on unseen data.

9. Freeze the layers of the pre-trained model by setting their trainable parameter to False. This prevents any updates to the weights of these layers during training.

10. Retrain certain layers of the model on the original training set. During training, only update the weights of the final layers of the model.

11. Continue this process iteratively until convergence. Alternatively, try different architectures or hyperparameter configurations until satisfactory results are achieved.
