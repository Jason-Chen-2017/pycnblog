# 2.Basic concepts and terminology 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a subset of computer science concerned with creating machines that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence or expertise. There are several main categories of AI algorithms which include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Reinforcement Learning. Below we will briefly discuss these basic terms and give examples of each category: 

1- Machine Learning: A type of AI algorithm where computers learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves training the computer on labeled data sets that contain inputs and outputs. Examples of applications of ML include spam filtering, face recognition, sentiment analysis, and predictive analytics. 

2- Deep Learning: Another type of AI algorithm where artificial neural networks are trained using large datasets consisting of multiple layers of neurons interconnected through weights. Deep learning models have shown impressive performance in tasks such as object detection, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Some popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. 

3- NLP: This category includes methods that enable computers to understand and manipulate text, voice commands, and other linguistic input. One example of an AI product utilizing NLP is Siri, Apple's personal assistant that learns what users want and suggests relevant results based on user preferences. NLP models use techniques like word embeddings, bag-of-words model, and recurrent neural networks. 

4- CV: This category consists of algorithms that analyze visual imagery and extract valuable insights. An example of an AI product utilizing CV is Amazon Rekognition service that identifies objects, faces, and labels in images. Other common CV algorithms include segmentation, object tracking, and facial recognition. 

5- Reinforcement Learning: This category covers strategies for agents to take actions in order to maximize rewards in complex environments. In simpler terms, reinforcement learning enables an agent to learn how to make decisions based on feedback from its actions rather than just receiving instructions directly. Reinforcement learning has been applied widely in games such as Go, Atari, and AlphaGo, and in robotics. 

The use cases of AI in different industries vary from simple chatbots to advanced self-driving cars. For instance, machine learning algorithms help Facebook discover who likes your posts, while virtual assistants like Alexa provide recommendations based on user queries. Similarly, in medical imaging, AI is being used to automate procedures such as breast cancer diagnosis and prevention, while in manufacturing, AI technologies are used to optimize inventory levels, reduce costs, increase productivity, and improve customer satisfaction. Overall, there is no single industry in which all areas of AI are equally important, but the role of AI is only going to grow with the advancement of technology. 
# 3.Types of Data Used by AI Products 
Data plays a crucial role in the deployment of AI products in enterprise systems. With so many options available for structured, unstructured, semi-structured, and image data, choosing the appropriate format and level of detail is critical. Here are some guidelines on the types of data used by AI products: 

1- Structured Data: These data sets consist of well-defined records and columns containing information about entities such as customers, orders, employees, and products. Typical applications of structured data include database management, e-commerce platforms, and banking systems. 

2- Unstructured Data: This type of data contains raw data obtained from sources such as social media sites, emails, audio recordings, videos, and sensor data. Unstructured data requires extensive preprocessing before it can be fed into AI algorithms. Some applications of unstructured data include content moderation, sentiment analysis, and fraud detection. 

3- Semi-Structured Data: This type of data is derived from both structured and unstructured data sets. It contains nested structures within documents or tables, making it difficult to store and query effectively. However, certain patterns in the data may reveal significant insights that traditional databases cannot obtain. Applications of semi-structured data include knowledge graphs and web scraping. 

4- Image Data: These data sets contain digital representations of physical objects such as photos, scans, and sketches. The size and complexity of these images makes them challenging to process efficiently. Therefore, specialized libraries and algorithms designed specifically for handling image data should be employed. Common applications of image data include photo tagging, object recognition, and self-driving cars. 

It’s essential to choose the right type of data depending on the requirements of the specific project. Companies can leverage multiple data types to enhance their products’ ability to handle a wide range of scenarios, including structured, unstructured, and image data types. 
# 4.How AI Is Being Used in Different Industries 
Now let us dive deeper into the roles of AI products in different industries. Let’s consider two key areas - Healthcare and Finance - since these industries are closely related. 

Healthcare: In the healthcare sector, AI is being leveraged to diagnose diseases, treat patients, and deliver better outcomes. Moreover, accurate and reliable diagnosis tools are crucial for improving patient care and reducing mortality rates. Currently, AI-powered diagnostic tools are often used during routine clinical visits, providing faster and easier access to high quality medical treatment. By incorporating AI into healthcare workflows, organizations can achieve better patient outcomes by automating processes, identifying disease patterns early, and targeting potential threats earlier in the disease lifecycle. As new technologies emerge and medicine becomes increasingly digitized, ensuring that AI can work seamlessly alongside humans will continue to be a priority for healthcare providers and researchers. Additionally, by integrating AI into hospital workflow and improving communication between doctors and nurses, patients can receive more consistent and efficient care across hospitals. 

Finance: In the financial services industry, AI is being leveraged to offer improved risk assessment and decision-making capabilities for clients. According to McKinsey Global Institute estimates, 70% of U.S. banks globally rely on AI-powered tools to manage client portfolios, track risks, and anticipate needs. AI-driven solutions allow banks to identify patterns, make predictions, allocate resources, and streamline business processes. They also enable them to provide personalized services tailored to individual clients' preferences and goals. Emerging technologies such as autonomous driving, virtual assistants, and augmented reality can further enrich the value propositions offered to consumers. Despite these benefits, it remains imperative that banks adopt an integrated approach to AI and focus on developing robust AI infrastructure that meets compliance regulations and best practices. Together, these factors contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future for the financial services industry.
