## 1.1 Least Squares Method (LSM)
Least-squares method (LSM), also known as ordinary least squares regression or linear regression is a statistical technique used to find the line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between a set of data points and their corresponding values on a straight line. It has become one of the most commonly employed methods for fitting data by finding the line of best fit through the data points without any outliers. LSM can be applied to both scalar variables (such as temperature, pressure, and speed) and vectorial variables (such as position, velocity, acceleration, and force). In this article, we will focus on its application to uncertainty quantification of output variables in systems with noisy sensor inputs.
## 1.2 Problem Statement
Consider a system where multiple sensors are placed at different positions along a process chain. The output variable of interest, denoted by Y(t), may depend on these input signals measured by each sensor within an uncertain time interval [t_start, t_end]. Specifically, Y(t) = f(X_i(t)), where X_i(t) represents the i-th sensor measurement at time t. Additionally, there exists noise associated with each sensor measurement due to instrumental and environmental variations that cannot be eliminated. Therefore, it becomes difficult to obtain a precise value of Y(t) from the raw measurements obtained using these sensors. Here, our goal is to estimate the uncertainty of Y(t) based on the available information from the sensors.
## 1.3 Approach
One possible approach towards obtaining the uncertainty of Y(t) is to use statistical techniques such as covariance analysis and bootstrap resampling. However, these approaches require additional assumptions regarding the form of the underlying model and/or the validity of the estimated uncertainties. Alternatively, we can leverage the low-rank structure of the matrix equation formed when solving for the parameters of the model, which makes it suitable for handling high-dimensional problems. We call this approach "least squares method," and here, we present its application to the problem of uncertainty quantification in systems with noisy sensor inputs. 

The key idea behind LSM is to decompose the error between the observed signal y and the predicted signal $\hat{y}$ into three parts: 

1. Residual Error ($e$): This corresponds to the difference between the actual value of $Y(t)$ and its predicted value $\hat{Y}(t)$.
2. Measurement Uncertainty ($u_m$): This reflects the intrinsic randomness inherent in the physical properties of the sensors themselves, independent of any interference or perturbation from other components of the system. 
3. Model Uncertainty ($u_{mod}$): This arises because the observations of the sensors are corrupted by various sources of noise, including sensor drift, bias, thermal fluctuations, and mechanical vibrations.

We assume that the noise processes cause the residual error to follow a normal distribution centered around zero, i.e., $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. Then, we can write down the following likelihood function assuming that the model is correct:

$$L(\theta) = L_y + L_{\mu} + L_{\Sigma}$$

where $\theta$ contains the parameters of the model. $L_y$ corresponds to the probability density function of the observed signal, while $L_{\mu}, L_{\Sigma}$ correspond to the conditional distributions of the model outputs given the model parameters. These two terms capture the effects of measurement uncertainty and model uncertainty respectively. For example, if the model parameters $\theta$ are fixed, then $L_{\mu}$, $L_{\Sigma}$ represent the posterior marginal probability distributions of the model outputs, conditioned on the observed signal and all of the other sources of uncertainty. If we have access to a large amount of data collected under similar conditions, we can approximate these distributions exactly using Bayesian inference methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this case, $L_{\mu}$, $L_{\Sigma}$ represent the approximated posteriors over the model outputs. Note that we treat the parameter space $(\theta, u_m, u_{mod})$ as a Gaussian mixture model, and therefore, we can use probabilistic programming languages such as PyMC3 or Stan to perform MCMC sampling and approximation.

To apply the LSM approach, we need to identify the appropriate measure of $u_{mod}$. One common choice is to take the trace of the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood function. However, computing the exact Hessian matrix is computationally expensive since it involves taking partial derivatives wrt all model parameters and requires evaluating the Jacobian matrix of the transformation functions. An alternative approach is to use the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which captures the second derivative of the log-likelihood function in the direction of maximum increase of the objective function. Since the FIM has less computational overhead than the Hessian matrix, it allows us to compute it efficiently even for high-dimensional models. The FIM takes the form:

$$H = -\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^T}\log p(y|\theta)$$

where $p(y|\theta)$ is the joint probability density function of the observed signal and the model parameters. To obtain the FIU for our specific scenario, we need to consider how the model uncertainty is expressed in terms of the elements of the FIM. Let $\Omega$ denote the submatrix of the FIM corresponding to the entries related to the output variables $f_j$, where $j=1,...,m$. Then, we have:

$$\text{FIU}_j = \sqrt{-Tr[\Omega_{jj}]I} = (\Sigma_{ij}^{-1})^{1/2}\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^nu_{mk}}$$

Here, $\Sigma_{ij}$ denotes the element of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ corresponding to the j-th output variable and the i-th state variable. We interpret this expression as follows. For a particular state variable $x_i$, the $j$-th output variable $f_j$ depends only weakly on it up to a constant factor, which can be characterized by the diagonal entry $\Omega_{jj}$. Therefore, we can reduce the effect of $\Sigma_{ij}$ by multiplying it by some factor $\sqrt{\Omega_{jj}}$ before squaring it to get $\text{FIU}_j$. Moreover, we incorporate the contribution of the remaining dimensions in the output vectors by summing over the k-th unknown noise source, which contributes an uncorrelated noise term $u_{mk}$. Finally, we take the square root of the result to ensure that the uncertainty estimates are positive definite, i.e., they do not contain negative eigenvalues.

With the above definitions in mind, let's now illustrate the entire pipeline for estimating the uncertainty of the output variable Y(t) using LSM in a real world system. We assume that we have already collected a dataset consisting of the observed signals y, the timestamps ts, and metadata information such as the location of each sensor relative to the measuring point. 

First, we preprocess the data by removing duplicate and missing samples, and transform them into a standard format that includes columns for the sensor IDs, timestamps, and corresponding measurement values. Next, we extract the relevant features such as the absolute differences between adjacent measurements, the angle between consecutive measurements, etc. depending on the nature of the input signals. Based on the feature selection, we construct a design matrix A that maps the input signals onto a latent space, where the dimensionality of the latent space equals the number of selected features. Using this design matrix, we learn a mapping function that transforms the sensor measurements into the latent representation. 

Once we have learned the mapping function, we partition the dataset into training and test sets, and train a model using the training dataset. The model predicts the observed signals $\hat{y}$ based on the input signals x, and computes the mean squared error loss between the true labels and the predicted labels. We can then evaluate the performance of the trained model on the test dataset and report the error rate. 

Next, we use the fisher information matrix to compute the confidence intervals of the predictions for the output variables Y(t). We first calculate the FIU for each output variable separately using the formula above. Then, we combine the FIUs across output variables to get the total FIU corresponding to the full prediction. We add a small fraction of the FIU to each prediction to account for model variance beyond what would be captured by the FIU alone. Lastly, we sample new datasets from the prior distribution corresponding to the FIU, and use them to predict the bounds on the output variable. We repeat this process several times to generate a more accurate estimate of the uncertainty of the output variable. 

In summary, the LSM approach provides a flexible and efficient way to estimate the uncertainty of output variables in complex systems with noisy sensor inputs. By leveraging the low-rank structure of the matrix equation and relying on probabilistic modeling, it offers significant advantages over traditional statistical methods like covariance analysis and bootstrap resampling, particularly for large-scale problems.
