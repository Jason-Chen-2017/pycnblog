# 1.简介
  


Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a popular technique for global optimization of black-box functions that have expensive evaluations but can be sampled cheaply. In this article we will explore the use of BO in practice using Python's scikit-optimize library to implement BO on a simple example problem. We'll also compare our results to standard grid search, random search and tuned hyperparameters from a machine learning algorithm like Random Forest or XGBoost. Finally, we'll discuss why BO might be useful in cases where standard methods such as grid search are not effective due to non-convexity, high dimensionality, stochasticity or noisy observations. 

This article assumes some familiarity with Python programming language, machine learning algorithms and optimization concepts. If you need an introduction to these topics then I recommend reading my other articles on them:




In summary, we will go through the following steps: 

1. Install required packages 
2. Define a simple example function to optimize
3. Implement different optimizers including standard grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimisation using `scikit-optimize` package
4. Compare performance of optimizers on our sample problem compared to baseline approaches (grid search, random search) and optimized hyperparameters from a ML model (Random Forest).  
5. Discuss reasons behind the choice of BO for this specific problem scenario and how it could be applied in more complex scenarios involving higher dimensional input spaces, non-convex functions, stochastic environments, and noisy data points. 


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into implementing any code, let's first understand the basic concepts and terminology related to Bayesian optimisation. 

## 2.1 Bayes' Rule
The fundamental idea of BO lies in Bayes' rule, which allows us to update probabilities based on new information. Mathematically, Bayes' rule states: 

$$ P(x|y) = \frac{P(y|x) P(x)}{P(y)} $$

where $x$ represents the hypothesis being considered (i.e., parameter settings), $y$ denotes observed evidence (i.e., objective value), $P(x)$ is the prior probability assigned to $x$, $P(y|x)$ is the likelihood function telling us the probability of observing $y$ given $x$, and $P(x|y)$ is the posterior probability assigned to $x$. 

In BO, we assume that the prior probability $P(x)$ is provided, and then evaluate the likelihood function $P(y|x)$ at multiple candidate values of $x$, weighted by their respective acquisition function values $q_n(x)$. The updated posterior probability is then calculated according to Bayes' rule. 

## 2.2 Acquisition Function
The main goal of BO is to select points $x$ where the expected improvement (EI) or its derivative maximizes the predictive power of the model. EI is defined as follows:

$$ EI(x) = \underset{\theta}{\max} \left[ f(\theta) - y_{best}\right] + \kappa \sqrt{\frac{\ln{(M+1)}}{N}} $$

where $\theta$ is the set of parameters being evaluated, $f(\theta)$ is the predicted objective value, $y_{best}$ is the best possible outcome (the minimum if the target is minimization), $M$ is the number of iterations so far, $N$ is the total number of samples collected, and $\kappa$ is a tradeoff parameter between exploration and exploitation. 

We can visualize the EI surface as follows:<|im_sep|>
