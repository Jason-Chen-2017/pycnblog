Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a computer science technique used for modeling and simulating complex systems with stochastic behavior based on mathematical formulations called "events". In this approach, processes are modeled as a sequence of decisions and actions that occur at specific times during the simulated time period. These actions may involve changes in system state or resource availability. The results of DES simulations can be analyzed to gain insight into system dynamics and provide useful information for decision making.

The advancement of technology has significantly increased the complexity and variety of real world systems. With the rapid growth of digital devices and network connectivity, there have been numerous challenges in managing large-scale distributed systems. Distributed control architectures have emerged as a powerful solution to these challenges, but they require advanced algorithms and tools to simulate and analyze their behavior under different operating conditions and constraints. Discrete event simulation (DES) offers an alternative approach where the entire system is represented as a set of discrete events, which can be efficiently executed by software simulators without requiring high computational power. Despite its simplicity, DES enables researchers and engineers to model and simulate complex systems with significant accuracy and detail.

In recent years, DES has become a popular tool for studying complex dynamic systems in several fields such as engineering, biology, finance, transportation, manufacturing, and economics. Many industries around the world are using DES for planning, scheduling, optimization, and controlling operations. Healthcare, public safety, energy, transportation, telecommunications, and many other domains use DES to model and simulate various systems with critical interdependencies between multiple actors.

Despite the popularity of DES, it remains a challenging topic due to its complex nature, mathematical rigor, and computationally expensive modeling process. The following sections will give a brief introduction to key concepts and terminology related to DES, describe how DES works, and discuss some practical applications of DES in various domains such as healthcare, resource allocation, and patient flow management.
# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Events
Events are the basic unit of activity in a DES model. They represent changes in system state or resource availability that can trigger subsequent events. When one event occurs, it triggers one or more new events in response, depending on the probability distribution associated with each transition. 

For example, consider a simple queueing system with customers arriving at different rates:


Each customer who enters the system gets assigned to one of three stations according to her priority level. If all three stations are busy, then the customer leaves unsatisfied. Otherwise, she waits until one of them becomes available and serves her demand.

In this case, we can define two types of events:

1. Customer Arrival: This event represents a new customer entering the system. It does not directly affect any existing entities in the system, but rather creates a new entity (a customer).

2. Station Availability Change: Each station has a limited capacity and there can only be so many customers allowed inside at any given time. Whenever a customer's demand exceeds the current station capacity, another station needs to become available before the customer can enter it. At this point, we say that the availability of a particular station has changed, triggering the corresponding event.

Together, these two events constitute a complete description of the system state change caused by a single customer arrival. We can repeat this process over and over again to generate a complete history of system events.

## 2.2 States
States are variables that characterize the system at any given point in time. They capture both the current values of system parameters and any relevant intermediate quantities needed to compute future state changes. In addition to being important for computing next-state probabilities, state variables can also help identify transient behaviors that may need further analysis. For instance, in our previous queueing example, if a customer is currently waiting in line, we might want to track her position in the line.

## 2.3 Resources
Resources are the physical or abstract items involved in a DES model, such as machines, vehicles, or human beings. Different activities within the system often share common resources, leading to conflicts when those activities try to access the same resource simultaneously. To avoid such conflicts, resource sharing must be controlled carefully through appropriate resource allocation mechanisms.

One type of resource in DES is the queue itself. A shared queue leads to congestion, delays, and unnecessary wait times, even in cases where no actual contention exists. Control strategies that allocate resources optimally towards tasks that benefit the most from that resource are essential to preventing congestions and maximizing throughput.

Another example of a resource in DES is space in a warehouse. Depending on the size and layout of the warehouse, certain areas may be designated as "restricted", meaning that no inventory moves can take place there unless authorized by a supervisor. Resource allocation algorithms that prioritize the movement of products that benefit the most from restricted spaces are necessary to ensure efficient utilization of storage facilities.

## 2.4 Decision Making Models
Decision-making models are methods for selecting among competing options or actions based on historical data or other factors. DES models frequently employ decision-making models to make strategic choices about allocation of resources, assignment of responsibilities, routing of traffic, and others. Some commonly used models include Markov chains, inventory models, choice-based models, and simulation-based optimization techniques.
