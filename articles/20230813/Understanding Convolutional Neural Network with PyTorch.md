# 2.1 Introduction to CNNs
## 2.1.1 What is a Convolutional Neural Network? 
A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is a type of artificial neural network that has been specifically designed for analyzing visual imagery. It uses filters and pooling layers to extract features from the input image, which are then processed by fully connected layers to produce output classification predictions. The architecture of a CNN typically consists of several convolutional layers followed by one or more fully connected layers.

In contrast to traditional feedforward neural networks (such as multilayer perceptrons), CNNs use convolutional layers to learn localized features in images. A convolutional layer takes an input image and applies a set of filter weights to it, producing a feature map. This process of applying a filter repeatedly over the entire image is known as convolution. Each element in the resulting feature map corresponds to a value obtained by multiplying the corresponding pixel in the input image by the filter weight and summing the results. By combining these values across multiple pixels and filters, a single feature map captures different aspects of the original image at different scales. 

The main advantage of using a convolutional layer instead of standard fully connected layers is that it enables the model to automatically learn spatial relationships between pixels, thereby capturing information that is difficult to capture with densely connected layers. Another important aspect of CNNs is their ability to handle variable size inputs through padding and strides. Finally, CNNs can be trained end-to-end on large datasets because they do not require any manual feature engineering or pretraining steps.

In summary, CNNs have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing visual imagery by learning abstract representations of the underlying patterns in the data. They provide state-of-the-art performance on many vision tasks such as object recognition, image segmentation, and face detection. With appropriate training, CNNs can achieve high accuracy rates while requiring less computation than other deep learning models.

## 2.1.2 How does a CNN Work?
Here's how a CNN works in detail: 

1. Input Image: The first step in processing an image with a CNN is to convert the raw image into a format that can be understood by the computer. This could involve scaling the brightness, cropping out unnecessary parts of the image, resizing the image to a uniform size, and normalizing the pixel values to lie within a certain range. 

2. Preprocessing: Before we can apply our convolutional layers, we need to preprocess the input image by passing it through some filters. These filters look at small regions of the image and compute new values based on what they find. For example, we might detect edges, textures, shapes, or colors. We'll call this collection of filtered outputs a feature map. 

3. Convolving Filters: The next step is to actually apply our set of filters to the image. Each filter looks at a different pattern, so when we apply each filter to the image, we get a unique feature map. To do this efficiently, we move our filters around the image, called a sliding window, and convolve them with the surrounding pixels. 

4. Pooling Layers: After convolving our filters, we may want to reduce the dimensionality of our feature maps. One way to do this is to take the maximum or average value within each small region of the feature map called a pool. This reduces the number of parameters in our network and speeds up the computations. 

5. Fully Connected Layer: Once we've reduced the dimensions of our feature maps, we pass them through one or more fully connected layers to perform classification or regression. In a typical classifier, we connect each node in the final layer to every node in the hidden layer, and add up all the weighted connections to obtain a prediction score for each class.

6. Output: At the output layer, we receive our predicted probabilities for each class, along with a probability for the overall correctness of the classification. We often choose the class with the highest probability as our final answer. 


## 2.1.3 Key Terms
**Feature**: A property or characteristic of an entity that makes it distinctive. Features are usually represented as vectors of numerical values. For instance, the color of a cat is a feature of the animal; its shape, orientation, and location can also be viewed as features. Features play an essential role in many applications where machine learning is used, including speech recognition, natural language understanding, facial recognition, image classification, and spam filtering. 

**Feature Extractor**: A component of a CNN that learns to extract features from an input image. Feature extractors work by scanning the image and extracting relevant information about the content. Typically, these components consist of sets of convolutional and max pooling layers, together with activation functions like ReLU. 

**Fully Connected Layer**: A linear transformation applied to the flattened representation of a feature map. This layer passes the information contained in the feature map to another part of the network for further processing. 

**Pooling Layer**: An operation performed after a set of filters have been applied to an input image. Pooling layers group nearby pixels together and collapse them down into a smaller region, reducing the computational cost required for subsequent layers. There are two types of pooling layers commonly used in CNNs: Max Pooling and Average Pooling. 

**ReLU Function**: Rectified Linear Unit function is an activation function that replaces negative values in a tensor with zeroes. It helps to improve the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm during backpropagation.  

# 2.2 Architecture of a Simple CNN Model
Now let’s create a simple CNN model using PyTorch. Here's a basic structure of our model:

```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        # Convolutional layer (sees 32x32x3 image tensor)
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        # Activation function
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        # Max pooling layer
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)

        # Convolutional layer (sees 16x16x16 tensor)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=16, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)

        # Flatten layer
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 16 * 16, 128)
        # Dropout layer (p=0.5)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        # Final output layer (outputting 10 classes)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Apply convolutional layers and pooling
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv2(x)))

        # Flatten output
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 16 * 16)
        
        # Apply fully connected layers
        x = self.dropout(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))
        x = self.fc2(x)

        return x
```

This model contains four major components:

1. **Input Image**: Our CNN model takes in a 32x32 RGB image tensor, with three color channels. 

2. **Convolutional Layers**: We apply two convolutional layers, each consisting of 3x3 filters with 16 and 32 output channels respectively. The `stride` parameter determines how much the filters slide along the image during each iteration, while the `padding` parameter adds additional zeros around the border of the image to keep the same size. 

3. **Activation Functions**: Both convolutional layers use the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, which computes the elementwise minimum of each input tensor and zero. ReLU is widely used in deep neural networks due to its simplicity and effectiveness in preventing vanishing gradients. 

4. **Max Pooling Layers**: We apply two max pooling layers with a 2x2 kernel size and a stride of 2 to shrink the output size of both convolutional layers. This allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps without losing too much useful information. 

5. **Flatten Layer**: We reshape the output tensor of our last convolutional layer into a flat vector before applying fully connected layers. This allows us to apply regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization later. 

6. **Output Layer**: Our final output layer produces 10 logits, one for each possible class label. During training, we calculate cross-entropy loss against the true labels, and update the parameters of our model accordingly using stochastic gradient descent.
