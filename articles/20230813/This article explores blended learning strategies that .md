Blending is a strategy for teaching learners in the classroom by combining multiple learning resources together to create a cohesive curriculum. Blended learning has emerged as a popular approach to help students master complex topics through interconnected knowledge. In this paper, I will explore how blended learning can be implemented within the context of online education platforms such as MOOCs.

Online education refers to the delivery of educational content or services over the internet using technology. It involves both traditional face-to-face and remote formats where educators offer virtual classes and interact with learners via social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc. There are several reasons why online education platforms have become increasingly popular including convenience, flexibility, scalability, affordability, and accessibility. With the advent of new technologies, it’s becoming easier than ever for educators to provide high quality educational content across all devices and on different platforms. However, implementing blending strategies requires careful planning to ensure consistency between online learning materials and in-person activities while also ensuring student engagement and retention. 

In this paper, I will focus on two key components of blended learning: problem-based learning and hybrid/flipped classrooms. The first component encourages learners to practice skills they may not be able to apply during real-world situations. For example, in biology lessons, learners must identify and isolate particular organisms based on molecular data but they don’t always have direct access to this information. They need support from experts who can explain the concepts behind the experiments. Similarly, when learners work on assignments, they must rely on feedback to improve their performance. Second, flipped classrooms encourage learners to use theory-driven approaches while actively working on exercises, projects, and tests. While theoretical knowledge is important, practicing practical skills is critical to develop competency in modern life. Hybrid classrooms combine synchronous online modules with asynchronous virtual activities that facilitate individualized attention and active participation. Both components require thoughtful design and implementation that ensures both efficiency and effectiveness of the course. 

To implement blended learning strategies within the context of NGOs and universities, there are several considerations. First, organizations need to understand the benefits of adopting blended learning and invest in developing integrated digital programs. Second, institutions should strive to align their courses with the demands of learners, making sure they address specific needs and interests of diverse learners. Third, institutions should carefully manage financial resources so that they don't end up spending more than necessary on digital infrastructure or hardware upgrades. Finally, learners need to be supported throughout their journey, from enrolling to graduation. Therefore, it's essential to establish strong relationships with stakeholders throughout the process to communicate effective program design, monitoring progress, and achieving results.
 
In my research, I examined three case studies of National Grassroots Organizations (NGOs) and universities integrating these strategies into their courses. Each organization had its own unique challenges and requirements, but they shared similar core objectives: providing relevant content, maintaining accountability, creating a culture of inclusivity, and responding effectively to challenges. We found that the successful cases highlighted strengths in terms of operational efficiencies, increased engagement, reduced costs, and improved outcomes for learners. Overall, our findings suggest that blended learning strategies can be leveraged successfully within the context of online education platforms to meet the needs of diverse learners while still ensuring equitable distribution of instructional resources and effective student interaction.
