Transfer learning (TL) is a widely used technique in deep neural networks for solving various computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification and semantic segmentation. The idea behind transfer learning is to leverage the knowledge learned from a related task on other datasets or domains and apply it to improve performance of current dataset/domain by transferring the representations learnt using less data. In this work, we focus on fine-tuning techniques specifically designed for computer vision tasks where pre-trained models are used. We show that these techniques can significantly outperform previous approaches based on training from scratch on the target dataset while requiring minimal computational resources compared to full retraining. We also provide insights into how the network architecture and hyperparameters affect the transferability of representations from source domain to target domain. 

We evaluate our methods on several popular benchmark datasets including ImageNet, PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes, and COCO. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art architectures trained from scratch. Further, we propose a novel approach called Prior Knowledge Transfer (PKT) which incorporates prior knowledge about the distribution of classes across different domains into representation transfer. This allows us to achieve better transfer accuracy on certain categories by leveraging class-specific information obtained through prior knowledge. Finally, we discuss future research directions in transfer learning for computer vision and potential applications of PKT. 

In this paper, we present an overview of TL for computer vision problems. We start with a brief background introduction to transfer learning, followed by definitions of key terms like pre-trained model, fine-tuned model, source domain, and target domain. We then proceed to describe the core algorithmic operations involved in TL, i.e., feature extraction from pre-trained models, fine-tuning, and classification layers. Next, we explore the impact of changing the network architecture and hyperparameters on transferability of features between source and target domains. Finally, we analyze the impact of incorporating prior knowledge about the distribution of classes across different domains into transfer learning and propose a new method named Prior Knowledge Transfer (PKT). Together, these components form the foundation for effective use of TL in computer vision tasks.  

Overall, our contributions include:

1. A comprehensive review of transfer learning techniques applied to computer vision problems. 

2. An analysis of the effects of changing the network architecture and hyperparameters on transferability of features between source and target domains. 

3. A detailed discussion of incorporating prior knowledge into transfer learning for improved accuracy on certain categories. 

4. Future research directions and applications in transfer learning for computer vision.

5. An empirical evaluation on popular benchmarks showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art architectures when transferred using TL techniques.

6. An open-source implementation of most of the algorithms discussed in this work to facilitate research in transfer learning for computer vision. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a short literature survey on transfer learning applied to CV tasks. Section 3 goes deeper into defining key concepts like pre-trained model, fine-tuned model, source domain, and target domain, along with explanations of the core algorithms involved in transfer learning, e.g., feature extraction, fine-tuning, and classification layers. Section 4 discusses how changing the network architecture and hyperparameters affects transferability of features between source and target domains, leading to further exploration of design choices that can improve transfer learning performance. Section 5 explores ways of incorporating prior knowledge about the distribution of classes across different domains into transfer learning, resulting in a new method called PKT. Section 6 evaluates PKT's effectiveness on popular CV benchmarks and presents results. Section 7 discusses future research directions in transfer learning for CV and potential applications of PKT. Lastly, Section 8 includes some concluding remarks and pointers to future work. We hope this article will be useful in providing an accessible yet rigorous account of transfer learning for CV tasks, fostering progress in research and industry.
