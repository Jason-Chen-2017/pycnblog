## 什么是Web Scraping?
Web scraping, also known as web data extraction or web harvesting, is the process of extracting data from websites by using automated software tools. It involves automating a web browser to access and extract content from websites such that it can be saved into files or used for further processing. The extracted information can be valuable in various applications ranging from scientific research, financial analysis, marketing analysis, customer profiling, and more. Web scraping enables businesses to collect large amounts of relevant data without having to manually copy-paste it from multiple pages on their website, making it easier than ever before to gather valuable insights and make better business decisions.
In this primer article, we will discuss the basics of web scraping, including its fundamentals, key concepts, algorithms, and common pitfalls. We will then use Python programming language to implement several examples of web scraping techniques, covering topics like xpath selectors, HTTP requests, parsing HTML documents with BeautifulSoup library, and other advanced features. Finally, we will demonstrate how to deploy these scripts on cloud platforms such as Amazon AWS or Google Cloud Platform so that they can continuously scrape and extract new data automatically. 

## Who should read this article?
This article is intended for those who are interested in learning about web scraping but may not have extensive experience in coding or web development. However, basic knowledge of computer programming and command line usage would definitely help in understanding some parts of the code snippets provided throughout the article. Anyone who wants to learn more about web scraping and see practical applications of it can benefit from reading through this article.

# 2.Basic Concepts
## What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API acts as a bridge between different software components, enabling them to communicate with each other seamlessly. For example, if you want to retrieve weather information from OpenWeatherMap, you don’t need to manually enter your city name, zip code, etc., instead, you can simply call upon the OpenWeatherMap API which will return all necessary weather information. APIs provide a way for developers to create powerful and efficient software systems that work together, allowing users to interact with third-party services quickly and easily. In the context of web scraping, APIs allow us to send HTTP requests to web servers and receive responses back in JSON format. Therefore, knowing what an API is and why it's important is essential when working with web scraping. 

## What is Xpath Selector?
Xpath selector is a tool used for selecting specific elements from an HTML document based on certain conditions. With an XPath selector, we can locate any element within an HTML document that has a particular attribute value or text content. Xpath selectors are commonly used in web scraping tasks where we need to identify specific pieces of information on a webpage and selectively extract only those elements. They are especially useful in cases where there are complex structures on the page (e.g., tables, lists) that require additional scripting to extract the desired information. Another advantage of Xpath selectors over regular expressions is that they offer easy-to-use syntax and flexibility. If the structure of the HTML document changes, the Xpath selector itself remains consistent, making it easier to maintain and update the script.

## How does HTTP Request Work?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), often abbreviated as "HTTP," is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how data is exchanged between web browsers and servers. When a user enters a URL in their browser, the request is sent via the internet to a server holding the requested resource (such as an HTML file). The response received from the server includes metadata such as the type of the file being requested (in this case, an HTML file), as well as the actual contents of the file.

HTTP Requests are essentially instructions sent to a web server requesting a specific action. There are four main types of HTTP requests:

1. GET - Retrieves resources from a specified URI
2. POST - Sends data to the specified URI
3. PUT - Replaces existing resources at the specified URI
4. DELETE - Deletes existing resources at the specified URI

Each request specifies a method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and a target URI (which specifies the resource to be retrieved or modified). The payload of the request contains any additional data required for the operation. Together, these properties define a complete HTTP request message that can be routed along the network and delivered to the appropriate destination server.

When performing web scraping, we typically send HTTP requests to retrieve data from web servers. These requests can include parameters specifying search criteria or authentication credentials. Once the request is made, the server returns a response containing the data we requested in the form of a message. This response is typically returned in XML or JSON format depending on the nature of the data being retrieved.

The interaction between client software (browsers, bots, crawlers, etc.) and web servers typically happens over standardized protocols such as TCP/IP or TLS/SSL. Understanding how HTTP requests and responses work under the hood is critical to becoming a successful web scraper. 

# 3.Scraping Techniques
Now let's dive deeper into some of the most popular web scraping techniques and apply them to real-world scenarios. Let's start with simple scraping techniques first.

## Simple Scraping
Simple scraping refers to retrieving data from a single webpage. Here are two examples:

### Example 1: Extracting Text Content From a Website
We can extract plain text content from a webpage using Python's built-in `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. Below is an example program that retrieves the content of a webpage and prints it out:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://www.example.com'

response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

print(soup.get_text())
```

Here, we first specify the URL of the webpage we want to scrape. Then, we use the `requests` library to send an HTTP GET request to the server hosting the webpage. The response object contains both the headers and the body of the response, which we parse using the `BeautifulSoup` library. Finally, we print out the plain text content of the webpage using the `get_text()` method.

Note that this approach doesn't capture images, videos, or interactive content present on the webpage. If we need to extract such content, we'll need to use more advanced techniques later on.

### Example 2: Downloading Images and Videos
Downloading images and videos can be achieved using similar approaches as above. We can use the `requests` library again to download the binary content of the image or video, save it locally, and add it to our dataset. Alternatively, we could just store the URLs to the images or videos and fetch them separately later on. Here's an example program that downloads all images and videos from a given webpage and saves them to disk:

```python
import os
import re
import requests
from urllib.parse import urljoin

url = 'https://www.example.com'

response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

for link in soup.find_all('img'):
    src = link.attrs['src']
    
    # Skip non-image links
    if not re.match(r'^https?://', src):
        continue
        
    img_url = urljoin(url, src)
    img_name = os.path.basename(img_url)
    img_data = requests.get(img_url).content
    
    with open(f'{img_name}', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(img_data)
        
for link in soup.find_all('video'):
    src = link.attrs['src']
    
    # Skip non-video links
    if not re.match(r'^https?://', src):
        continue
        
    vid_url = urljoin(url, src)
    vid_name = os.path.basename(vid_url)
    vid_data = requests.get(vid_url).content
    
    with open(f'{vid_name}.mp4', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(vid_data)
```

Again, here, we first specify the URL of the webpage we want to scrape. Next, we use the same `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to parse the HTML content of the webpage. We loop through all `<img>` tags in the HTML content, check if they contain a valid source URL (i.e., starting with http:// or https://), join the base URL of the webpage with the source URL to get the full URL of the image, download the image using `requests`, and write it to disk using a filename derived from the original URL. Similarly, we do the same thing for `<video>` tags, downloading and writing mp4 files to disk. Note that this approach works best if we know ahead of time what kind of media content we're expecting on the webpage. Otherwise, we might end up downloading unnecessary data or failing altogether due to unsupported formats.

## Crawling Websites
Crawling websites is a technique used to recursively visit every linked page on a website and retrieve the contents of those pages. It is particularly helpful in situations where there are many related pages on a website or in highly dynamic websites where updating content requires frequent visits to individual pages. While some sites limit automated crawling due to legal or ethical concerns, others enable it voluntarily to gather large volumes of data for machine learning purposes or social science research. Popular crawl strategies include breadth-first search and depth-first search, which traverse the website tree either level-by-level or node-by-node respectively. Some popular tools for crawling websites include Selenium WebDriver, Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and ScrapyCloud.

Here's an example program that uses Scrapy to recursively visit every linked page on a website and print out their titles and URLs:

```python
import scrapy


class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):

    name ='myspider'
    allowed_domains = ['example.com']
    start_urls = [
        'http://www.example.com/'
    ]

    def parse(self, response):
        for link in response.css('a::attr(href)').extract():
            yield response.follow(link, self.parse)

        title = response.css('title::text').extract()
        if len(title) > 0:
            print(title[0])
        
        url = response.request.url
        print(url)
        

if __name__ == '__main__':
    process = scrapy.crawler.CrawlerProcess({
        'USER_AGENT': 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)'
    })
    
    process.crawl(MySpider)
    process.start()
```

Here, we define a custom spider class called `MySpider` that extends the `scrapy.Spider` superclass. We set the initial URL to the homepage of the website we want to crawl and override the default `parse` callback function to follow every link found on the current page using the `response.follow` method. If no links are found, the function simply yields the current response to trigger subsequent callbacks. Inside the `parse` function, we extract the title and URL of the current page using CSS selectors and print them out. Note that we set the user agent header to mimic normal human behavior while crawling websites to avoid detection.
