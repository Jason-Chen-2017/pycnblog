BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)是一种预训练文本处理模型，可以对输入进行建模并生成序列表示。其最大的特点就是能够同时关注到整个句子的信息，并且通过双向 Transformer 层来捕获语句的全局信息。而 masked language model（MLM）是 BERT 的一个自监督任务，通过掩盖输入中的一小部分字符，让模型能够预测被掩盖的那些位置上的单词。因此，masked language model 是一种基于上下文的自然语言理解（NLU）任务。

在 BERT 中，有两种类型的预训练任务：pre-training 和 fine-tuning。前者是通过无监督学习的方式，提取有效的信息，如上下文特征、语法结构等；后者是采用已有预训练模型的参数进行微调，在特定 NLP 任务上优化模型性能。本文主要介绍 MLM 在 pre-training 中的作用及其原理。

在此之前，对于 NLU 任务来说，一般都会选择 word embedding + RNN/CNN 作为模型的基本结构。然而，这种结构只考虑了单词的直接关系，没有考虑到上下文关系。而 BERT 可以在保持模型规模和训练效率的同时，解决这个问题。通过预训练，可以使得模型能够学习到丰富的上下文信息，进而做出更好的判断。

那么，什么时候我们需要用到 MLM？假设我们有一个目标语言模型需要生成一个新闻标题，且输入只有一个句子。那么，由于标题往往包含关键词或一些名词短语，而这些词可能出现在原始语句中，如果直接输入所有原始语句，很可能会导致生成错误的标题。而使用 MLM 来生成标题可以缓解这个问题。它可以保证模型生成的标题不会包括原始语句中的信息，从而避免重复。

那么，MLM 有哪些具体的应用呢？这里列举几个：
1. text classification: 给定一个文本，判断该文本属于哪个分类类别。如 sentiment analysis。
2. named entity recognition: 把文本中的实体识别出来。如在一个文档中识别出人名、地名、机构名等。
3. machine translation: 将一种语言翻译成另一种语言。如将英文翻译成中文。

MLM 对模型的影响到底如何？这里给出几点个人看法：
1. 模型收敛速度加快。由于模型不需要再学习预先训练的目标函数，因此训练过程会更加快速。
2. 提高模型的泛化能力。MLM 使得模型的鲁棒性增强。当模型看到一个新样本时，模型不再依赖于目标函数的准确预测，而是在掩盖掉了一部分原始信息的情况下进行预测。因此，模型在处理新的数据时，能够更加健壮。
3. 更多的训练数据。MLM 用无标签数据进行预训练，可以获得更多的训练数据。

# 2.相关术语与定义
## 2.1 transformer
Transformer 是由 Vaswani et al. 在论文 Attention Is All You Need 中提出的神经网络。它的基本单位是 multi-head self-attention。其结构如下图所示：


## 2.2 position encoding
Position Encoding 是编码器（encoder）和解码器（decoder）之间传递位置信息的一种方式。一般的方案有三种：
1. One-hot vector：把位置编码固定为{0,1}向量，长度等于句子长度，然后在前面添零至达到指定的长度。
2. Positional embeddings：每一行代表一个单词的位置编码，一般采用正弦曲线。
3. Learned positional embeddings：位置编码不是固定的，而是根据模型的输入计算得到，因此不需要事先设置长度。

通常情况下，positional embeddings 会随着时间的推移逐渐衰减或者减小。

## 2.3 token embedding
token embedding 是指每个单词（符号）的嵌入向量。它的作用是使得输入序列能够被有效地编码成固定维度的向量。BERT 使用的是 pre-trained embedding，即在一个大的语料库上训练出来的词向量。

## 2.4 vocabulary size and number of layers
vocabulary size 表示词表大小，也就是有多少不同词。number of layers 表示模型的层数。一般 BERT 使用的层数是12层。

## 2.5 attention mask
attention mask 是一张二维矩阵，用来指定哪些位置要参与注意力计算。值为 1 的地方则要参与，为 0 的地方则不参与。

## 3.1 Pre-training Overview
Pre-training BERT involves two tasks:

1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM): This task forces the model to learn to predict what the original input token was based on its surrounding context in a probabilistic way. It does this by randomly replacing some of the input tokens with "[MASK]" tokens during training, and using that as an indicator for which words are being used as queries and which ones are used as keys. The network then learns to reconstruct those missing words based on their surroundings in the same sentence. The goal is to make sure that the model can fill in the blanks accurately even if it's not given all the information up front.

2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): This task asks the model to determine whether two sentences come from the same document or not. In other words, the objective is to train the model to identify which sentence comes next after a '[SEP]' symbol indicating the end of one sentence. The approach involves feeding pairs of sentences into the model together with their labels indicating either 'is_next' or 'not_next'. During training, we randomly choose half of the examples to be negative pairs where each pair contains a random sentence from another document than the one shown in the current example. The remaining half form positive pairs containing the same document. The aim is to teach the model how to differentiate between these two types of sentences. 

After both pre-training tasks have been completed, the resulting weights can be saved for further finetuning on specific tasks such as sentiment analysis or question answering.

## 3.2 Masked Language Modeling Task
Masked Language Modeling (MLM) is done through randomly selecting a subset of the input tokens at each step and replacing them with "[MASK]". Each instance of "[MASK]" corresponds to exactly one input token in the original sentence, but each possible output token could correspond to multiple positions within the sequence. To avoid overfitting, only a small percentage of the inputs (80% by default) are actually masked, while the rest are left unchanged.

During training time, we sample a batch of sequences from our corpus of data, where each sequence has a probability of being selected based on its length. For each selected sequence, we uniformly select a fraction p=0.1 of its tokens at random to replace with "[MASK]", so that there are typically about 15% of masked tokens per input sequence. We also add padding symbols to ensure that all input sequences have the same length (usually set to the maximum sequence length).

After generating a batch of masked sentences, we pass them through the encoder to obtain fixed-length vectors representing each token’s contextual meaning. These vectors are passed through separate dense layers before they are fed back into the decoder. Here is the detailed process:

1. Token Embeddings: We use pre-trained token embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec, etc.) to embed each input token as a high-dimensional vector representation.

2. Segment Embeddings: In addition to the input token, we need to include segment embeddings to indicate which part of the input sentence the token belongs to. We simply create two distinct segment embeddings for "sentence A" and "sentence B", and concatenate them with the token embeddings to get the final embedding for each input token. 

3. Positional Embeddings: Finally, we apply positional encodings to each input token to give it a position in the sequence. We do this by adding a learnable weight matrix Wpe to the concatenation of the token embeddings and the segment embeddings, and passing the result through a non-linear activation function (e.g., ReLU). The purpose of this is to allow the model to capture global features of the input sequence, such as syntax or semantics. Specifically, we compute Equation 7 below:


   Where S denotes the dimensionality of the token embeddings and H denotes the hidden layer size of the transformer. Note that the order of operations here matters - multiplying first then adding ensures that values don't become too large.
   
   Also note that the positional embeddings are added instead of multiplied because multiplication would introduce dependencies between previous positions in the sequence, which violates the structure of natural language.

Once we generate the encoded representations, we pass them through several fully connected layers followed by a softmax activation to produce the probabilities for each output token corresponding to the masked input token. The loss function is cross entropy between the predicted distribution and the true target distribution. We optimize the parameters of the model using stochastic gradient descent with learning rate decay and a minimum lr of 0.00001.

The key aspect of this task is the masked inputs, where the model must infer the original value of the missing tokens without seeing them directly. By doing this, the model is forced to learn complex relationships between the surrounding tokens and the missing ones, which is difficult to do explicitly due to the limitations of neural networks. Furthermore, since the missing tokens are sampled from a discrete space, rather than continuous variables like in traditional language modeling, the model may learn more robust representations and handle out-of-vocab tokens better than standard language models. Overall, this leads to significant improvements in performance compared to standard LMs.

## 3.3 Next Sentence Prediction Task
Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) is a binary classification task that aims to classify whether two consecutive sentences belong to the same document or not. It helps the model understand the importance of sentence boundaries in understanding text. Similar to MLM, we use a similar strategy of randomly selecting the location of the '[SEP]' symbol to split the input sentence pairs into separate segments, and feed them separately through a transformer architecture. The difference is that in this case, we label each pair of sentences with either 'is_next' or 'not_next', depending on whether the second sentence follows the first one or not. As before, we optimize the parameters using stochastic gradient descent with learning rate decay and a minimum lr of 0.00001.

Here is the detailed process:

1. Input Embedding: First, we tokenize the input strings using spaCy tokenizer, extract their embeddings using pre-trained embeddings, pad them to equal lengths, and pack them into a tensor.

2. Attention Mask: Then, we construct an attention mask to distinguish which elements should receive non-local attention and which shouldn't. We do this by setting the diagonal elements of the mask to zero, ensuring that the model cannot attend to future tokens.

3. Output Layer: After obtaining the transformer outputs for both sentences, we perform linear transformations on the final hidden states of the last layer and take the dot product with a learned projection matrix to obtain logits for each class ('is_next' vs 'not_next'). We use cross entropy loss to calculate the loss function between the predicted distributions and the true target distributions. We optimize the parameters of the model using stochastic gradient descent with learning rate decay and a minimum lr of 0.00001.

Overall, the main advantage of this task over MLM is its focus on identifying sentence boundaries and accounting for interactions across sentences. By designating certain instances as relevant and others as irrelevant, this task encourages the model to pay closer attention to the important parts of the input and discourages it from memorizing entire documents when dealing with long sequences of text. Additionally, it provides additional supervision for the model to learn meaningful representations of sentences that contain shorter noun phrases or verb phrases that span multiple sentences.
