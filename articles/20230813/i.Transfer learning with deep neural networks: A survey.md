Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be effective in many tasks such as image classification, object recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. However, training DNN models requires large amounts of labeled data, which is not always available or practical for real-world applications. Transfer learning techniques can address this problem by transferring knowledge learned from a source task to a target task using a small amount of additional unlabeled data. Transfer learning has become an essential technique for building accurate and robust DNN models. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art research on transfer learning based on deep neural networks. In particular, we provide a comprehensive review of existing approaches that are classified into three categories: domain adaptation, feature reuse and multi-task learning. We also discuss the challenges and future directions for transfer learning in DNN systems. Overall, this work provides a valuable resource for practitioners, researchers and students interested in developing transfer learning based deep neural network solutions for various problems such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language understanding and other machine learning applications.
In this survey, we first introduce the background and motivation of transfer learning for DNNs. Then, we review several key concepts and terms commonly used in transfer learning literature. Next, we provide an overview of relevant techniques proposed so far, including two main categories - domain adaptation and feature reuse. Each category includes multiple subcategories with specific algorithms. We then focus on each algorithm to explain its operation and theory behind it. Finally, we discuss the evaluation metrics and datasets used in transfer learning literature. These evaluations will help us understand how well our methods perform in different scenarios and what factors influence their performance. In conclusion, this survey presents a concise and accessible introduction to transfer learning based deep neural networks along with pointers to more detailed resources for further study.

## 2.1 Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
Deep neural networks (DNNs), also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs), are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's central nervous system. The model consists of interconnected layers of neurons, where each layer receives input from the previous layer, processes it through several non-linear transformations and produces output for the next layer. In order to learn complex functions, the ANN learns by adjusting its weights and biases iteratively until convergence to a local minimum. A typical architecture for a deep neural network consists of multiple hidden layers connected to an input layer. Each hidden layer consists of a set of nodes with nonlinear activation functions applied at each node. The output layer typically contains one node per class label, which represents the probability of belonging to any given class.

DNNs have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex problems such as image classification, object recognition, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, natural language processing, recommendation systems etc., especially in recent years due to advances in hardware technology and big data availability. They have made significant progress in a wide range of applications spanning medical imaging, financial modeling, healthcare, social media analytics and video game playing among others. Although they achieve high accuracy levels in most cases, it is important to note that they often require massive amounts of labeled data for training. 

## 2.2 Transfer Learning
Transfer learning refers to the process of adapting pre-trained deep neural networks to new domains or tasks without requiring extensive retraining of the original model. The goal is to leverage knowledge gained from the successful training of these models on related tasks to improve the generalization ability of the model on the new task. The idea is to take advantage of rich features learned on a large dataset for predicting targets for similar but slightly different tasks. 

The use of transfer learning is particularly useful when there is limited labeled data for training a deep neural network on a specific task. For example, consider a scenario where you want to build a model for recognizing objects in images but only have access to a few thousand annotated examples. If you were to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch, you would need a large dataset comprising tens of thousands of labeled examples. Instead, if you could use a pre-trained CNN like VGG, ResNet or GoogLeNet, you could quickly fine-tune the model on your target task by simply adding a few fully connected layers for classification. You may even skip some of the earlier layers of the model since those tend to contain lower level features that do not necessarily apply to your target task. By doing this, you save time and money spent on collecting and annotating data for training, while still achieving good results. 

Another common approach involves utilizing shared representations obtained during training on a larger dataset. Consider a case where you have a large dataset consisting of both cat and dog images. If you were able to extract common features from the large dataset, you could use them as a starting point for training another classifier on a smaller dataset consisting solely of cartoon characters. In this way, you can leverage prior knowledge about visual patterns that are universal across different domains and transfer that to the new task. 

## 2.3 Domain Adaptation
Domain adaptation is the practice of adapting a pretrained model to a new domain without having to annotate a separate dataset specifically for that domain. One type of domain adaptation involves applying changes to the pre-trained weights of the model that make it suitable for the new domain without changing its overall architecture. Another type involves finetuning the entire model on the new dataset using a combination of frozen layers and trained layers. Common ways of performing domain adaptation include jittering the inputs, interpolating between pairs of samples, modifying the loss function and regularization techniques. Additionally, it is common to modify the distribution of classes within the target domain or use a discriminator network to distinguish between source and target distributions during training.

One popular application of domain adaptation is in computer vision, where traditional classifiers have performed remarkably well on standard benchmarks. However, they fail to accurately identify certain types of objects that appear rare or difficult to detect under real-world conditions. Transfer learning allows us to adapt a pre-trained model to a new domain without having to train a dedicated classifier on the new dataset. It can significantly reduce the cost and time required to develop and evaluate models for complex tasks.

## 2.4 Feature Reuse
Feature reuse is a transfer learning paradigm that combines features extracted from a large dataset with less expensive labeled data from a small subset of labels. This method takes advantage of the complementary strengths of deep neural networks and feature engineering techniques. Instead of training a model from scratch on the small subset of labels, we freeze the weights of the pre-trained model and add custom layers to extract specialized features that are indicative of the new task. We then train the final layers of the model on the small subset of labels. This approach enables us to avoid redundant annotations of the same data points, reduces annotation costs and saves time compared to conventional transfer learning approaches.

For instance, suppose you have a pet image dataset containing cats, dogs, birds and horses. To classify pets using a single CNN model, you might start by extracting low-level visual features such as edges and textures from the dataset. Once the CNN has learned these features, you can use transfer learning to customize the model to recognize animal breeds without relying entirely on the initial visual cues provided by the CNN. Specifically, you can freeze all weights except those associated with the last few layers of the pre-trained CNN, and replace them with layers that extract specialized features indicative of the new task, such as color and pattern of fur. Finally, you can fine-tune the remaining layers of the model on the small dataset of breed labels to improve accuracy and control for overfitting. By freezing the majority of the pre-trained weights and focusing on tuning the last few layers, we can greatly reduce the risk of overfitting and enhance the accuracy of the resulting model.
