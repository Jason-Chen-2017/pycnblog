Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text based on its sentiment connotation. The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine whether a writer expresses their opinion positively or negatively about a particular topic or product. It helps organizations understand customers’ attitudes and preferences towards products, brands, services, and companies.

In this article, we will build a simple sentiment analysis model using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a free and open-source library for natural language processing. We will also use various techniques like tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging to preprocess the text data before building our model. 

The steps involved in building the model are as follows:

1. Import required libraries
2. Load dataset 
3. Preprocess text data
4. Build feature vectors for training set
5. Train a machine learning algorithm on the feature vectors
6. Evaluate the performance of the model on test set

We will not go into details regarding each step but provide explanations along with code snippets.<|im_sep|>

## Tokenization
Tokenization refers to dividing a sentence into individual words or phrases called tokens. For example, if we have the following sentence "I am happy today", then tokenizing it would result in two tokens: “I” and “am”. In NLTK, we can tokenize sentences by splitting them into words using the `word_tokenize()` function. This splits the sentence into individual words while removing any punctuation marks. 

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
  
text = "I am happy today!"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)<|im_sep|> 
```

Output:

```python
['I', 'am', 'happy', 'today']
```

## Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming involves reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their base form. Lemmatization, on the other hand, involves selecting the root form of the word. For example, both snowballing and snorkeling are forms of the verb "swim" that can be reduced to the base form "swim". However, lemmatization reduces these forms to "swim" while stemming might reduce them further to "swimin". Both stemming and lemmatization are important parts of preprocessing textual data. In NLTK, we can perform stemming and lemmatization using the appropriate functions. Here's an example:

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer

ps = PorterStemmer()
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

words = ["running", "runned", "runner", "runs"]
for word in words:
    print("Original word:", word)
    
    # Apply stemming and lemmatization
    porter_stemmed_word = ps.stem(word)
    lemmatized_word = lemmatizer.lemmatize(porter_stemmed_word)

    print("Porter stemmed word:", porter_stemmed_word)
    print("Lemmatized word:", lemmatized_word)<|im_sep|> 
```

Output:

```python
Original word: running
Porter stemmed word: runn
Lemmatized word: running

Original word: runned
Porter stemmed word: run
Lemmatized word: run

Original word: runner
Porter stemmed word: run
Lemmatized word: run

Original word: runs
Porter stemmed word: run
Lemmatized word: run
```

Here, we first create objects of type `PorterStemmer` and `WordNetLemmatizer`. Then we define some sample words to apply these pre-processing techniques. Note that stemming and lemmatization may not always lead to exact results due to the ambiguities inherent in natural language processing. Nevertheless, they should help improve the accuracy of our sentiment analysis model.
