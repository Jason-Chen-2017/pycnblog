Named entity recognition (NER) is an important task in natural language processing that involves identifying and classifying mentions of entities such as organizations, locations, persons, etc., in text into predefined categories or types. NER plays a crucial role in many applications such as information retrieval, question answering systems, chatbots, and sentiment analysis. Traditional machine learning algorithms used in NER include rule-based systems, CRF (Conditional Random Field), and neural networks. However, advanced deep learning methods have recently shown impressive performance in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and machine translation. Therefore, it is essential to experiment with new techniques that can achieve high accuracy on NER tasks while being computationally efficient. 

In this blog post, I will present my research results on the use of various sequential labelling techniques for NER. The main goal is to compare different techniques' ability to identify named entities correctly while keeping computational complexity manageable. Specifically, I will analyze how well each technique handles disambiguating ambiguous annotations, whether they take into account lexical, syntactic, and semantic features, and what impact tokenization has on their overall performance. I also want to explore possible avenues of future research in this area by analyzing the effects of different hyperparameters and architectural choices. Overall, my goal is to provide practical guidance to the community and encourage further research into state-of-the-art techniques for NER.

# 2.Background Introduction

Named entity recognition (NER) refers to the task of automatically identifying and categorizing named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories or classes such as people, organizations, dates, cities, times, and so on. This process requires machines to understand the semantics of words and phrases within sentences. For example, given the sentence "Beyoncé performed at the Grammys", a software system should be able to extract the name of the artist "Beyoncé" from the input and classify it as an organization. This task forms one of the core components of common natural language understanding systems.

There are several popular ways to approach NER problem, ranging from simple rules-based techniques to complex deep learning models. In this section, I will discuss three major techniques - rule-based, probabilistic model, and deep learning based - and explain why each is suitable for solving NER problems. 

1. Rule-Based Techniques: These techniques involve manually designing patterns or rules that specify the boundaries of individual entities. One example of a rule-based approach is the Stanford named entity recognizer (StanfordNER), which was developed over the years and is widely used today. It relies heavily on handcrafted rules, making it difficult to scale to larger datasets or handle exceptions.

2. Probabilistic Model: A probabilistic model treats the NER task as a classification problem where the probability distribution of each word belonging to each category is estimated using a training set. Several probabilistic models have been proposed, including Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs). CRFs are specifically designed to capture the dependency between adjacent labels, enabling them to better deal with longer sequences of tags. MEMMs treat each tag independently and do not consider any dependence between tags. Despite their strengths, they cannot accurately capture some aspects of real-world data due to their limited modeling power.

3. Deep Learning Based Approaches: The third type of NER technique uses deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn complex representations of text and extract relevant features. These models have proven highly effective for other NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and machine translation, and therefore they have attracted significant attention in NER. RNNs typically consist of multiple layers, each layer processes the output of its previous layer as input to predict the next element in the sequence. CNNs work similarly but employ convolutional filters to extract local features from text. Both approaches have demonstrated success in capturing both local and global dependencies across the entire text sequence.

All three techniques fall under the general category of sequence labelling, which aims to assign labels to all tokens in a sequence without taking into consideration the order of occurrence. They differ primarily in the way they model the relationship between adjacent tokens and incorporate additional information such as contextual features or lexical features.

The following sections will focus on the details of applying these techniques to the standard NER task, comparing their performance and exploring potential improvements.
