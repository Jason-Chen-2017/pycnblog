Transfer learning (TL) refers to the process of acquiring knowledge or skills through transfer from a source domain to a target domain in machine learning. It is widely used for solving problems related to limited training data available in the target domain by leveraging the knowledge or skills acquired on similar tasks in the source domain. Recently, researchers have been exploring different approaches towards transferring knowledge across non-semantic spaces into semantic ones using deep neural networks. In this survey paper, we will provide an overview of methods and trends for TL from non-semantic to semantic spaces that are being used to solve various natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV) and speech recognition (SR) tasks.

In general, three main categories of techniques can be distinguished based on how they approach the problem of knowledge transfer:
1. Fine-tuning - where only some layers of pre-trained models are fine-tuned with task specific data. This involves training only the top layer(s) of the network and reinitializing all other layers randomly.

2. Knowledge distillation - here, large amounts of unlabeled data are distilled down to smaller amounts of labeled data containing information about the original labels. The goal is to create a small model that is able to learn high level features from both the input space as well as the output space. However, it requires specialized hardware and expertise to achieve good results.

3. Joint training - jointly train both the encoder and decoder parts of the network, which allows the network to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs without any external supervision. However, this method often has more parameters than simple fine-tuning and does not necessarily work well when the number of classes changes.

The article also discusses applications of transfer learning in NLP, CV and SR fields. Some areas of interest include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modeling, image caption generation, question answering etc., each requiring a slightly different set of tools and techniques to succeed.

Finally, the study evaluates the effectiveness of transfer learning in addressing these challenges, highlighting its potential benefits and limitations. 

Overall, the aim of this survey paper is to provide an up-to-date understanding of recent advancements and methods in transfer learning from non-semantic to semantic spaces, and help researchers choose appropriate methods for their own use cases. With better understanding of current literature, decision makers and developers would have a better idea of what factors influence the performance of transferred models and what solutions exist to address them effectively.

# 2.主要术语
Fine-tuning: Transfer learning technique that involves initializing some layers of a pre-trained model with new task specific data, while keeping the rest of the layers intact. This is done to fine-tune the model's ability to recognize relevant patterns within the given dataset.

Knowledge Distillation: Transfer learning technique that involves training a small student model to mimic the behavior of a larger teacher model but without access to its true labelled data. Instead, the algorithm uses soft targets generated by the teacher model to guide the training of the student model.

Joint Training: Transfer learning technique that involves training two separate models simultaneously, one responsible for encoding the input data and generating a fixed size representation, and another responsible for decoding the encoded representations back into meaningful output data. This enables the model to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs without any external supervision, making it particularly suitable for tasks involving structured data such as text classification, named entity recognition and parsing.

Pre-trained Model: A pre-trained neural network that was trained on a large amount of data for a different task before it was frozen and fine-tuned for the specific purpose of the current task.

Semantic Space: A vector space defined over a vocabulary or concepts that represent the meaning of individual words, phrases or sentences. Examples of semantic spaces include word embeddings, concept vectors and sentence encodings.

Source Domain: The initial domain where training data resides. For instance, in NLP, this may refer to texts collected from customer feedback form or social media posts.

Target Domain: The final domain where new data needs to be classified or transformed into. For instance, in NLP, this could be medical records or security reports.

Task-Specific Data: A small set of examples that contain enough information to improve the accuracy of the model's predictions on the target domain. These examples should cover edge cases, rare occurrences or outliers that are typically hard to obtain otherwise.

Unsupervised Pretraining: A type of transfer learning where the pre-trained model is trained solely on the source domain without any explicit annotations. This step serves as a regularizer that helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning.
