# 1.简介
  

Monolithic application architecture refers to the traditional approach of building large applications as a single unit that runs in one process and is divided into multiple layers or tiers with well-defined interfaces between them. The entire system consists of all parts required for running the app. It can be thought of as a single monolith. However, this architectural style has its own limitations such as high coupling, tight cohesion, complexity, and scalability problems. With increasing traffic volumes and use cases requiring more complex features, it becomes necessary to move towards microservices architecture where each service is responsible for a specific functionality and communicates through a lightweight protocol (such as HTTP) instead of directly talking to other services within the same application. This way, developers are able to independently scale individual services without affecting others. 

In this article, we will look at how eBay transformed itself from a monolithic database-driven application to a distributed system consisting of microservices using Apache Kafka messaging framework. We will also discuss some key benefits gained by adopting microservices architecture, including better scalability, agility, flexibility, and resilience to failures. Finally, we will showcase a step-by-step migration plan for migrating an existing monolithic application to microservices architecture.

## 2.1 Apache Kafka Messaging Framework
Apache Kafka is a fast, distributed streaming platform that allows us to build real-time data pipelines and stream data between different systems. It provides a flexible, scalable and fault-tolerant solution that enables us to handle streams of data with low latency and high throughput. Additionally, Kafka supports horizontal scaling and topic partitioning which makes it suitable for processing large amounts of data across multiple nodes.

Microservices architecture involves breaking down a large software application into smaller, independent components called services that communicate through lightweight protocols like HTTP. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and interacts only with other services via their exposed APIs. To implement these communication patterns, Kafka acts as a message broker that connects separate services together, providing a reliable event stream. Kafka's ability to distribute messages across partitions helps ensure that events are delivered reliably to consuming services even when there are failures or delays. 

## 2.2 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern
CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern. In essence, it separates read and write operations into two distinct operations. Write operations typically involve creating, updating, and deleting records while Read operations typically retrieve data from the underlying storage but do not modify it. By segregating these responsibilities, CQRS ensures that the application remains consistent, meaning that any changes made to the database result in identical queries returning updated results. This helps maintain data integrity and improves performance since reads can be served from precomputed caches rather than relying on slow database queries.

eBay's monolithic application used both write and read operations against its relational databases. When migrated to a microservices architecture, the need to manage multiple databases becomes apparent. To overcome this challenge, eBay implemented the CQRS pattern to break down the monolithic application into two completely decoupled services - Inventory Service and Sales Service. The Inventory Service manages product inventory information, while the Sales Service handles orders and related transactional information. These two services communicate with each other using Kafka messaging and share common views of the underlying data stored in PostgreSQL databases. This allows eBay to efficiently update and query various aspects of the application data without impacting each other.

## 2.3 Event Sourcing Pattern
Event sourcing is a design pattern used to record all changes to the state of an object in a sequence of events that are written to a log. An aggregate root captures the current state of an entity by replaying all the recorded events. This allows us to reconstruct the complete state of an entity at any given point in time, enabling us to take action based on past events rather than the current state alone. For example, if a user cancels an order, we may want to undo all the associated payment transactions performed earlier, which would require us to keep track of those events separately.

Similarly, in eBay's case, we could use event sourcing to capture all changes to the inventory and sales data entities and store them in Kafka topics. Since Kafka guarantees delivery of messages, storing the changes in a durable manner guarantees that they cannot be lost. Additionally, replaying the events can help restore the state of an entity to a previous version in case of a failure or corruption. Overall, event sourcing can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the application and offer new ways to optimize it.

# 3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤、数学公式讲解
The following sections will discuss in detail about how eBay transformed itself from a monolithic database-driven application to a distributed system consisting of microservices using Apache Kafka messaging framework. I will start by highlighting the steps taken to migrate the application and then explain the major issues faced during the migration and how they were resolved. Finally, I'll talk about some benefits gained by adopting microservices architecture, including better scalability, agility, flexibility, and resilience to failures.

Firstly, let's consider what challenges eBay had in migrating to microservices architecture.

1. **Data consistency:** During the transition period, many users might still access the monolithic application, causing conflicts between the different versions of the data being displayed simultaneously. To avoid this issue, eBay implemented the CQRS pattern to ensure that the writes to the databases are done in one place, while reads are handled by another service. 

2. **Scalability:** As the number of users increases, the monolithic application starts facing performance issues due to increased load and response times. Microservices allow eBay to scale each service independently, allowing greater flexibility in managing resources and addressing bottlenecks. 

3. **Performance:** One of the main reasons behind poor performance was that each request involved several calls to remote services leading to higher latencies and slower overall performance. To improve the overall performance, eBay used asynchronous programming techniques such as caching and batch processing. 

4. **Resiliency:** Similarly, as the number of users increases, the likelihood of encountering errors increases as well. While testing the application, eBay found several bugs and vulnerabilities that needed to be addressed urgently. To achieve high availability and resiliency, eBay used automated deployment strategies that constantly monitor and test the application. 

To address these challenges, eBay implemented microservices architecture using the below steps:

1. **Service decomposition:** Divide the application into small independent modules, known as “microservices”. Develop each module independently, ensuring that it follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). The goal is to create loosely coupled, modular, and self-contained services that can be deployed independently and scaled individually depending on the needs of the application. 

2. **API Gateway:** Implement an API gateway that acts as a single entry point for external clients. The API gateway serves as a reverse proxy server and routes incoming requests to appropriate backend microservices. Using an API gateway can simplify the development workflow and reduce the number of API endpoints required for the client. 

3. **Message bus:** Use a lightweight messaging framework like Apache Kafka to connect the services. Kafka is designed to support highly concurrent and scalable environments, making it ideal for microservices architectures. The idea is to have each service produce messages onto a dedicated Kafka topic and consume messages from other topics as necessary. 

4. **Messaging protocol:** Choose a messaging protocol that is easy to understand and implement. Typically, RESTful web services or RPC are used for interservice communication. Some popular options include gRPC, Apache Avro, Thrift, and MessagePack. 

5. **Monitoring:** Monitor the health of each service using tools like Prometheus and Grafana, which enable us to easily detect and troubleshoot issues. For instance, if a service fails to respond within a certain time frame, we can send alerts or restart the service automatically. 

6. **Logging:** Store logs from each service in a centralized location for easier debugging. Also, make sure to tag every log with relevant metadata so that we can filter and analyze the logs later. 

After implementing these steps, eBay achieved the desired level of scalability, improved performance, and reduced errors. Below is a summary of some benefits gained by adopting microservices architecture:

**Better Scalability**: Services can now be independently scaled based on the amount of traffic and workload requirements, thus improving resource utilization and meeting compliance with scalability targets. Each service can be hosted on separate machines, containers, or clusters, further enhancing scalability.

**Agility**: Each service can be developed and released independently, reducing the risk of integration and dependency hell. New features and bug fixes can be rolled out quickly without affecting the rest of the system.

**Flexibility**: Adding new features or optimizing existing ones can be done faster and cheaper because of the modularity and autonomy provided by the microservices architecture.

**Resilience to Failures**: By developing independent services, eBay avoids the risks of shared infrastructure and interdependencies. If one service fails, it does not affect the other services, making the application more robust and resistant to failures.
