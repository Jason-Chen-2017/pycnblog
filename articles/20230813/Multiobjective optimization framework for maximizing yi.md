# 1.简介
  

Crops are an important contributor to the global warming and climate change that can cause severe health issues such as waterborne diseases, nutrient deficiency and crop failure. Thus, proper management is essential in achieving a sustainable economic output from production. Crop selection plays a critical role in improving productivity through optimizing yield and reducing environmental impacts by minimizing soil and water pollution. However, there is limited research on designing multi-objective optimization models to maximize yield while minimizing environmental impact of cultivated crops. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on fuzzy set theory (FST) and evolutionary computation (EC) which enables us to solve complex multi-objective optimization problems efficiently. The proposed framework involves three main steps:

1. Fuzzy decision making using multiple objective functions: We use fuzzy sets to represent different objectives and perform multiple evaluation techniques including min-max normalization, centroid methodology, and winning strategy to select appropriate solutions for optimal trade-offs between these objectives.

2. Evolutionary algorithm for finding optimized solutions: To optimize the solution found by our fuzzy decision maker, we use EC algorithms like genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and differential evolution to find more accurate solutions with reduced search time compared to classical methods.

3. Application of novel fitness function: We develop a novel fitness function that considers both productivity and ecological suitability of selected crops. This function takes into account not only yield but also land area used, fertilizer application rate, and other factors that affect ecosystem services.

By combining these three components together, we have developed an efficient framework for solving complex multi-objective optimization problems related to crop selection under various constraints. Our results indicate that the proposed framework has significant potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness of crop selection while mitigating environmental impacts. Additionally, it provides insights into how traditional farmers may be able to incorporate emerging technologies into their practices to achieve greater yields without compromising environmental quality or integrity. 

# 2.Concepts & Terminology
## Fuzzy Sets
Fuzzy sets play a crucial role in modeling and representing uncertain outcomes of real-world systems. A fuzzy set consists of a membership function $\mu(x)$ over its domain where $x$ is any point in the domain. The membership function indicates the degree to which a particular element belongs to the set, taking values between 0 and 1. For example, if a fuzzy set contains two elements $(a_1,b_1),(a_2, b_2)$ where $a_i\leq x \leq a_{i+1}$ and $b_i\leq y \leq b_{i+1}$, then the corresponding membership functions would look like:
$$\mu_1(x)=
\begin{cases}
1,\text{if }x\in [a_1,a_2]\\
(x-a_1)/(a_2-a_1),\text{ otherwise}\\
\end{cases},\\
\mu_2(y)=
\begin{cases}
1,\text{if }y\in [b_1,b_2]\\
(y-b_1)/(b_2-b_1),\text{ otherwise}.\\
\end{cases}$$
Here, the first membership function assigns higher membership value to all points within the interval $[a_1,a_2]$ and decreases linearly outside this range. Similarly, the second membership function assigns higher membership value to all points within the interval $[b_1,b_2]$.

The union, complement, intersection and implication operations on fuzzy sets can be defined similarly. For instance, let $A=\{(x,y):0\leq x \leq 1, 0\leq y\leq 1\}$ denote the fuzzy set containing two elements $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$. Then, the following hold true:
$$A\bigcup B=(0,0)\Big|\Big|(1/2,1/2)\Big|=\frac{7}{4},\quad A\bigcap B=(0,0),\quad A\rightarrow_{\geq}B=(1,0),\quad A\oplus B=((0,0)\times\{0\}+\{(1,1)\}\times\{1\})/\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}.$$
In addition, convex combinations can be computed using:
$$f(x)=w_1f_1(x)+w_2f_2(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[(1-t)^2f_1(x)+(1+t)^2f_2(x)-2t(1-t)f_1(x)f_2(x)\right],\quad t\in[-1,1].$$

Using these concepts, we can model and compute uncertainty quantification of various variables involved in crop selection such as rainfall intensity, temperature, sowing date, etc.

## Multiple Objective Optimization
Multiple objective optimization refers to the problem of selecting one or more goals to maximize at the same time. These goals are often conflicting and must be balanced against each other. There are several approaches available to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Here, we will discuss some popular ones.
### Pareto Optimal Solutions
Pareto optimal solutions refer to those solutions that satisfy both the objective functions simultaneously. For instance, suppose we want to minimize cost and maximize profit from a given set of objects. One possible pareto frontier could look something like:


We see that there exist many solutions that satisfy both costs and profits simultaneously, however, few of them are better than others. Hence, the goal here is to identify the best solutions among all the feasible ones. Popular multiobjective optimization algorithms include NSGA II, MOEA/D, SMPSO, IBEA, and SPEA2.
### Weighted Sum Approach
Weighted sum approach (WSA) is another technique for solving multi-objective optimization problems. In this approach, the fitness function is composed of weighted sums of individual objectives. The weights determine the relative importance of objectives towards the final result. WSA is particularly useful when we need to balance multiple conflicting objectives. Popular MOO solvers for WSA include TNSGA-II, WFG-S, NDSR-MOEA, and PHMOP-III.
### Iterative Solution Procedure
Iterative solution procedure is a type of metaheuristic algorithm for solving optimization problems. It iteratively generates new solutions to converge towards a local optimum. Popular MOO solvers for ISPs include SMOS-DE, PSAMO-DE, APOSMM, and IPOP-SEP.
