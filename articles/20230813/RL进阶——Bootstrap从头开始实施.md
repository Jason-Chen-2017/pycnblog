# 2.基本概念及术语介绍
## 2.1 RL概述
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that aims to build an intelligent system capable of learning from experience and adapting its behavior in response to new situations with the goal of achieving optimal results over time. It belongs to a class of artificial intelligence algorithms known as model-based reinforcement learning methods, which use dynamic programming to find the optimal policy for the agent given a model of the environment's dynamics and reward function. The basic idea behind RL is to learn by trial and error through interaction with the environment, so that it can make efficient decisions on what actions to take at any given moment based on its perceptions of the current state and its previous experiences. This process involves finding the right balance between exploration (of unexplored parts of the state space) and exploitation (of promising regions).

## 2.2 环境模型(Environment Model)
The environment model specifies how the agent interacts with the outside world, including the states, rewards, and transitions between them. For example, if we are designing an autonomous driving agent, then our environment might include the position, orientation, speed, acceleration, etc., of all objects in the surrounding environment, along with their interactions with other agents or obstacles. We need to develop an understanding of how these variables change over time to construct an accurate model of the environment. In some cases, such as games like Atari, we may be able to obtain an accurate model by collecting data directly from human players. However, this is usually expensive and impractical when dealing with complex real-world environments. Therefore, we often rely on simplified models or assumptions about the underlying structure of the environment to simplify the problem. For instance, we could assume that the environment is fully observable, meaning that we know everything there is to know about the current state without any extraneous information from external sources. Alternatively, we might assume that the action space is discrete, where each possible action corresponds to one of several predetermined behaviors. 

For most practical applications, however, we will need to create our own custom environment to capture the relevant aspects of the problem domain. Developing and maintaining reliable and effective models of the environment requires expertise in both physics and mathematical modeling, together with the ability to simulate and test the resulting systems. 

## 2.3 动作空间(Action Space)
The action space defines the set of allowed actions that the agent can take within the environment. In the case of autonomous driving, the action space might consist of accelerating forward, backward, left, or right, but also include commands to steer the car or perform maneuvers such as making tight turns or following traffic signals. For many tasks, the action space can have a large number of dimensions, such as a 7-dimensional continuous vector for control of a robotic arm or a 100-dimensional vector representing the preferences of millions of users across a website. In general, smaller action spaces tend to lead to faster convergence and better performance, while larger action spaces require more sophisticated strategies to keep up with ever-increasing complexity. 

In practice, researchers typically try out various architectures and hyperparameters in order to find the best tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, as well as ensuring that they do not waste resources exploring areas of the state space that they know to be useless or even harmful. There exist multiple techniques for optimizing the choice of action space, including constrained optimization, Bayesian optimization, grammar-based approaches, and reinforcement learning itself. 

## 2.4 状态空间(State Space)
The state space represents the entire range of possible observations that the agent receives from the environment. These observations comprise both the current perceived values of the physical quantities present in the environment (such as positions, velocities, angles, forces), as well as higher-level features that combine these quantities into abstract concepts (such as location and heading). In general, the size and complexity of the state space directly affects the amount of memory required by the agent, as well as the computational resources needed to represent and reason about it. A small state space leads to a simpler task, while a large state space requires additional processing power and storage capacity.

Again, in practice, the choice of state representation, feature engineering, and architecture play a crucial role in determining the final quality of the learned policies and the efficiency with which they can solve problems. Researchers have found that modern deep neural networks are particularly effective in learning complex representations from high-dimensional inputs like images or speech, and thus can greatly enhance the effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms in high-dimensional settings. 

## 2.5 奖励函数(Reward Function)
A reward function provides feedback to the agent regarding its successful completion of tasks within the environment. Unlike traditional supervised learning problems where the correct output labels are provided before training begins, reinforcement learning does not provide clear answers or objective measures of success and failure. Instead, the agent must learn to maximize long-term rewards obtained from interacting with the environment and receiving feedback on its performance. Reward functions can vary widely depending on the specific goals and constraints of the problem being solved, but some common examples include negative cumulative cost, sparsely rewarded tasks, positive feedback loops, and proximity-based prizes. Moreover, since reward signals don't always accurately reflect the desired effects of an action, researchers are actively working on developing methods for improving the reliability and interpretability of reward functions.

One way to measure the accuracy and robustness of a reward function is to compare it against a baseline that doesn't depend on it. One approach is to use Monte Carlo rollouts, where the agent runs a series of episodes in the environment using random actions and accumulates the total rewards collected during those episodes. If the average reward achieved by the agent is significantly lower than that of the baseline, then it suggests that the reward function may be too sparse or too biased towards certain outcomes. Similarly, a study comparing different versions of the same reward function can help identify redundancies or irrelevant details that cause suboptimal performance. 

## 2.6 策略(Policy)
The policy refers to the mechanism by which the agent selects actions in response to observed states. It determines what actions to take under what circumstances, i.e., what decision-making strategy to adopt. Different policies can address different types of decision making processes, ranging from simple rules-based policies that simply apply hard-coded responses to specific states and contexts, to more complex hierarchical policies that consider long-term goals and plan ahead. The exact formulation of a particular policy depends on the nature of the environment and the intended purpose of the agent. Common choices include probabilistic policies that map states to probabilities of selecting each possible action, deterministic policies that choose only one action based on local conditions, and value functions that estimate expected future rewards given a state and action. 

The choice of policy architecture and parameters can have significant impacts on the overall performance of the agent. As mentioned earlier, advanced deep neural network architectures such as convolutional networks, recursive neural networks, and Q-learning-style policies have been shown to achieve improved performance in many challenging tasks. Additionally, recent work has focused on incorporating prior knowledge into policy search using curiosity-driven exploration and imitation learning. 

## 2.7 价值函数(Value Function)
The value function represents the level of estimated utility or reward that the agent expects to accumulate over time by taking a particular action in a given state. Value functions enable the agent to determine the relative importance of different states and actions by evaluating the potential payoffs for each option. By contrast, a purely statistical viewpoint treats the value function as a random variable that follows a Markovian distribution and relies entirely on samples to compute estimates. Despite this distinction, value functions are commonly used to guide reinforcement learning algorithms in deciding which actions to explore next and prioritize among potentially beneficial options.

Moreover, value functions can be thought of as analogous to credit assignment mechanisms in reinforcement learning, as they establish a numerical comparison between the agent's beliefs about the state and the outcome of selected actions. Since the agent cannot observe the true state of the world until after taking an action, it uses the value function to infer the likelihood that the chosen action would result in a better outcome than others, leading to greater trust in its decision-making process. Importantly, because value functions are updated online, the agent can adapt its behavior over time to minimize the risk of getting trapped in local minima and maximizing the long-term returns instead.

## 2.8 动态规划(Dynamic Programming)
Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm used in reinforcement learning to calculate optimal policies. DP consists of breaking down complex problems into smaller subproblems and solving them independently, storing the solutions to avoid redundant computations, and combining the solutions to solve the original problem. In contrast to classic linear programming techniques, DP avoids building the entire solution matrix explicitly, which makes it scalable to large state and action spaces. While many modern RL algorithms involve a combination of DP and other methods, DP remains central to many techniques. 

## 2.9 模型free算法(Model-Free Algorithms)
Model-free algorithms refer to reinforcement learning algorithms that do not rely on explicit models of the environment or its dynamics. Instead, they learn policies directly from raw observations and interact with the environment via simulations or through noisy sensors. This property makes model-free algorithms ideal for real-world applications, where accurate and precise models are difficult to engineer or collect. Examples of model-free RL algorithms include Q-learning, SARSA, actor-critic, and various variants of DQN. Although they have emerged as dominant approaches, model-free algorithms still enjoy widespread popularity due to their simplicity, stability, and ease of parallelization compared to model-based algorithms.

## 2.10 蒙特卡罗方法(Monte Carlo Methods)
Monte Carlo methods are a family of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms that use simulated episodes to estimate the value of state-action pairs. The basic idea is to run an infinite number of episodes, performing random policy selections and recording the sum of rewards experienced during each episode. Once all episodes have completed, the algorithm computes the empirical mean and variance of the accumulated rewards, which approximate the true value function for each state-action pair. As a result, MC methods converge quickly to the true value function, although they have a high degree of bias due to random fluctuations in the sample means and variances. However, MC methods are highly sample-efficient and fast, making them useful for large state spaces and short episode lengths. Examples of popular MC methods include vanilla PG, weighted PG, NPG, and TRPO.  

## 2.11 时序差分学习(Temporal-Difference Learning)
Temporal-difference learning (TD) refers to a model-free reinforcement learning method that updates the agent's estimate of the value of a state based on its actual observation, rather than attempting to predict the future based on past experience. TD methods differ from MC methods in that they update the value estimates iteratively, rather than waiting till the end of an episode. This allows TD methods to handle large action spaces and receive feedback more frequently, but at the cost of slower convergence rates and requiring less memory than MC methods. Popular TD methods include Q-learning, Sarsa, and Expected Sarsa.

## 2.12 策略梯度下降(Policy Gradient)
Policy gradient methods leverage ideas from deep reinforcement learning to train an agent by updating its parameterized policy to increase expected returns. Policy gradients are a natural extension of standard supervised learning techniques to reinforcement learning, enabling us to optimize a stochastic policy that maps states to probability distributions over actions. Training in policy gradient methods is typically done using stochastic gradient ascent, where we backpropagate the logarithmic gradients of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters, calculated by running the policy in a simulator/environment and approximating the corresponding advantage estimates. Because policy gradient methods are essentially gradient descent methods applied to a stochastic objective function, they are particularly suitable for handling high-dimensional action spaces and slowly varying returns. Common examples of policy gradient methods include REINFORCE, PPO, and DDPG. 

## 2.13 目标奖励估计(Empowerment)
Empowerment refers to a concept in reinforcement learning where the agent learns to select actions that contribute positively to its long-term goals. Specifically, the agent is trained to select actions that lead to improvement in the agent's internal goal score, defined as a metric that considers both immediate and longer-term rewards. Empowerment can significantly improve the rate of convergence and sample efficiency of agent policies in domains where the goal is non-stationary and changes over time. Popular implementations of empowerment-based methods include Curiosity-driven Exploration (C51), Deep-Curiosity-Network (DCN), and GAIL. 

## 2.14 激励函数的细节(Details of the Reward Function)
The reward function plays a critical role in shaping the trajectory taken by the agent and guiding its decision-making process. Many researchers have proposed novel forms of reward functions to deal with a variety of challenges in reinforcement learning, such as sparse rewards, delayed rewards, intrinsic motivation, off-policy correction, and diverse trajectories. Here are some tips for creating effective reward functions:

1. Make rewards sparse: Sparse rewards signal that the agent should focus on obtaining few rewards early on in the game and progress gradually over subsequent steps. 

2. Delay rewards: Delays encourage the agent to act greedily initially, allowing it to build up experience and gather momentum over time. 

3. Intrinsically motivated: Intrinsically motivated agents learn to complete tasks by maximizing the pleasure or engagement of a virtual environment, such as completing missions or navigating mazes. 

4. Off-policy correction: On-policy learning algorithms typically learn from data generated using the latest version of the policy, leading to catastrophic forgetting when combined with outdated policies. To mitigate this issue, off-policy correction algorithms attempt to adjust the policy to match the distribution of data sampled from another, older policy. 

5. Diverse trajectories: Diverse trajectories challenge the agent to explore different parts of the state space and develop a diverse set of skills and preferences. To achieve this, the reward function should be designed to encourage the agent to visit rare yet interesting states or act in ways that complement its existing skillset.
