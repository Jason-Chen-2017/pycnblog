# 1.背景介绍


近年来随着人工智能、大数据和云计算的普及，人们对“AI+”领域的研究越来越多，而且越来越火爆。而超导计算作为一种超级计算设备，也逐渐受到科技界的重视，由于其高性能、高性价比等特点，已经成为当下最热门的科技领域之一。

在超导计算领域中，量子信息是量子计算的关键所在。量子信息可以用来编码和存储信息、传输信息、制造新型机器、干扰物质等，而量子计算则是运用量子技术解决复杂问题的重要方法论。量子计算的相关研究一直是计算机科学的一项热点，尤其是在人工智能、自然语言处理、生物信息等领域都有很大的应用。

从20世纪70年代起，量子计算迎来了它的黄金时期，并且取得了极大的成果，但同时也面临着许多挑战。比如从理论到实践的转变过程较长，缺乏严格的数学模型，导致实验验证困难，尤其是在现阶段对于大规模超导量子计算尚无理论支持。

另外，超导设备中的某些材料在传导过程中存在局部相位差异，这些偏差会导致计算结果出现错误，从而无法真正实现量子计算。因此，如何通过改进传导结构来优化超导量子计算，成为目前研究的热点。

而在此背景下，以《量子物理前沿》杂志社主办的量子学术研讨会上，华南理工大学物理学院长李德龙教授作为嘉宾应邀做客了量子信息和量子计算领域的顶级学术机构。他通过自己的专业知识，深入浅出地介绍了量子计算领域的最新进展。

在本次研讨会上，李德龙老师从理论基础、经典算法与新算法、量子计算平台的选择、量子计算机和量子网络的设计、量子计算中的硬件/软件问题、量子计算领域的技术创新等多个角度详细阐述了超导量子计算的理论基础、原理、技术路线和未来的发展方向。

# 2.核心概念与联系
## 2.1 概念与定义
### （1）量子
Quantum mechanics (QM) is a mathematical theory of the behavior of matter at large scales. It describes the laws of quantum physics that include elementary particles and interactions between them. QM involves concepts such as quantum states, quantum systems, operators, and transformations between these objects. Quantum computing is an area of computer science and technology that uses quantum mechanical techniques to perform computations using qubits or other quantum information-carrying structures rather than classical bits and binary instructions.

### （2）量子态(State)
A state in quantum mechanics is defined as a complete set of properties of a physical system—such as position and momentum for a particle—that can be described by degrees of freedom. In terms of a quantum system, this means that it consists of two parts: the wave function describing its probabilities, and the corresponding probability distribution over all possible basis configurations. The probability distribution completely characterizes the system's state and gives us information about how the system behaves under certain conditions.

### （3）量子叠加态(Superposition State)
In quantum mechanics, a superposition state refers to a combination of multiple quantum states with varying amplitudes or probabilities, making up what is sometimes called a "wavefunction." These combinations are typically denoted by ket notation, which represents each component of the wavefunction as a column vector. By combining different components of the wavefunction into superpositions, we can create new, more complex quantum states that cannot be achieved otherwise. Superposition states have important applications in quantum chemistry and in various fields where we need to describe complex molecules or physical processes through a limited number of uncorrelated electrons.

### （4）量子门(Gate)
A gate in quantum mechanics is a unit operation that changes one quantum state to another. The term "gate" is often used interchangeably with "operator," but they are actually quite different things. An operator describes the effect of applying it on some quantity; it does not change the state itself. On the other hand, a gate defines the behavior of a quantum system by acting on one or several qubits, changing their state. Gates can also manipulate the phase of the quantum state, thereby changing its overall energy level. Examples of gates include Pauli spin gates, CNOT gates, and swap gates.

### （5）量子纠缠(Entanglement)
In quantum mechanics, entanglement refers to the phenomenon where quantum particles behave in ways that violate the no-cloning theorem (i.e., clones of identical particles do not behave identically). This occurs because the particles possess correlations between them that allow them to interact without being measured separately beforehand. As a result, a measurement may give rise to correlated results instead of truly independent ones, leading to spurious conclusions when attempting to separate the original particles. Entangled states are commonly encountered in many areas of quantum computing, including quantum communication protocols and quantum algorithms for searching large databases.

### （6）量子通信(Quantum Communication)
Quantum communications refers to the use of quantum effects to establish and maintain long-distance quantum links. One common application of quantum communications is quantum teleportation, where entangled photons are used to transmit quantum information between distant locations. Another example of quantum communications is quantum key distribution, where secure encryption keys are shared between multiple parties via entangled qubits. In both cases, entangled states are required to transfer arbitrary information quickly and reliably, paving the way towards practical quantum internet connectivity.

### （7）量子计算(Quantum Computing)
Quantum computing refers to the use of quantum mechanical principles to solve problems in quantum information processing and simulation. The goal of quantum computing is to explore the implications of quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement in computation. While traditional computers rely on transistors to store and process data, quantum computers could potentially break down traditional computer architectures and enable the generation of higher-level computational structures. Quantum computing has already been used to develop theoretically sound models for molecular simulations, real-world applications in finance, biology, and quantum chemistry, and technological advancements in quantum devices have accelerated the development of novel technologies like photonic quantum computers and superconducting quantum tunnelling.

### （8）量子比特(Qubit)
A qubit is a quantum information-carrying structure consisting of three subsystems: the environment, the quantum bit, and the control electrons or microwave radiation. They differ from regular bits by allowing quantum states to occupy either the |0⟩ or |1⟩ eigenstate, giving them properties such as superposition and entanglement. Unlike classical bits, qubits can be manipulated and transformed according to quantum logic gates. Qubits are central to modern quantum computing, providing powerful tools for logical operations, error correction codes, and machine learning tasks.

### （9）超导量子计算(Superconducting Quantum Computation)
Superconducting quantum computation refers to the ability of materials such as metals to conduct electricity within themselves without relying on external power sources. Accordingly, quantum circuits designed specifically for superconducting devices exhibit unique advantages compared to standard analog computers. However, the concept of "superconductivity" is somewhat misleading, since most superconducting materials are non-linear resonators that cannot conduct electricity precisely. Instead, superconducting quantum computation relies on a family of simpler ideas known as topological phases, which depend only on the topology of the device and do not require any specific material properties beyond charging and discharging rates. Despite these limitations, superconducting quantum computers promise significant advances in performance and scalability due to their low costs and high throughput.

## 2.2 相关概念之间的联系
**量子态和量子比特的关系**：一个量子比特只能处于两个不同的量子态（|0>或|1>），这就是量子比特的定义。而超导量子计算是利用量子比特实现的，所谓的量子态就是由量子比特构成的空间里的一个点所对应的值。不同的是，超导量子计算并不需要将每一个量子比特的电子调动到不同的状态，所以不存在量子态之间的切换。比如，|0000>既可以表示量子态A，也可以表示量子态B，不能表示其他任何量子态。换句话说，超导量子计算中不存在量子态的切换。

**超导量子计算和经典计算机的区别**：超导量子计算是利用量子力学来描述并执行实际计算任务的，也就是通过构建具有奇异性的物理系统来实现量子逻辑上的运算功能，并使得物理系统内的量子态演化到一定精确度。而超导量子计算提出的理论基础是超导体物理和量子场论，与经典计算机是截然不同的两个领域。尽管经典计算机可以在类比电路的帮助下实现基本的逻辑运算，但它毕竟是一个集成电路的集合，其运算能力仍然远远不及超导量子计算系统的强大。相反，经典计算机在进行复杂的计算任务时，往往依赖于其中的存储器、运算单元等软硬件，因此其运算速度较慢且耗费巨大。超导量子计算系统则是利用已知的无序纠缠效应来实现高度可控的量子信息传输和计算。超导量子计算系统的性能有限，无法用于处理复杂的计算任务。

超导量子计算的重要意义就在于，它摆脱了经典计算机只能处理线性逻辑的问题限制，允许利用超导量子技术实现非线性逻辑功能。借助超导量子技术，能够让我们寻求更高的计算性能、利用率和速度。
