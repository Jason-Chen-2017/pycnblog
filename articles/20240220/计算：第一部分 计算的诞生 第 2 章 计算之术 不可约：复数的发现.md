## 1. Background Introduction

The history of mathematics has been a long and fascinating journey of discovery, invention, and exploration. Throughout this journey, the concept of numbers has evolved significantly. Initially, the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) sufficed for basic counting and measurement tasks. However, as mathematical concepts expanded and new challenges arose, the need to extend the number system became apparent. In ancient civilizations such as Egypt and Babylon, mathematicians developed fractional numbers to handle ratios and proportions. Later, the Greeks introduced irrational numbers to represent lengths and areas that could not be expressed as rational numbers. Despite these advances, there was still no systematic way to deal with negative quantities or square roots of negative numbers. This led to the birth of complex numbers, an extension of real numbers that includes the imaginary unit i, defined as the square root of -1.

### 1.1. A brief history of complex numbers

Complex numbers were first hinted at in the works of ancient mathematicians like Heron of Alexandria and Diophantus, who explored expressions involving square roots of negative numbers. However, it wasn't until the 16th century that Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano explicitly introduced complex numbers while solving cubic equations. His contemporary Rafael Bombelli further formalized the concept and provided rules for manipulating complex numbers. Since then, complex numbers have found numerous applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and even art and music.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

To understand complex numbers, we must first introduce some core concepts and their connections to previously established number systems.

### 2.1. Real numbers and the extended real number line

Real numbers are those that can be represented on an infinitely long number line. They include both rational and irrational numbers. Extending the real number line by adding two symbols, +∞ and -∞, results in the extended real number line, which allows us to handle limits, suprema, and infima more rigorously.

### 2.2. Imaginary numbers and the imaginary unit

Imaginary numbers are those that cannot be represented on the real number line but can be associated with points on a perpendicular axis. The imaginary unit i is defined as the square root of -1, implying that i^2 = -1. Imaginary numbers have the form ai, where a is a real number.

### 2.3. Complex numbers and their representation

A complex number z is represented in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit. Geometrically, complex numbers can be visualized as points on a two-dimensional plane called the complex plane, with the real part along the horizontal axis and the imaginary part along the vertical axis. Algebraically, complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided using rules similar to those for real numbers.

## 3. Core Algorithm Principle and Specific Operational Steps, Mathematical Model Formulas

We will now discuss the fundamental principles and specific operational steps involved in performing arithmetic operations on complex numbers, as well as provide the corresponding mathematical model formulas.

### 3.1. Addition and subtraction

Adding or subtracting complex numbers involves combining their real and imaginary parts separately. Given two complex numbers z1 = a1 + b1i and z2 = a2 + b2i, their sum and difference are calculated as follows:

z1 + z2 = (a1 + a2) + (b1 + b2)i

z1 - z2 = (a1 - a2) + (b1 - b2)i

### 3.2. Multiplication

Multiplication of complex numbers requires applying the distributive property, conjugate multiplication, and the definition of the imaginary unit. For two complex numbers z1 and z2, their product is calculated as:

z1 \* z2 = (a1a2 - b1b2) + (a1b2 + a2b1)i

### 3.3. Division

Division of complex numbers involves multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the imaginary part from the denominator. For two complex numbers z1 and z2, their quotient is calculated as:

z1 / z2 = ((a1a2 + b1b2) / (a2^2 + b2^2)) + ((b1a2 - a1b2) / (a2^2 + b2^2))i

### 3.4. Modulus and argument

The modulus (magnitude or absolute value) of a complex number z = a + bi is given by |z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), representing its distance from the origin in the complex plane. The argument (angle) of a complex number z is given by arg(z) = atan(b/a), representing the angle formed between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin to the point z in the complex plane.

## 4. Best Practices: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

Here, we present Python code examples for calculating basic arithmetic operations and modulus/argument of complex numbers.

### 4.1. Arithmetic operations

```python
# Define complex numbers
z1 = 3 + 2j
z2 = 1 - 5j

# Addition
sum_z = z1 + z2
print("Sum:", sum_z)

# Subtraction
diff_z = z1 - z2
print("Difference:", diff_z)

# Multiplication
mul_z = z1 * z2
print("Product:", mul_z)

# Division
div_z = z1 / z2
print("Quotient:", div_z)
```

### 4.2. Modulus and argument

```python
import cmath

# Define complex number
z = 4 + 3j

# Calculate modulus and argument
mod_z = abs(z)
arg_z = cmath.phase(z)

print("Modulus (magnitude):", mod_z)
print("Argument (angle):", arg_z)
```
