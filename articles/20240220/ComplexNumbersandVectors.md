## Background Introduction

### What are complex numbers?

Complex numbers are a mathematical concept that extend the real numbers by adding an imaginary component. An imaginary number is a multiple of the square root of -1, denoted as i. Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part, represented as a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.

### What are vectors?

Vectors are mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction. They can be represented as an arrow with a specified length and direction in a coordinate system. Vectors can be added, subtracted, and scaled, making them useful for representing quantities such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration.

### The relationship between complex numbers and vectors

Complex numbers and vectors are related concepts in mathematics. A complex number can be interpreted as a vector in the complex plane, where the real part is the x-coordinate and the imaginary part is the y-coordinate. This interpretation allows us to apply vector operations to complex numbers, such as addition and multiplication.

## Core Concepts and Connections

### Complex numbers

A complex number is a mathematical object that consists of a real part and an imaginary part, represented as a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of -1.

#### Real and imaginary parts

The real part of a complex number is the coefficient of the real number, and the imaginary part is the coefficient of the imaginary number. For example, in the complex number 3 + 4i, the real part is 3 and the imaginary part is 4.

#### Imaginary unit

The imaginary unit, denoted as i, is defined as the square root of -1. It is used to represent the imaginary part of a complex number.

#### Complex conjugate

The complex conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. It is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part.

#### Modulus (absolute value)

The modulus (or absolute value) of a complex number a + bi is the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts, denoted as |a + bi| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). It represents the distance from the origin to the point in the complex plane.

#### Argument (angle)

The argument (or angle) of a complex number a + bi is the angle between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin to the point in the complex plane, measured counterclockwise. It is denoted as arg(a + bi) and is related to the modulus and the real and imaginary parts through the formula tan^-1(b/a).

### Vectors

A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. It can be represented as an arrow with a specified length and direction in a coordinate system.

#### Magnitude (length)

The magnitude (or length) of a vector is the length of the arrow in the coordinate system. It is a non-negative scalar quantity.

#### Direction

The direction of a vector is the orientation of the arrow in the coordinate system. It can be represented by the angles between the vector and the coordinate axes.

#### Vector addition

Vector addition is the operation of combining two vectors to obtain a third vector, called their resultant. It is performed geometrically by placing the tail of one vector at the tip of the other and drawing the resultant vector from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector.

#### Scalar multiplication

Scalar multiplication is the operation of multiplying a vector by a scalar (real number) to obtain a new vector with the same direction but different magnitude.

#### Dot product

The dot product (or scalar product) of two vectors is a scalar quantity that measures their similarity or orthogonality. It is defined as the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them.

#### Cross product

The cross product (or vector product) of two vectors is a vector quantity that measures their perpendicularity and orientation. It is defined as the vector product of their magnitudes and the sine of the angle between them.

## Core Algorithms and Operations

### Addition and subtraction of complex numbers

Addition and subtraction of complex numbers are performed componentwise, using the following formulas:

(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
(a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i

### Multiplication and division of complex numbers

Multiplication and division of complex numbers are performed using the distributive property and the following formulas:

(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
(a + bi)/(c + di) = ((ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i)/(c^2 + d^2)

### Rotation of complex numbers

Rotation of complex numbers is performed by multiplying them by a complex number of unit modulus with the desired rotation angle. The rotation formula is:

z' = z \* e^(ik),

where z is the original complex number, k is the rotation angle, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.

### Addition and subtraction of vectors

Addition and subtraction of vectors are performed geometrically by placing the tail of one vector at the tip of the other and drawing the resultant vector from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector. They can also be performed algebraically by adding or subtracting their components.

### Scalar multiplication of vectors

Scalar multiplication of vectors is performed by multiplying each component of the vector by the scalar. The resulting vector has the same direction as the original vector but a different magnitude.

### Dot product of vectors

The dot product of two vectors is a scalar quantity that measures their similarity or orthogonality. It is defined as the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. The dot product formula is:

a \* b = ||a|| ||b|| cos(θ)

where a and b are the vectors, ||a|| and ||b|| are their magnitudes, and θ is the angle between them.

### Cross product of vectors

The cross product (or vector product) of two vectors is a vector quantity that measures their perpendicularity and orientation. It is defined as the vector product of their magnitudes and the sine of the angle between them. The cross product formula is:

a x b = ||a|| ||b|| sin(θ) n

where a and b are the vectors, ||a|| and ||b|| are their magnitudes, θ is the angle between them, and n is the unit normal vector perpendicular to the plane of a and b.
