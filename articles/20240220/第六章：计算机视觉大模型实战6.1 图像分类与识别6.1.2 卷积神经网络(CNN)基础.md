### 6.1.1 Background Introduction

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. With the rapid development of deep learning, computer vision technology has made great progress in recent years, widely used in autonomous driving, facial recognition, medical imaging diagnosis, virtual reality, augmented reality, robot vision, etc. Among many computer vision tasks, image classification and recognition are one of the most basic and important applications.

In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of image classification and recognition, researchers have proposed various algorithms and models, among which convolutional neural networks (CNN) are one of the most successful and widely used models. CNN can effectively extract features from images, reduce dimensionality, and improve the robustness of the model. This article will introduce the basic principles and practices of CNN for image classification and recognition.

### 6.1.2 Core Concepts and Relationships

To better understand CNN, we first need to clarify some related concepts.

#### 6.1.2.1 Images and Pixels

An image is a two-dimensional matrix composed of pixels. A pixel is the smallest unit of an image, representing the color value of a point in the image. In grayscale images, each pixel represents a brightness value ranging from 0 to 255. In color images, each pixel consists of three color components: red, green, and blue (RGB), with values ranging from 0 to 255 for each component.

#### 6.1.2.2 Feature Extraction

Feature extraction is the process of selecting or transforming original data into feature vectors that are more representative of the data's characteristics. The purpose of feature extraction is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the essential information, making it easier for subsequent analysis and processing. In image classification and recognition, feature extraction refers to converting raw image data into feature vectors that describe the image's texture, shape, color, and other attributes.

#### 6.1.2.3 Convolution Operation

Convolution operation is a mathematical operation commonly used in signal processing, image processing, and deep learning. It is a sliding dot product between two functions: one is the input function (such as an image) and the other is the kernel function (also called filter or window). The result of the convolution operation is a new function that describes the local characteristics of the input function.

#### 6.1.2.4 Activation Function

Activation function is a nonlinear function applied to the output of neurons in neural networks. Its role is to introduce nonlinearity into the model, allowing the network to fit complex mapping relationships between inputs and outputs. Common activation functions include Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and its variants.

#### 6.1.2.5 Pooling Operation

Pooling operation is a downsampling method used to reduce the spatial size of feature maps and prevent overfitting. It includes maximum pooling, average pooling, and other forms. The pooling operation slides along the feature map and selects the maximum or average value within a small region, reducing the resolution of the feature map and increasing the robustness of the model.

#### 6.1.2.6 Fully Connected Layer

The fully connected layer (FC layer) is a traditional neural network layer where each neuron connects to all neurons in the previous layer. It is responsible for integrating the global features extracted by the convolutional layers and predicting the final output based on these features.

### 6.1.3 Core Algorithms, Principles, and Specific Operations

Based on the above concepts, we can now explain the core algorithm of CNN in detail.

#### 6.1.3.1 Convolutional Layer

The convolutional layer is the core building block of CNN. It performs the convolution operation on the input feature map using multiple filters, generating new feature maps that highlight different aspects of the input data. The formula for the convolution operation is as follows:

$$
y[i, j] = \sum\_{m}\sum\_{n}w[m, n] \cdot x[i+m, j+n] + b
$$

where $x$ is the input feature map, $w$ is the filter, $b$ is the bias term, and $y$ is the output feature map.

The convolutional layer usually contains multiple filters, each corresponding to a different aspect of the input data. After the convolution operation, the output feature map may contain negative values due to the subtraction operation. To ensure that the output values are non-negative, we often apply a nonlinear activation function to the output feature map.

#### 6.1.3.2 Pooling Layer

The pooling layer follows the convolutional layer to perform downsampling on the output feature map. The pooling operation reduces the spatial size of the feature map while preserving its most critical information. By doing so, it not only prevents overfitting but also reduces the computational complexity of the network.

There are two main types of pooling operations: maximum pooling and average pooling. Maximum pooling selects the maximum value within a small region, emphasizing the most significant feature. Average pooling calculates the average value within a small region, providing a more stable representation.

#### 6.1.3.3 Fully Connected Layer

The fully connected layer integrates the global features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers and predicts the final output based on these features. Each neuron in the FC layer connects to all neurons in the previous layer, forming a dense connection pattern. The output of the FC layer is a probability distribution over all possible categories, which can be obtained by applying the softmax function to the linear transformation of the input features.

### 6.1.4 Best Practices: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

To better understand how CNN works in practice, let's look at a simple example using the Keras library. We will use the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a basic CNN model for image classification.

#### 6.1.4.1 Dataset Preparation

First, we need to load the CIFAR-10 dataset and preprocess it. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images of size 32 × 32 pixels, with 10 categories. We randomly split the dataset into training and validation sets, with a ratio of 4:1.
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

# Split dataset into training and validation sets
val_images = train_images[:10000]
partial_train_images = train_images[10000:]
val_labels = train_labels[:10000]
partial_train_labels = train_labels[10000:]

# Define batch size and buffer size
batch_size = 32
buffer_size = 10000

# Create data generators for training and validation
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((partial_train_images, partial_train_labels))
train_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(buffer_size).batch(batch_size).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
val_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((val_images, val_labels))
val_dataset = val_dataset.batch(batch_size)
```
#### 6.1.4.2 Model Architecture

Next, we define the CNN model architecture. Our model consists of three convolutional layers, followed by three pooling layers, and one fully connected layer. We use the ReLU activation function after each convolutional layer and the softmax activation function after the fully connected layer.
```python
model = models.Sequential([
   layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
   layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
   layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
   layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
   layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
   layers.Flatten(),
   layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
   layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
#### 6.1.4.3 Model Training

Finally, we train the model using the Adam optimizer and the categorical crossentropy loss function. We set the number of epochs to 20 and the learning rate to 0.001.
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
             loss=tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
             metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=20, validation_data=val_dataset)
```
