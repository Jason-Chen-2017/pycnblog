==============================

作者：禅与计算机程序设计艺术

## 1. 背景介绍

### 1.1. MyBatis简介

MyBatis是一款优秀的持久层框架，它支持定制化 SQL、存储过程以及高级映射。MyBatis 避免了几乎所有的 JDBC 代码和手动设置参数以及获取结果集。MyBatis 可以使用简单的 XML 或注解来配置和映射原生点<?> 类型，也可以完全定制化每一个 SQL 标签和函数。MyBatis 中的映射器接口只需要继承基本的 Mapper 接口，然后就可以被任意扩展。 Furthermore, under the covers, MyBatis generates dynamic proxies for you.

### 1.2. 数据库引擎与存储引擎

在讨论 MyBatis 的数据库引擎与存储引擎之前，我们首先需要了解什么是数据库引擎和存储引擎。

- **数据库引擎**（Database Engine）：它是负责管理和维护数据库对象（如表、索引、视图等）的数据库 software module。其主要功能是处理数据库查询和修改操作，并且负责事务管理和并发控制。InnoDB 和 MyISAM 是 MySQL 数据库的两种常见的数据库引擎。
- **存储引擎**（Storage Engine）：它是负责将数据库对象的数据存储到底层 storage media 上的 software module。其主要功能是提供数据 persistence 和 retrieval 服务，并且支持 various types of storage media，such as disk, tape, and flash memory。InnoDB 和 MyISAM 同时也是 MySQL 数据库的两种常见的存储引擎。

从上述定义可以看出，数据库引擎和存储引擎 although closely related are actually two different things. In fact, a database engine can support multiple storage engines, and vice versa. For example, MySQL supports both InnoDB and MyISAM storage engines, while PostgreSQL supports both PostgreSQL and MongoDB storage engines.

In the context of MyBatis, we are more interested in the storage engine rather than the database engine, because MyBatis is a persistence framework that deals with data storage and retrieval at the application level, rather than at the database level.

### 1.3. MyBatis storage engine

MyBatis provides several storage engine options to choose from, depending on your specific requirements and constraints. The following table summarizes the main features and tradeoffs of each storage engine:

| Storage Engine | Description | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MapDB | A fast and efficient Java collections library with built-in serialization and disk storage. It supports various indexing strategies and concurrency models. | - Easy to use<br>- Fast and memory-efficient<br>- Flexible and customizable | - Limited scalability due to single-writer design<br>- No support for transactions or ACID properties<br>- No support for distributed storage or clustering |
| RocksDB | A high-performance embedded key-value store based on LSM trees. It supports various compression algorithms and bloom filters for efficient data access. | - Fast and reliable<br>- Scalable and fault-tolerant<br>- Support for transactions and ACID properties | - Complex configuration and management<br>- Requires careful tuning for optimal performance<br>- May consume significant resources (CPU, memory, disk) |
| H2 | A lightweight relational database management system written in Java. It supports various SQL dialects and data types, as well as JDBC and ODBC interfaces. | - Easy to deploy and manage<br>- Supports SQL and ACID properties<br>- Compatible with various programming languages and frameworks | - Limited scalability and concurrency<br>- May not perform well under heavy load or complex queries<br>- May require additional configuration and tuning |
| Derby | A small and self-contained relational database management system written in Java. It supports various SQL dialects and data types, as well as JDBC and ODBC interfaces. | - Easy to deploy and manage<br>- Supports SQL and ACID properties<br>- Compatible with various programming languages and frameworks | - Limited scalability and concurrency<br>- May not perform well under heavy load or complex queries<br>- May require additional configuration and tuning |

The choice of storage engine depends on various factors, such as the size and complexity of the data, the expected query and update patterns, the available resources and constraints, and the desired performance and scalability goals.

In this article, we will focus on the MapDB storage engine, which is the default storage engine for MyBatis.

## 2. 核心概念与联系

### 2.1. MyBatis data model

MyBatis uses a simple yet powerful data model to represent the mapping between the application domain objects and the underlying storage media. The main components of the data model are:

- **Mapper interface**: An interface that defines the operations on the data, such as query, insert, update, and delete. Each operation corresponds to a SQL statement that operates on one or more tables. The mapper interface typically extends the `org.apache.ibatis.session.SqlSession` interface, which provides the basic methods for executing SQL statements.
- **Mapper XML file**: An XML file that contains the SQL statements corresponding to the operations defined in the mapper interface. Each SQL statement consists of a unique identifier, a SQL command type (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), a parameter map, and a result map. The parameter map specifies how to map the input parameters to the SQL syntax, while the result map specifies how to map the output columns to the application domain objects.
- **Database connection**: A connection to the database that provides the physical access to the storage media. MyBatis uses the standard JDBC API to connect to the database and execute SQL statements.
- **Session**: A session represents a logical unit of work that involves one or more operations on the data. A session encapsulates the database connection and provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with the data. A session is created by calling the `SqlSessionFactory.openSession()` method, which returns an instance of the `org.apache.ibatis.session.SqlSession` class.

### 2.2. MapDB data model

MapDB is a Java collections library that provides various in-memory and on-disk data structures, such as maps, sets, lists, and queues. MapDB uses its own storage format and does not rely on any external libraries or frameworks. MapDB supports various indexing strategies and concurrency models, making it suitable for different use cases and scenarios.

The main components of the MapDB data model are:

- **Database**: A logical container for the data that can be stored in-memory or on-disk. A database can have multiple tables, each representing a collection of related data.
- **Table**: A collection of data that shares the same schema and indexing strategy. A table can be created, modified, and deleted dynamically at runtime.
- **Record**: A unit of data that has a unique key and a set of attributes. A record can be inserted, updated, or deleted individually or collectively.
- **Index**: A data structure that enables fast lookup and retrieval of records based on certain criteria. MapDB supports various indexing strategies, such as hash index, tree index, and bitmap index.

### 2.3. MyBatis-MapDB integration

MyBatis integrates with MapDB by providing a custom storage engine implementation that maps the MyBatis data model to the MapDB data model. The MyBatis-MapDB integration consists of two main classes:

- **MapDBTypeHandler**: A type handler that converts the MyBatis data types (such as strings, integers, and dates) to the MapDB data types (such as text, number, and timestamp). The MapDBTypeHandler also provides various methods for serializing and deserializing the data using the MapDB serialization format.
- **MapDBCache**: A cache implementation that stores the MyBatis data in a MapDB database. The MapDBCache provides various methods for creating, modifying, and deleting the data, as well as for managing the cache eviction policies and expiration times.

By using the MapDB storage engine, MyBatis can benefit from the fast and efficient data storage and retrieval provided by MapDB, as well as from the flexible and customizable indexing strategies and concurrency models supported by MapDB.

## 3. 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

The core algorithm of the MapDB storage engine is based on the LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) architecture, which is a popular and efficient data structure for managing large-scale key-value stores. The LSM architecture combines the advantages of both the log-based and the tree-based approaches, providing high write throughput and low read latency.

The LSM architecture consists of three main components:

- **MemTable**: An in-memory data structure that stores the recent updates and modifications to the data. A MemTable typically uses a hash table or a B-tree as the underlying data structure, providing fast and efficient lookup and insertion operations.
- **ImmutableMemTable**: A snapshot of the MemTable at a certain point in time, which is immutable and can be safely written to disk without affecting the ongoing operations. An ImmutableMemTable is typically flushed to disk when it reaches a certain size or age threshold.
- **SortedStringTable**: A disk-based data structure that stores the historical versions of the data, organized in a sorted order based on the keys. A SortedStringTable typically uses a variant of the B-tree as the underlying data structure, providing efficient range queries and scans over the data.

The LSM architecture works by maintaining a pipeline of MemTables and ImmutableMemTables, which are periodically flushed to disk as SortedStringTables. The SortedStringTables are merged and compacted to reduce the fragmentation and redundancy in the data, resulting in a more efficient and consistent data representation.

The specific steps of the LSM algorithm are as follows:

1. When a new update or modification operation arrives, it is first applied to the current MemTable. If the MemTable does not exist, it is created and initialized with the updated data.
2. When the MemTable reaches a certain size or age threshold, it is converted into an ImmutableMemTable and removed from the memory.
3. When the number of ImmutableMemTables exceeds a certain limit, they are merged and compacted into a single SortedStringTable on disk.
4. When a query operation arrives, it searches the MemTable, the ImmutableMemTables, and the SortedStringTables in parallel, returning the first matching result found.
5. When a delete operation arrives, it marks the corresponding record as deleted in the MemTable and the ImmutableMemTables, but does not physically remove it until it is compacted and merged into a SortedStringTable.
6. When a flush operation arrives, it writes the current MemTable to disk as a new ImmutableMemTable, and creates a new MemTable for future updates and modifications.
7. When a merge or compaction operation arrives, it reads multiple SortedStringTables from disk, merges and sorts their contents, and writes the result back to disk as a new SortedStringTable.

The performance and scalability of the LSM algorithm depend on several factors, such as the size and complexity of the data, the expected query and update patterns, the available resources and constraints, and the desired latency and throughput goals.

In general, the LSM algorithm provides excellent write performance and moderate read performance, making it suitable for applications that require frequent updates and modifications, such as social media feeds, news aggregators, and online marketplaces. However, the LSM algorithm may suffer from some limitations, such as the write amplification caused by the merging and compaction of the SortedStringTables, the potential inconsistency caused by the delayed removal of the deleted records, and the limited support for transactional and distributed scenarios.

## 4. 具体最佳实践：代码实例和详细解释说明

In this section, we will provide a concrete example of how to use the MapDB storage engine in MyBatis, by demonstrating how to create, modify, and query a simple user table.

### 4.1. Create a new MapDB database

First, we need to create a new MapDB database that will store our user table. We can do this by calling the `MapDB.builder()` method and specifying the file path and the configuration options. For example:
```java
File dbFile = new File("userdb.mapdb");
DB db = MapDB.builder().file(dbFile).transactionEnable().build();
```
This code creates a new MapDB database named `userdb.mapdb`, with transaction support enabled.

### 4.2. Create a new user table

Next, we need to create a new user table that will store our user records. We can do this by creating a new `MapDBCache` instance and specifying the table name and the type handler. For example:
```java
MapDBTypeHandler typeHandler = new MapDBTypeHandler();
MapDBCache<Integer, User> cache = new MapDBCache<>("users", typeHandler);
```
This code creates a new `MapDBCache` instance named `users`, with the `MapDBTypeHandler` as the type handler.

### 4.3. Insert a new user record

Then, we can insert a new user record into the user table. We can do this by calling the `cache.insert()` method and passing the key and the value parameters. For example:
```java
User user = new User(1, "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com");
cache.insert(1, user);
```
This code inserts a new user record with the key `1` and the value `User(1, "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")`.

### 4.4. Query the user records

Finally, we can query the user records from the user table. We can do this by calling the `cache.get()` method and passing the key parameter. For example:
```java
User user = cache.get(1);
System.out.println(user);
```
This code queries the user record with the key `1` and prints its value `User(1, "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")`.

### 4.5. Update a user record

We can also update a user record in the user table. We can do this by calling the `cache.update()` method and passing the key and the new value parameters. For example:
```java
User newUser = new User(1, "Jane Doe", "jane.doe@example.com");
cache.update(1, newUser);
```
This code updates the user record with the key `1` to `User(1, "Jane Doe", "jane.doe@example.com")`.

### 4.6. Delete a user record

We can also delete a user record from the user table. We can do this by calling the `cache.delete()` method and passing the key parameter. For example:
```java
cache.delete(1);
```
This code deletes the user record with the key `1`.

## 5. 实际应用场景

The MapDB storage engine is suitable for various application scenarios that require fast and efficient data storage and retrieval, as well as flexible and customizable indexing strategies and concurrency models. Some examples of such scenarios are:

- **Data grid**: The MapDB storage engine can be used as a distributed data grid, enabling multiple nodes to share and synchronize their data across a network.
- **Time-series database**: The MapDB storage engine can be used as a time-series database, storing and querying large volumes of time-stamped data.
- **Event sourcing**: The MapDB storage engine can be used as an event sourcing system, capturing and replaying the sequence of events that led to a certain state.
- **Log processing**: The MapDB storage engine can be used as a log processing system, aggregating and analyzing the logs generated by various applications and services.
