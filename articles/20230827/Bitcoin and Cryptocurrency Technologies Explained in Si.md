## Introduction
### What is bitcoin? 
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created by <NAME> on January 3, 2009. The creator intended to create a completely digital asset with no central authority. Currently, it has achieved widespread acceptance as a store of value and financial medium. 

The first two letters of his name "Satoshi" come from Japanese surname Yoshimoto which means light source. He hoped that the currency would have no central control and not rely on banks or governments for funding or regulation. Instead, he used peer-to-peer networking to allow anyone to participate in its economy. By launching bitcoin on July 3, 2009, Satoshi promised a high level of security and transparency in order to keep the network running smoothly.

A unique feature of bitcoin is that it has an extremely low fee rate compared to other currencies. Fees are determined based on transaction sizes and include transaction verification costs, making it difficult to perform spam attacks or take advantage of scammers. However, since bitcoin has many similarities to traditional currencies such as cash, they can still serve as a useful payment method especially when international trade occurs.

While bitcoin offers several advantages over traditional currencies, it is only becoming more significant day by day due to its fast pace of development and scalability. There is a lot of competition amongst various altcoins, but their monetary policies are often inconsistent with those of bitcoin. For example, etherium, litecoin, and dash all offer alternative forms of currency with varying degrees of freedom and autonomy. These may suit specific needs better than bitcoin, so they have gained popularity among some traders.

Overall, bitcoin has been shown to be effective in fueling global trade and sparking renewed interest in the space. Whether this trend continues depends largely on whether bitcoin succeeds where others fail. While there are many factors contributing to bitcoin's success, institutional demand is undoubtedly one of the largest contributors. Long-term holders of bitcoin remain committed to maintaining the currency's stability and long-term growth. 

### Why do people use bitcoin? 
People use bitcoin for numerous reasons ranging from personal finance to online purchases. Here are just a few of the benefits of holding and using bitcoin:

1. Financial freedom - bitcoin allows for complete financial freedom as payments can be made anonymously and securely.
2. Cost-effectiveness - bitcoin has a lower cost per transaction compared to traditional currencies like dollars or euros. Additionally, bitcoin's ability to instantaneously settle transactions ensures swift processing times.
3. Privacy - bitcoin provides strong privacy features that protect customers' identities while allowing businesses to conduct business transactions seamlessly. 
4. Security - bitcoin guarantees transaction security by utilizing encryption, digital signatures, and peer-to-peer networks. 
5. International Trading - Since bitcoin relies on peer-to-peer networking, it can be easily exchanged internationally. Unlike physical currency, foreign exchange rates fluctuate less frequently causing greater efficiency.
6. Greater Decentralization - Bitcoins' lack of central authorities makes it a truly distributed ledger, removing a single point of failure risk. Furthermore, the concept of a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, further supports decentralization efforts.

There are countless ways in which people use bitcoin and more applications await discovery. Some of the more common ones are listed below: 

1. Online Purchases - Bitcoin enables consumers to make fast, cheap, and easy-to-verify online purchases worldwide. 

2. Shopping Platforms - Bitcoin is being increasingly adopted in ecommerce platforms such as Amazon, Ebay, and Alibaba. With its focus on speed, convenience, and safety, these companies are enabling consumers to spend safely without the fear of counterfeiting or disputes. 

3. Entertainment and Media Industries - Bitcoin has taken the media industry by storm with its capacity for paying for entertainment content directly. No longer do viewers have to worry about losing money because their streaming subscriptions can suddenly stop working due to pricing volatility. 

4. Healthcare Industry - Bitcoin plays a crucial role in modern healthcare as a safe, efficient way to make medical appointments, manage insurance claims, and share medical records. 

5. Agriculture - Bitcoin is transforming the way crops are grown and traded globally. Big investors have invested in developing dapps that help farmers automate processes and reduce labor costs. 

6. Online Gaming - Bitcoin is replacing traditional payment systems for games like World of Warcraft and League of Legends. As players continue to purchase goods and services digitally, their prices drop leading to increased competitiveness.

Of course, bitcoin alone cannot replace all aspects of traditional finance and even attempts to do so have limited scope. Nevertheless, it represents a revolutionary tool for individual financial mobility and a great opportunity for entrepreneurs to tap into a growing marketplace.
