# 1.简介
  

Evolutionary computation (EC) and genetic algorithm (GA) are two of the most popular optimization techniques used in many fields including computer science, mathematics, engineering, and economics. While they have different approaches to solve problems and produce better solutions than other methods like brute force search or heuristic algorithms, both EC and GA can be applied successfully on various types of problems. 

This article will compare the key features and differences between EC and GA. It will also discuss when it is advantageous to use one method over the other, provide examples illustrating how to implement them, as well as outline some potential challenges ahead for these techniques. By the end of this article, readers should feel confident about selecting which technique they need based on their specific requirements and constraints.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
In order to understand the main ideas behind evolutionary computation and genetic algorithm, let’s first review a few basic concepts and terminology:

1. Population: A population refers to a set of individuals that interact with each other to find the best solution(s). In an EC context, the population represents the current generation of candidate solutions; while in a GA context, it corresponds to the pool of chromosomes from which new generations are created.

2. Individual: An individual consists of data representing its characteristics, such as genes or weights. The fitness function assigns a score or objective value to each individual depending on its performance. 

3. Fitness Function: This is a criterion assigned to each individual within a population that determines whether it is suitable for reproduction, survival, or selection into the next generation. In short, the higher the fitness score, the better the individual. In EC, fitness functions are often complex, involving multiple objectives and trade-offs, whereas in a GA context, fitness evaluation may involve simple mathematical operations such as calculating the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the desired output and the predicted output by the model.

4. Selection Process: This involves selecting the fittest individuals from the previous generation to mate and reproduce in the next generation. It allows for variation amongst the population, preventing convergence towards local minima. There are several methods available, such as roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, and elitism.

5. Crossover Operation: This combines the genetic material of two parent individuals to create offspring who inherit traits from both parents. In a GA context, crossover operators typically consist of randomly dividing segments of DNA, thus creating new variations in the gene expression.

6. Mutation Operation: This alters the genetic composition of a selected individual to introduce randomness into the population and encourage diversity among the members. Depending on the mutation rate, mutations can be small changes, such as adding or removing a single bit, or large swings in the gene expression resulting in a completely novel trait.

7. Parent Selection Method: This defines how the initial population of candidates is generated, such as through uniform random sampling or using a probabilistic approach. In contrast, in a GA context, natural selection takes place by identifying the most promising candidates, ensuring genetic variability and reproductive success.

With these definitions in mind, we can now dive deeper into comparing EC and GA:

# 3. Differences Between EC and GA
## 3.1 Objective Functions
The primary difference between EC and GA lies in the way they evaluate the fitness of individuals. In EC, the goal is to maximize the global fitness function over time, where each iteration advances the system closer to finding the global optimum. On the other hand, in a GA context, fitness functions are evaluated only at the end of each generation, and the focus is on generating high-quality solutions that satisfy certain constraints.

For example, in solving a multi-objective optimization problem, such as optimizing fuel consumption while minimizing noise pollution, EC would require defining a weight factor to balance the two objectives. In contrast, GA could simply minimize the total distance traveled.

Another advantage of EC is that it has the ability to optimize complex systems that cannot be easily optimized using traditional optimization methods due to their non-convexity or multimodality. For instance, in biology research, trying to identify the optimal combination of drug treatments to achieve a target phenotype is notoriously challenging without relying on convex optimization algorithms like gradient descent. In contrast, a GA might be able to find highly efficient drug combinations that meet the same objective function criteria.

However, there are drawbacks as well. One issue is that fitness functions defined in terms of multiple objectives can become more difficult to define and optimize because it requires subject matter experts to articulate clear goals and criteria. Another challenge is that domain expertise required by EC can limit the effectiveness of the technology in practice. Finally, EC tends to perform poorly when dealing with noisy or dynamic environments that change frequently, leading to suboptimal solutions compared to GA.

## 3.2 Elitism versus Novelty Search
Another distinction between EC and GA lies in the selection process. In EC, the top performing individuals are retained unchanged and passed down to future generations, while in a GA context, newer individuals are given a chance to improve upon existing ones. Similarly, there are two common selection mechanisms in EC, namely elitism and ranking-based selection, while GA uses various mating mechanisms, such as sexual and asexual reproduction, and discrimination mechanisms, such as stochastic universal sampling.

In addition, another distinction between EC and GA is related to the population size. In an EC context, the population size can grow arbitrarily large because it continually evolves and adapts to the changing environment. However, in a GA context, the number of individuals in a population must remain constant throughout the entire process, otherwise selection biases may result. Additionally, in a GA context, it is possible to employ techniques such as neuroevolution, which allow for learning and adaptation by modifying the structure of the neural networks during training.

Finally, even though EC and GA share similarities in their underlying principles, they still differ in important ways, such as the impact of noise, the complexity of fitness functions, and the capacity to handle multimodal and non-convex spaces. Therefore, understanding the key differences between the two technologies and choosing the right one for your problem requires careful consideration and deliberation.
