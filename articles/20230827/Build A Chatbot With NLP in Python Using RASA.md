> Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most critical skills for chatbots today as they are becoming increasingly essential in our lives and day-to-day interactions with machines. In this article, we will use the open source machine learning framework Rasa to build a simple chatbot that can understand basic natural language questions and provide an appropriate response based on predefined training data set. We will also discuss various implementation aspects such as using external APIs or connecting databases for storing user information, and how to handle conversation context across multiple sessions. Finally, we will consider some best practices and pitfalls while building a chatbot system and suggest ways to improve it further.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the subfield of artificial intelligence that involves interpreting human languages. It includes both computational linguistics and statistical techniques used to analyze and manipulate natural human languages, such as English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to process and understand human language as well as converse with humans in natural language form. 

There are several steps involved in natural language processing:

1. **Tokenization**: Tokenizing means dividing a sentence into individual words or phrases called tokens. For example, "I am happy" can be tokenized into ["I", "am", "happy"].
2. **Stop Word Removal**: Stop words are common words like 'the', 'a' etc., which don't add any meaning to a sentence but may cause ambiguity. They should be removed from the text before further processing.
3. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Stemming reduces each word to its base or root form. Lemmatization provides more accurate results by stemming only when necessary.
4. **Part-of-speech tagging**: Part-of-speech tagging assigns parts of speech to each word in the text, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This step helps identify the grammatical structure of the sentence.
5. **Named entity recognition**: Named entity recognition identifies different entities mentioned in the text, such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc. These entities can have different meanings depending on their roles within the sentence.
6. **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis determines whether the speaker's sentiment towards a particular topic is positive, negative, or neutral. The result of sentiment analysis can help determine what action the bot should take in responding to the user's query.

Rasa uses a pipeline approach to perform these tasks automatically, which makes it easy to integrate new features easily without changing the code.

## Machine Learning:
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computer programs to learn from experience and make predictions or decisions autonomously. ML algorithms work on large datasets to find patterns and correlations between inputs and outputs, making them useful in many applications including image recognition, natural language understanding, and predicting stock prices. There are several types of machine learning models, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

In this tutorial, we'll use Rasa for building a simple chatbot. Rasa is an open-source platform for building assistants and conversational software. It offers a unified programming interface and tools that allow developers to create bots that interact naturally with users via messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Telegram.

The bot can understand basic natural language questions by analyzing intents and entities. Intents represent actions the user wants to perform, while entities describe the objects being manipulated or referred to. To train Rasa, you need a labeled dataset consisting of examples of conversations between the bot and the user, where each example contains a set of sentences exchanged between the two parties along with the intended intent and entity values.

Once trained, the bot can respond to queries in natural language form based on the intents and entities recognized in the input. The bot maintains a dialogue state throughout the conversation, allowing it to remember previous conversations and adapt its responses accordingly. By leveraging machine learning techniques, Rasa is capable of handling complex conversations with ease, enabling you to focus on designing effective dialogues and interactions instead of spending hours writing code.


## Deep Learning:
Deep learning (DL) is a type of machine learning technique that employs neural networks to solve complex problems. DL models are designed to extract complex features from raw data and transform them into abstract representations that can capture underlying relationships among data points. The term deep learning originated from the depth of neural network architectures that typically consist of many layers of interconnected neurons. While traditional machine learning algorithms like linear regression and logistic regression require a lot of feature engineering and domain expertise, deep learning models can learn complex non-linear relationships between input and output directly from the data itself.

Rasa also leverages deep learning algorithms through pre-trained embeddings. Pre-trained embeddings are sets of vectors representing semantic relationships between words. By embedding words into a high-dimensional space, Rasa achieves better performance than other approaches in recognizing similarities and differences between words. Furthermore, Rasa supports a variety of popular deep learning libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, so you can experiment with different architectures and optimization strategies to suit your specific needs.
