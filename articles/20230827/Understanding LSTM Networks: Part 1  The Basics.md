Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network that is particularly powerful for time series prediction and classification problems due to their ability to handle long dependencies in the input data. In this article, we will learn about the basic concepts and theory behind an LSTM architecture, including its core algorithms, mathematical formulas, code examples, challenges, and applications.
In part one of our LSTM tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

1. Background Introduction
2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
3. Core Algorithm Principles and Operations
4. Math Formulas and Code Examples
5. Applications and Challenges

Let's get started!
## 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the details of LSTMs, it's important to understand some fundamental concepts such as input/output sequences, cells, gates, and state variables. Here are brief explanations of these concepts:
### Input Sequence
An input sequence is a set of values or vectors representing an ordered list of inputs to an LSTM unit at each time step. It can be thought of as a multi-dimensional array where each row represents a timestep and each column represents an element within the input vector. For example, if your input features include two continuous numerical variables x and y, and three categorical variables color, shape, and texture with four possible categories, then your input sequence might look like this:

| Time Step | Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Feature 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| t = 1     | X1        | Y1        | Color_1   |
| t = 2     | X2        | Y2        | Color_2   |
|...       |...       |...       |...       |

Note that the order of the columns may vary depending on the specific problem being solved. Also note that there should not necessarily be any missing values in the input sequence; the LSTM model should be able to deal with incomplete information by using the previous output as a starting point.
### Cell
The cell is the main component of an LSTM network. It processes the input sequence and produces an output at each time step based on both the current input and the internal memory state of the cell. Each cell consists of three parts:

1. **Input gate:** This gate controls how much new information from the input sequence enters the cell’s memory. It uses a sigmoid function to calculate a weighted sum of the input and previous memory state, which determines what fraction of the new information should be added to the cell’s state. 

2. **Forget gate:** This gate controls how much of the previous memory state should be forgotten and replaced with new information from the input sequence. It also uses a sigmoid function to determine the strength of the forget signal. 

3. **Output gate:** This gate controls how much of the cell’s current state should be passed on to the next time step, and how much of the new information from the input sequence should be added to the cell’s memory. 

Each of these gates receives inputs from other components in the cell such as connections to the previous state, the input sequence, and other gates. These gates then produce outputs between 0 and 1 that control the flow of information through the cell. Finally, the cell produces an updated memory state based on the input sequence, the current state, and the output gate. 


### Gating Mechanisms
Gating mechanisms allow the LSTM network to selectively remember or discard different pieces of information from the input sequence. They act as switches that either let pass certain information or block it while maintaining access to the rest of the memory. The purpose of gates is to make sure that important information remains accessible to the cell even when large amounts of irrelevant information arrive from outside the cell. 

In an LSTM cell, the input gate controls the amount of new information from the input sequence that gets entered into the cell’s memory, the forget gate controls how much of the previous memory state gets discarded, and the output gate controls how much of the cell’s current state passes on to the next time step along with the new information from the input sequence. 

These gates use several mathematical functions to perform their tasks, including logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions. However, they still retain their regular binary nature because most computers only work with bits rather than floating-point numbers. By performing these calculations using bitwise logic operations, researchers have been able to create efficient and accurate implementations of these gates.
