# 1.简介
  

Over the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized businesses by automating tasks such as email response, inventory management, customer support chatbots, and more. With the development of natural language processing (NLP), a new approach called conversational interfaces is emerging that allows users to interact with applications through voice or text input instead of traditional forms like forms on websites or buttons on mobile apps.
In this article, we will build a fully functional AI powered customer support system using Dialogflow and GCP. We will use various APIs provided by both platforms for building our customer support bot including Text-to-Speech (TTS), Speech-to-Text (STT), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Dialogflow CX. The complete solution can be hosted on cloud infrastructure.
This article assumes basic knowledge of AI concepts and terminology, experience in software design patterns, NLP techniques, and familiarity with popular API documentation. If you are just getting started with these technologies, we recommend starting from scratch before following along.
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## A. AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to any machine learning technique that enables machines to perform complex tasks that would typically require human intelligence or intelligent behavior. Some common types of AI include:

1. Machine Learning: This involves training algorithms based on data to recognize patterns and make predictions about future outcomes. 

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): This involves computer systems that understand and process human language, allowing them to communicate effectively with each other and respond to user queries. There are several subtypes of NLP, including Sentiment Analysis, Entity Recognition, Intent Classification, etc.

3. Computer Vision: This involves computers recognizing patterns and objects within images and videos, enabling them to identify and classify content, make decisions, and act autonomously. 

Overall, there is a myriad of AI techniques being developed right now, ranging from simple image recognition to advanced natural language understanding. In this article, we will focus specifically on NLP and Dialogflow.

## B. Dialogflow
Dialogflow is a platform developed by Google that provides an AI interface that enables developers to create conversation-based bots. It offers several tools such as intent modeling, entity extraction, context tracking, and rich analytics dashboards that help developers monitor and improve their bot's performance over time. The primary usage of Dialogflow is to provide an easy way for users to interact with enterprise or consumer services such as FAQs, product information, ticketing, feedback surveys, etc., making it one of the most widely used AI platforms today.


The main components of Dialogflow include:

1. Intents: These define what actions the agent should take when it receives certain inputs. For example, if the user says "I want a videogame" then the corresponding intent could be "GreetingIntent".

2. Entities: These are important parts of user messages that need to be identified and extracted for further processing. Examples of entities might be datetimes, numbers, locations, or categorical variables.

3. Context: This is necessary because humans often express similar ideas in different ways. For example, saying "help me with my order" could refer to multiple things depending on the user's situation. By keeping track of the user's previous utterances and contexts, Dialogflow can better determine which intent to trigger next.

4. Fulfillment: This is where the actual action is taken. When the agent recognizes an appropriate intent, it retrieves relevant data from its database or executes a function based on the query. It may also prompt additional questions to clarify details or suggest alternative options.
