# 1.简介
  

Over the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has seen significant progress in solving complex problems such as playing games, understanding natural language, answering questions, and much more. However, creating an AI agent that can perform tasks at a human level of performance is not trivial because it requires knowledge about the world and the task being performed by the agent. This research project aims to develop a hybrid model called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), which combines biological principles of neocortical networks with deep learning techniques for building agents capable of generalization and adaptation. In this article, we will discuss how HTM works and demonstrate its use to build an autonomous driving agent using Python programming language.

# 2. Background Introduction: What is HTM?
Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a type of machine learning algorithm developed by the Brain Corporation based on the principles of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels found in the neocortex of animal brains. It consists of multiple layers of processing cells connected in a hierarchical structure. Each layer contains hundreds of synapses that integrate inputs from other layers or the input sensors, and outputs spikes that propagate through the network to form patterns and memory. The time dimension enables information to persist over long periods of time without any explicit reset mechanisms, making HTM suitable for applications where temporal dependencies are critical.

# How does HTM work? 

Here's a brief overview of the key concepts behind HTM:

1. Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs): SDRs represent neural activity using binary vectors instead of real numbers. Instead of storing individual weights for each connection between processing units, SDRs store a small number of sparse weights per unit. 

2. Synaptic Scaling: Synaptic scaling is used to maintain balance during large changes in activity levels. When one synapse experiences high activation, others may be suppressed accordingly.

3. Dynamic Synapse Plasticity: Every neuron exhibits different plasticity properties depending on the state of the surrounding neurons. Over time, these properties change dynamically, allowing the cell to adjust to new conditions while retaining optimal performance.

4. Learning Algorithms: HTM uses unsupervised learning algorithms like Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for clustering similar patterns into stable clusters, Kohonen’s self-organizing feature map (KFFM) for pattern recognition and classification, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequential decision making.

The HTM architecture is shown below:


Overall, HTM provides a powerful framework for building intelligent agents with highly adaptive behavior, robustness, and scalability. With HTM, we can create agents that can learn continuously and adapt to changing environments, making them ideal candidates for automated driving systems, personal assistants, social media bots, and many other applications requiring sophisticated decision-making abilities.

# 3. Basic Concepts & Terminology: SDRs, Synaptic Scaling, and Dynamic Synapse Plasticity
## Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs)
Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) represent neural activity using binary vectors instead of real numbers. A vector represents the state of an elementary neuron with a set of bits representing the states of connections from other neurons. Each bit corresponds to a particular weight, with only some bits having nonzero values. By only storing a small number of sparse weights per unit, SDRs compress the information stored in the neuron and reduce redundancy. For example, consider a dense representation of a pixel value in a color image, which stores three decimal digits for every pixel position. An equivalent SDR representation would have just seven nonzero values corresponding to the weights that are nonzero. 

Synaptic Scaling is used to maintain balance during large changes in activity levels. Each neuron has a threshold value that determines when output spikes are generated. If a neuron’s accumulated excitatory current exceeds its threshold, it generates a single spike. To prevent too much inhibitory current flowing through a neuron, synaptic scaling limits the amount of excitation allowed before additional spikes are produced. As the magnitude of the excitatory current increases, the effective strength of the synapse decreases until it eventually becomes nearly zero. During periods of slow activity, all synapses are relatively weak and allow enough current to be transferred without causing refractory period violations. But during periods of fast activity, most synapses become stronger, increasing their effectiveness even beyond normal thresholds. 

Dynamic Synapse Plasticity allows the cell to adjust to new conditions while retaining optimal performance. Different neurons respond differently to stimuli and internal environmental factors. So, HTM modifies the shape and size of synapses dynamically so that they suit the context of the situation, improving the overall system stability and efficiency. The degree of modification depends on both the frequency and duration of recent events, as well as the predictive power of the underlying task.

## Learning Algorithms
HTM uses several learning algorithms for clustering similar patterns into stable clusters, pattern recognition and classification, and sequential decision making. These algorithms incorporate features learned from previous examples and use feedback loops to modify the topology of the network or the parameters of the learning rules. Some commonly used learning algorithms include SOM, Kohonen’s self-organizing feature map (KFFM), and RNN. 

In SOM, a map of neuron positions is initialized randomly and then updated iteratively by computing the distance between the input patterns and the nearest cluster center. New centers are chosen based on proximity to existing ones and refinement of topological properties of the map. Cluster labels are assigned to data points based on the closest matching center. KFFM learns a compact representation of the input data using a stack of linear transformations and nonlinearities. RNN models sequential data by maintaining hidden states along a sequence of inputs. It updates the hidden state using the output of the current step as input and the previously computed state as feedback. Based on the actions taken by the agent, the next state and reward signal determine future predictions and rewards. Overall, these learning algorithms provide a flexible and efficient way to process complex datasets and make accurate predictions and decisions.
