# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression analysis. It works by finding the best hyperplane that separates two classes of data points in a high-dimensional space. The goal is to find the largest possible margin between the two classes while keeping as few support vectors as possible. 

In this article, we will learn about how to choose the right hyperparameters for an SVM model, such as kernel type, gamma parameter value, cost parameter value, and regularization parameter value. We also discuss techniques like cross-validation and grid search to optimize the hyperparameters and achieve better performance on real-world datasets.

Before we dive into the main topic of hyperparameter tuning, let's first understand some related terms. 

 - Support vector: A point from the dataset that is closest to the decision boundary or the line that separates the different class labels. These points are responsible for making predictions and contributing to the accuracy of the classifier.

 - Kernel function: A mathematical function that converts raw data into feature vectors. The purpose of using a kernel function is to enable nonlinear relationships between features that may not be linearly separable. There are several types of kernel functions available, including linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoidal kernels.

 - Gamma parameter: This parameter controls the width of the RBF kernel and therefore its effectiveness at non-linearly separating the data. Higher values lead to a smoother decision boundary but can cause overfitting if set too high.

 - Cost parameter: This parameter controls the trade-off between margin maximization and misclassification error minimization. Lower values prioritize higher margins but might result in larger number of false positives or negatives.

 - Regularization parameter: This parameter adds a penalty term to prevent overfitting by imposing a limit on the magnitude of coefficients. The smaller the value of the regularization parameter, the fewer parameters are used during training and consequently less prone to overfitting.

 - Cross-validation: This technique involves splitting the original dataset into multiple subsets and training the model on each subset, then evaluating the model’s performance on the remaining part of the data. In other words, it helps us determine which combination of hyperparameters performs well on the validation set.

 - Grid search: This technique involves exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of hyperparameters until the optimal configuration is found. Similar to cross-validation, it takes considerably more time than a single trial and provides insights into the behavior of the model with varying hyperparameters.

SVM algorithm consists of four main steps:

 1. Training Dataset Preprocessing: We need to preprocess our training dataset before applying any algorithm. The preprocessing step includes normalization, feature scaling, and handling missing data.
 
 2. Model Selection: After preparing our dataset, we need to select the appropriate kernel type to use in our SVM model. Some commonly used kernel types include linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoidal.
 
 3. Hyperparameter Optimization: Once we have selected our kernel type, we need to fine-tune our hyperparameters. Hyperparameters control many aspects of the model’s behavior, such as the degree of polynomail or the strength of the RBF kernel. To achieve the best results, we need to perform a grid search or cross-validation to identify the optimal values for these hyperparameters.
 
 4. Model Evaluation: Finally, after selecting and optimizing our hyperparameters, we evaluate the final model’s performance on a test dataset. If the model does not meet our desired level of performance, we go back to step 3 and repeat the process until we get a satisfactory model.

Let's now focus on understanding the theory behind SVM algorithm. 

## SVM Model Parameters
The SVM model requires a choice of kernel function, C (cost parameter), and γ (gamma parameter). Choosing the correct kernel function and setting the appropriate parameters is essential for achieving good performance in supervised learning tasks. Here are some general guidelines:

 ### 1. Linear Kernel Function
Linear kernel is suitable when both input spaces are high dimensional and the relationship between inputs and outputs is linear. In this case, we only need to compute inner products between input vectors and their corresponding output labels. Therefore, it has fast execution speed and avoids the overhead of computing high-dimensional feature maps using neural networks. However, it cannot capture complex non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs.

 ### 2. Polynomial Kernel Function
Polynomial kernel functions are useful when the input space is very high dimensional and there exists some correlation between the inputs and outputs. When applied to high-dimensional problems, they map the inputs into infinite dimensions, allowing them to capture complex interactions. However, their computational complexity grows exponentially with increasing dimensionality, making them slower than linear kernel functions.

### 3. Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel Function
Radial basis function (RBF) kernel is a popular choice because it is able to handle non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs without explicitly mapping them into infinite dimensions. It is defined as K(x,y)=exp(-γ||x−y||^2), where x and y are input vectors, ||x−y|| is the Euclidean distance between them, and γ is the gamma parameter. As the name suggests, γ determines the “width” of the kernel function and controls the smoothness of the decision boundary. Large values of γ make the decision boundary smooth, whereas small values produce sharp edges.

### 4. Sigmoidal Kernel Function
Sigmoidal kernel functions are similar to the RBF kernel except that they involve a logistic transformation of the squared distance before taking the exponential. They are often preferred for binary classification problems where the target variable is categorical rather than continuous.

 ## 4. Regularization Parameter
Regularization refers to adding a penalty term to the objective function in order to prevent overfitting. The larger the regularization coefficient, the greater the penalties associated with having large weights. Thus, it helps to reduce the variance of the learned models and improves their generalization ability to new data.

Therefore, choosing a reasonable value for the regularization parameter is crucial in order to obtain accurate and reliable predictions. One common approach is to use cross-validation to tune the regularization parameter. Specifically, we split the dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. Then, we train the SVM model with different values of the regularization parameter on the training set. Next, we evaluate the model’s performance on the validation set and pick the best performing value based on the evaluation metric.

In summary, the key hyperparameters involved in SVM model selection are the kernel type, gamma parameter, cost parameter, and regularization parameter. Setting these correctly can significantly improve the performance of an SVM model.
