Singular value decomposition (SVD), also known as truncated SVD or latent semantic analysis (LSA), is a mathematical algorithm that factorizes a matrix into three matrices of lower rank than the original matrix and whose products are equal to the original matrix when multiplied together. It has become one of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques used in machine learning and data mining applications such as recommender systems, image processing, bioinformatics, and text analytics. In this article, we will discuss what SVD is and how it can be applied to solve problems related to data science using Python. 

In this article, we assume that you have some basic knowledge about linear algebra and probability theory. We'll start by introducing singular values and eigenvectors, then explain how they relate to SVD and define their properties. Next, we'll see why SVD works well in practice for various types of datasets and apply it on real-world examples to demonstrate its effectiveness. Finally, we'll conclude with suggestions for further reading and resources for more information.

This article assumes readers have at least intermediate level understanding of Python programming language. However, if you need an introduction to Python, please check out our previous articles covering basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and object-oriented programming. 

 # Introduction
In order to understand what SVD is all about, let's first recall what vectors and matrices are and how they work. A vector is an array of numbers, which typically represents a direction or magnitude in n-dimensional space. For example, the position of a point in a two-dimensional plane is a two-dimensional vector. A matrix, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional grid of numbers arranged into rows and columns. Each element in a matrix corresponds to the product of the corresponding row vector and column vector. For example, the dot product between two vectors gives us a single number, while the multiplication of a matrix by another matrix produces another matrix of the same size where each element i,j is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements in both matrices. These operations allow us to perform complex computations on large amounts of data.

 Now suppose we want to represent a high-dimensional dataset as a set of low-rank components, i.e., a matrix that is very sparse but still contains most of the important information. One way to do this is to use SVD. The idea behind SVD is to decompose the original matrix into a diagonal matrix called the singular values and a collection of orthogonal matrices called the left and right singular vectors, respectively. Specifically, given a matrix X of size m x n, we compute its SVD as follows: 

X = U * np.diag(S) * Vt

where S is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of X, sorted from largest to smallest, and U and Vt are unitary matrices (i.e., square and transpose of inverse). Here's how these matrices look like: 

U: Left singular vectors, represented as a matrix of size m x k where k <= min(m,n)
S: Diagonal matrix containing singular values
Vt: Right singular vectors, represented as a matrix of size n x k where k <= min(m,n)

The main goal of SVD is to find the best rank k approximation of the input matrix X. This means finding the projection matrix P that minimizes the Frobenius norm ||X - UV||_F, where X is the original matrix and UV is its SVD form. In other words, we're looking for the lowest-rank subspace spanned by the right singular vectors that approximates the original data as closely as possible. The reason we want to approximate the data rather than keeping only the top k eigenvalues is because some of the dimensions may not be informative or relevant to the problem at hand. By projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, we can reduce the complexity of the problem without losing much information. 

For instance, if we have a dataset consisting of movies and actors who acted in them, we might want to learn a reduced representation of the data consisting of just the features that capture the actors' characteristics (such as age, occupation, etc.) while ignoring irrelevant factors like genre, duration, or storyline. Using SVD, we could find a basis of actor characteristics that captures the most important ones while discarding any noise or redundant features. Similarly, if we had a list of documents written in different languages, we could use SVD to identify common topics across different languages and cluster similar documents together based on shared topic features.
