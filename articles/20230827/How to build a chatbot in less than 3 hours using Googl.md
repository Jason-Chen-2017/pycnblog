Chatbots are increasingly being used by businesses to increase engagement with their customers and boost sales. However, building a reliable Chatbot can be challenging for developers as they need to have an understanding of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning algorithms, and knowledge base construction. 

Google has recently released its Dialogflow platform which makes it easy to create chatbots without having any programming experience or needing specialized skills such as data engineering or AI expertise. In this article, we will walk you through how to build a simple weather bot using the Dialogflow platform. We assume that you already have a basic understanding of NLP concepts like intents, entities, and contexts. If not, please refer to other articles on these topics before proceeding. 

Let's start by creating a new agent within Dialogflow. Once created, follow the steps below: 

1. Add your name and description (optional).

2. Under the "Fulfillment" section, select "Webhook".

3. Click on "Create Agent".

4. Now, click on the gear icon next to the newly created agent and navigate to the "Settings" tab. 

5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and under "General", set the Timezone to match your location.

6. Next, let’s add some Intents and Entities. Go back to the left-hand side menu and click on “Intents”.

7. Click on "+ New Intent” button and give your first intent a descriptive name, e.g., “Weather” (or any suitable name of your choice).

8. Drag and drop the appropriate words from the list onto the right hand pane, making sure to include all necessary parameters. For example, if I want my chatbot to tell me the current temperature, I would use the following phrases: “What is the weather like”, “Show me the forecast”, “Tell me about today’s weather”, etc. Each phrase should map to one specific action, i.e., getting the current weather conditions.

9. When you have added all the required examples for each intent, move on to adding Entities. You can also reuse existing entities, but make sure to define them correctly to ensure optimal performance of your model. Let’s say I want to specify a city when asking for weather information, so I would go ahead and create an entity called "City." 

10. Now, we need to train our model to understand our chatbot’s responses better. To do this, we can test out sample utterances against the agent. This helps us refine the training data and improve accuracy. 

For testing purposes, we can try providing different inputs to the chatbot and verifying whether it responds accurately.

11. Finally, deploy your agent by clicking on the "Deploy" button at the top of the screen. This will publish the agent and enable it to receive messages from users. It may take several minutes to complete the deployment process, after which you can access your chatbot via messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype, etc. 

That’s it! Your very own chatbot can now provide real-time weather updates based on user queries. Well done!

Now let's put everything together into a more detailed explanation of how to build the Weather Bot step by step. 


# 2.How to Build a Chatbot in Less Than 3 Hours Using Google Dialogflow and Python
In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a simple weather bot using the Google Dialogflow platform. The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate how easy it is to build a functional chatbot using only free tools and services. The following are the steps involved in building a chatbot using the Dialogflow platform:

1. Setting up the Environment
2. Creating a New Dialogflow Agent
3. Defining the Intents and Training Examples
4. Adding Custom Entities
5. Deploying the Agent
6. Integrating the Python Code
7. Testing the Weather Bot

Before we begin, there are few prerequisites that must be satisfied:

1. Basic Understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Concepts like Intents, Entities, and Contexts
2. Knowledge of Python Programming
3. Access to a Text Editor/IDE


## 1.Setting Up the Environment
To get started, we need to install the latest version of Python, pip, and virtualenv. Open up a terminal window and type the following commands one by one:

1. Install Python: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install python3`
2. Verify installation: `python3 --version`
3. Install pip: `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3`
4. Verify installation: `pip3 --version`
5. Create virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`
6. Activate virtual environment: `../venv/bin/activate`
7. Install Flask framework: `pip3 install flask` 
8. Verify installation: `flask --version`

With the above pre-requisites installed, we can now continue with setting up the Dialogflow environment.



## 2.Creating a New Dialogflow Agent
Head over to the Dialogflow website and sign up or log in to your account. After logging in, click on the "+ New Agent" button located at the top-right corner of the screen. Choose a unique display name for your agent. Keep in mind that the Display Name field cannot be changed later.

Next, select English language and click on the "Create Agent" button. Once the agent creation is successful, head over to the Settings page of your agent and scroll down to the "General" section. Set the timezone to match your location and click on the Save button.




## 3.Defining the Intents and Training Examples
Once the agent is created, we can start defining the Intents and Training Examples for our agent. Go to the "Intents" tab on the left-hand side menu of your Dialogflow dashboard. Here, you can see a list of existing Intents along with their associated training examples.

Click on the "+ New Intent" button to create a new Intent. Give it a relevant name, for instance, "Weather". Now, drag and drop the required words onto the right panel. Make sure to cover all possible ways that the user might ask for weather information. Just like humans, Dialogflow tries to understand what the user means and perform an accurate prediction. Therefore, keep adding relevant examples until you are happy with the results.

Make sure to mark all the mandatory fields mentioned during training while dragging and dropping. At the same time, pay attention to the order of the words as well. Avoid repeating the same word multiple times in a sentence unless it provides additional context.

You can always edit the training examples later on if needed. Once you have completed the training phase, save the changes.

At this point, you have defined the Intent and provided training examples for obtaining weather reports. Lets now move to the next step where we will add custom entities to our dialogflow agent.
