# 1.简介
  

Graphical models (GM) are a powerful tool for reasoning about and modeling complex systems with many interconnected variables. They have attracted much attention due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships between the variables and their dependencies. However, the inference in GM is typically based on point estimates or pseudo-point estimates that often suffer from bias and variance issues especially when the number of variables grows large. To address these challenges, non-parametric bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), variational inference, and stochastic gradient MCMC can be used to estimate the parameters of graphical model. This article provides an introduction to non-parametric bayesian methods for GM by discussing the fundamental concepts of graph structure learning and parameter estimation. We will also discuss some key algorithms like structure learning and approximate inference using techniques like loopy belief propagation and factor graphs. Finally, we will present several practical examples demonstrating how to apply these algorithms to real world problems like semi-supervised learning and recommender systems. 

# 2.Background Introduction
In recent years, there has been significant interest in applying machine learning and statistical methods to analyze complex biological systems. One class of applications involves modeling gene expression profiles, identifying disease biomarkers, predicting drug response patterns, etc. These applications involve modeling of complex networks of interacting molecular entities where each entity may possess its own set of features and interacts with other entities. In order to analyze such data efficiently, various approaches have emerged including Gaussian mixture models (GMM), hidden markov models (HMM), neural networks, and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs).

The basic idea behind PGMs is to represent the joint distribution of all random variables in a system as a graphical model, which consists of nodes representing the random variables and directed edges representing the dependencies among them. The probability distributions of each variable are represented by potential functions defined over its neighbors. This representation captures both the dependency structure of the system and the dependence of each variable on its parents. Learning the parameters of a PGM requires solving two fundamental tasks:

1. Structure learning: It involves finding the best way to represent the graph structure of the system, i.e., finding the optimal parent-child relationships among the variables. This task is closely related to the field of graph theory called structural learning. There exist numerous methods for this task such as maximum likelihood, latent variable models, belief propagation, and loopy belief propagation. 

2. Parameter estimation: Given the learned graph structure, it involves estimating the values of the parameters corresponding to the conditional probabilities of the random variables given the observations. Two popular methods for parameter estimation include exact inference and approximation inference. Exact inference involves computing the true posterior distribution and integrating over it exactly, whereas approximation inference involves using mathematical tools such as moment matching, stochastic gradients, or iterative updates to estimate the posterior distribution. Approximate inference offers considerable advantages in terms of computational efficiency compared to exact inference but at the cost of introducing errors into the estimated parameters.

Non-parametric bayesian methods such as MCMC, variational inference, and stochastic gradient MCMC have emerged as highly effective alternatives to exact inference for approximating the posterior distribution. These methods leverage the underlying generative process of the model to generate samples from the posterior distribution without explicitly computing the full joint distribution. By doing so, they avoid the curse of dimensionality associated with exact inference and hence offer substantial benefits in terms of scalability and accuracy. 

# 3.Basic Concepts and Terminologies
## 3.1 Graphical Model
We use the term "graphical model" (GM) to refer to a probabilistic model consisting of variables connected by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) representing the joint distribution of the variables. Each node represents a random variable and represents a set of possible states. Edges indicate the directional causal relationship between the variables, i.e., if variable $X$ affects variable $Y$, then $X$ is the parent of $Y$.

### Types of Variables 
The types of variables include discrete variables ($X_i \in \{c_1, c_2,..., c_k\}$), continuous variables ($X_j \in [a,b]$), mixtures of multiple types of variables, and combinations of the above. For example, let's say we have two binary variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ indicating whether a patient has breast cancer ($X_1$) and whether he/she is male ($X_2$). Then we could define our graphical model as follows:


Here, $X_1$ and $X_2$ correspond to independent Bernoulli random variables with $\text{Pr}(X_1=1|X_2)$ being determined only by $X_2$. Similarly, we can define different forms of graphical models depending on the nature of the connections between the variables. 

### Causal Reasoning and Intervention
Causal reasoning refers to understanding the effect of changing one variable on another variable, while considering all the factors that might influence them. Intervention refers to the process of shaping the outcome of a study by controlling a subset of the variables or even removing certain connections altogether. Both of these ideas are essential in performing robust inference in GMs. Consider the following example:

Suppose we want to infer the survival rate of patients who received treatment $T_1$ versus those who did not receive any treatment. Let's assume that $S(X_1, T_1)$ indicates the probability of survival after receiving treatment $T_1$ conditioned on observing the individual's sex $X_1$ (assuming perfect knowledge of covariates except $X_1$). If we perform a standard analysis using logistic regression, we would obtain the estimate:

$$\text{Pr}(T_1 = 1 | X_1)\approx \frac{\exp(\beta^TX_1 + \alpha}{\exp(\beta^TX_1 + \alpha) + 1}$$

This equation assumes that the probability of treatment assignment $T_1$ does not affect the probability of survival unless affected by covariates such as age, medical history, etc. To take into account the effect of treatment on survival, we need to modify the formula accordingly. Our modified estimator should take into account the direct effect of $T_1$ on survival, as well as indirect effects caused by confounding factors such as $X_1$. Therefore, we need to find an equation that takes into account all the relevant factors. Here is an example of how to do this:

$$\text{Pr}(T_1 = 1 | X_1)\approx \frac{\exp(\beta_{t}^{T}X_1+\beta_{x_1}\left(1-T_1\right)+\alpha_t}{\exp(\beta_{t}^{T}X_1+\beta_{x_1}\left(1-T_1\right)+\alpha_t) + \exp(-\beta^{T}_x-\beta^{T}_{x_1}-\alpha)} $$

Here, $\beta_{t}$, $\beta_{x_1}$, $\alpha_t$, and $\alpha$ are vectors of coefficients obtained through a logistic regression analysis of $(T_1, S(X_1,T_1))$ vs. $X_1$ respectively. We assumed that the coefficient $\beta_{t}^{T}X_1$ is directly proportional to the probability of treatment, which is known as the direct effect of $T_1$ on survival. On the other hand, we assumed that the coefficient $\beta_{x_1}\left(1-T_1\right)$ is equal to zero because of the indirect effect of $X_1$ on survival. Thus, the second part of the denominator of the modified estimator accounts for the indirect effect caused by confounding factors.

Similarly, we can design interventions by varying the value of a subset of the variables in place of holding constant their current values. This allows us to assess the effect of modifying the environment on the outcomes of interest.
