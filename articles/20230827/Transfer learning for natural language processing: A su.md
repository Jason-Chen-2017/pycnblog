在自然语言处理（NLP）任务中，无监督学习已被广泛应用于训练模型对数据进行特征提取、分类等任务，取得了良好的效果。但是如何利用已有的监督训练好的模型来解决新任务，仍然是一个难题。Transfer learning 的出现正逐渐成为解决这个问题的方法之一。本文将从相关的研究历史出发，介绍 Transfer learning 在 NLP 中的一些基础概念和技术实现方法。
Transfer learning 是机器学习领域的一个重要概念。它提出了一个简单而直观的假设：一个机器学习任务可以由许多基础性的子任务组成，不同子任务之间存在某种相关性。这些相关性可以通过知识蒸馏（Knowledge Distillation）等方法来获得。因此，在迁移学习过程中，源模型（source model）会首先学习基础的特征表示，然后在目标数据集上微调，将其适用于新任务。
根据 Wu et al.(2019) 的论述，目前 Transfer learning 在 NLP 中主要包括以下几类方法：
- feature transfer：直接复用源模型的预训练的神经网络层作为目标模型的初始权重；
- fine tuning：利用源模型的参数初始化目标模型参数，然后微调调整；
- distilling the knowledge：通过知识蒸馏将源模型的知识转移到目标模型中；
- multi task learning：将多个源模型的输出结果整合到一起作为目标模型的输入，并联合训练。
接下来，本文将详细阐述以上这些方法以及各自的特点、优缺点、适用的场景以及相应的实践案例。
# 2.主要术语及定义
## 2.1 Transfer Learning
Transfer learning (TL) is a machine learning technique that enables training of deep neural networks on a target dataset by exploiting pre-trained representations from another related but different dataset. In other words, we can use a pretrained model to learn relevant features from some source data which can be useful in solving a similar or related problem in our target dataset. It has become increasingly popular as it reduces the time and resources required for developing deep learning models while achieving good performance. TL plays an essential role in fields such as image recognition, speech recognition, and text analysis. 
The general steps involved in applying transfer learning are as follows:
1. **Feature extraction:** The pre-trained model first extracts features from the source domain, which are then used as input to train the final classifier layers on the target domain. 
2. **Fine-tuning**: Once the initial weights have been transferred, the model’s parameters are further adjusted using backpropagation to optimize them for the specific target domain. This process involves updating the weights of the final layer(s) only, so that the network focuses more on recognizing patterns that are specific to the target domain rather than those learned through transfer learning.  
3. **Distillation**: Knowledge distillation techniques like Hinton’s work on adapting soft targets instead of hard labels during training can also be employed when transferring knowledge from a larger source model to a smaller target model. This helps improve both accuracy and computational efficiency.
4. **Multi-task learning**: Multiple source domains can also be combined together to form a unified model with multiple outputs, all trained simultaneously on the same target data.
In this paper, we will focus mainly on supervised transfer learning methods for natural language processing tasks.

## 2.2 Supervised Transfer Learning
Supervised Transfer Learning refers to the type of transfer learning where the labeled examples come from the same source domain as well as the target domain. In order to apply SLTL, one needs to identify suitable source datasets for the given task at hand. Common sources include pre-existing corpora and lexicons, available publicly or privately, along with their annotations. Another important aspect of supervised transfer learning is that the target domain must have appropriate annotations. This requirement ensures that the target model learns reliable and accurate representations for the new domain without any ambiguity. However, there may still be cases where the target dataset contains noisy or unreliable labeling. Therefore, it becomes necessary to carefully examine the feasibility of supervised transfer learning before attempting it.

Some common types of supervised transfer learning methods are:

1. Feature Extraction: Instead of directly fine-tuning the entire model, the representation extracted from the source domain can be used as part of a broader architecture for the target task. For example, if we want to classify sentences into two categories—positive or negative sentiment—we might use a large corpus of movie reviews annotated with positive/negative sentiment and train a CNN on top of these representations. 

2. Fine Tuning: In this approach, the pre-trained model is loaded with its initialized weights and the last few layers are removed and replaced with new ones designed specifically for the target domain. Here, the existing weights in the remaining layers of the model are updated based on the newly labeled target data. This method usually leads to better results compared to feature extraction alone since it uses more robust representations obtained through fine-tuning. 

3. Label Adaptation: When the target domain does not contain sufficient amount of labeled data or annotation, we can leverage a small set of unlabeled instances from the source domain to guide the classification of the target data. This is called label adaptation, and several works have proposed various ways to perform this. One way is to use a pre-trained model to predict the most likely labels for the unlabeled instances in the source domain, and then use these predictions to train the classifier on the target domain. 

4. Distribution Matching: If the target distribution differs significantly from the source distribution, especially if it is imbalanced, then we need additional techniques to ensure that the learned representation captures meaningful information about the target domain. We can use density matching to make sure that the number of samples belonging to each class is roughly equal across both domains. Alternatively, we can use style transfer techniques to learn a mapping between the styles of the source and target domains, ensuring that the target model produces outputs that are consistent with the intended emotion or content.

Other approaches such as weakly-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-training could also fall under the scope of supervised transfer learning.

## 2.3 Unsupervised Transfer Learning
Unsupervised Transfer Learning refers to the case where the source domain is completely unknown and we don't have access to any labeled data except the text documents themselves. One possible solution to address this issue is to leverage the structure inherent in the text document itself to represent the underlying semantics. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling algorithm that discovers latent topics within a collection of texts. By clustering the texts based on their similarity, LDA can capture the internal structure of the text data and map each document to its corresponding topic. Based on this idea, we can treat each topic as a “concept” or “feature” that characterizes a particular subset of textual data. Then, we can use these concepts as input to a downstream classifier that performs classification based on the textual content alone. Since LDA is unsupervised, it doesn't require any annotated data beyond what's provided in the raw text. Furthermore, LDA is particularly effective when dealing with short texts or sparse text collections where manually annotating every instance would be impractical or impossible.
