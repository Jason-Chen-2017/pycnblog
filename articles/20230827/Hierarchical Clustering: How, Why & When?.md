及背景介绍
Hierarchical clustering is a popular technique in data mining and machine learning to group similar objects or data points into clusters based on their similarity of attributes. It has been used in many fields such as pattern recognition, image processing, bioinformatics, and finance. The concept can be explained using the following steps:

1. Start with each object/data point as a separate cluster (leaf node).
2. Merge two adjacent clusters that have similar characteristics until all objects are grouped together into a single cluster at the top level. This process continues recursively until there is only one large cluster containing all original objects.

The hierarchical clustering algorithm uses distance measures to determine how closely related pairs of data points are. There are several common distance metrics including Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Mahalanobis distance, etc., which measure the difference between two vectors in high-dimensional space. 

Therefore, the goal of hierarchical clustering is to find natural groups amongst a set of data points without specifying any predefined number of clusters beforehand. Once we identify these groups, we may then use other techniques such as density-based clustering, k-means clustering, or DBSCAN for further analysis.

In this article, I will discuss the working principles of hierarchical clustering and its applications. Specifically, I will cover the following topics: 

1. What is hierarchical clustering?
2. Why should you use it?
3. How does it work?
4. Types of hierarchical clustering algorithms
5. When should you use different types of hierarchical clustering algorithms?
6. Important parameters and tuning strategies
7. Choosing an appropriate distance metric
8. Pros and cons of various hierarchical clustering methods
9. Applications of hierarchical clustering in real-world scenarios

To conclude, this article provides insights into the fundamental concepts behind hierarchical clustering and demonstrates the practical utility of this method by discussing several case studies and applying them to solve real-world problems. By understanding the theory and practice behind hierarchical clustering, you will become better equipped to apply it in your own research and industry projects. Good luck!











# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1.What is hierarchical clustering?
Hierarchical clustering refers to a class of clustering algorithms where clusters are successively merged together to produce a tree structure called dendrogram. At each step of merging, nodes in the dendrogram represent individual clusters, while internal branches of the tree represent intermediate merges. A linkage criterion determines the degree of similarity between clusters and determines whether they should be merged or not. Dendograms can help us understand the arrangement of the final clustering result and reveal underlying patterns within our dataset. Here's what happens under the hood during hierarchical clustering:


The above figure shows the general flowchart of hierarchical clustering. In brief, starting from the bottom left corner, we start with n initial observations, labeled i=1,..., n. We form a singleton cluster C_i for each observation, resulting in n singleton clusters. Next, we select two clusters, say C_j and C_k, whose centers are most similar to each other according to some chosen distance function. For example, if we use Euclidean distance, we would choose the pair with minimum sum of squared distances between corresponding cluster centers. We merge those two clusters into a new larger cluster called CK+, resulting in a new set of n-1 clusters. We repeat this procedure recursively, taking the best pair of unmerged clusters at each iteration and eventually obtaining a root cluster that contains every observation.

Finally, we obtain a partition of the dataset into multiple clusters, each representing a specific type or category of behavior, behavioral model, or functional role. These partitions can provide valuable information about the relationships and interdependencies between data points, as well as suggest possible structures or mechanisms underlying the observed behaviors.
