Sentiment analysis is one of the most important tasks in natural language processing that involves analyzing text data and determining its attitude or opinion towards a particular topic or product. There are many techniques to perform sentiment analysis including rule-based methods, machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM), deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this tutorial, we will use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for performing sentiment analysis on tweets dataset. We will also cover some advanced topics related to NLTK such as Regular Expressions, Part-of-speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition. Finally, we will discuss several approaches to evaluate the performance of our model. 

In general, sentiment analysis has two types:
1. Objective - which evaluates the overall emotional tone of the sentence, whether it's positive, negative or neutral. It can be done using simple lexicon-based approach where specific words or phrases associated with different emotions are labeled as positive, negative or neutral.

2. Subjective - which identifies the underlying factors that contribute to the sentiment of the sentence. This type of analysis requires more sophisticated NLP techniques like syntactic parsing, dependency parsing, etc., to identify subjective components in the sentences and their corresponding sentiment scores. 


This article is focused on explaining how to perform sentiment analysis using the NLTK library on the Twitter dataset. Before jumping into code, let’s understand some basic concepts and terms used in NLTK.
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
## Tokens
A token is the smallest unit that makes up a piece of text. For example, “I love programming” contains three tokens: "I", "love" and "programming". 

In NLTK, all tokens are separated by spaces, tabs, newlines or other whitespace characters. When working with documents as strings instead of files, you need to specify your own delimiter between each word.

You can access individual tokens from a document object using indexing notation. The first token is at index 0, second token is at index 1, third token is at index 2, and so on. Here's an example:

```python
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(document)
print(tokens[0]) # Output: I
print(tokens[-1]) # Output:.
```

There are various ways to tokenize a string using NLTK depending on the desired level of granularity. `nltk.word_tokenize()` method splits the input string into individual tokens based on space characters, punctuation marks and certain special characters such as hyphens, apostrophes and parentheses. Other commonly used tokenization functions include `nltk.sent_tokenize()` function which breaks a paragraph into separate sentences and `nltk.regexp_tokenize()` function which uses regular expressions to split a given string based on a specified pattern. 

When dealing with corpora containing multiple documents, you may want to have separate lists of tokens for each document. You can achieve this by creating a list comprehension over the corpus and applying the `nltk.word_tokenize()` function to each element. Here's an example:

```python
corpus = ["I love programming.",
          "The sun rises in the east."]
          
tokenized_corpus = [nltk.word_tokenize(doc) for doc in corpus] 
          
for i in range(len(tokenized_corpus)):
    print("Document", i+1)
    print(tokenized_corpus[i])
```

Output:

```python
Document 1
['I', 'love', 'programming']
Document 2
['The','sun', 'rises', 'in', 'the', 'east']
```

## Stopwords
Stopwords are common words that do not provide much meaning to the context of a sentence and are usually removed before further processing. These stopwords vary based on the domain of interest and hence there is no single universal list of stopwords available for every task. One popular set of English stopwords provided by NLTK includes "is", "am", "are", "was", "were", "be", "been", "have", "has", "had", "do", "does", "did", "will", "would", "should", "can", "could", "may", "might", "must", "shall", "will", "would", "use", "used", "using". 

To remove stopwords from a list of tokens, you can create a list comprehension that filters out these words and then join them back together into a string using spaces. Here's an example:

```python
stopwords = ['the', 'and', 'but', 'or', 'not', 'an', 'a', 'the']
filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stopwords]
sentence =''.join(filtered_tokens)
print(sentence) # Output: programming
```

## Stemming vs Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization are both processes that reduce words to their root form. While stemming simply chops off the ends of words, lemmatization aims to bring words back to their original roots while ensuring that they are still meaningful.  

Stems of words often correspond to those used in the British National Corpus, whereas lemmas represent base forms rather than inflectional endings. For instance, the stemmer would transform the word "running" to "run," whereas the lemma of "running" would remain unchanged because it does not have any further changes. 

Both stemmers and lemmatizers rely on rules-based algorithms that require a dictionary of word pairs to map ambiguous words to their stems/lemmas. NLTK provides built-in support for many languages' stemmers and lemmatizers through the `PorterStemmer` class and `WordNetLemmatizer` class respectively. Both classes have their strengths and weaknesses, but generally speaking, stemmers work well for finding general trends and patterns in texts while lemmatizers work better for specific applications like named entity recognition.
