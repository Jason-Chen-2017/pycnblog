## 概述
Differential evolution (DE) is a popular optimization algorithm that belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). It generates solutions by iteratively trying out new candidate solutions based on their similarity to the previous ones through mutation and crossover operators. DE has been shown to perform particularly well for global optimization problems in many applications. The popularity of DE is also due to its simplicity, fast convergence rate, ability to handle non-convex problems with appropriate parameter settings, and scalability to large-scale optimization problems. However, even though it offers good performance, it may not be very efficient when applied to high-dimensional search spaces or computationally intensive objective functions. To improve the efficiency of DE, various parallel implementations have been proposed. Here we propose an implementation using Rcpp and OpenMP to exploit multi-core architecture to parallelize the evaluation of fitness function and selection process in differential evolution. 

In this article, we will first introduce the basic concepts of DE and provide necessary explanations to understand how the parallel implementation works. We then explain the core algorithm behind differential evolution and present the detailed steps involved in implementing it using Rcpp and OpenMP. Finally, we demonstrate the working of our parallel implementation by optimizing a mathematical function using DE. Our implementation should scale up better than other implementations since it exploits the benefits of parallelism offered by modern hardware architectures.

## Differential Evolution (DE)
### Basic Concepts
The main idea behind differential evolution is to generate offspring via a combination of two parent individuals. In each generation, multiple child individuals are generated from pairs of parents. Each pair consists of one individual from the current population and one individual selected randomly from the previous population. Two mutations can occur at random during the course of generating the offspring: componentwise difference mutation and uniform mutation. Componentwise difference mutation replaces the value of a gene with a perturbed version of itself based on the difference between the corresponding values in the parental individuals. Uniform mutation adds some random noise to a gene within a given range. The resulting offspring is evaluated according to its fitness, which determines whether it becomes part of the next generation or if it is discarded. Selection happens after all offspring are produced, selecting the best individuals as parents for the subsequent generation.

To implement differential evolution, we need three components:

1. Fitness Function: This function calculates the quality of an individual solution. A higher fitness score indicates a more accurate representation of the problem's target space. For example, in a regression context, the fitness function could measure the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted values and actual data points. 

2. Population Initialization: At the beginning of the optimization process, a set of initial guesses is used to create the population. Typically, these guesses are chosen randomly from the input domain, although techniques such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be used to initialize the population more efficiently.

3. Selection Process: After producing offspring candidates from each pair of parents, they must be selected for survival into the next generation. There are several ways to do this, including roulette wheel, tournament selection, stochastic universal sampling (SUS), and ranking selection.

### Algorithm Steps
Here are the general steps involved in applying the DE algorithm:

1. Generate initial population. Randomly select n individuals from the initial guess distribution. These individuals serve as starting points for constructing the rest of the population.

2. Repeat until termination condition met:

   a. Calculate fitness scores for all individuals in the current population.
   
       i. Apply fitness function to evaluate the fitness of each individual.
   
        ii. Assign fitness scores to individuals based on their relative importance. Higher fitness scores indicate better solutions, so they should receive a higher probability of being retained during selection.
   
   b. Generate offspring candidates by combining pairs of individuals from the current population and previous population. 
   
      i. Use componentwise difference mutation to modify the genotype of the offspring candidates by adding small differences to their parental genes.
      
      ii. Use uniform mutation to add some random noise to the offspring candidates' genes.
   
   c. Evaluate fitness of each offspring candidate.
   
     i. Apply fitness function to calculate the fitness of each offspring candidate.
   
  d. Select individuals for survival based on their fitness scores.
  
   e. Replace individuals in the current population with those selected for survival.
    
3. Return final result(s) and corresponding fitness values.
  
At each iteration step, the algorithm updates the fittest solutions obtained so far and selects them for reproduction. The repeated application of these steps produces ever-improving results over time.
