# 1.简介
  

Regression analysis is one of the most popular statistical techniques used in data science for analyzing relationships between variables. It helps us to find out whether there exists any relationship between two or more variables by estimating the strength and direction of that relationship using various statistical methods such as correlation coefficient and regression line.

Linear Regression (LR) is one of the simplest type of regression models where we have only one independent variable x and one dependent variable y. In this article, we will use Linear Regression to predict the salary based on years of experience of employees. 

We will follow these seven simple steps to create a successful regression model:

1. Importing libraries
2. Data Preparation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building
6. Evaluation Metrics
7. Deployment

Let's get started!

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminologies
## 2.1 Independent Variable(s) vs Dependent Variable
In statistics, an independent variable is a variable that has no effect on the outcome variable. A dependent variable on the other hand, does depend on another variable or factor. If we consider both of them together then we can say that they are related to each other.

For example, if we want to study the relationship between the number of hours studied per day and the grade obtained by a student in his/her examination, then the “hours studied” would be the independent variable, while the “grade” would be the dependent variable. The reason behind it is that students who spend more time studying gain higher grades. Therefore, hours studied is responsible for the change in grade.

If we have multiple independent variables in our dataset, we call it Multiple Linear Regression. However, since the goal of this article is LR with single feature, we will stick with simple Linear Regression here.

## 2.2 Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response variable y and a scalar predictor variable x. We assume a straight line equation : y = b + a*x, where "a" denotes the slope of the line and "b" is known as the intercept term. Here, "a" represents the rate of change in Y per unit change in X, which indicates how much Y increases when X increases. When a=0, we assume the line passes through the origin point.

The SLR is useful when the relationship between the predictor and response variables is linear. Understanding this assumption allows us to make predictions about the expected value of the response variable when given values of the predictor variable. This makes the method easy to understand but less accurate than polynomial and non-linear regressions that may capture complex patterns in the data. Nonetheless, it remains a good starting point for many applications.

## 2.3 Training Dataset vs Testing Dataset
Before building any machine learning model, it’s essential to divide the available dataset into training and testing datasets. The training dataset is used to train the ML algorithm, whereas the testing dataset is used to validate the trained model. During training, the algorithm learns from the input features and their corresponding output labels to minimize the error between predicted output and actual label. Once the model is trained, we test its accuracy on unseen data, i.e., the testing dataset. By doing so, we ensure that our model generalizes well to new data and provides meaningful insights.

Therefore, our task now becomes to split the original dataset into two parts - training set and testing set. Let’s call these sets A and B respectively. While dividing the data, we need to ensure that all the observations belonging to the same group fall under either A or B at random. One way to do this is to randomly assign observations to the two sets. Another approach involves stratifying the data according to some criteria before splitting it. For example, we might split the data into five subsets, namely A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 containing approximately equal percentage of samples belonging to different classes. Similarly, we can form another subset B containing the remaining data.

With A and B separately defined, we proceed to preparing them further. Specifically, we perform EDA on A to identify relevant factors influencing the outcome variable (salary). Based on our findings, we engineer new features and preprocess the data. Finally, we select appropriate regression model and tune its hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques.

After obtaining a satisfactory model, we apply it to the testing dataset to obtain final evaluation metrics such as mean squared errors (MSE), root mean square errors (RMSE), R-squared score, etc. These metrics help us assess the quality of our model and determine whether it needs further fine-tuning or improvement. Depending upon the results, we deploy the best model for prediction purposes.
