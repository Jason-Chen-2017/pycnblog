# 1.简介
  

从字面意思上理解，国家码或者说国别码就是为地区提供统一标识符号。目前全球已经形成了较为完整的国家码体系，其中最主要的国家码体系有ISO、ITU-T、MCC和MIC等。ISO和ITU-T分别由国际标准化组织负责制定和发布，而MCC和MIC则是由各个国家自行管理。所以，要详细了解这些国家码系统及其相关知识，就需要深入研究和了解这些系统背后的一些基本概念、术语和规则。本文将从这几个方面进行详细介绍。
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 ISO 3166
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a non-governmental organization that promotes international cooperation by defining standards and rules for industrial, commercial, financial, transportation, healthcare, environmental, security, military and other areas of science, technology, engineering, and medicine. It was founded in Geneva on October 1st, 1947 as the International Organization for Standardization. The primary purpose of ISO is to develop and maintain codes and standards that ensure data interoperability between different countries or regions around the world. 

The International Standardization for Publicly Accessible Telecommunications (ISOTPS) which was published in 2002 establishes ISO 3166 as a code system for country names, their abbreviations and codes used by national telecommunication authorities across the world. There are two versions of this standard: the first version was published in January 2000 and includes information about all countries identified by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the second revision was issued in May 2003 and includes additional information such as former countries and territories. 

In order to understand how this code system works, it's important to have a basic understanding of the following concepts and terminology. These terms will be mentioned throughout this article so please keep them handy!

### 2.1.1 Countries
A **country** is an independent political entity, existing as a self-sovereign nation consisting of a distinct sphere of territory from any other political entity in the world. Each country has its own laws, customs, languages, government structure, currency, and cultures. Countries can be divided into three main categories - Commonwealth countries, nation states, and dependent territories.

### 2.1.2 Regions and Subregions
A **region** refers to a broad area encompassing one or more countries with similar characteristics and economic and cultural traditions. A region may comprise multiple smaller subregions called **subregions**. Each subregion contains at least some part of the parent region but also shares borders with other subregions and possibly countries outside the region. Some countries belong to several regions while others may only belong to one region.

For example, Asia is a region that comprises many small subregions including Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Middle East and North America. Europe is another region that consists of five major subregions - Western Europe, Northern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia.

Countries within a single region typically share common cultures, values, and language. However, there may still be variations in legal systems, geography, and demographics due to differences in linguistic and historical factors.

Some countries like Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore form individual regions despite being largely part of China. Other countries like the US state of Alaska and Canada province of Quebec belong to both regions and subregions.

### 2.1.3 States/Provinces and Territories
A **state** or **province** is a political subdivision of a country where its people live and conduct their business. For countries with a federal constitution, each state represents a jurisdiction over certain territories and is responsible for exercising significant power over these territories. In general, governments divide up a country into provinces according to natural divisions, such as mountains, hills, valleys, plains, and forests. Countries without a federal constitution usually split up their territory into discrete states or regions, sometimes known as "territories".

Each state has its own legislature and executive branch, and also elects representatives to serve in parliament. States generally have autonomy over their resources, culture, and trade policies. While most states reside in a contiguous area, some border states may share borders with neighboring countries. State borders tend to be drawn on land and may be disputed if necessary.

For example, California is a state in the United States that borders most of the Pacific Ocean. New York City, Texas, and Florida are all separate states in the USA.

### 2.1.4 Dwellings and Settlements
A **settlement** or **dwelling** is an aggregate of buildings, roads, shores, and waterways that together provide habitat and shelter for people. Most countries have settlements scattered through various parts of the continent, particularly along coastlines and inland waters. Settlements vary greatly in size and density, ranging from very sparse hamlets to dense cities. Many countries limit the number of settlements they allow per person, making it difficult to compare wealth levels across the same location.

Settlements may consist of several units or sections separated by walls or gates. Units range from households to villages to manors and castles. The basic unit types include housing (with apartments, rooms, bathrooms, and kitchens), industry, commerce, education, entertainment, leisure, tourism, religious activities, and recreation.

While settlements may differ significantly in size, population numbers can often be compared using indirect measures like Gross National Product (GNP). GNP is calculated by multiplying the value of domestic output by the population of the country. Since the value of production varies greatly depending on sector, accounting for income distribution requires factoring in labour force participation rates. GNP provides a relatively accurate measure of overall economic output even when a country's population is highly unequal.
