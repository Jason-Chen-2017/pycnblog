# 1.简介
  

Serverless computing refers to a cloud-computing model that provides developers with the capability of building and running applications without managing servers or runtimes. Developers only need to focus on writing code for their application logic and delegate the management of server resources and scaling policies to the platform provider. This model allows users to build scalable, event-driven applications in a cost-effective manner while still maintaining control over the underlying infrastructure. However, serverless computing is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to reduce costs and enable agile development cycles. 

In this article, we will explore how to implement serverless computing on Kubernetes by leveraging the open source tool Knative. We will use a simple example to demonstrate the basic concepts and steps involved in implementing serverless functions using Knative. Additionally, we will cover advanced topics such as traffic splitting, autoscaling, logging, metrics collection, tracing, and security. At the end, we will discuss some best practices and challenges when implementing serverless computing on Kubernetes. By reading through this article, you should gain an understanding of: 

 - What is serverless computing?
 - Why is it so popular nowadays?
 - How does it work under the hood?
 - The different components involved in implementing serverless computing on Kubernetes?
 - Best practices and challenges when implementing serverless computing on Kubernetes?
 
This article assumes a solid working knowledge of Kubernetes and programming principles such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, objects, arrays, etc. You can get started by downloading and installing the latest version of Docker Desktop, Minikube, kubectl, and kubectx. If you are unfamiliar with these tools, I recommend starting with my other article on "Getting Started with Kubernetes". Once you have set up your local environment, let's dive into the core of this article!

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into implementation details, we must first understand several key terms used in serverless computing and Kubernetes. Here are some important definitions:

1. Function as a Service (FaaS): FaaS refers to a compute service where application logic is packaged as functions that can be executed on demand. In other words, FaaS allows developers to write code once and deploy it anywhere – making it easy to scale, manage, and secure their applications. FaaS platforms typically offer a range of features including auto-scaling, high availability, and managed services like database integration. Examples of FaaS platforms include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, IBM OpenWhisk, Oracle Functions, and many more.

2. Event Driven Architecture (EDA): EDA refers to a software architecture pattern where events trigger actions or workflows instead of data flows. It enables real-time processing of streams of data and supports loose coupling between microservices. Examples of EDA platforms include Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, Azure Event Hubs, IBM MQ, RabbitMQ, Splunk Streams, and many more.

3. Container Orchestration Platform (COP): COPs are responsible for coordinating the deployment, scaling, and management of containers across multiple hosts. They provide APIs for scheduling tasks, monitoring resource usage, and providing resiliency against hardware failures. Examples of COP platforms include Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, Google Kubernetes Engine, Microsoft AKS, VMware Tanzu, and many more.

4. Knative: Knative is an open-source project created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to simplify the development, deployment, and management of serverless applications on Kubernetes. Knative offers a range of features such as automatic scaling, routing rules, and blue-green deployments that make it easier to develop and deliver reliable, scalable applications quickly and easily. Knative builds upon Kubernetes’ extensive ecosystem and integrates seamlessly with various container orchestrators like Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Nomad, and Prometheus.

Now that we know the basics of serverless computing and Kubernetes, let’s move onto learning about what Knative actually is and how it works.
