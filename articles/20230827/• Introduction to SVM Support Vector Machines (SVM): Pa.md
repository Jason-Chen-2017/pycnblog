Support vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most powerful and popular machine learning algorithms for classification and regression problems. In this article, we will introduce SVMs in a simple yet comprehensive way using a classic example - linearly separable data with two classes. We also discuss how to apply different kernel functions such as polynomial or radial basis function kernel, select an appropriate value of C parameter, use cross-validation method to avoid overfitting, and evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc. Finally, we summarize several key points and leave out some advanced topics such as nonlinear support vector machines and hyperparameter tuning to keep things simple and straightforward.

In this part of the series, let’s start with understanding what is support vector machine? What makes it unique compared to other machine learning algorithms used today? And how does the algorithm work on a very basic level? Let's get started! 

## What is a Support Vector Machine?
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a type of supervised learning machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The goal of SVMs is to find the optimal boundary between two classes by maximizing the margin between them. This means creating a line or hyperplane which separates the data into distinct classes while keeping the misclassified samples at a minimum. It is often referred to as the "kernel trick", since SVMs transform input space by applying a non-linear transformation called the Kernel.

For example, consider a dataset consisting of two classes: blue circles and orange squares. A straight line cannot separate these classes because there may exist examples from both classes within the same decision region. However, if we add another point inside each class, we create more clear separation lines. These points known as support vectors have been marked with solid dots in the figure above. The objective of SVMs is to identify these support vectors and draw the decision boundaries that best separate the data into distinct classes.

One advantage of SVMs over logistic regression is their ability to handle high dimensional datasets where other methods like PCA may not perform well. Another reason is that they can naturally handle multi-class problems without the need for multiple binary classifiers, making them ideal for text categorization or spam detection.

## How Does SVM Work? 
The fundamental idea behind SVM is to find the maximum margin hyperplane that separates the data into classes while keeping the misclassifications at a minimum. To do this, SVM finds the projection of the training data onto the largest possible set of vectors while maintaining as much distance between the projected points as possible. Mathematically, we want to solve the following optimization problem:

$$ \min_{\omega,\alpha} \frac{1}{2}\left \| w \right \|^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^{n}\xi_i $$

subject to $ y^{(i)}(w^T x^{(i)} + b) \geq 1-\xi_i $, $\forall i$ and $\xi_i \geq 0$, $\forall i$. Here, $x^{(i)}$ represents the feature vector of the $ith$ instance, $y^{(i)}$ is either 1 or -1 depending on whether the $ith$ instance belongs to the positive or negative class respectively, $b$ is the bias term, $C$ is a regularization parameter that controls the tradeoff between minimizing the error rate and achieving a good margin.

We can interpret $w$ as the direction along which the hyperplane should be oriented so that its margin is maximized. Since we want to maximize the margin, we choose the $w$ vector that has the largest dot product with any given example, effectively finding the maximum margin hyperplane that separates the data into classes. The magnitude of the scalar product determines the degree of overlap between the example and the hyperplane. If the scalar product is zero, then the example lies exactly on the hyperplane.

To make predictions on new instances, we simply calculate the scalar product between the feature vector of the instance and the hyperplane equation. If the result is greater than 0, then the prediction is positive; otherwise, it is negative.

The purpose of adding the slack variable $\xi_i$ is to ensure that all mistakes made during the optimization process are punished severely. Specifically, when $\xi_i$ becomes small enough, we ignore the constraint violation by setting $\xi_i = 0$. By doing so, we relax the constraints and allow the classifier to produce smaller errors.

However, due to the presence of the slack variables, SVMs can become unstable and diverge during training. Therefore, we typically use various techniques such as convex programming, penalty terms, and decreasing C values to prevent overfitting. In summary, here are the main steps involved in SVM training:

1. Convert the data into standard form $(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})$ where $x^{(i)}\in R^{d}$, $y^{(i)} \in {-1,+1}$.
2. For a given value of $C$, solve the optimization problem using quadratic programming or gradient descent.
3. Use cross validation to measure the performance of the model.
4. Select the value of $C$ based on the results obtained through cross validation.

Now, let's move on to look at how to implement SVM in Python code and apply it to a classic example of linearly separable data with two classes.
