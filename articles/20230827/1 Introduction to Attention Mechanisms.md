# 2.Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Concepts
Attention mechanisms are a type of model that assign more weight to certain parts of the input data for predicting or generating the output. The attention models are widely used in NLP tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, text summarization, and question answering. In simple terms, an attention model assigns weights to different parts of the input sequence based on their relevance to the current time step being processed. This is achieved by using a special type of neural network layer called self-attention layers which allows each position in the sequence to attend over all other positions in the sequence at once. 

Therefore, an attention mechanism involves three main components: 

1. A query vector Q - represents what we want to find in the input data. 

2. Key vectors K - represent similarities between the query vector and the input elements. 

3. Value vectors V - represent the actual values stored in the input elements. 

The goal of the attention mechanism is to generate a weighted representation of the input data where the importance of each part of the data is considered during inference. Self-attention is a type of attention mechanism that uses the same set of key and value vectors across all time steps in the sequence. On the contrary, regular attention mechanisms use a separate set of keys and values for each time step. Some attention mechanisms also include a relative position encoding technique. Relative positional encodings add information about the distance between two elements in the input sequence, which can be helpful in capturing long-range dependencies.

Overall, an attention mechanism enables a deep learning system to focus its attention on relevant parts of the input sequence while ignoring irrelevant details, enabling it to capture patterns within complex natural language inputs.

In Fig 1 above, attention mechanisms work by creating a soft alignment score between every element in the input sequence and the query vector Q. These scores help determine the degree of importance given to each word in the sequence when generating the output. The resulting alignment scores are then combined through another function to produce a final output. In this way, attention mechanisms act like learnable feature extractors that filter out noise from the input sequence and return only the important features needed to make predictions or generate new outputs.

## 2.2 Terminology
Before we proceed into further detail, let's briefly define some terminology that will be useful throughout our discussion of attention mechanisms. Here are some key concepts related to attention mechanisms:

1. Query Vectors: In general, a query vector refers to the representation learned by the transformer network that is queried to retrieve relevant information from the input sequence. It is often denoted as q in the literature. The query vector captures the intent behind the user's utterance, i.e., the desired output produced by the chatbot or machine translation engine.

2. Key Vectors: Key vectors are closely related to query vectors but instead of representing specific words or phrases, they provide insights into the meaning and structure of the entire input sequence. They are generated by multiplying the hidden states with a matrix of learned weights. Key vectors are typically referred to as k in the literature.

3. Value Vectors: Value vectors correspond directly to the original values present in the input sequence, usually denoted as v. Each value vector corresponds to one particular piece of information contained in the input sequence. The values are extracted based on their corresponding keys before applying any activation functions.

4. Dot Product Attention: One of the simplest types of attention mechanism is dot product attention, which computes the similarity between the query vector and the key vectors using dot products. The basic idea is to take the dot product of the query vector and each key vector, and normalize these results to obtain a probability distribution over the input sequence. This distribution reflects the level of attention to each portion of the input sequence depending on their respective query and key vectors. 

5. Multi-Head Attention: Multi-head attention is a variant of attention mechanisms that leverages multiple heads to compute attention in parallel. Instead of having just one head computing the attention, multi-head attention splits the input sequence into several sub-sequences and applies attention independently to each subsequence. This helps to reduce the amount of redundant computation required to perform attention computations. 

6. Scaled Dot-Product Attention: Another variation of the dot product attention mechanism is scaled dot-product attention. In addition to performing the normal dot product operation, scaled dot-product attention divides each attention score by the square root of the dimensionality of the key vectors. This reduces the variance of the attention scores and improves training stability. 

7. Positional Encoding: Positional encoding is a technique that adds information about the position of the tokens in the sequence without explicitly accounting for their order. It is added to the embedding layer of the transformer networks to improve performance. In practice, positional embeddings are created using sine and cosine functions applied to a fixed length vector. More specifically, positional embeddings are created using functions of the form sin(pos / power_of_2i), cos(pos / power_of_2i), where pos is the position of the token in the sequence and i ranges from 0 to d-1, where d is the dimensionality of the embeddings. 

8. Transformer Networks: Transformer networks are a class of neural network architectures introduced by Vaswani et al. in their paper "Attention Is All You Need." These models combine ideas from convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as attention mechanisms, to create powerful end-to-end models for many natural language processing tasks.
