Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library for the Python programming language that provides various types of charts and graphs. In this article, we will learn how to create basic visualizations using matplotlib library in Python by creating line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms. We will also discuss other useful features such as setting axis labels, titles, legends, and adding annotations. Finally, we will present some advanced concepts such as subplots and color maps which can help us create complex visualizations with ease.
Before starting the article, let’s understand what is meant by data visualization? Data visualization refers to the process of converting raw data into graphical representations that are easy to interpret and convey insights quickly. It helps us understand patterns, trends, and outliers in our data more clearly. 

In this article, we will use the following sample dataset:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

np.random.seed(1) # set seed for reproducibility

# Generate random data
x = np.arange(0, 10, step=0.1)
y1 = np.sin(x) + np.random.normal(scale=0.2, size=len(x))
y2 = np.cos(x) - np.random.normal(scale=0.2, size=len(x))
df = pd.DataFrame({'data': y1+y2})

print("Dataframe:")
print(df)
```

Output:

```python
      data
0  0.9879
1  0.5357
2  1.1991
3  0.8783
4  1.1029
5  0.8323
6  0.5375
7  1.0376
8  1.1469
9  0.4891
```

This dataframe has two columns ‘data’ containing values generated from sinusoidal function and cosine function respectively. The code above generates an artificial dataset consisting of noisy sine and cosine curves.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## What Is A Visualization?
Data visualization is a technique used to communicate information through images, videos or interactive dashboards. These visualizations should be designed to accurately represent the underlying relationships between variables, revealing patterns and trends that could not be found otherwise. Good data visualization techniques can make it easier for users to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.

To create a good visualization, it is essential to choose the right type of chart or graph that best reflects your data. Here are five common types of charts commonly used in data visualization:

1. Line Charts: Line charts show changes over time or across categories. They provide insight into how a variable changes over time or under different conditions. 

2. Bar Charts: Bar charts display categorical data on a vertical or horizontal scale. Each category is represented by a rectangular block, with its height indicating the value of the corresponding variable. 

3. Scatter Plot: Scatter plots are used to compare two numerical variables against each other. Each point represents a combination of two variables, and the distance between them indicates their correlation. 

4. Pie Charts: Pie charts provide a way to visualize proportions of a whole. You can use pie charts when you have one categorical variable that is divided into multiple segments. 

5. Histograms: Histograms show distributions of continuous data, grouping similar values together and displaying their frequencies. They can be used to identify skewed data and measure the spread of a distribution. 

Sometimes, there may be additional elements required to enhance these charts, such as textual annotations or legend labels. Other times, they may need special attention to detail to ensure that they stand out amongst all the others. For example, adding clear and concise titles, captions, and axis labels can make your visualizations stand out from the crowd.

Now that we know about the basics of data visualization, let’s move on to learning how to use the `matplotlib` library in Python to create these visualizations.<|im_sep|>
