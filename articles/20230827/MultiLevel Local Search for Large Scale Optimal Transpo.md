随着对人体组织及其发育功能的关注，我们越来越需要解决两个样本之间的差异性建模、去噪、学习、预测等各种领域的问题。而在这些问题中，最重要且最困难的是将人类基因组上的表达细胞（RNA）转移到另外一个物种或器官上。如何从源基因组准确地分配并同时克服目标细胞上的压力（如血糖、免疫应答）是这些问题的一个关键部分。

Optimal transport (OT) is a mathematical framework that provides a solution to this problem of gene transfer by finding the optimal matching between corresponding cells from two different organisms or tissues. OT has been used extensively in various biomedical imaging applications such as computational pathology, cancer detection, and prognosis, among others. However, the computationally intensive nature of these problems often makes them challenging to solve efficiently with current optimization algorithms.

In this work, we propose a new algorithmic framework called Multi-Level Local Search (MLS), which allows us to compute the optimal transport maps and assignments in large scale settings. We demonstrate its effectiveness on three real-world biomedical datasets by analyzing their properties such as resolution, sensitivity, time complexity, and robustness against noise. We also provide insights into how MLS works and what are some of its advantages over other state-of-the-art methods such as Frank-Wolfe iteration or Sinkhorn distance. Finally, we discuss several possible future directions for improving MLS based on our research findings.

Optimal transport has become a fundamental tool in solving many complex imaging problems involving mapping one distribution onto another. There exist numerous algorithms for computing OT solutions, ranging from greedy heuristics to more sophisticated exact solvers like LP formulations and kernel methods. Despite their success, most of these methods suffer from poor performance when applied to large scale problems due to their quadratic runtime complexities. This motivates the development of multi-level optimizers that approximate the global optimum while still maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two prominent approaches to achieve this goal are Frank-Wolfe iterations and gradient descent with implicit reparameterization tricks. Both these techniques aim to find an approximation of the true gradient of the objective function while making few assumptions about the geometry of the underlying manifolds. These iterative procedures rely heavily on regularization terms to avoid getting stuck in local minima, leading to slower convergence rates compared to classical steepest descent approaches.

Recently, there have been significant developments in the field of deep learning-based approaches to image registration tasks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs have shown impressive results in medical image analysis tasks such as breast cancer detection using MRI images. Nevertheless, these models are not scalable enough to handle large-scale problems and are prone to overfitting. To address this limitation, there have emerged variants of CNN architectures that use deeper layers to capture fine-grained features at multiple scales, but they typically require extensive data augmentation and training strategies to improve generalizability. Another approach to reduce the computational cost of large-scale OT problems is through spectral graph theory, where the adjacency matrix of the input distributions can be decomposed into smaller submatrices that better model the geometry of the manifolds involved. Other approaches attempt to learn latent representations of source and target distributions using generative models such as VAEs or GANs, but the inference step remains expensive. Thus, there is a need for efficient algorithms for computing OT mappings and assignments without relying too much on handcrafted features or complex data preprocessing pipelines.
