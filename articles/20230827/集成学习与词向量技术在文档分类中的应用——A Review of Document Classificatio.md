Document classification is an important problem in natural language processing (NLP) where the goal is to assign a specific category or class label to a given text document based on its content. One common approach for this task involves using machine learning algorithms that can learn patterns from large sets of labeled documents and then use these learned features for predicting the categories of new unseen data points. In recent years, there has been significant progress towards achieving high-quality document classifiers by leveraging both statistical techniques such as bag-of-words and neural networks, and deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers. This article reviews various approaches and techniques used for building document classifiers using word embeddings and ensemble methods.
In particular, we will focus on two types of techniques:

1. Bag-of-Words + Classifier: The first technique consists of applying traditional machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM) etc., followed by a classifier such as kNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests etc. These classifiers typically rely on feature engineering techniques such as bag-of-words to represent the input text data into numerical vectors which are fed directly into the classifier model. However, bag-of-words representation may not capture semantic information present in the text. Therefore, it would be better to incorporate additional features derived from the context of each word to improve the performance of the classifier. 

2. Word Embeddings + Ensembles: The second technique uses pre-trained word embeddings obtained from popular embedding models such as GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText etc. These embeddings map each unique word to a dense vector representation which captures the meaning of the corresponding words in the sentence. Once trained, they can be combined with other machine learning techniques to build more complex models that can handle sparse and noisy input data and provide more accurate predictions than bag-of-words representations alone. Furthermore, ensemble techniques can further improve the overall accuracy of the final classifier by combining multiple base models trained on different subsets of the dataset. 

To demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques, we will apply them to a real-world document classification task using Python programming language and scikit-learn library. Specifically, we will use the 20 Newsgroups dataset available through Scikit-learn's built-in datasets module. We will also compare the performance of our proposed techniques against several baseline models provided by scikit-learn library. Finally, we will discuss some of the limitations and potential improvements of the current state of art techniques for document classification tasks. Overall, our work aims to contribute towards understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of using word embeddings and ensemble techniques alongside traditional machine learning algorithms for building high-quality document classifiers.
# 2. 词嵌入的定义和作用
Word embedding is a powerful tool in natural language processing (NLP) because it allows us to represent words and phrases in a low-dimensional space while retaining most of their semantic relationships. It does so by mapping each word or phrase to a dense vector of fixed size, where similar words have similar vectors, and dissimilar words have highly dissimilar vectors. Traditionally, word embeddings were learned from a corpus of texts consisting of billions of tokens. Today, many popular NLP libraries come equipped with pre-trained word embeddings, such as GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText, which can help speed up the process of training models for tasks related to NLP. Word embeddings allow us to perform interesting tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition (NER), and question answering. Additionally, they enable applications such as word analogy solving, text summarization, and document clustering.

The fundamental idea behind the working of word embeddings is to train a distributed representation of words in such a way that words that appear frequently together are represented by similar vectors, whereas rare words are represented by dissimilar vectors. Intuitively, if two words are similar in terms of their usage, then they should occur often in close proximity within sentences; conversely, if two words are unrelated, then they should occur far apart within sentences. By doing this, we hope to capture semantic relationships between words that might otherwise go overlooked by traditional bag-of-words techniques. 

However, word embeddings suffer from certain limitations and shortcomings. Firstly, due to the discrete nature of words, the number of possible combinations of distinct words grows exponentially with the vocabulary size. As a result, representing all possible words in a continuous space would require an enormous amount of memory and computational resources, making traditional matrix factorization techniques impractical for large vocabularies. Secondly, word embeddings do not consider syntactic or semantic relationships between words. For instance, "man" and "woman" are usually thought of as opposites but they share the same root form "man". To capture these relationships, we need to look beyond individual word embeddings and instead leverage dependency parsing trees, constituency grammars, and other linguistic resources. Thirdly, existing word embeddings are trained on very small corpora and may not generalize well to out-of-domain scenarios. Fourthly, even though modern deep learning models can achieve good results when fine-tuned on limited amounts of supervised data, they still struggle to capture long-range dependencies across entire sentences without extensive manual annotation or joint training on massive unannotated corpora.

Overall, despite these challenges, word embeddings have proven themselves to be one of the most effective tools in modern NLP for capturing semantic relationships between words and providing improved accuracy in a wide range of natural language processing tasks.
