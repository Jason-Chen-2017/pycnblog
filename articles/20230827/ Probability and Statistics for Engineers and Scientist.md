## 一、概述
>Probability is the mathematical study of randomly occurring events. It involves quantifying uncertainties in nature by describing their possible outcomes or probabilities based on observed data. Statistical analysis helps to make sense of large amounts of data by extracting useful information that can be used to model complex systems with higher accuracy. In this article, we will explore some basic concepts in probability and statistics and see how they are applied in real-world scenarios. This includes a brief history of probability, the basic definitions and properties of random variables, descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, correlation coefficient, and statistical hypothesis testing using the t-test, ANOVA test, Chi-square test, and Fisher’s exact test. We also cover popular distributions like normal distribution, binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, exponential distribution, and Gamma distribution along with commonly used estimators like sample mean, median, mode, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and confidence interval construction. Finally, we discuss various techniques for dealing with non-linear relationships between variables, including scatter plots, regression lines, logarithmic transformations, and boxplots. Overall, these tools provide an essential toolkit for anyone interested in applying probability and statistics to solve problems in science, engineering, finance, and other fields.

Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists (PSET) is designed to provide engineers, scientists, and IT professionals with a comprehensive introduction to probabilistic modeling and statistical analysis. The article provides detailed explanations of key probability and statistics concepts and techniques while demonstrating examples in Python programming language. PSET aims to help readers understand and apply statistical methods and models effectively to various types of problems across various disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, economics, finance, marketing, manufacturing, and others. 

This article assumes readers have basic knowledge about probability theory and statistical inference. If you are not familiar with these topics, we recommend checking out our free articles:
