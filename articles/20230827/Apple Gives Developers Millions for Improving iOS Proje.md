# 2.1 Background Introduction
In December 2017, Apple launched the iPhone X, one of the biggest leapfrogging events in the history of smartphones. The device had a massive screen that could show everything from beautiful photos to high-definition video content, while simultaneously offering amazing battery life and price performance. As a result, many consumers were hooked and wanted access to even better mobile payment solutions such as Apple Pay. 

However, until now, developers had few options to implement Apple Pay without having to use third-party libraries or plugins. While Apple did provide documentation on how to set up Apple Pay, the process was complex and time-consuming. Furthermore, Apple Pay required special handling and validation compared to other types of payment methods due to its unique characteristics like debit cards and 3D Secure authentication. 

To overcome these challenges, Apple introduced the Payment Authorization Networks (PAN) framework in iOS 9. This framework provides an easy-to-use interface for developers to handle Apple Pay transactions within their apps. The PAN framework includes classes, protocols, and methods that make it easy to request authorization and perform transactions using Apple Pay. Additionally, Apple released several sample code snippets that demonstrate how to integrate Apple Pay into existing apps and encourage developers to explore the full range of capabilities provided by Apple Pay. These samples illustrate both basic usage scenarios and advanced techniques such as tokenization and background processing. 

The availability of Apple Pay also meant that developers had the opportunity to tap into hundreds of millions of iPads, iPhones, and Mac computers around the globe. By enabling users to pay directly within their apps, Apple Pay has become a platform for innovators and brands to engage with consumers. The growth of Apple Pay has further motivated developers to invest in creating great experiences for their users while still respecting security and privacy concerns. 

Overall, Apple Pay represents a fundamental change in the way developers think about payments on mobile devices. It enables developers to easily add powerful, flexible, and secure payment options to their apps while also encouraging greater transparency and accountability in financial transaction processes. However, developers must keep in mind that Apple Pay requires careful integration and testing to ensure that it meets the needs of individual users and their data protection policies.
