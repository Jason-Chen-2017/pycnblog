In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key technology in the modern world. It provides us with a way to automate routine tasks and solve complex problems that were once considered impossible or too time-consuming for humans. This article will discuss some of the advantages of using AI over rule-based systems in various fields such as medicine, engineering, finance, transportation, healthcare, etc. We will also highlight the top reasons why it is better than rule-based systems for each field and explore how they can be used to make significant improvements in these areas.

Rule-based systems are systems that operate based on rules that are created by experts. These systems work by processing input data according to pre-defined rules, which makes them easy to understand, use, and maintain. However, they have limitations compared to AI models, especially when applied to more complex scenarios. For instance, rule-based systems may not always provide the best results because they often lack the ability to consider multiple factors simultaneously. Moreover, their underlying logic may not be able to adapt quickly to changing situations, making them unsuitable for fast-paced environments like the real world. Therefore, we need to develop effective strategies to integrate AI into our existing systems to benefit from its increased accuracy, robustness, and scalability. 

This article will focus on the following five main topics:

1. Medical Robotics
2. Financial Analysis
3. Navigation Aids 
4. Transportation Management 
5. Healthcare Applications

We will examine each topic in depth and explain the benefits of integrating AI into rule-based systems to improve performance in specific domains. Finally, we will suggest ways to implement and deploy AI-powered solutions. Overall, this article will serve as an educational tool for decision-makers and developers interested in exploring the potential benefits of integrating AI into their current systems.


# 2. Medical Robotics
# 2.1 Background

One of the most common applications of robotics today is in medical treatment. Medical robots can help treat patients faster, cheaper, and better than other methods, but traditional medical procedures still rely heavily on human intervention. One approach to improving patient care through automated surgery is known as robotic assistance (RA). RA involves replacing the surgeon’s hands with robotic arms, allowing the assistant to control the surgical tools without relying on someone else's experience. By automating some of the steps involved in surgery, RA can reduce errors and improve patient outcomes.

However, implementing RA fully requires a deep understanding of surgery techniques and clinical expertise. In fact, until recently, it was thought that RA could only lead to minor improvements in surgical outcomes due to technical limitations. Nevertheless, new technologies have made progress towards fully autonomous surgery at much higher speeds. Nonetheless, incorporating these advancements into RA remains a challenge as it requires advanced machine learning algorithms, computational power, and large amounts of labeled training data. To address this gap, researchers have developed new approaches called active learning and transfer learning, which allow machines to learn from sparse annotations instead of requiring extensive manual labeling effort. Within the past few years, these techniques have been successfully applied to RA, leading to promising results.

Despite the impressive achievements of RA, there remain challenges faced by physicians who want to take advantage of automation while maintaining high standards of quality of life during surgery. Desperate times call for more efficient techniques that involve less human interaction. Other approaches include generating feedback automatically based on surgical artifacts or using crowdsourcing platforms to collect biometric data from patients. The aim is to minimize the need for specialists and increase patient safety. Clinical trials of these techniques must first show promise before being approved for widespread use. While integration of AI into medical robotics is currently focused primarily on surgery, there is growing interest in developing similar capabilities for other areas of medical diagnosis and treatment such as eye examination, mammogram analysis, and X-ray imaging. 


# 2.2 Integration Approaches 
To integrate AI into medical robotics for improved surgical outcomes, several approaches have been proposed. Some of the most successful ones include: 

1. **Active Learning:** Active learning refers to training models on small sets of annotated examples, rather than the entire dataset. The goal is to obtain samples with highly informative labels so that the model can learn to generalize well to unseen instances. The core idea behind active learning is to select examples with the highest uncertainty to determine whether they are likely to be correct or mislabeled, and then request additional annotations for those points. The process continues iteratively until a satisfactory level of accuracy is achieved.

2. **Transfer Learning:** Transfer learning is another technique where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a target task by adjusting the network architecture or retraining the last layer(s) of the network using a smaller dataset. The goal is to leverage the knowledge learned in a related domain to improve the performance on a new task. Here, a popular approach is to initialize the feature extractor layers of the classifier using weights trained on a large-scale image classification dataset, and train just the final layer on the target task.

3. **Deep reinforcement learning:** Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combines reinforcement learning with neural networks to optimize the policies for agent actions. An RL agent learns to maximize a reward function by interacting with the environment in real-time. The algorithm balances exploration of newly discovered states with exploitation of the best previously seen policy. DRL can achieve state-of-the-art performance in many challenging games, including Atari video games and board games. By applying DRL to medical robotics, researchers hope to find better policies for controlling the surgeries to achieve better outcomes.

4. **Cooperative Learning:** Cooperative learning aims to enable multiple agents to collaborate to improve the performance of a system. Traditional supervised learning assumes that all agents are rational and act independently. However, in medical robotics, it is important to consider interactions between different medical professionals. To promote cooperation among doctors, researchers have proposed techniques such as cross-modal annotation, ensemble learning, and interactive guidance. Cross-modal annotation involves annotating images and videos simultaneously, enabling multi-disciplinary teams to contribute expertise to individual cases. Ensemble learning combines predictions from multiple models to produce a consensus decision. Interactive guidance allows doctors to dynamically update plans based on surgeon actions and evaluations.

5. **Human in the Loop:** Human in the loop refers to training the model by interacting directly with the doctor in real-time, receiving feedback about the decisions and the resulting outcomes. Researchers have developed techniques for modeling interpersonal dynamics and designing interfaces that emphasize collaboration and accountability. In some cases, the interface even includes augmented reality displays that visualize the actual operation and provide visualizations of feedback to the surgeon.

All of these approaches involve building systems that require specialized hardware and infrastructure. As a result, deploying these technologies may involve lengthy development cycles and costs that are prohibitively expensive for larger organizations. Nonetheless, despite the complexity of these approaches, they offer exciting possibilities for improving medical robotics by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care.
