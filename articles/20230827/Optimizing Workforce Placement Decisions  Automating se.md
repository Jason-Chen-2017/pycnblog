# 2.1 Introduction
The problem of optimally allocating work force resources is critical for many organizations. For instance, nonprofits and small businesses facing difficulty in finding sufficient staff members are experiencing significant costs due to lack of qualified candidates or insufficient training. In contrast, large corporations have many more employees working harder than ever before. They need an efficient way to match new talent and fill up vacancies efficiently while still maintaining competitive edge. 

Given these challenges, effective solutions that can automate placement decisions using machine learning algorithms are crucial to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and reduced costs. To achieve optimal results, it is essential to consider a wide range of factors such as cultural similarity, education level, skills, experience, ethnicity, disability status, age, etc., which impact how individuals are evaluated during the hiring process. Additionally, other organizational policies like payroll taxation, benefits eligibility criteria, team structure, and workload balance also play a role in determining whether a candidate is selected over another. All these factors add to the complexity of the optimization problem.

To address this challenge, several techniques have been developed based on mathematical optimization methods, such as linear programming, integer programming, mixed-integer programming, heuristic approaches, neural networks, genetic algorithms, metaheuristics, etc. These techniques aim to find a global optimum that satisfies all constraints and objectives simultaneously. The approach followed by most organizations today involves manually analyzing data, building rules, and creating processes to assign roles and responsibilities. However, manual intervention can be time consuming, expensive, and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex decision-making problems. Therefore, automated methods that can generate optimized solutions quickly and accurately are needed to reduce costs, enhance recruitment effectiveness, and optimize work force utilization.

In this blog post, we propose a novel solution that incorporates multiple optimization strategies to automatically select and deploy workers in order to maximize profitability, job satisfaction, and employee retention rates. Specifically, we present two optimization algorithms: (i) Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and (ii) Genetic Algorithm (GA). We demonstrate our method using use case scenarios from different industries, including healthcare, retail, and manufacturing. This blog post provides a comprehensive overview of human resource management techniques that could be used in future work to improve the productivity, efficacy, and sustainability of organizations.
# 2.2 Terminology & Concepts
Before we delve into the details of our proposed solution, let’s briefly go through some important terminologies and concepts.
## Employee Attributes
Among the various attributes associated with each employee, there are several key ones that influence their potential value for hire: experience, skill set, knowledge, dedication, personality traits, performance evaluation, and communication skills. Here are some common examples of employee attributes:

1. Experience: Determines how capable an individual is at performing certain tasks and activities. Higher levels of experience correlate with higher salary expectations and advancement opportunities within an organization.

2. Skill Set: A combination of technical expertise, business acumen, and cultural sensitivity that make someone unique in an organization. Skills vary from one organization to another depending on the industry and size.

3. Knowledge: A person’s understanding and ability to apply learned information to practical situations. Good knowledge enables individuals to effectively perform specific tasks and contribute positively to an organization.

4. Dedication: A measure of hardwork, perseverance, commitment, and focus required to accomplish a task or solve a problem. It determines if an individual can be trusted to deliver high quality work under pressure.

5. Personality Traits: Impressions formed after interacting with people show an individual’s attitude, interests, values, motivations, concerns, emotions, temperament, and stances towards life. Research suggests that strong personalities tend to create better teams and lead to better outcomes.

6. Performance Evaluation: Measures of how well an individual has performed in the past few years, including achievements, appraisals, evaluations, and reviews. These measures provide insights into an individual’s leadership qualities and character development, and help managers determine the best fit for their staff members.

7. Communication Skills: Ability to communicate ideas clearly, concisely, and persuasively, as well as follow instructions and resolve conflicts successfully. Good communication skills enable an individual to effectively interact with colleagues and supervisors, as well as with clients, vendors, and partners.
## Resource Allocation Problem
One of the core components of the optimization problem is to allocate work force resources among various departments, positions, and functions in an efficient manner while minimizing costs. Let $I$ denote the set of possible individuals to choose from, where each individual $\in I$ corresponds to a set of employee attributes. Similarly, let $J$ denote the set of available jobs/positions/departments, where each job/position/department $\in J$ represents a position or department offered by an organization. Finally, let $D$ represent the set of resources (human power, tools, facilities, etc.) available in the organization, where each resource $\in D$ corresponds to a particular type of asset, such as cash flow, physical space, equipment, or finance.

We assume that there exists an objective function $f(x)$ that aims to maximize profitability, job satisfaction, or employee retention rate given the current state of the organization. The first step is to define the decision variables $x_{ij}$ as follows:

$$x_{ij} = \begin{cases}
    1,\text{if}\ i\ selects\ j \\
    0,\text{otherwise}
\end{cases},\quad \forall i\in I,j\in J.$$

This variable indicates whether individual $i$ selects job/position/department $j$. If $x_{ij}=1$, then individual $i$ chooses to work in job/position/department $j$. Otherwise, they do not take any responsibility for that job/position/department. Note that choosing zero does not necessarily mean that the individual is unemployed, because a candidate might be ineligible for a particular position but still desires to continue applying elsewhere.

Next, we need to specify the objective function $f(x)$ that considers several parameters. We consider three metrics: profitability ($p$), job satisfaction ($q$), and employee retention rate ($r$). Each metric takes into account a specific aspect of the employee’s work experience, skills, performance rating, recommendation letter, bonus package, promotions, and compensation plan. The profitability metric reflects the economic benefit of selecting an individual for a particular job/position/department. Job satisfaction refers to the extent to which the individual performs the assigned tasks according to expectation. Lastly, employee retention rate measures how long an individual stays in their current position compared to the total number of years they have worked. All three metrics should be maximized simultaneously to obtain the maximum overall benefit.

Finally, we need to specify the constraint equations that limit the search space of feasible solutions. First, we impose the budget constraint $c_j\geq b_j,\ \forall j\in J$, where $b_j$ represents the budget allocated for job/position/department $j$. Second, we require that only one individual can work in a single job/position/department:

$$\sum_{i\in I}{x_{ij}}\leq 1,\ \forall j\in J.$$

Third, we require that every job/position/department must be filled either completely or partially by a fixed number of individuals. Moreover, we want to avoid assigning individuals to positions that would result in a loss of profitability. Therefore, we constrain the minimum level of profitability for a particular job/position/department:

$$\sum_{i\in I}{p_{ij}x_{ij}}\geq p^*_j,\ \forall j\in J,$$

where $p_{ij}$ represents the profitability score of individual $i$ for job/position/department $j$. Finally, we allow for flexibility in the choice of individuals who share the same job/position/department. To do so, we introduce the concept of shared responsibility $z_{ij}$, which represents the fraction of the salary that individual $i$ contributes to the job/position/department $j$:

$$z_{ij}=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K}{w_kx_{ik}}}{s_j},\ \forall i\in I,j\in J,$$

where $K$ represents the number of positions open for job/position/department $j$, $w_k$ represents the weight of position $k$, and $s_j$ represents the salary of job/position/department $j$. By setting $\sum_{k=1}^{K}{w_kz_{kj}}=1$, we indicate that the sum of contributions by each individual equals the full salary amount. Thus, we can write:

$$\sum_{i\in I}{z_{ij}\cdot x_{ij}}\geq z^*_{j},\ \forall j\in J,$$

where $z_{ij}$ represents the contribution percentage of individual $i$ to job/position/department $j$. Overall, the model can be written mathematically as:

$$
\begin{array}{llcl}
    \max & f(x) &=& \sum_{i\in I}{\sum_{j\in J}{p_{ij}(r_{ij}-\gamma_{ij})\cdot x_{ij}}} + c^{\mathrm{T}}\cdot x\\

                & & & \sum_{i\in I}{z_{ij}\cdot x_{ij}}\geq z^*_{j},\ \forall j\in J \\

        %     &\forall i\in I,\forall j\in J \\ &\forall l\in L \\ 
                % &\begin{aligned}[t]&+\sum_{k=1}^{K}{d^{il}_{\cdot k}\cdot n^{kl}_{\cdot ij}}&\geq&\theta_{l}\\
                                % &+\epsilon^{il}_{\cdot jj}&\leq&\gamma_{ij}\\
                                % &+d^{il}_{jk}\cdot y^{kl}&\leq&n^{kl}_{\cdot ij}\end{aligned} \\ 
        % \forall i\in I,\forall j\in J \\ &\forall l\in L,\forall k\in K \\ 
                % &\begin{aligned}[t]&y^{kl}=e^{-\psi_{lk}}\cdot u^{kl}+(1-e^{-\psi_{lk}})p^{kl}+\alpha_{kl}\\
                    % &u^{kl}=a_{lk}\cdot m^{kl}+(1-a_{lk})\sqrt{\sum_{m=1}^{M}{v_{lm}^{\prime}w_{km}}}\\ 
                    % &a_{lk}\leq b_{lk},\forall k\in K,\forall l\in L\end{aligned} \\ 
    \end{array}$$
