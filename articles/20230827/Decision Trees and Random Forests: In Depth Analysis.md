Decision trees and random forests are two popular algorithms used for classification problems in machine learning. They both produce accurate models that can be used to make predictions on new data points. However, their behavior is often different due to the way they train and split the data into smaller subsets to create the decision tree or forest. This article will explain how these algorithms work at a deeper level of abstraction, with mathematical formulas and code examples. The article also covers key concepts like information gain, variable importance, overfitting, and underfitting, and will discuss its limitations and potential improvements in specific applications. Finally, we'll cover some practical tips and tricks when using decision trees and random forests in practice, including hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and algorithm selection. 

## 2. Background Introduction
In supervised machine learning, we have labeled training data containing inputs and outputs that we want our model to learn from. We then use this labeled dataset to train an algorithm (known as a classifier) that maps inputs to outputs based on its learned parameters. Once trained, the classifier can take unlabeled input data and predict its corresponding output value(s). Classifiers typically fall into one of three categories: 

1. Binary Classification - Labels belong to only two classes such as Yes/No, True/False, etc., while the goal is to classify new instances into those two classes based on some features.

2. Multi-Class Classification - Labels belong to more than two classes such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, etc., where each instance belongs to exactly one class among several possible choices.

3. Regression - Labels represent continuous values such as prices, temperatures, sales figures, etc., and the goal is to predict the output value given certain features.

Classification trees and random forests are commonly used for binary and multi-class classification tasks because they can handle large datasets and provide interpretable models. Both techniques recursively partition the input space into smaller subspaces, until a leaf node in the resulting tree gives a predicted label. The recursive process stops when all instances in a particular region belong to the same class or when there are no more splits that improve the accuracy of the model. For example, consider the following decision tree: 


In this tree, the root node represents the overall prediction made by the model; if the current region contains red points, it assigns "Yes" as the final result. On the left branch, there are two nodes representing two possible outcomes for green points; according to their proximity to the vertical line separating them, either the blue or orange point might be the majority. Similarly, on the right branch, there are two child nodes representing the remaining regions. If the next layer had not been reached yet, additional layers could further refine the decisions made by the tree. By combining multiple simpler trees, we get a stronger learner that can capture complex relationships between the input variables and labels.

Random forests combine many decision trees together to reduce variance and improve generalization. Each tree is trained on a randomly selected subset of the training set, which helps avoid overfitting and ensure diversity in the ensemble. By aggregating the results of each individual tree, we get a better understanding of the underlying distribution of the data and prevent any single tree from becoming too specialized. Overall, decision trees and random forests are widely used in modern machine learning systems, especially for non-linear and high dimensional data sets.

## 3. Basic Concepts and Terminology
### Information Gain
Information gain measures the reduction in entropy after splitting a node based on a given attribute or feature. It calculates the difference between the original entropy of the parent node and the weighted sum of entropies of each child node. Intuitively, the greater the amount of information gained by a split, the higher the confidence in choosing the correct attribute or feature as the splitting criterion. Mathematically, the formula for information gain is: 

$$IG = H(Parent) - \sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i H(Child_i)$$

where $H$ stands for entropy and $p_i$ denotes the proportion of samples that belong to each child node.

### Variable Importance
Variable importance measures how much a predictor contributes to the construction of a decision tree. A predictor whose importance score is low means that it did not contribute significantly to the final outcome and has little impact on the model's performance. The variable importance measure is calculated as follows: 

$$IV = -\frac{|\text{Average impurity decrease}|}{\sum_{\substack{\text{all predictors}}} |\text{Average impurity decrease}|} $$

where $\text{Average impurity decrease}$ is the average reduction in node impurity caused by selecting a predictor during splitting.

### Overfitting
Overfitting refers to a situation where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, previously unseen data. Common causes of overfitting include:

1. High bias - the model is too simple, unable to fit the complexity of the training data effectively.

2. High variance - the model captures noise in the training data instead of true patterns, leading to poor generalization to new data.

To detect overfitting, we need to evaluate the model's performance on validation or test data that was not used for training. When the validation error increases relative to the training error, we know that the model is overfitting.

### Underfitting
Underfitting refers to a scenario where the model is too simplistic and does not capture enough complex relationships between the input variables and labels. To detect underfitting, we usually compare the model's performance on validation and test data to its baseline performance (e.g. constant guessing). If the validation error remains relatively consistent across different runs, then the model is underfitting.

### Hyperparameters and Model Selection
Hyperparameters refer to adjustable parameters that control the behavior of the model architecture and training process. Some common hyperparameters for decision trees and random forests include:

* `max_depth` - maximum depth of the tree
* `min_samples_split` - minimum number of samples required to split a node
* `min_samples_leaf` - minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node
* `criterion` - function to measure the quality of a split (e.g. entropy, Gini index)
* `n_estimators` - number of decision trees in the forest

Model selection involves choosing the best combination of hyperparameters that maximizes the desired metric such as accuracy or precision. There are various strategies such as grid search, randomized search, and Bayesian optimization to automate the process of finding good hyperparameters.
