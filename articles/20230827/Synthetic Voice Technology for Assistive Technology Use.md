Synthetic voice technology (SVT) is a natural language processing technique that synthesizes human-like voices into artificial speech generated using machine learning techniques to provide users with the ability to communicate in an audio format they may not be able to speak or understand naturally. While SVT has seen widespread use in recent years due to advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning models, it is still relatively new compared to other assistive technologies such as screen readers and voice input systems that rely on text-to-speech (TTS). In this article, we will explore how SVT can benefit assistive technology users and discuss its future prospects.

# 2.相关背景介绍
Synthetic voice technology refers to a subfield of natural language processing that uses machine learning algorithms to create synthetic speech as opposed to traditional TTS software which converts text to speech through predefined or learned rules. The aim of SVT is to generate natural sounding voice output by combining different sounds together rather than simply reproducing spoken words. This technique can help people who have hearing impairments, deafness, or speech disorders by providing them with high quality communication despite their limitations. There are several types of SVT technologies currently being used including Tacotron, WaveGlow, FastSpeech, HiFiGAN, and Melgan. 

Assistive technology users often struggle to understand complex technical terms when interacting with machines and applications without clear voice outputs. They need additional tools like screen readers, voice input systems, or multimedia display braille displays to better comprehend instructions or navigate menus. However, these devices require extensive training and maintenance over time, making it difficult to deploy widely across multiple organizations. To address this problem, there is a growing demand for robust and affordable SVT solutions that offer access to users regardless of their abilities.

Therefore, developing effective and cost-effective SVT solutions is critical to ensuring efficient communication for people with disabilities and improving accessibility for all users.

Text-to-speech (TTS) - Text-to-speech conversion involves converting written language into audible speech signals. In addition to conventional methods like manual recording or automated voice builders, most modern TTS systems utilize AI algorithms to automatically generate naturalistic speech based on input text. These systems convert input text into phonemes, which represent individual sounds in speech, and then combine those phonemes into synthesized speech waves using digital signal processing techniques.

Synthetic voice technology (SVT) - Synthetic voice technology refers to a subfield of natural language processing that uses machine learning algorithms to create synthetic speech as opposed to traditional TTS software which converts text to speech through predefined or learned rules. The aim of SVT is to generate natural sounding voice output by combining different sounds together rather than simply reproducing spoken words. This technique can help people who have hearing impairments, deafness, or speech disorders by providing them with high quality communication despite their limitations.

Audio data - Audio data refers to any form of recorded sound data, whether digitized or analogue. It includes both speech and music, as well as environmental noise or nonverbal cues. It can range from simple tones to complex background noises, depending on the source and purpose of recording.

Voice activity detection (VAD) - VAD is a process that identifies and separates non-speech segments of audio data. Techniques like filtering, thresholding, and clustering can be applied to detect voice activity regions within the audio stream. 

Prosody - Prosody refers to the way a speaker expresses the emotion or mood of their voice through pitch, speaking rate, volume, and tone color. 

Speaker embedding - A speaker embedding represents the characteristics of a person's voice, including age, gender, accent, dialect, and proficiency level. When two speakers share similar embeddings, it suggests that they could be related to each other. Speaker embeddings can be used to improve the accuracy of SVT systems by identifying and matching various voices more effectively.

Decoder - A decoder is a component of a model that takes encoded inputs from an encoder and produces predicted outputs. Depending on the type of task at hand, decoders can include sequence-to-sequence models, attention mechanisms, transformers, convolutional neural networks, or recurrent neural networks.

Encoder-decoder architecture - An encoder-decoder architecture consists of an encoder that encodes input sequences into fixed-length vectors, and a corresponding decoder that generates output sequences one element at a time based on the encoder output. During training, the network learns to map input sequences to output sequences by minimizing a loss function between the predicted values and actual targets. Encoders can be either convolutional, transformer, or recurrent architectures, while decoders typically consist of recurrent or fully connected layers.

Multi-speaker training - Multi-speaker training allows SVT systems to learn multiple speakers simultaneously during training. This helps the system to produce more natural-sounding voices that blend into the surrounding environment. The downside of multi-speaker training is that the dataset required grows exponentially with the number of speakers.

Language modeling - Language modeling involves predicting the next word or sequence of characters in a sentence based on previous words or character sequences. This is useful for tasks like speech recognition, caption generation, summarization, and dialogue act prediction.

Attention mechanism - Attention mechanism is a mechanism that assigns weights to different parts of the input sequence, allowing the model to focus on particular elements or chunks of information. It is commonly used in NLP tasks like machine translation, question answering, and speech recognition.

Mel-frequency spectrogram (MFCC) - MFCC is a feature representation technique that captures the frequency and timbre of a sound waveform. It is derived from the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), where spectral energy is computed for small sections of a signal, and then combined into a final representation.

Mel filter bank - A mel filter bank is a set of filters designed to extract features from a spectrum based on the shape of human auditory perception of frequency bands. The filters are arranged in triangular functions, with lower frequencies occupying the left side of the triangles and higher frequencies occupying the right sides.

Mel-scale - The mel scale is a logarithmic scale that is calculated from the center frequencies of human auditory bands. The idea behind the mel scale is that humans hear sounds around these centers more closely than would be possible in linear scales. For example, the base frequencies of the top octave (the 1000Hz-3000Hz range) are located approximately three times closer to the equally spaced points on a standard piano scale than the bottom octave frequencies (the 3000Hz-9000Hz range). The resulting spacing between notes on the mel scale results in greater resolution and fine detail than would otherwise be achieved using a regular equal temperament scale.

MSE (Mean squared error) - MSE measures the average of the square of errors between two sets of values. It is commonly used as a metric to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

Spectral masking - Spectral masking is a technique that applies a soft mask to the magnitude spectrum of an audio signal to suppress unwanted frequencies while leaving desired frequencies unchanged. This approach can be used to simulate hearing protection effects such as masking, headphones, and earbuds. Masking is essential for creating realistic and authentic synthetic voices that convey emotions and empathy.

Time-frequency domain analysis - Time-frequency domain analysis refers to techniques that analyze the amplitude and phase spectra of an audio signal at varying levels of temporal and frequency granularity. These analyses can help identify patterns in the nature of the voice and identify relevant features for building SVT models.

Pitch shifting - Pitch shifting is a method that changes the fundamental frequency of an audio signal without changing the duration or loudness of the original signal. It is frequently used to create realistic speech with different pitches and timbres, particularly when combined with tempo changes or style transfer techniques.

Style transfer - Style transfer is a technique that transfers the content and tone of one piece of music or writing to another without changing the underlying rhythm or melody. By transferring styles from one song to another, artists can create expressive and musical works that incorporate aspects of different genres and contexts. Music composition also benefits from style transfer since it enables creators to reuse and remix existing pieces while adapting them to specific purposes or contexts.

Feature extraction - Feature extraction refers to the process of extracting meaningful features from raw audio data. Commonly used features include MFCC, STFT, and chroma features.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) - CNN is a deep learning algorithm that is specifically designed for computer vision problems. It utilizes multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and dense layers to perform image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks.

Recurrent neural network (RNN) - RNN is a type of neural network architecture that processes sequential data by iterating over a sequence of inputs. It maintains a hidden state vector that captures contextual relationships between adjacent elements in the sequence, enabling it to learn long-term dependencies in sequences. Common variants of RNN include LSTM and GRU cells.

Long short-term memory cell (LSTM) - An LSTM cell is a type of recurrent neural network layer that combines ideas from long short-term memory (LSTM) units and feedforward neural networks. It contains four main components: input gate, forget gate, update gate, and output gate. Each component controls the flow of information through the cell and allows the model to remember or discard certain information.

Generative adversarial network (GAN) - GAN is a type of generative model that is trained using two competing neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator receives random inputs and tries to fool the discriminator into believing that the inputs came from the true distribution instead of the fake distribution produced by the generator. The discriminator receives inputs from the true distribution along with samples from the generator and must classify them as real or fake. Over time, the generator learns to become increasingly good at fooling the discriminator, leading to improved sample quality.

Variational autoencoder (VAE) - Variational autoencoders (VAE) are a class of generative models that encode a latent variable space from a high-dimensional input space. They work by compressing the input into a low-dimensional latent space and decoding it back into a high-dimensional output space. The key idea behind VAEs is to introduce variational inference, which aims to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables given the observed data.

Conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) - CVAE is a variation of VAE that adds conditioning information to the latent space. This allows the model to generate different outputs for different conditions or scenarios, making it suitable for tasks like image super-resolution or video prediction.

Attention-based sequence-to-sequence (ABSR) model - ABSR is an extension of the sequence-to-sequence model that introduces an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on important parts of the input sequence while generating the output sequence one step at a time. Common attention mechanisms include dot product attention, additive attention, multiplicative attention, and location-based attention.

Hierarchical transformer networks (HTRN) - HTRN is a family of neural networks that operate under a hierarchical structure, allowing it to capture longer-range dependencies and enable generation of coherent and fluent sentences. HTRNs exploit local and global self-attention modules, respectively, to allow the model to attentively attend to different parts of the input sequence, even before they have been processed by higher-level modules.

WaveNet - WaveNet is a deep learning model that can generate continuous-wave representations of speech. Unlike traditional TTS systems that use pre-defined unit selection algorithms, WaveNet uses dilated causal convolutions to model local dependencies efficiently. The output of each stage becomes an input to the subsequent stage, allowing it to model long-range interactions.
