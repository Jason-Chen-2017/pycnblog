Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most popular and exciting areas in machine learning. It allows us to teach machines how to act optimally in uncertain environments by rewarding or punishing them for their actions based on certain criteria. Despite its popularity, it has not received much attention from researchers because few concrete models have been found that explain why the agent can solve complex tasks so effectively. 

In this article, we will explore why some simple RL algorithms perform well compared to more advanced ones with theoretical underpinnings and practical applications in reinforcement learning systems. Specifically, we will focus on the analysis of random agents, which are the simplest form of AI agents and provide an opportunity to compare various components in reinforcement learning algorithms such as value functions, policies, exploration/exploitation trade-offs, and returns.

Before delving into the technical details of RL algorithms, let's first understand what exactly is meant by "random" in terms of reinforcement learning. A random agent is simply an agent who takes actions at random according to a fixed probability distribution over all possible actions given the current state of the environment. Since there is no training involved in these agents, they typically learn only through trial and error and end up taking actions that do not maximize their rewards but rather result in suboptimal results. For instance, if our agent tries to climb a tree randomly without knowing any physics principles, it might reach the top branches early and even get lucky and break out of a couple steps down. While effective, this strategy may not be optimal for solving problems that involve significant motion or forces and requires careful design of the policy to avoid falling into traps. Nevertheless, understanding the concept behind random agents can still provide insights into why other RL algorithms work better than random strategies in certain scenarios. 

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology 
## Markov Decision Process (MDP) 
A MDP consists of the following components:

1. **State space**: The set of states that the agent can occupy at any point in time
2. **Action space**: The set of possible actions that the agent can take in each state
3. **Reward function**: Defines the reward obtained after executing an action in a particular state 
4. **Transition model**: Defines the probabilities of moving between different states when performing a specific action. This matrix represents the dynamics of the MDP. 


The goal of an agent is to find the optimal sequence of actions that maximizes cumulative reward over long periods of time while ensuring that it does not become stuck in local minimums. We define the optimal policy $\pi_*$ as the mapping from every state $s$ to an action $a$, i.e., $\pi_*(s)$ denotes the best action to take from state $s$. To optimize the policy, we need to evaluate its performance using temporal difference (TD) methods, where the agent interacts with the environment and learns from its mistakes.

The TD update equation can be written as follows:

$$ Q(S_{t}, A_{t}) \leftarrow Q(S_{t}, A_{t}) + \alpha [R_{t+1}+\gamma Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}) - Q(S_{t}, A_{t})] $$


where $Q(S_{t}, A_{t})$ is the estimated return for taking action $A_{t}$ in state $S_{t}$, $\alpha$ is the step size parameter, $R_{t+1}$ is the reward obtained after taking action $A_{t}$ in state $S_{t}$, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor.

For large state spaces and continuous action spaces, we use neural networks to approximate the Q function instead of tabular representations. Neural network approximators are known to perform well for continuous control tasks due to their ability to handle non-tabular input data. In contrast to tabular representations, neural networks require less storage and computation and allow us to represent complex dependencies among variables. Neural networks can also capture higher level features from raw observations that may be useful for reinforcement learning tasks like image classification. 

## Value Function Approximation (VFA) 
Value function approximation (VFA) refers to estimating the expected future return of being in a particular state $s$ and taking an action $a$ in the next state $s'$. VFA techniques can help simplify the problem of finding the optimal policy by providing an estimate of the value function instead of computing it directly. 

The basic idea behind value function approximation is to train a neural network to predict the value function $v_{\phi}(s)$ for every state $s$. Given a state $s$, the output of the network would be the predicted value for that state. More specifically, we want to minimize the loss between the true value function $v^{\pi}(s)$ and the predicted value function $\hat{v}_{\phi}(s)$, where $\pi$ is the optimal policy derived using dynamic programming. 

The classic approach to regression-based VFA is to use a linear combination of feature vectors as inputs to the network and then apply a non-linearity such as sigmoid or tanh. Commonly used features include state values, action values, and next state values. Other commonly used architectures include multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, since the state space and action space could be high-dimensional, it may be necessary to use specialized architectures designed for those types of tasks. One example is AlphaZero, which uses CNNs for board games.

Once trained, the value function estimates $\hat{v}_{\phi}(s)$ can be used to determine the optimal action selection policy $\pi_\theta(s)$ for the agent. Similarly to tabular algorithms, we can derive an optimal policy by choosing the action $a$ that maximizes the value function estimate $\hat{v}_{\phi}(s)$. However, unlike traditional tabular algorithms, VFA algorithms can adapt to changes in the environment and discover new behaviors during runtime, making them particularly suitable for interactive environments and robotics.  

## Policy Gradient Methods 
Policy gradient methods rely on the gradient of the objective function defined by the policy gradient theorem to iteratively improve the policy. The main idea is to estimate the gradient of the logarithm of the policy probability of selecting a particular action in a particular state. By updating the parameters of the policy network using stochastic gradient descent, we can maximize the expected return from the starting state until the termination condition is met. The key advantage of policy gradient methods over value function approximation approaches is that they can easily scale to large state and action spaces while handling continuous action spaces. Another benefit is that they enable the agent to directly learn from episodes of experience, which makes them highly sample-efficient. Additionally, they don't require expert knowledge about the environment or the optimal policy to begin with, making them more versatile and adaptable. 

Commonly used policy gradient algorithms include REINFORCE, PPO, and A2C. These algorithms operate differently depending on the structure of the underlying policy function. In general, they follow an actor-critic architecture and aim to simultaneously optimize two objectives: 

1. Maximize the expected return over trajectories sampled from the current policy $\pi_{\theta}(.|s)$
2. Minimize the entropy of the policy $\frac{-\sum_{a}\pi_{\theta}(a|s)\log\pi_{\theta}(a|s)}{}$

The former objective encourages the agent to select actions that lead to good behavior in the real world. The latter objective prevents the policy from getting stuck in bad local minima, leading to exploration and preventing catastrophic forgetting. Both objectives are usually evaluated separately during training and their relative strengths can be adjusted by hyperparameters. 

REINFORCE is a basic policy gradient method that updates the policy parameters using a single trajectory generated from the current policy. At each timestep, the algorithm computes the log probability of taking the selected action and subtracts it from the accumulated reward from previous timesteps to compute the baseline. It then applies the gradient of this loss with respect to the policy parameters to update the policy network. Because it samples trajectories sequentially from the current policy, REINFORCE is relatively slow and can sometimes fail to converge. However, it provides a solid foundation for further improvements. 

PPO addresses the convergence issues of REINFORCE by using multiple parallel actors to generate trajectories and estimating advantages online. Instead of using a single trajectory, PPO interpolates between the current policy and a perturbed version of itself to make sampling efficient and reduce variance. The surrogate loss function includes both the advantages and the entropy term, and is optimized using proximal policy optimization (PPO). 

A2C combines ideas from REINFORCE and TRPO to achieve faster convergence rates and stronger performance across a wide range of tasks. A2C works by applying policy gradients to the current policy and using the resulting gradient to bootstrap the value function estimation. The advantage is that it can leverage parallelization to speed up computation and can handle larger batch sizes than traditional RL algorithms.
