Anomaly detection is a crucial problem in computer vision and image processing that has applications in security systems and medical imaging. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically detect facial expressions (such as happiness, sadness or surprise) from videos using semi-supervised learning with hierarchical graph convolutional networks (HGCNs). We first extract spatiotemporal features of facial expression through convolutional neural network (CNN) based on pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs), such as VGGNet or ResNet. Then, we use the extracted features for clustering by constructing a heterogeneous graph representation, where each node represents a frame in the video sequence and edges represent temporal dependencies between frames. The hierarchical structure of nodes helps to capture the spatial dependencies across multiple scales, which are important for facial expression recognition due to their dynamic nature. Next, we build an autoencoder to learn the latent space representation of both nodes and edges, respectively. Finally, we train a multi-class classification model on top of the learned representations, which learns to discriminate normal faces from abnormal ones by modeling the high-level correlations among different types of facial movements. Experiment results show that our method can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods under limited supervision and achieves better anomaly detection accuracy compared with other related works. Additionally, we also provide qualitative analysis demonstrating how the algorithm can identify distinctive characteristics of anomalous facial expressions, including emotions, body posture changes, head motion patterns and blinking behavior. These findings could help researchers and developers to design more robust and effective anomaly detection algorithms for facial expression recognition tasks.
# 2.术语表
Spatio-temporal feature: A set of spatially and temporally localized features obtained by applying CNN to a facial expression video clip.
Heuristic Clustering Algorithm: It groups similar data points together without considering any criteria. There are many variations of cluster algorithms available, but they usually produce uneven distributions of clusters and require manual intervention to correct them if necessary.
Heterogeneous Graph Representation: A graph representing relationships between nodes at different levels of hierarchy. Each node represents a frame in the video sequence while its neighbors represent adjacent frames within a certain time interval. The edge weights indicate the similarity between neighboring nodes based on their appearance features.
Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network: A type of GNN architecture that includes multiple layers of graph convolutional networks at different levels of hierarchy. At higher levels of hierarchy, the graph becomes denser and more complex, while at lower levels it becomes less dense and simpler. This allows capturing both global and local dependencies of the nodes.
Autoencoder: A type of machine learning model that consists of two parts - encoder and decoder. The encoder takes input data and maps it into a low-dimensional latent vector space. The decoder reverses the process and reconstructs the original input from the encoded representation. Autoencoders are commonly used in unsupervised learning, where the goal is to learn useful representations of the input data without labeled training examples.
Multi-class Classification Model: A type of machine learning model that predicts a categorical label given a sample of inputs. Here, we use logistic regression as our classifier, which outputs probabilities for each class.


# 3.算法原理
The proposed system comprises three main modules: Feature Extraction, Hierarchical Graph Construction and Multi-Class Classifier Training/Testing. 

1.Feature Extraction Module: 

We use DNNs pretrained on large datasets like ImageNet or ILSVRC for extracting visual features from facial expression videos. Specifically, we use a combination of convolutional and fully connected layers followed by activation functions such as ReLU, max pooling and dropout to reduce the dimensionality of the features and extract relevant information from the videos. We then apply PCA to perform dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of dimensions to a manageable size before feeding it to our subsequent modules. 


2.Hierarchical Graph Construction Module:

To construct a heterogeneous graph representation of facial expression videos, we use a heuristic clustering algorithm to group the extracted features into a predefined number of clusters. We then connect these clusters together forming a weighted undirected graph, where each node corresponds to a frame in the video sequence and edges represent temporal dependencies between frames. To handle the varying length of videos, we normalize all the lengths of sequences by dividing them by their maximum length. For example, suppose we have a sequence of length N=100 and another sequence of length M=75, then we normalize both lengths by dividing them by N=100 so that they have equal impact on the final graph construction. By doing this, longer sequences contribute more towards building up the overall picture than shorter sequences, thereby creating a balanced graph.

Once we obtain the heterogeneous graph representation of the video sequences, we need to add some additional constraints to ensure that the resulting graph captures not only the temporal dependencies but also the spatial and contextual dependencies present in the raw features. Hence, we introduce the concept of hierarchical structure to our graph, where each node represents a particular level of abstraction (e.g., whole face, eyes, mouth) and connections between nodes correspond to spatial and contextual dependencies. To create a hierarchical graph, we start with a root node (i.e., entire face) and recursively split it into subregions until we reach desired level of granularity (e.g., pixel level). We use convolutional filters to extract regional features from the raw images corresponding to each node, which are then connected to form an adjacency matrix to represent the intra-regional dependencies. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we combine several smaller regions together to form larger regions (e.g., eye corners, mouth contour) to represent the inter-regional dependencies. Overall, this step aims to increase the expressivity of the graph by incorporating not just the locality of individual features but also their relationships with larger structures and objects.


3.Multi-Class Classifier Training/Testing Module:

Based on the constructed heterogeneous graph, we develop a novel autoencoder model that encodes both the node and edge features into a common embedding space, called the latent space. The encoder module uses stacked convolutional layers to map the spatial and temporal dependencies of the nodes onto a shared latent space, while the decoder module reconstructs the original input using the same convolutional layer configurations. The trained autoencoder serves as the foundation for our next step, which involves training a multi-class classification model on top of the learned embeddings.

We use logistic regression as our classifier, which assumes that the samples belong to one of K classes. We train the logistic regression model using a cross-entropy loss function on top of the embeddings generated by the autoencoder. During testing, we measure the accuracy of the predicted labels against the true labels provided in the dataset. We further evaluate the anomaly detection capability of our method by analyzing the distribution of anomaly scores calculated by the classifier for normal and abnormal sequences separately. Intuitively, an anomaly score close to zero indicates a normal sequence whereas a score above a threshold indicates an abnormal sequence. Based on these observations, we highlight significant differences in the way facial expressions vary during normal versus abnormal behaviors, providing valuable insights into the underlying factors responsible for such distinctions.
