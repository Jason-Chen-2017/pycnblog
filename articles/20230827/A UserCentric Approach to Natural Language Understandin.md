# 1.简介
  

Natural language understanding (NLU) is an essential component in many applications that involve human-to-machine interactions such as chatbots and voice assistants. NLU systems are widely used for tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. However, it can be challenging to build robust and accurate NLU models due to the complexity of natural language, ambiguity in sentences, sarcasm, dialects, idiomatic expressions, and errors made by humans. To address these challenges, there have been several approaches developed to train neural networks using large amounts of labeled data. These methods include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we propose a user-centric approach to natural language understanding based on crowdsourced datasets. We argue that incorporating diverse user feedback into training a model can help improve accuracy and reduce the amount of annotated data required to build high-quality NLU models. Additionally, we show how to collect, annotate, and use a dataset of users' reactions to text messages or customer feedback for building an engaging and comprehensive NLU system. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method on two popular benchmarks, MultiWOZ and SimDial, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

# 2.背景介绍
In recent years, with the advent of modern artificial intelligence techniques like deep learning and attention mechanisms, natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a new frontier in NLU research. However, building robust and accurate NLU models requires massive amounts of labeled data. This data collection process is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, while various sources exist for obtaining labelled data, they vary significantly in quality and scope. One approach to overcome these limitations is to utilize crowdsourced data sets where volunteers provide their valuable insights into specific domains. Examples of such datasets include Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), Google's Dialogflow, and IBM Watson Assistant. 

Recently, a number of papers have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing crowdsourced data sets for improving the performance of NLU systems. For example, Fernández et al. [1] demonstrated the benefits of using crowdsourced annotations to build a semantic frame based named entity recognition system called SenseMaker. Similarly, Kamran et al. [2] evaluated the impact of crowd-sourcing dialogues for the task of domain classification and intent detection. Nevertheless, the underlying assumption behind these works was that every annotator provides reliable and consistent annotations. As pointed out in Thangaraju et al.[3], such assumptions may not always hold true. As such, there is a need to explore other ways to leverage crowdsourced data sets to improve NLU performance.

## 3.1 NLU 
Natural language understanding (NLU) refers to the ability of machines to understand and interpret human languages. It involves identifying the meaning of words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs; extracting relevant features from them; and interpreting the contextual relationships between them. 

To perform any meaningful task in NLU, the input needs to first be converted into a structured format known as "natural language syntax," which represents the order, structure, and content of individual words in a sentence. Before feeding this syntax representation to the NLU system, additional pre-processing steps can also be applied, including tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

The output of NLU systems includes various types of signals indicating what the user wants to achieve and how best to accomplish it. Some examples of common NLU outputs include:

1. Intent classification - classifying user utterances into one of predefined categories, such as greeting, asking a question, informing about a product, etc.
2. Entity extraction - detecting and extracting entities related to the user’s request, such as location names, dates, numbers, products, etc.
3. Sentiment analysis - determining whether a user’s opinion is positive, negative, neutral, mixed, or none at all. 
4. Machine translation - translating the user's query from one language to another.
5. Dialogue management - coordinating the conversation flow, taking appropriate actions to satisfy the user’s requests, and generating appropriate responses.

Overall, NLU is a complex and versatile field that involves handling numerous different aspects of human communication, from linguistic understanding to dialogue management. Therefore, it is essential to consider the nature of the problem being solved when designing NLU models, and identify suitable algorithms and techniques that can effectively handle a wide range of inputs and scenarios.

## 3.2 Neural Networks
A neural network is a set of connected nodes designed to recognize patterns in input data. It consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the raw input data and passes it through the hidden layers to produce the final output. The purpose of the hidden layers is to transform the raw input data into a more compact form that is easier for the algorithm to learn. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, softmax, and linear.

Training a neural network typically involves minimizing the difference between the predicted output and the actual target value. Three commonly used optimization algorithms for this purpose are stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adagrad, and Adam. During each iteration of training, the network adjusts the weights and biases of each neuron to minimize the error function. The backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias, and updates the parameters accordingly. After many iterations, the trained network can accurately predict the target values for new inputs.

## 3.3 Crowdsourced Datasets
Crowdsourced data sets refer to datasets that are collected from a group of individuals who contribute their expertise via online platforms or social media. They offer a unique advantage over traditional data sets because they do not require manual annotation and often contain a higher degree of noise than manually curated data sets. Although previous work has focused primarily on building automated systems for gathering and analyzing crowdsourced data, the practical usefulness of these resources is limited. Instead, leveraging user contributions to develop specialized NLU models is critical.

One way to collect crowdsourced data for NLU purposes is to create a platform or app where users can submit texts and receive ratings or feedback based on the correctness, completeness, and coherence of their answers. Another approach is to organize multiple datasets from different sources, which can then be combined together to generate a comprehensive corpus for training and testing NLU models. While some datasets are specifically created for NLU tasks, others can serve as general knowledge bases or benchmark datasets. Overall, collecting and aggregating crowdsourced data sets is an effective strategy for developing better NLU systems.

## 3.4 MultiWOZ Dataset
MultiWOZ is a recently released multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset consisting of real-world conversations among people talking about travel booking, hotel reservation, restaurant recommendation, and payment. The dataset contains 7,232 dialogues spanning across six domains with varying sizes ranging from 5 to up to 15 turns each. MultiWOZ offers a good challenge for evaluating NLU systems since it tests for both spoken language understanding and natural language generation abilities.

Each turn in a conversation comprises three parts: the speaker's goal or intention, followed by the user's utterance, and finally, the assistant's response. Additionally, MultiWOZ provides detailed metadata regarding each turn, such as the dialogue act type, slot values, and API calls. Hence, it is important to take into account all the factors involved in understanding the users' requests and providing the right responses.

Another challenge faced by NLU systems when dealing with multi-turn dialogues is the potential for long-term dependencies in the user's queries and responses. Traditional seq2seq models fail to capture long-term dependencies effectively and tend to generate repetitive and boring responses. A popular solution to tackle this issue is the Pointer-Generator Network (PGN). PGN uses a pointer mechanism to selectively attend to relevant portions of the input sequence during decoding, thus avoiding the repetition problem caused by traditional seq2seq architectures.

In addition, other advanced methods such as multimodal deep learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning have shown promise for improving NLU performance on spoken language understanding tasks. However, the development of user-centric NLU strategies based on crowdsourced datasets remains a pressing issue in the future.


# 4.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
Our proposal is based on the following principles:

1. Use crowdsourced datasets instead of standard datasets
2. Collect diverse user feedback to boost model accuracy
3. Introduce novel techniques to incorporate user feedback

To implement this framework, we first introduce the main components of the NLU pipeline, namely tokenizer, tagger, parser, and entity linker. Tokenizer splits the incoming text into smaller chunks, Tagger assigns parts of speech tags to each word in the chunk, Parser builds a syntactic parse tree from the tagged text, and Linker identifies and links relevant entities mentioned in the text. Next, we explain how to integrate crowdsourced data sets within the pipeline.

We begin by introducing a technique called Social Intents. When designing a software application, developers frequently ask themselves if they should treat certain user input cases differently, depending on the current state of the system or the user preferences. Our intuition is that similar situations will result in similar user intentions. Based on this idea, we propose a concept called Social Intents, which allows us to associate user input cases with predefined intents defined by the developer. For instance, if the user inputs "I want to book a flight", we might assume that they intend to make a flight reservation. Moreover, we present an architecture diagram to illustrate the interaction between components of our proposed pipeline.


Next, we discuss the details of implementing our Social Intents feature. First, we extract candidate intents for the given user input using a small but diverse set of keywords extracted from existing training data. Second, we filter out duplicate candidates using n-gram matching and prioritize them according to their similarity score with the input. Third, we apply a simple rule-based classifier to rank the filtered candidates based on their likelihood of being true intents. Fourth, we return the top-ranked candidate as the most likely intent to the user. Lastly, we map each detected user input case to a predefined intent associated with it. By doing so, we enable developers to tailor the behavior of their NLU system according to their requirements and user preferences.

However, integrating crowdsourced data sets into the NLU pipeline presents its own unique challenges. Since crowdsourced labels may not always be accurate or reliable, we cannot rely only on those labels alone. Therefore, we introduce an iterative training procedure that takes into account both standard and crowdsourced data sets during model training. Specifically, we iterate until convergence or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. At each step, we update the model weights using only the standard data set and then fine-tune the model using the crowdsourced data set.

Furthermore, we introduce a module called Enhancer. Enhancer is responsible for enhancing the training signal provided by crowdsourced data sets by selecting a subset of reliable labels and smoothing the weak ones. Specifically, we assign a confidence score to each label based on the strength of the user's consensus. We then compute a weighted average of the confidence scores assigned to the reliable labels and the original data set. We further smooth the confidences of the labels by adding Gaussian noise.

Finally, we note that the proposed framework does not replace standard NLU pipelines or algorithms. Rather, it complements them by enabling users to interact with the system directly through the platform and provide continuous feedback to enhance the quality of the predictions. Overall, the key ideas behind our proposal are:

1. Use crowdsourced datasets to supplement standard datasets for training NLU models
2. Train NLU models incrementally using user feedback
3. Design custom modules to incorporate user feedback into NLU pipelines

# 5.具体代码实例和解释说明
This section will provide code examples and explanations for implementing the core components of our proposed framework, including Social Intents, Enhancer, and incremental model training. We will demonstrate how to use this framework on the MultiWOZ dataset, and showcase how the results compare against the baseline models without considering user feedback.
