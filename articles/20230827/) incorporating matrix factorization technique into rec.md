# 1.简介
  

## Matrix Factorization is a popular recommendation algorithm used in recommender systems to recommend items to users based on their past behavior or preferences. It decomposes the user-item rating matrix R into two matrices U and V such that the dot product of U and V gives the predicted ratings for all pairs (u,i). In simple terms, it identifies latent factors (hidden features) in the data which can explain the variations observed between different users and items with respect to some underlying attributes or properties. The main advantage of this approach is its ability to handle sparsity in the dataset and provide accurate predictions even when few observations are available. However, traditional collaborative filtering methods still outperform matrix factorization techniques by several metrics due to their interpretability and scalability.
In recent years, neural networks have shown impressive performance in various tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, natural language understanding, etc. Similarly, deep learning models have been employed successfully in recommendation systems to generate more relevant recommendations by modeling complex patterns in the data and taking into account multiple factors involved in generating those recommendations. Among these approaches, matrix factorization has emerged as an effective technique for improving predictive accuracy, recommending novel items and enhancing item discovery. This article will explore how we can incorporate matrix factorization technique into recommendation systems to enhance accuracy, recall, and coverage.

## Key Takeaways:

1. Recommendation algorithms using matrix factorization lead to better recommendations compared to other methods because they offer greater flexibility in capturing interactions among users, items, and contextual information across domains.

2. Different variants of matrix factorization can be applied depending upon the nature of the data being modeled. These include probabilistic matrix factorization, bilinear matrix factorization, multi-task matrix factorization, non-negative matrix factorization, and hybrid matrix factorization.

3. Latent factors learned by matrix factorization can capture both implicit and explicit preferences of the users towards specific items. Therefore, their insights can help researchers improve the quality of recommendations by identifying subsets of similar users and/or items who share similar tastes and preferences.

4. Interpretability of matrix factorization techniques makes them attractive for human-in-the-loop applications where experts in the domain can interpret the recommendations generated by the model.

5. Scalability of matrix factorization techniques ensures efficient computation even when dealing with large datasets. They also make use of parallel computing resources and GPU clusters to train and deploy models quickly.

# 2. Concepts & Terms
Matrix Factorization is widely used in Recommender Systems. It is commonly referred to as MF, ML-MF, and NMF in literature. Here I am going to explain basic concepts related to Matrix Factorization so you get clear idea about what it is and why we need it.

1. User-Item Rating Matrix
   - The User-Item Rating Matrix is a sparse matrix consisting of the ratings given by each user to each item.
   
2. Latent Factors
   - Latent Factors refer to hidden variables representing user preferences and item attributes. We want to learn these factors from the ratings provided in the User-Item Rating Matrix.
   
   Example : For example, if there are n users and m items in our dataset, then we can assume that the first k dimensions represent the user preferences and remaining dimensions represent the item attributes. 
   
3. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
   - SVD is one of the most important tools in Machine Learning used to decompose high dimensional data into low rank approximations. It works by breaking down a matrix into three parts - U, Sigma, V. Where U is the left singular vectors, V is the right singular vectors and Sigma contains the eigenvalues of the original matrix arranged in descending order. By projecting new data points onto the basis obtained from SVD, we can recover the original approximation accurately.
  
   Say we have a matrix X with dimensions d x n and wish to reduce the number of dimensions to k. We can perform SVD on the matrix to obtain three matrices U(d x k), sigma(k x k), V(n x k) such that X = U*Sigma*V^T. We select only top K columns of U and V as our reduced representations of the original matrix. This results in reducing the dimensionality of the input matrix X while preserving most of the variance.
   
4. Cross Validation
   - Cross Validation involves splitting the dataset into training set and testing set. The trained model is then tested on unseen test data to evaluate the performance of the model.
   
    Cross validation is essential in evaluating machine learning algorithms since it provides a way to estimate the generalization error of the model. There are many ways to implement cross validation but here we will discuss two common strategies - Holdout and LOOCV.
    
    **Holdout Strategy**
      - Holdout strategy involves dividing the dataset randomly into two sets - Training Set and Testing Set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.
      
      Explanation : Suppose we have a dataset containing 10,000 samples. We split it into a training set containing 7,000 samples and a testing set containing 3,000 samples. We then train a model on the training set and calculate the loss function over the entire dataset i.e., sum((predicted_rating - actual_rating)^2)/total_samples. To estimate the generalization error of the model, we repeat this process by splitting the dataset randomly into training and testing sets repeatedly and compute the average loss over all splits. This estimated value represents the expected loss over a population of users under random distribution of ratings.
      
    **Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)**
      - Leave One Out CV involves selecting one sample from the dataset as the testing set and leaving the rest as the training set. Again, the trained model is then evaluated on the held out test sample. This process is repeated for every single sample in the dataset and the final score represents the average performance of the model.
      
      Explanation : Suppose we have a dataset containing 10,000 samples. We iterate through each sample and leave one sample out as the testing set. After iterating through all samples, we calculate the mean squared error over all held out samples. This means the smaller the MSE score, the better the prediction was made for that particular user-item pair.
      
 5. Regularization Techniques 
   - Regularization refers to adding penalty terms to the cost function during the optimization process to prevent overfitting. The goal is to find the optimal values of weights in the model parameters that minimize the cost function plus the regularization term.

    Types of Regularization Techniques
    
    1. L2 Regularization 
      - L2 regularization adds a quadratic penalty term proportional to the magnitude of the weight vector elements to the cost function. It encourages smaller weights.

    2. L1 Regularization 
       - L1 regularization adds a linear penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weight vector elements to the cost function. It encourages sparser weights.
       
    3. Elastic Net Regularization 
        - Elastic net combines L1 and L2 regularization penalties. It controls the balance between the L1 and L2 norms by tuning the mixing parameter alpha between 0 and 1. If alpha=1, it becomes equivalent to L2 penalty whereas if alpha=0, it becomes equivalent to L1 penalty.
        
    Choosing the best value of alpha for Elastic Net Regularization requires experimentation and evaluation on your dataset.
    
  # 3. Algorithm and Operations
  ## Probabilistic Matrix Factorization
  ### Problem Formulation
  Given a matrix R (Users x Items), we want to approximate P (Items x Users) such that R ≈ P * R'.
  
  - Item Attributes Vector (A): Each row of A denotes a user's preference for different attributes of items. An element A[j][t] indicates the strength of the jth attribute for the ith item.

  - Attribute Users Matrix (B): Each column of B denotes an item's attributes represented as binary values {0, 1}. A value of B[a][j] equals 1 if the jth attribute of the ith item is present, otherwise 0.

  Then we define a joint probability distribution p(u, i, r| a, b, θ) as follows:

  - u is the index of the user.
  - i is the index of the item.
  - r is the rating assigned by the user to the item.
  - a is the index of the attribute selected by the user for the current iteration.
  - b is the index of the item attribute corresponding to the chosen attribute a.
  - θ is the model parameters vector which includes the following components: A, B, C, D, E, F.

    - A - item attributes covariance matrix (latent space for user's preferences)
    - B - attribute users matrix (latent space for item's attributes)
    - C - item attributes biases (intercepts for user's preferences)
    - D - user bias (intercepts for item's attributes)
    - E - overall user biases (intercepts for items)
    - F - overall item biases (intercepts for users)

  Let’s take an example to understand the above equation. Consider the following matrix R:

   |User|Movie|Rating|Genre|Action|SciFi|Comedy|Drama|Thriller|Mystery|Romance|Animation|
   |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
   |U1|M1|5.0|Yes|No|No|Yes|No|No|No|No|Yes|
   |U1|M2|4.0|Yes|Yes|No|No|Yes|No|No|Yes|No|
   |U2|M3|3.0|No|No|No|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
   |U2|M4|4.0|No|No|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|Yes|No|
   |U3|M5|2.0|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|No|
   |U3|M6|5.0|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|

  Assume we have already initialized the A and B matrix. Now let’s consider movie genre as our attribute and let’s solve the problem of estimating the latent preferences for movies according to genres. Hence, we choose Genre as our attribute and optimize the below objective function:

   J = − log p(R| A, B, θ) + λ ||θ||₂²,    where λ is the regularization hyperparameter  

  First, we update the item attributes matrix B using SVD decomposition. Then, we apply regularization techniques to avoid overfitting. Finally, we can formulate the optimized conditional probabilities and assign ratings based on these probabilities. Mathematically, let’s write the update rules for the parameters θ:
  
   Update rule for A: A = ((X^TX + lambda*I)^(-1)) X^TY
  
   Update rule for B: B = Y^TB'Y' + (lambda/m)*BB',    where BB' is the transposed version of B multiplied by itself
  
   Update rule for C: C = diag(σ_c)(∂p(r|a,b,β)/∂β_uC')*diag(r),      where σ_c is the standard deviation of the ratings for the current user u
  
   Update rule for D: D = diag(σ_d)(∂p(r|a,b,β)/∂β_iuD')*diag(r),       where σ_d is the standard deviation of the ratings for the current item i
  
   Update rule for E: E = (F'*diag(σ_e)*p(r|a,b,β))/∂p(r|a,b,β)/∂E'*diag(σ_e)     where σ_e is the standard deviation of the aggregated ratings for all users
  
   Update rule for F: F = (E'*diag(σ_f)*p(r|a,b,β))/∂p(r|a,b,β)/∂F'*diag(σ_f)     where σ_f is the standard deviation of the aggregated ratings for all items
  
   And finally, we can plug in the updated estimates back into the formula for calculating the likelihood and calculate the negative log-likelihood to get the next set of A and B matrix. We keep repeating these steps until convergence occurs or maximum iterations limit is reached.
  
  ## Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
  ### Problem Formulation
  Given a matrix R (Users x Items), we want to approximate Q (Users x K) and P (Items x K) such that R ≈ Q * P'.
  
  - User Features Vector (Q): Each row of Q denotes a user's profile with K features. An element Q[i][j] indicates the importance of the jth feature for the ith user.

  - Item Features Vector (P): Each row of P denotes an item's profile with K features. An element P[j][l] indicates the importance of the lth feature for the jth item.

  Then we define a joint probability distribution p(u, i, r| q, p, θ) as follows:

  - u is the index of the user.
  - i is the index of the item.
  - r is the rating assigned by the user to the item.
  - q is the index of the user feature selected by the user for the current iteration.
  - p is the index of the item feature corresponding to the chosen user feature q.
  - θ is the model parameters vector which includes the following components: Q, P, mu, W.

    - Q - user feature covariance matrix (latent space for user profiles)
    - P - item feature covariance matrix (latent space for item profiles)
    - μ - global intercept (bias) parameter
    - W - additional (shared) parameters between Q and P

  Let’s take an example to understand the above equation. Consider the following matrix R:

   |User|Movie|Rating|Director|Year|Runtime|Budget|Revenue|
   |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
   |U1|M1|4.0|<NAME>|1994|120|$7 million|$3.5 million|
   |U1|M2|3.0|Frank Darabont|2010|100|$8 million|$2.5 million|
   |U2|M3|4.0|Tom Hanks|2008|90|$7 million|$2.7 million|
   |U2|M4|5.0|Mark Twain|1985|110|N/A|$2.8 million|
   |U3|M5|2.0|<NAME>orentz|1950|85|N/A|$2.4 million|
   |U3|M6|5.0|George Lucas|2014|150|$5 million|$2.8 million|

  Assume we have already initialized the Q and P matrix. Now let’s consider runtime as our feature and director as another feature and let’s solve the problem of estimating the latent features for directors and runtimes. Hence, we choose Runtime and Director as our features and optimize the below objective function:

   J = − log p(R| Q, P, μ, W) + λ ||θ||₁,    where λ is the regularization hyperparameter  

  First, we update the user and item feature matrices Q and P using SVD decomposition. Then, we apply regularization techniques to avoid overfitting. Finally, we can formulate the optimized conditional probabilities and assign ratings based on these probabilities. Mathematically, let’s write the update rules for the parameters θ:
  
   Update rule for Q: Q = ((X^TQ^TP + lambda*I)^(-1))*X^TQy,         where y is a constant vector of ones

   Update rule for P: P = ((X^TQ^TP + lambda*I)^(-1))*Qy^Ty,            where y is a constant vector of ones

   Update rule for μ: μ = np.mean(np.array([np.dot(X[:,i].reshape(-1,1),y)*(λ/len(y))+mu*(1+λ) for i in range(len(y))]))
  
   Update rule for W: W = np.dot(((X^TQ^TP + lambda*I)^(-1)), Q.T @ y)
 
  And finally, we can plug in the updated estimates back into the formula for calculating the likelihood and calculate the negative log-likelihood to get the next set of Q and P matrix. We keep repeating these steps until convergence occurs or maximum iterations limit is reached.
