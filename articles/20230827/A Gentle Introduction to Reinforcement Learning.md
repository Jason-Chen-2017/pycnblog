Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that enables agents to learn how to make decisions in situations where rewards or punishments are received for their actions. It involves an agent interacting with its environment by taking actions and receiving feedback as to whether those actions were effective or not. The goal of the RL agent is to find a strategy that maximizes long-term reward over time while also minimizing the negative consequences of its actions on the system being controlled. This can be seen as training the agent to balance between exploration and exploitation: it must explore new areas of the state space so as to discover potentially useful policies, but once it finds one that works well, it should exploit that policy to maximize future reward. 

The idea behind reinforcement learning has been around for decades now, but the rapid progress achieved recently through advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), deep Q-learning (DQN), actor-critic methods, and other techniques have had a profound impact on the field's development. In this post we will gently introduce the main concepts, algorithms, and technical details involved in developing modern reinforcement learning systems. We will begin by reviewing some key ideas from psychology, economics, and control theory, before diving into more advanced topics such as model-based and model-free reinforcement learning, exploration/exploitation tradeoffs, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.

We hope that this post will provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and students interested in building intelligent systems that adaptively act based on dynamic environments and receive positive or negative feedback. 

2.Key Ideas from Psychology, Economics, and Control Theory
In order to understand the foundations of reinforcement learning, it helps to recall some important ideas from psychology, economics, and control theory. These include:

1. Utility Function - In psychology, utility functions measure the value of different alternatives, including goods and services provided by human beings or machines. Reinforcement learning relies on the concept of a reward function which specifies the reward associated with each action taken by the agent. When designing reward functions, it is crucial to consider both immediate and long-term benefits, since humans often seek to optimize these values.

2. Marginal Value of Information - One way to think about decision making under uncertainty is to break down the decision problem into smaller subproblems, which may have different marginal value of information (or cost). For example, if the weather forecast predicts rainfall tomorrow, then deciding whether to go swimming or stay dry would involve choosing between two options with different probabilities. In economic terms, people generally prefer riskier activities because they reduce their overall uncertainty, leading them to take actions with lower marginal costs.

3. Rational Decision Making - According to the principles of rational choice, humans tend to choose the option that appears most beneficial to themselves without regard for any external factors such as probability, social influence, or culture. In contrast, artificial intelligence agents might behave differently depending on the contextual information provided by the environment. To achieve high levels of performance, these agents need to select actions that are guided by rationality rather than instinct or randomness.

4. Feedback Loops - Humans use feedback loops when making decisions to modify our behavior in response to changes in the external world. These loops allow us to adjust our perceptions, expectations, preferences, and behaviors accordingly. In reinforcement learning, we build similar feedback loops using the term "credit assignment". By accumulating rewards, the agent learns to map states to higher cumulative rewards, thereby improving its current strategy.

These ideas form the basis of the basic components of reinforcement learning systems, including the agent, the environment, the state, the action, the reward function, and the credit assignment process. The next section will discuss the various types of reinforcement learning algorithms, starting with basic Q-learning and proceeding to more complex models like DQN and A3C.
