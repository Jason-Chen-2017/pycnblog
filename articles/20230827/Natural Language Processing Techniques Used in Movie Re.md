# 2.Terminology and Basic Concepts
## Term-Semantic Analysis
In natural language processing, semantic analysis refers to analyzing textual data and identifying meaningful relationships between words and concepts within it. It involves representing each word or phrase as a vector representation, which captures its meaning and allows us to analyze its relationship with other words and phrases. This is done by comparing the similarity or distance between vectors and using statistical methods to determine how similar two words or phrases are. For example, if we have a document containing sentences like "The cat in the hat" and "She sells seashells", we can represent each sentence as a vector of weights corresponding to each unique word. The weight associated with the word "cat" could be higher than those associated with "hat" since they convey different meanings while the weight associated with "sells" may be lower than that of "seashells". Once all the documents have been represented as vectors, we can use clustering or regression techniques to identify patterns and group them together. One commonly used method is TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency), which calculates the frequency of terms in a document and then normalizes it by taking into account the overall frequency of terms across the corpus. This approach gives more importance to rare but important words. Another technique is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA/LSI), which projects the original high-dimensional vector space down onto a lower dimensional space that retains most of the information while reducing noise and redundancy. This makes it easier to compare and analyze texts based on shared themes or topics.
语义分析就是从文本中分析其含义的过程。它通过对每个单词或短语进行向量表示，使得它能够捕捉到它的意义并且与其他单词或短语之间的关系，比较两个向量之间的相似性或者距离，以及利用统计方法确定两个单词或短语之间是如何相似的。举例来说，假如有一个文档，其中有两句话："The cat in the hat" 和 "She sells seashells"，我们可以把这两句话表示成不同的权重向量。“cat”这个词对应的权重可能高于“hat”这个词，因为它们表示的是不同的含义；而“sells”这个词可能低于“seashells”，因为前者代表一种行为，后者代表一种商品。所有文档都被转换成了向量之后，就可以使用聚类或回归的方法识别模式并将它们组织起来。一个常用的方法就是TF-IDF(Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)，它会计算出一个文档中某个词频的大小，然后除以整个语料库中出现该词的次数，得到该词在特定文档中的重要程度。这种方法赋予较高的权值到罕见但重要的词汇上。另一个技术是潜在语义分析（Latent Semantic Analysis），它将原始的高维空间映射到低维空间中，保留信息的同时降低噪声和冗余。这样的话，便于根据共享主题或话题来比较或分析文本。

## Content-Based Recommendations
Content-based recommenders rely heavily on user profiles and item descriptions to generate personalized recommendations. These systems extract features from items' metadata, including keywords, categories, and reviews, and then match them against user's preferences to create a list of recommended items. Popular content-based recommenders include collaborative filtering, keyword matching, and hybrid recommender systems. Collaborative filtering is a machine learning approach that considers the preferences of multiple users and predicts ratings or preferences for a particular item. It works by analyzing the behaviors of similar users and building a profile based on their opinions. Keyword matching uses item metadata to assign scores to candidate items based on their relevance to a given query. Hybrid approaches combine content-based and collaborative filtering methods to improve accuracy and diversity of recommendations.

基于内容的推荐器依赖于用户档案和项目描述生成个性化的推荐。这些系统从项目元数据的关键字、类别和评论等特征中提取特征，然后与用户的偏好匹配，生成推荐列表。流行的基于内容的推荐器包括协同过滤、关键词匹配和混合推荐系统。协同过滤是一种机器学习的方法，它考虑了多个用户的偏好，并预测特定项目的评级或偏好。它通过分析类似用户的行为构建了一个基于他们的意见的档案。关键词匹配则根据查询针对候选项目分配分数，基于它们与给定查询的相关度。混合方法结合了基于内容的和协同过滤的方法，以提高准确性和推荐的多样性。

## Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering algorithms utilize the ratings or preferences of various users to recommend items to a new user who has not provided any rating yet. They work by finding users whose tastes and interests are similar to the target user, and then recommending items that those users liked. There are several types of collaborative filtering algorithms, including memory-based, model-based, and graph-based methods. Memory-based models store previous user activities and preferences, whereas model-based methods build a mathematical model of user preferences and use it to make predictions. Graph-based methods represent user-item interactions as a network and use centrality measures to find influential nodes. Popular collaborative filtering algorithms include user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, SVD++, Pearson correlation coefficient, and matrix factorization methods. User-based collaborative filtering assumes that similar users share similar preferences and selects the top N rated items that both users have liked. Item-based collaborative filtering computes the latent factors for each item based on the ratings of similar users, and then recommends unseen items that are most similar to previously seen ones. SVD++ adds regularization to improve the performance of collaborative filtering methods.

协同过滤算法利用各种用户的评级或偏好为新用户推荐物品。它们通过找到目标用户的喜好与兴趣相近的用户，并推荐那些用户喜欢的物品来工作。协同过滤算法有三种类型——基于内存的模型、基于模型的模型和图形模型。基于内存的模型存储了之前的用户活动和偏好，而基于模型的模型建立了用户偏好模型，并用于预测。图形模型将用户项交互表示为一个网络，并使用中心度衡量找到影响力节点。流行的协同过滤算法有基于用户的协同过滤、基于项目的协同过滤、SVD++、皮尔逊相关系数和矩阵因子化法。基于用户的协同滤波假设相似用户具有相似的偏好，选择最受N赞同的物品，这两人都喜欢过。基于项目的协同过滤计算每个项目的潜在因子，依据类似用户的评价，然后推荐之前看过的物品中最相似的一个未见到的项目。SVD++添加正则化以改善协同过滤方法的性能。

## Rating Prediction Models
Rating prediction models use historical data to predict future ratings or preferences of items for users. These models assume that items with similar attributes tend to receive similar ratings. Commonly used rating prediction models include collaborative filtering, logistic regression, linear regression, Bayesian networks, and Markov chains. Logistic regression uses binary values to calculate probabilities of success and failure for each user-item pair. Linear regression estimates a linear equation to fit the ratings curve. Bayesian networks estimate probability distributions over user preferences and attempt to capture uncertainties in the underlying ratings process. Markov chains simulate the probabilistic transition of states in discrete time series data, making them useful for modeling sequences of events such as stock prices. Popular rating prediction models include ALS (Alternating Least Squares), KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), Random Forest, Matrix Factorization, and Deep Learning Methods. ALS attempts to minimize the error between predicted ratings and actual ratings, while KNN assigns a rating based on the average ratings of k nearest neighbors. Random Forest builds a collection of decision trees and aggregates their outputs to predict ratings. Matrix Factorization decomposes the ratings matrix into low-rank matrices and maps them back to a sparse matrix of item features, which can reduce dimensionality and allow for faster calculations. Lastly, deep learning models leverage neural networks to automatically learn complex functions from large amounts of data and produce accurate results.
