# 1.简介
  

Batch normalization (BN) is a widely used technique for improving the training of deep neural networks (DNNs). It was proposed in 2015 and has been shown to significantly accelerate DNN training by reducing internal covariate shift (ICS), which refers to changes in the distribution of features across different layers during training. In this article, we will briefly introduce BN, its core algorithm and how it works. Then, we will show some code examples using PyTorch library. Finally, we will talk about possible future improvements of BN and some common questions and answers raised in literature review. Let's get started! 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 Batch normalization
Batch normalization (BN) is one of the most important techniques that have been introduced recently to improve the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs). During training, batch normalization normalizes each mini-batch of input data before passing it through the network. The key idea behind batch normalization is to normalize the output of neurons before activation functions are applied, i.e., apply an affine transformation separately for every mini-batch. Specifically, BN normalizes the mean and variance of each feature map over the mini-batch dimension. This reduces ICS and improves the overall stability and convergence of the training process. To do so, BN maintains two learnable parameters, scale $γ$ and bias $β$, per channel or layer, that are multiplied with normalized values after adding the offset $\beta$. Therefore, BN makes the model less sensitive to the scale of the inputs, resulting in faster learning rate adaptation and better generalization ability than other regularization techniques like weight decay or dropout. 


## 2.2 Internal Covariate Shift (ICS)
Internal covariate shift (ICS) refers to changes in the distribution of features across different layers during training. For example, consider a simple feedforward neural network with three fully connected (FC) layers where outputs from the first FC layer act as inputs to the second FC layer and then finally into the output layer. Intuitively, if there is any change in the distribution of the activations within these layers, then backpropagation might fail to update weights properly because gradient information would be lost between them. Similarly, if any of the intermediate feature maps present sudden shifts in their statistics, such as when they are sampled at random or subjected to perturbations during training, then all subsequent layers downstream of those affected layers will also suffer from the same issue. Hence, the goal of good initialization of weights, proper scaling of gradients, early stopping/reducing LR on plateaus etc. can not only help avoid divergence but also address ICS effectively.


## 2.3 Learning Rate Decay and Gradient Clipping
When working with large datasets, it becomes crucial to use appropriate optimization algorithms like SGD, AdaGrad, Adam, RMSProp etc. These algorithms aim to find the best balance among speed, accuracy, and memory usage. However, sometimes high learning rates can lead to slow convergence due to oscillations or even divergence. Therefore, one effective way to deal with this problem is to gradually reduce the learning rate during training, starting from a higher value at the beginning and decreasing to a lower value towards the end. We call this method "learning rate scheduling". Another option is to clip the gradients to prevent them from becoming too large. This approach is more aggressive than lr scheduling since it prevents the parameter updates entirely instead of just slowing down the learning process. Again, clipping should be combined with careful analysis of the effectiveness of each technique individually. 

Therefore, although BN is known to greatly enhance the efficiency of DNN training, optimizing hyperparameters like learning rate, momentum, and weight decay remains critical to obtain optimal results. Additionally, it is essential to analyze model architecture and regularize it appropriately to minimize ICS and improve generalization capacity.


# 3. Core Algorithm and Operation Steps
In this section, we will walk through the basic operation steps of BN and discuss some relevant details. We assume that we are dealing with a mini-batch $X=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n \in \mathcal{R}^{d_\text{in} \times m}$, consisting of n samples with d_in features and m batches. First, we compute the sample mean and standard deviation of the mini-batch:

$$\mu_{\text{batch}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m x_i $$

$$\sigma_{\text{batch}}^2 = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - \mu_{\text{batch}}) ^ 2 $$

where $\mu_{\text{batch}}$ and $\sigma_{\text{batch}}$ represent the mean and standard deviation of the mini-batch respectively. Next, we subtract the mean of each element from the corresponding element of the mini-batch:

$$\hat{x}_i = (x_i - \mu_{\text{batch}} ) / \sqrt{\sigma_{\text{batch}}^2 + \epsilon}$$

where $\epsilon$ is a small constant added to the denominator to ensure numerical stability. Now, we pass the transformed mini-batch $\hat{X}$ through the rest of the network, applying the following operations at each hidden layer:

$$z_i^{(l+1)} = W^{(l)} \hat{x}_i + b^{(l)}$$

and computing the nonlinearity $\phi(\cdot)$ and the output layer predictions:

$$y_i = \phi(z_i^{(L)})$$

Note that we do not need to include a trainable scale factor $\gamma$ or bias $\beta$ inside the BN equation, since they are learned automatically based on the current mini-batch statistics. Instead, we multiply the normalized mini-batch with $\gamma$ and add $\beta$ externally outside the network.

After the forward propagation, we perform backward propagation to compute the gradients with respect to the weights, biases, and mini-batch statistics throughout the network. At each layer l, we first compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the pre-activations $z_i^{(l)}$:

$$\nabla_{z_i^{(l)}} L = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i^{(l)}}$$

Next, we transform the gradients using the chain rule to obtain the gradients of the loss with respect to both the mini-batch statistics $(\mu_{\text{batch}}, \sigma_{\text{batch}}^2)$ and the parameters of the previous layer:

$$\nabla_{\mu_{\text{batch}}} L = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i^{(l)}} \frac{\partial z_i^{(l)}}{\partial \mu_{\text{batch}}} = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j^{(l)}} \frac{\partial z_j^{(l)}}{\partial \mu_{\text{batch}}} $$

Similarly,

$$\nabla_{\sigma_{\text{batch}}^2} L = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i^{(l)}} \frac{\partial z_i^{(l)}}{\partial \sigma_{\text{batch}}^2} = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j^{(l)}} \frac{\partial z_j^{(l)}}{\partial \sigma_{\text{batch}}^2}$$

Finally, we take the average of the gradients computed above over the entire mini-batch and apply the update rules for the parameters $W^{(l)}, b^{(l)}$, and the batch normalization variables $\mu_{\text{batch}}, \sigma_{\text{batch}}^2$:

$$\Delta W^{(l)} = \eta (\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{(l)}}) \\
\Delta b^{(l)} = \eta (\frac{\partial L}{\partial b^{(l)}}) \\
\Delta \mu_{\text{batch}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mu_{\text{batch}}} \\
\Delta \sigma_{\text{batch}}^2 = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\partial L}{\partial \sigma_{\text{batch}}^2}$$

where $\eta$ denotes the learning rate. Note that while updating the weights and biases, we still divide by the number of minibatches m. This ensures that the gradients are unbiased estimates of the true gradient, accounting for the fact that our mini-batches may vary in size.


# 4. Code Example using Pytorch Library
Let us now see some practical code examples using the PyTorch library to illustrate the application of BN in training a deep CNN. Consider a binary classification task with MNIST dataset. Here, the input images are grayscale and have dimensions 28x28 pixels. The output variable is either zero or one representing digit class {0,1}. Our task is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify digits accurately. Below is the implementation of the CNN without BN. Without BN, we observe that the model tends to underfit and achieve poor test accuracy. After introducing BN, we notice significant improvement in performance and the model achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST dataset.
