Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure that enables users to execute complex analytical queries against large datasets stored in distributed storage using SQL-like syntax called Structured Query Language (SQL). It provides fast querying and analysis capabilities for big data without the need to write complex code or use MapReduce programming paradigm. In this article, we will learn about the core concepts of Hive and get started with basic operations such as creating tables, inserting data, reading data from tables, filtering data based on conditions, aggregating data using functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc., joining multiple tables, sorting results, and exporting data to external systems. We will also cover advanced topics like partitioning, indexing, writing user defined functions (UDFs), optimizing query execution plans, and troubleshooting common problems faced during development and production usage. By the end of the article, readers should have a solid understanding of how Hive can be used to analyze and extract insights from large volumes of structured or unstructured data stored across multiple file formats within Hadoop ecosystem.

In order to fully grasp the content of this article, it is recommended to have some familiarity with Hadoop architecture and data processing models such as MapReduce, HDFS, YARN, Spark, Pig, and others. A good knowledge of relational database management system concepts such as schemas, normalization, transactions and ACID properties would help in better understanding certain aspects of Hive operation. 

We assume that you are familiar with operating systems, command line interfaces, networking, and general computer science concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and programming languages. You must also be comfortable working with SQL dialects including ANSI standard and its extensions.

This is a long read but do not worry! Once understood, you will find yourself enjoying learning new technologies, sharing your experiences, and getting hands-on with real world examples. Let's dive into the technical details below.<|im_sep|>
2.1 Background
Hadoop is one of the most popular open source Big Data frameworks currently available. It allows us to process enormous amounts of data at scale efficiently and cost effectively. However, managing massive datasets is still challenging even for experienced developers. To address this issue, Apache Hive was created. It provides a declarative language known as Structured Query Language (SQL) to enable users to interact with large datasets stored in Distributed File System (HDFS) managed by Hadoop framework. Users can create tables, insert data, perform joins between different tables, filter data based on conditions, aggregate data using built-in functions, sort results, and export data to external systems. The result set can then be further processed using various visualization tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, or Google Charts. Additionally, Hive offers high scalability, fault tolerance, security, and compatibility features making it ideal for running large-scale analytic jobs. Despite these advantages, however, developing and maintaining Hive queries requires expertise in several areas, such as SQL syntax, performance optimization, design patterns, and debugging. This complexity makes it difficult for non-technical individuals to make their first steps towards building robust analytical solutions using Hive.

To simplify the development and maintenance tasks associated with Hive, Cloudera has developed Impala which is essentially an extension of Hive providing improved performance, additional functionality, and support for efficient parallel processing. Another significant effort that aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for non-technical users is Zeppelin. It supports interactive data exploration, integration with other third party applications, automatic generation of visualizations, and collaboration among team members. Nevertheless, these projects offer limited support for more advanced functionalities offered by Hive and require deeper expertise in Hive internals. Therefore, we propose here an essay that covers all essential parts of Hive, starting from a brief introduction and background information, to simple SQL queries, aggregation functions, and advanced features such as UDFs and Partitioning. 

2.2 Prerequisites
Before diving into the main topic of this article, let’s quickly go over the prerequisites required beforehand.

2.2.1 Experience With Hadoop Ecosystem
While being an open source project, Hadoop is constantly evolving and expanding. As such, there may be changes in the APIs, toolchains, terminologies, and overall approach taken by various companies/projects contributing to the ecosystem. Hence, it is essential to stay up-to-date with latest developments and best practices adopted by various vendors. For instance, it is crucial to understand the underlying principles behind MapReduce, HDFS, YARN, and so on, so that you can properly configure your cluster settings, tune parameters, and optimize performance accordingly.

2.2.2 Familiarity With Relational Database Management Systems
Hive uses SQL as its primary query language, which means it relies heavily upon SQL standards and features. In addition to that, we also leverage the powerful engine provided by traditional RDBMSes such as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Understanding fundamental concepts of RDBMS such as schema design, data normalization, transaction management, and concurrency control will be very helpful when working with Hive.

2.2.3 Knowledge Of Programming And Scripting Languages
While Hive only provides access to semi-structured and unstructured data through its SQL interface, it does come with a rich set of libraries and tools written in Java, Python, and Scala. These languages allow developers to implement custom functions, transforms, and mappers for specific data types or situations. Becoming proficient in these languages will greatly enhance your ability to utilize and integrate Hive into existing data pipelines.
