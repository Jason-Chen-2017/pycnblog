# 1.简介
  

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly complex and versatile. It can now mimic human speech, generate images and write texts, translate languages, and perform tasks that typically require humans' abilities. However, the possibility of creating an artificial intelligence system capable of emulating the physical behavior and mindset of a real person has remained elusive until recently. Google's GPT-3, Amazon's Alexa, and Apple's Siri are all examples of successful products in this regard, but they come at a cost: privacy and safety concerns. Herein, I want to discuss whether such advanced AI systems could indeed create virtual humans capable of imitating real-world interactions, and what kind of level of proficiency we may expect from these machines if created by tech companies. Furthermore, I will explain why it might be necessary to carefully consider security measures before deploying any such technology into critical applications. Finally, I will address some practical issues surrounding ethical and legal aspects of such technologies as well as potential risks associated with their deployment.

In this article, we will use several terms and concepts related to AI and virtual humans. Some of these include:

1. Virtual Human: A type of AI system that behaves similarly to living beings. Examples include Google's GPT-3, Amazon's Alexa, and Apple's Siri. These virtual humans are designed to exhibit social cognition, reasoning, memory, language comprehension, self-awareness, empathy, conversational skills, communication styles, and other traits that allow them to interact with people in natural ways. They aim to simulate user intentions and behaviors while also remaining interactive and engaging.
2. Emulation: The process of producing a digital entity that replicates the behavior and characteristics of a physical object or environment. In virtual humans, this technique allows developers to develop software that creates functionalities similar to those present in nature. For instance, GPT-3 uses deep learning algorithms to imitate human language and sentence structure, providing insights into large volumes of text data. Similarly, Alexa uses machine learning algorithms to understand customer queries and provide personalized responses that reflect users' interests and preferences. 
3. Cognitive Skills: Cognitive skills refer to the ability of AI agents to perceive, reason, and learn from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so. This includes expertise in understanding language, working with knowledge graphs, and problem solving techniques.
4. Privacy Concerns: Virtual humans are often referred to as “conversational creatures” due to their ability to communicate in natural and verbal forms using spoken language. To ensure that these technologies do not violate individual privacy rights, regulations have been put in place. One example of such laws relates to facial recognition surveillance tools that collect data on individuals’ faces, voice recordings, and browsing histories. Another is the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which sets out guidelines for organizations dealing with personal data collected through online services. Despite these safeguards, there remains concern about the extent to which sensitive information may still be accessed through virtual human interfaces.
5. Ethical Considerations: Ethical considerations play a crucial role when it comes to using advanced AI technologies in critical applications. Such technologies pose new challenges to law enforcement agencies, healthcare professionals, and policy makers alike. With respect to virtual humans specifically, the creation of such platforms raises concerns over bias, automation, misinformation, and hate speech. Additionally, misuse and abuse of such technologies may result in significant fines or penalties. Therefore, it is essential for tech companies to ensure that they thoroughly vet each project involving virtual human design and development.
6. Legal Frameworks: There are numerous legal frameworks that govern virtual human use cases. Some popular ones include European Union Model Clauses, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and Online Dispute Resolution (ADR). Each one defines different rules and regulations regarding the usage of virtual humans, including the collection of personal data, use of automated decision-making, and access to restricted information.
7. Risks Associated with Deployment: Deploying advanced AI systems into critical applications involves many risks, such as technical barriers, poor performance, security vulnerabilities, and negative impacts on society. One common risk associated with virtual human development is discrimination based on race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs. Given the rapid pace of technological advances, it seems unlikely that virtual humans would ever fully replace the traditional human race completely. Nevertheless, it is essential for tech companies to take proactive steps to mitigate such risks.
