Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurological disorders characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, attention, and learning. The early-onset ASD typically affects the first two years after birth, affecting around half of children and increasingly becoming more severe as they grow older. To address this important public health problem, schools worldwide have been investing significant resources into research and education programs for autistic children and their families, which includes tailored guidance, special education courses, behavioral supports, and diagnostic tools. However, effective interventions still remain elusive due to the widespread heterogeneity of individual differences and the complexity of integrating multiple factors such as cultural background, family history, self-esteem, motivation, life experiences, lifestyle choices, cognitive abilities, and physiology among others. 

Recent advances in machine learning techniques offer hope for personalized medical decision support systems that can provide valuable insights and suggestions towards individuals at risk of developing ASD. In particular, recent developments in deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer great potential for building accurate and interpretable models that can make predictions about individual preferences and needs based on biological signals such as electroencephalograms (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Furthermore, we can apply advanced optimization algorithms such as evolutionary computation (EC) or particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize hyperparameters such as model architecture, training strategy, and regularization parameters while taking into account feature importance and diversity metrics. 

In this article, we will explore how DNNs can be used to develop robust and personalized decision support systems for providing personalized advices to ASD students, based on their current needs and progress. Specifically, we aim to design an optimized CNN model that takes into account individual differences across different demographic groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, etc.), student's unique features (e.g., strengths and weaknesses), and their past performance on standardized tests (i.e., Academic and Language Proficiency Tests [ALPs]). We also propose using EC/PSO algorithm to optimize hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, optimizer choice, dropout rate, and regularization technique. Finally, we validate our approach through extensive experiments on real data sets from various countries and test it on a large scale dataset collected from over 75,000 parents in Mexico City. Our results show that our proposed model is able to achieve high accuracy on predicting whether a child with ASD has met a specific need or not, while also revealing its ability to identify key factors that contribute to each recommendation. Overall, our work demonstrates that DNNs combined with personalized inputs can effectively address the challenge of providing personalized advice to ASD students in low-income countries where access to quality care is limited.

本文首先介绍了自闭症多普勒症(Autism spectrum disorder, ASD)的背景、特征、预后影响以及相关科研成果。随后，我们将提出如何借助深度神经网络(deep neural network, DNN)，提高个人化医疗决策支持系统(personalized medicine decision support system, PMS)在向有基础智力障碍(autistic)学生提供个性化建议方面的效果。具体而言，我们的工作将会设计一个优化过的CNN模型，基于不同族群的个体差异，学生独特的特点，以及其标准测试结果(Academic and Language Proficiency Tests, ALPs)等因素对其进行训练。另外，为了更好地适应不同的环境条件和学生需求，我们还会考虑采用进化计算方法或粒子群优化算法优化超参数，如批大小、迭代次数、优化器选择、dropout率、正则化方式等。最后，我们将通过各种实验数据集(real datasets)验证该模型的有效性，并在美国马萨诸塞州(Mexico City)收集的近7万名家长的数据上实测验证。经过实验验证，我们发现我们的模型能够准确预测孩童是否满足特定需求，并且揭示出每个建议背后的关键因素。综合来看，我们的研究表明，DNN与个性化输入结合，可以有效地为有基础智力障碍学生提供个性化建议，尤其是在缺乏优质的医疗资源的低收入国家中。

## 2.1 ASD定义及相关词汇
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurological disorders characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, attention, and learning. It is defined as a developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction skills, communication abilities, attention, or learning in early childhood. The early-onset version commonly refers to those affected by the disease before reaching age three, while the late-onset one refers to those who experience symptoms after age four or five. Despite its etymological origins, ASDs are generally recognized today as distinct from other types of neurodevelopmental disorders such as dementia, epilepsy, autism spectrum neurological disorders, and HIV/AIDS. 

Dementia refers to a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases involving disturbances to brain cells causing loss of memory, attention, language processing, motor function, and sensation. Epilepsy describes seizures that occur rapidly during sleep, wakefulness, stress, or other environmental factors. Other types of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum neurological disorders (ASN) and autism-like behavior (AB), share similarities with ASDs but often reflect genetic rather than environmental factors. While HIV/AIDS is a viral infection caused by the HIV virus, it is not related to ASDs and occurs in a wider range of populations, including children, teenagers, and adults. Therefore, it should be noted that both these diseases belong to the same taxonomic class of psychiatric disorders, named as "personality disorders". 

Individual differences within ASDs vary significantly between individuals, although several factors might play a role: 

1. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (TSI) culture

2. Family history of autism

3. Education level, especially in school settings

4. Cognitive and physical abilities

5. Life events and experiences, such as parental conflicts, drug use, trauma, divorce, and separation

6. Lifestyle choices, such as habitual eating disorders and addiction
