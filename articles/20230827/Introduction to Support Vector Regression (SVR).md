# 1.简介
  

Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for regression analysis and prediction tasks. It is similar to linear regression but it uses the support vectors to determine the hyperplane that best separates the data points into classes. The goal of SVR is to find the hyperplane with the maximum margin between two classes while minimizing an error term called "epsilon". In other words, we want to find the most effective hyperplane that can explain as many instances as possible while keeping the error within an acceptable range. 

In this article, we will explore what support vector regression is, its mathematical formulation and implement it using Python programming language. We will also learn about different kernel functions and how they affect our model's performance.

Before starting this article, you should be familiar with basic machine learning concepts such as regression and classification, as well as some knowledge in Python programming. If not, please refer to other resources like Wikipedia or official documentation. 

This article assumes readers have prior knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, optimization algorithms and deep learning architectures.

## 2.1 定义
### Linear Regression 
Linear regression is a simple and commonly used method for predicting a quantitative response variable based on one or more predictor variables. In linear regression, the relationship between the input variables x and output variable y is assumed to be linear. That is, the predicted value of the output variable y is directly proportional to the sum of the product of each independent variable xi with their corresponding coefficients and bias b:

y = Σ(xi * ci) + b

Where c1, c2,..., cn are constants that represent the slope of the line, and biases b represent the intercept of the line at the origin. 

Linear regression has several advantages over other methods such as polynomial regression and decision trees because it can capture non-linear relationships in the data. However, it may not perform well when there are multiple confounding factors or interactions among the input variables.  

### Support Vector Regression
Support vector regression (SVR) is a variant of traditional linear regression that uses a subset of training examples to estimate a function that maps inputs from a high-dimensional space to outputs in a low-dimensional space. The estimated function is represented by a hyperplane in this low-dimensional space. 

The key idea behind SVR is to minimize the risk associated with misclassifying training examples. A typical approach involves creating a hyperplane that separates the data into distinct regions where each class appears only once. This hyperplane is chosen to maximize the distance between the closest examples of each class. These examples are termed the support vectors. Any point outside these support vectors is considered an error, which contributes to the overall error rate.

We use a penalty term epsilon to control the tradeoff between fitting the training set well and avoiding overfitting (i.e., creating a complex model that fits the noise in the data instead of the underlying pattern). Intuitively, if the value of epsilon is too small, then the hyperplane may underfit the training data and create high variance. On the other hand, if epsilon is too large, then the hyperplane may fit the training data too closely and lead to high bias. By adjusting the value of epsilon, we balance between these two concerns. 

### Kernel Functions 
Kernel functions provide a way to project high-dimensional input spaces into a lower-dimensional feature space where a linear separation is easier to obtain. Traditionally, RBF kernels were used for SVMs due to their ability to handle non-linear relationships. Other popular kernel functions include linear, polynomial and radial basis function (RBF), etc. 

A good explanation of kernel functions is provided in Professor <NAME>'s Machine Learning Course Notes [https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/courses/mlfss17/notes_pdf/ch3.pdf]. In summary, a kernel function transforms the input space into another space where the distance metric becomes a dot product of the original features. The transformation allows us to use standard linear classifiers and regressors on higher dimensional datasets without having to consider explicit feature mappings. 

Overall, both linear regression and support vector regression assume a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable. Both models involve selecting a subset of the training data to construct a separate hyperplane. The choice of kernel function determines how the hyperplanes are constructed and affects the degree of flexibility and robustness of the model.
