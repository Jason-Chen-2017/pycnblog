# 1.简介
  

In this article we will implement two machine learning algorithms - linear regression and support vector machines (SVM) regression on Python programming language using scikit-learn library for data preprocessing and model training and testing purposes.

Linear regression is a simple algorithm that estimates the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (X). On the other hand, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data to identify patterns and categorize new examples based on their similarity to known ones. In both cases, our objective is to learn a function that can predict values of y when given an input X value. The output of the prediction function is used as a measure of how well the model fits the data. 

In order to evaluate which algorithm performs better in solving our problem at hand, let's compare their performance metrics: Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE), R-squared coefficient of determination(R^2) and mean squared error (MSE) score. We'll also test different parameters and hyperparameters for each model to improve its performance. This comparison will help us understand the limitations and strengths of each approach before selecting the best suited method for our dataset. 

We will use various datasets from sklearn library and apply these techniques on them to gain insights about their behavior and determine the appropriate regression model for our dataset. These code snippets should be helpful for anyone who wants to learn about the implementation details of linear regression and SVM regressions using Python programming language.

1. Basic understanding of linear algebra concepts.
2. Basic understanding of python programming language.
3. Familiarity with NumPy and Pandas libraries.
4. Scikit-learn python library installed on your system. You can install it by running the following command in terminal: `pip install scikit-learn`

# 3.Dataset Introduction
The first step towards implementing any Machine Learning Algorithm is to choose the right Dataset. Here we have chosen Boston Housing dataset and breast cancer wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset for demonstration purpose. We can use the respective documentation pages provided by sklearn website for getting information related to the same.<|im_sep|> <|im_sep|>







Linear Regression Model:
In linear regression, the hypothesis function is defined as: 
hθ(x)= θ0 + θ1*x1+θ2*x2+....+θn*xn, where theta is the parameter vector containing the coefficients corresponding to the n features of the dataset X. θ0 is called the bias term and represents the constant offset added to the predicted value. The goal of linear regression is to minimize the sum of squares of errors (SSE) or mean squared error (MSE) over all training samples, denoted by J(theta): 

J(theta)=∑i=1m(hθ(xi)-yi)^2=(y−hx)(y−hx)T/2  

where m is the number of training samples, xi is the feature vector of i-th sample, hi is the predicted label of xi obtained through the hypothesis function hθ(xi), and yi is the actual label of xi.

Hypothesis Function Optimization:
Once we have our hypothesis function, we need to find the optimal set of weights (θ) such that the SSE or MSE is minimized. One way to do this is gradient descent optimization technique. For iterative updates, we calculate the gradients of J(θ) with respect to each weight θj, then update the weights θj by subtracting the product of the learning rate alpha and the negative gradient calculated above from the current weight value.

Therefore, the process of finding the optimal weights involves repeating these steps until convergence, which means the difference between consecutive updates becomes smaller than a threshold ε. A common strategy is to start with some initial guess for the weights θ, then repeatedly update them while monitoring the progress made by comparing the predicted labels generated by the hypothesis function hθ(x) with the true labels y in the training set. If the predicted label does not match the actual label closely enough after multiple iterations, the weights may become too large or small and cause numerical instability during gradient descent. Therefore, it is important to carefully tune the learning rate α and stopping criteria ε to avoid these issues.
