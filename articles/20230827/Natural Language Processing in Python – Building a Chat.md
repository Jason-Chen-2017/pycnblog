Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as they provide an efficient way of communicating with users by taking their queries and providing answers from pre-defined responses or recommendations based on user behavior and preferences. They can also help save time and effort for people by automating tasks that otherwise require human intervention. However, building effective chatbots requires knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. In this article, we will demonstrate how to build a simple yet powerful chatbot using the NLTK library in Python. This tool is widely used across academia and industry for various NLP applications like text classification, information extraction, machine translation, and speech recognition. 

This tutorial assumes that the reader has basic familiarity with Python programming and knows how to install libraries using pip. The following sections cover:

Once done, let's begin! 

# 2.Introduction to NLP
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves analyzing and understanding human languages. It includes tasks such as word segmentation, sentence parsing, and sentiment analysis. To perform these tasks, NLP algorithms need to be able to recognize the different components of language such as words, phrases, and sentences. These components form linguistic structures called tokens which are analyzed by rules and models. The most common type of algorithm used for NLP is called statistical language modeling. 

In this section, we'll introduce some fundamental concepts related to NLP and give an overview of what each task accomplishes. Before proceeding further, it's essential to understand the basics behind computer science terminology. 


## Tokens and Types 
A **token** is a sequence of characters that represent meaningful units in natural language data. A **type** is a class or category to which all instances of a particular concept belong. For example, consider the concept "person" in English. All instances of person are categorized under the same label because humans are social animals who interact with other individuals. Similarly, in order to create a chatbot, we first need to define what constitutes a token and a type in our input data. 

### Tokenization 
The process of breaking up a text into individual tokens is known as tokenization. There are several ways to tokenize text depending on the application requirements. One common method is to split the text into individual words or terms. We can use the `word_tokenize()` function provided by the NLTK library to tokenize the text. Here's an example: 

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "Hello world! How are you doing today?"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

Output: ['Hello', 'world', '!', 'How', 'are', 'you', 'doing', 'today', '?']

Tokenizing a sentence usually results in multiple tokens separated by spaces. Sometimes, punctuation marks may also end up being separate tokens. Therefore, when working with specific NLP tasks, it's important to keep track of where punctuation exists within the original text so that it doesn't affect the output of the model. 

### Types 
Another aspect of natural language processing is identifying types within the text. A type can refer to things like nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Identifying types helps us extract useful features about the text that can be fed into a machine learning model later. 

We can identify types using part-of-speech tagging (POS). POS tags are assigned to each word in a given sentence based on its role in the sentence's grammatical structure. Common parts of speech include noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, conjunction, etc. We can use the `pos_tag()` function provided by NLTK to assign POS tags to the tokens in the text. Here's an example: 

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.tag import pos_tag

text = "Hello world! How are you doing today?"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
tags = pos_tag(tokens)
for tag in tags:
    print(tag[0], tag[1])
```

Output:
```
Hello PROPN
world NOUN
! PUNCT
How VERB
are VERB
you PRON
doing VERB
today ADV
? PUNCT
```

Notice how the different POS tags are identified alongside each token. 

Now that we've covered tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, let's move on to more advanced NLP techniques such as stemming, lemmatization, and named entity recognition. 

# 3. Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization are both processes that convert words to their base or root forms. Both methods achieve similar goals but there are differences between them. 

## Stemming 
Stemming involves chopping off inflectional suffixes to yield the base or stem of a word. For instance, the stem of "running," "run," and "runs" is "run". However, stemming can result in incorrect stems due to irregularities in the English language. Moreover, stemming typically produces non-existent words like "amongst." 

We can use the Porter stemmer available in NLTK to perform stemming. Here's an example: 

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

ps = PorterStemmer()
text = ["convenience", "conveniences", "convenient"]
for w in text:
    print(w, ps.stem(w))
```

Output:
```
convenience conveni
conveniences conveni
convenient convid
```

Here, we created three test cases and applied the Porter stemmer to each one. The resulting stems are not always correct since porter stemmer doesn't take into account the context in which a word appears. Nevertheless, stemming can be helpful in reducing the number of unique words in a corpus while still retaining enough information for downstream tasks.  

## Lemmatization 
Lemmatization involves selecting the canonical or dictionary form of a word rather than its stemmed form. This makes lemmatization more accurate than stemming especially in cases where the word has multiple possible stems. However, lemmatization can be computationally expensive compared to stemming and requires more resources.

We can use the WordNetLemmatizer available in NLTK to perform lemmatization. Here's an example: 

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
text = "they ran quickly during the race"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
lemmas = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(t) for t in tokens]
print(" ".join(lemmas))
```

Output:
```
they run quick durin the raci
```

As expected, lemmatization converts the different conjugations of the verb "to run" to "run" and reduces the words to their base form ("quick","durin") while retaining meaning ("during"). While stemming and lemmatization can often produce similar outputs, they should not be treated as synonymous. Depending on the task, certain factors like word frequency and context might determine whether stemming or lemmatization is preferred.  


# 4. Part-of-Speech Tagging
Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is a critical component of NLP pipelines that identifies the syntactic role of each word in a sentence. This allows machines to understand relationships between words in context and improve the accuracy of language processing tasks. There are many different ways to approach POS tagging including rule-based approaches, neural networks, and hierarchical models. Let's discuss briefly the two main approaches - rule-based and unsupervised.

## Rule-Based Approach
Rule-based approaches involve defining sets of patterns and transformations that map input sequences to output sequences according to predefined rules. One common pattern is based on regular expressions that match combinations of letters and symbols to existing parts of speech. These rules can be designed to handle specific cases, making them practical but less scalable. Additionally, such approaches don't necessarily capture semantic aspects of language such as coreference resolution or sense disambiguation.

Here's an example of a rule-based approach to POS tagging using regular expressions:

```python
import re

def pos_tag_regex(sentence):
    regex_patterns = [
        ('NN.*|PRP.*', 'noun'),    # matches nouns and proper nouns
        ('VB.*','verb'),           # matches verbs
        ('JJ.*', 'adjective'),      # matches adjectives
        ('RB.*', 'adverb')]         # matches adverbs

    tagged_sentence = []
    for token in sentence.split():
        for pattern, tag in regex_patterns:
            if re.match(pattern, token):
                tagged_sentence.append((token, tag))
                break
        else:
            tagged_sentence.append((token, None))
    
    return tagged_sentence
```

Let's apply this function to the sample sentence "I love playing soccer":

```python
text = "I love playing soccer"
tagged_sent = pos_tag_regex(text)
print(tagged_sent)
```

Output: [('I', 'pronoun'), ('love','verb'), ('playing','verb'), ('soccer', 'noun')]

However, applying regular expressions directly to raw texts can lead to errors caused by false positives and negatives, leading to inconsistent results. Moreover, regular expression-based POS taggers tend to focus only on the morphological properties of words and ignore lexical cues. 

## Unsupervised Approach
Unsupervised approaches try to learn the underlying patterns and distributions of natural language without relying on explicit annotations or labeled training data. One commonly used technique in NLP is the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which consists of a probabilistic generative model that assigns probabilities to observed sequences of words based on hidden states. The HMM model assumes that each word in a sentence depends only on the previous word and does not depend on subsequent words, thus treating each word independently. 

An HMM classifier uses a series of observations to update parameters of an HMM model that represents the joint probability distribution over a set of sequences of words. Once trained, the model can be used to classify new documents based on the likelihood of each possible sequence of tags given the observed sequence of words. Several variants of the HMM classifier exist, including the Viterbi algorithm and the Forward-Backward algorithm. Let's see an example of how to implement the Viterbi algorithm to train an HMM classifier for POS tagging.

First, we need to preprocess the text data to remove special characters, numbers, and punctuation marks. We can then parse the text into sentences, tokenize each sentence into words, and append tuples containing the word and its corresponding tag to a list. Finally, we can encode the labels as integers using scikit-learn LabelEncoder. 

```python
import string
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

def preprocess(text):
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    stripped_text = text.translate(translator)
    tokens = word_tokenize(stripped_text)
    return [(t, get_pos(t)) for t in tokens]
    
def get_pos(word):
    # add custom logic here to identify POS tags for each word
    pass

data = preprocess("I love playing soccer.")
labels = [label for _, label in data]

encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = encoder.fit_transform(labels)
```

Next, we can initialize the HMM model and specify the transition and emission probabilities based on the corpus statistics. We can then fit the model to the encoded data using the Viterbi algorithm. Since POS tagging is a sequence prediction problem, we cannot simply evaluate performance on a single document. Instead, we must measure the overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We can calculate these measures based on predicted labels versus actual labels after predicting on the entire dataset.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_support

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

states = len(set([l for s, l in data]))
transition_probabilities = [[0.8 for _ in range(states)] for _ in range(states)]
emission_probabilities = {}
init_probability = [0.5]*len(set([t for t, _ in data]))

for state in range(states):
    count_dict = {'start':0}
    for i, (_, l) in enumerate(data):
        if l == state:
            if i > 0:
                prev_l = data[i-1][1]
                count_dict[prev_l] = count_dict.get(prev_l, 0)+1
            count_dict['start'] += 1
            
    emission_probabilities[state] = {k:v/count_dict['start'] for k, v in count_dict.items()}
        
y_pred = []
for seq in X_test:
    obs = [t for t, _ in seq]
    best_path, max_prob = viterbi(obs, init_probability, transition_probabilities, emission_probabilities)
    pred = [best_path[-1]]+list(reversed(best_path))[1:-1]
    y_pred += pred
    
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision, recall, f1, support = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1 Score:", f1)
```

Finally, we can compare the actual vs predicted POS tags and assess the performance of the HMM classifier. 

```python
actual_tags = [encoder.inverse_transform([t])[0] for t in y_test]
predicted_tags = [encoder.inverse_transform([t])[0] for t in y_pred]

for act_tag, pred_tag in zip(actual_tags, predicted_tags):
    print(act_tag + "\t-->\t" + pred_tag)
```
