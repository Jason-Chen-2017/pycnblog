# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm used to classify or predict outcomes based on input features. In this tutorial, we will go through the fundamental concepts of SVM and then build an example classifier using Python's scikit-learn library. 

In this article, you'll learn how Support Vector Machines work, its working principles and implementation steps in Python using scikit-learn library. We will also discuss different types of SVMs such as linear, polynomial and radial basis function kernel and their advantages over other algorithms. Additionally, some of the important parameters and hyperparameters involved in SVM training can be understood better along with practical examples and use cases. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our model using various evaluation metrics like accuracy score, precision, recall, F1 score etc. 

By the end of this tutorial, you will have gained insights into the inner workings of SVM and understandable explanations of relevant mathematics and techniques used to train them effectively.

We hope that by reading this article, you'll find it easy to implement your own SVM models and get started with SVM for your data science projects. If you're already familiar with SVM but want to know more about its latest advancements, feel free to read our latest articles.

 # 2.相关概念、术语及定义
Before we dive deep into the core concepts and technologies of support vector machines (SVM), let’s first briefly review some related terms and definitions that are commonly used in the field of machine learning. 

 ## Terminology

 - **Input**: Input refers to the set of independent variables X that define each instance or observation, which is represented by one row in the dataset. For example, if you are building a credit scoring system, your input could include age, income, debt burden, number of open credit lines, amount borrowed per month, and so on. 

 - **Output/Class Label**: Output refers to the dependent variable Y that specifies the class label or category assigned to each instance or observation. This output value indicates what the observed feature(s) represent. For example, if you are trying to identify fraudulent transactions, your output might indicate whether the transaction was actually fraudulent or not. Typically, the class labels are binary (e.g., fraud vs non-fraud). 

 - **Training Set**: The set of instances used to develop the SVM model is called the training set. It consists of both inputs and outputs, where each instance represents a single input-output pair. 

 - **Testing Set**: Once the SVM model has been trained, it needs to be tested against new data, known as testing set, to check its generalization ability. The testing set contains observations that were not seen during training and provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model would perform in real-world scenarios. 
 
## Mathematical definition of SVM

The mathematical definition of SVM involves finding the best hyperplane that separates two classes of points in high-dimensional space while maximizing the margin between these two classes. The optimal hyperplane is chosen among many possible hyperplanes by minimizing a regularized cost function, subject to certain constraints. Here's how SVM works mathematically:





Let's break down the above equation step by step:

- Let x be the input feature vectors, y be the corresponding output classes (either +1 or –1) and φ(x) be the decision boundary that separates positive and negative samples.
- The objective function C∗ is optimized using soft margins, which means that small errors can be penalized more than large ones. Therefore, the width of the decision boundary does not have to be exactly equal to 1/λ, making it easier to handle datasets with varying scales.
- Minimizing the maximum margin distance between any two points within both classes leads to stronger separation of classes compared to other classification methods.
- SVM uses kernel functions to transform the input features into higher dimensional spaces where they become linearly separable. These transformations help in capturing nonlinear relationships in the data and improve the overall efficiency of the algorithm. There are three popular types of kernel functions used in SVM:

  * Linear Kernel
  * Polynomial Kernel
  * Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel
