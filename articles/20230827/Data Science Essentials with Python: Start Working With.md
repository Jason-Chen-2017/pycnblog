Data Scientist plays a crucial role in today’s world of big data and has many responsibilities as we try to understand the underlying patterns or trends from massive amounts of data generated every day. However, learning how to work with big data requires more than just technical skills. To make it easy for anybody to get started working with big data, I have prepared this article that will help you learn core concepts, algorithms, practical techniques and code examples while also providing clear insights into future directions and challenges. This is not an exhaustive guide but rather serves as a starting point for anyone interested in getting started with big data analysis using Python.

This article assumes readers are familiar with basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, functions, arrays and dictionaries. If you are completely new to programming, don't worry. We'll start by covering the basics.

# 2. Basic Concepts

## 2.1 Variables
A variable is a symbolic name given to a piece of information stored in memory. In other words, it refers to some value which can be changed at runtime. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10 # assign value 10 to x
y = "Hello World" # assign string "Hello World" to y
z = [1, 2, 3] # create list [1, 2, 3] and assign to z
```

We can access the values assigned to these variables like this:

```python
print(x) # output: 10
print(y) # output: Hello World
print(z) # output: [1, 2, 3]
```

You can use different data types, including integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), booleans (bool), lists (list), tuples (tuple), sets (set), and dictionaries (dict). Let me know if there are any specific questions about each data type. 

## 2.2 Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on operands, typically values that are stored in variables. The common arithmetic operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulo (%), exponentiation (**), and floor division (//). Here's an example:

```python
a = 10 + 5
b = 10 - 5
c = 10 * 5
d = 10 / 5
e = 10 % 5
f = 10 ** 5
g = 10 // 5
```

Similarly, comparison operators include less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), greater than or equal to (>=), equality (==), and inequality (!=). These operators return boolean values indicating whether the condition is true or false. Here's an example:

```python
result_a = a < 15
result_b = b > 5
result_c = c == 50
result_d = d!= 2
```

Logical operators include AND (&), OR (|), NOT (~), XOR (^), and conditional operator (?:). They allow us to combine multiple conditions together using logical operators. For instance, let's say we want to check if both a and b are positive and if c is even. Using logical operators, we could write something like this:

```python
is_positive = lambda x: x > 0
is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0

if is_positive(a) & is_positive(b) & is_even(c):
    print("All conditions satisfied")
else:
    print("Not all conditions satisfied")
```

Here, `lambda` function is used to define two separate functions `is_positive` and `is_even`, which returns True only when their respective conditions are met. `&` operator combines them with logical AND operation. The result of the expression inside the `if` statement is printed based on whether all three conditions are satisfied (`True`) or not (`False`). You can replace the `print()` statements with appropriate actions depending on your program requirements.  

## 2.3 Control Flow Statements
Control flow statements are used to control the execution of our programs. There are several types of control flow statements, including if/elif/else blocks, for loop, while loop, and nested loops. Here's an example of an `if`/`else` block:

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num >= 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
else:
    print("The number is negative.")
```

In this case, we first ask the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and convert it to integer using the `int()` function. Then, we use an `if`/`else` block to determine whether the number entered is positive or negative. Finally, we print out one of the messages accordingly using the `print()` function. Note that `:` symbol must always appear after the condition in an `if`/`elif`/`else` block.
