Compressed sensing (CS) is a technique that enables the acquisition of sparse signals from a dense signal by using low-rank matrix completion techniques such as the Lasso or Total Variation regularization. This article introduces compressed sensing and explores its applications in medical imaging, image processing, biomedical engineering, and finance. We will discuss how to design CS algorithms, analyze their performance and limitations, and evaluate them for practical use cases where these techniques are particularly useful. In addition, we will demonstrate how our work can lead to significant improvements in computational efficiency and accuracy of various medical imaging tasks.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## Compressed Sensing
Compressed sensing (CS) refers to the problem of recovering a sparse signal $x$ from a noisy measurement $\hat{y}$ of a vector of measurements $y=\{\hat{y}_i\}_{i=1}^N$, where each $\hat{y}_i \in \mathbb{R}^M$. The goal is to minimize the number of nonzero entries of $x$ while still approximating $y$. In other words, it seeks to find a minimizer of the following objective function:
$$
\text{minimize} \quad ||x||_0 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad y = A x + n \\
\text{where}\quad n,A\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times M},\ x\in \{0,\pm 1\}^N
$$
Here, $||.\||_0$ denotes the zero norm, which counts the number of zeros in a vector.

When N >> M, the above problem becomes computationally tractable because it involves solving a large linear system, which is commonly referred to as "underdetermined" or ill-posed problems. In practice, most existing CS algorithms solve this problem iteratively using alternating projections or gradient descent methods on convex surrogate models constructed from the data. These surrogate models often take the form of either sparse approximation functions or dictionaries, depending on the specific algorithm being used. Here's an illustration of a common approach called l1-minimization.

## Sparse Representation
A sparse representation refers to a set of basis vectors and corresponding coefficients that approximate a given input vector well. It allows us to represent a high-dimensional vector as a combination of few basic elements instead of all possible ones. For instance, let $z=(z_1, z_2,..., z_{N})^T$ be a high-dimensional vector and consider a basis $\beta = (\beta_1, \beta_2,..., \beta_{K})$ consisting of K unit vectors $\beta_k$. Then, if $\|z\|=1$, then we have:

$$
z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \beta_k^{\top} z_{\alpha(k)}
$$

where $z_{\alpha(k)}$ is one of the support vectors of the subspace spanned by $\beta$. Specifically, the index $\alpha(k)$ indicates which coordinate is included in the subspace spanned by $\beta_k$. We can also write this equation more concisely as follows:

$$
z = B^\top z_{\alpha}
$$

where $B = [\beta_1, \beta_2,..., \beta_{K}]$ is a matrix whose rows form the basis. Here, $z_{\alpha}$ is a binary vector indicating which coordinates are included in the subspace spanned by the selected basis vectors. By selecting only a subset of dimensions corresponding to non-zero entries of $z$, we obtain a reduced-dimensionality representation of the original high-dimensional signal.

Sparse representations have many important applications in machine learning, including natural language processing, computer vision, recommender systems, and audio analysis. In medical imaging, they are commonly employed for compressively sampling X-ray images and CT scans into smaller formats that capture relevant features. In speech recognition, they enable compression of recorded speech signals into compact representations suitable for classification and processing. Additionally, sparse representations are crucial components of compressed sensing algorithms due to their ability to achieve both high dimensional recovery and low-rank structure.


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
In recent years, there has been substantial progress towards achieving efficient solutions to compressed sensing problems. Two main approaches have emerged: dictionary-based methods and sparse approximation functions based on singular value decomposition (SVD). While these two families of algorithms share some similarities in principle, their respective theoretical underpinnings, mathematical properties, and application areas vary significantly. Let's focus on the former first. 


## Dictionary Based Methods
Dictionary based methods involve creating a fixed-size dictionary of basis vectors and applying sparse coding over the entire observation vector at once. These methods operate directly on the raw signal without any pre-processing steps, but may suffer from poor scalability when the dimensionality exceeds certain limits. However, since they require no prior knowledge about the signal structure, they can adapt dynamically to different types of signals. Some prominent examples include:
* Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC): A variant of SVM that relies on dictionary learning to construct decision boundaries between classes, resulting in higher generalization capabilities than standard SVMs. An advantage of this method is that it does not rely on explicit feature extraction or hand-designed filters, thus enabling it to handle arbitrarily complex inputs. [Chen et al., ICML '09]
* Compressive Sensing using Hierarchical Sparse Coding (HSC): A variant of dictionary learning that uses multiple dictionaries hierarchically to extract the most informative features from the data. HSC is highly effective at dealing with high-dimensional data sets that possess intrinsic clusters and structures, and can learn rich and interpretable patterns. [Duvenaud et al., CVPR '09].

The key idea behind dictionary-based methods is to learn a codebook of basis vectors $\Phi$ such that the error $e_\lambda(x) = \Vert Ax - b \Vert$ is minimized for every $\lambda$ in the range of interest. In particular, the codewords $\bar{x}(\lambda)$ correspond to the solution to the optimization problem:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{minimize} && e_\lambda(\bar{x}(\lambda))\\
&\text{subject to}&& \Phi^{T} \bar{x}(\lambda) = \lambda d
\end{align*}
$$

where $A=[A_{\mu}]_{\mu\in \Omega}$, $\Omega$ is a finite set of measurement locations, $b=[b_{\mu}]_{\mu\in \Omega}$ are the observations at those locations, $d$ is a vector of weights assigned to each atom in the dictionary $\Phi$, and $x$ is the sparse approximation obtained through least squares fitting of the weighted sum of atoms in the coefficient vector $\bar{x}$. The optimal choice of lambda is determined by the tradeoff between sparsity and distortion.

To compute the codeword $\bar{x}(\lambda)$ efficiently, several variants of dictionary-based methods exist, including Multiplicative Update Rules (MU), Iterative Hard Thresholding Algorithm (IHT), and Primal-Dual Splitting Method (PDSP). Each of these methods updates the coefficients in a way that decreases the reconstruction error gradually until convergence is reached. Below is a summary of the inner workings of IHT, which is widely used in practice:

1. Start with a random initialization of the codeword $\bar{x}(\lambda)$;
2. Iterate over all indices $j$ in $\Omega$:
   * Compute the projection $\bar{a}_j$ onto the active set $\mathcal{A} = (\bar{a}_{\mu})_{\mu\in \Omega \backslash\{j\}}$ of $\Phi$ defined by fixing $j$ and updating the remaining atoms accordingly. The projection is computed using the formula $\bar{a}_j := P_{\mathcal{A}}^{-1}\Phi (b-\Phi\bar{x}(t))$, where $P_{\mathcal{A}}^{-1}$ is the pseudo-inverse of the submatrix $\Phi[\mathcal{A}, :]$.
   * Compute the threshold level $\tau$ as $\frac{\epsilon}{|\mathcal{A}|}$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired tolerance level specified by the user.
   * If $\vert\bar{a}_j\vert < \tau$, fix $j$ and update the remaining atoms accordingly; otherwise, leave $j$ free and continue iterating over the rest of the atoms.
   
After iterating over all indices, the updated codeword $\bar{x}(t+1)$ should converge to the optimal solution with respect to some distance metric.

Another popular variation of dictionary-based methods is Tikhonov regularization, where we add a penalty term to the loss function that encourages sparsity:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{minimize} && \frac{1}{2}\left\Vert AX - b\right\Vert^2_2 + \frac{\lambda}{2}\left\Vert \Phi\bar{x} - d\right\Vert^2_F
\end{align*}
$$

This leads to a simplified version of the primal-dual splitting method known as Robust PCA (RPCA), which estimates the dictionary and the coefficients simultaneously. Other variations include minimum variance encoding (MVE) and dictionary selection (DSEL), which aim to select the appropriate number of atoms based on the tradeoff between complexity, redundancy, and predictiveness.

While dictionary-based methods offer fast and scalable implementations, they can sometimes produce suboptimal results for noisy measurements. To address this issue, other methods like sparse regression, fused lasso, and group lasso have been developed to estimate individual weights in a probabilistic manner.


## Sparse Approximation Functions
Sparse approximation functions combine ideas from neural networks and dictionary-based methods to build surrogate models for compressed sensing. Unlike traditional sparse coding techniques, these models do not rely on carefully designed basis vectors, and hence they automatically adapt to the characteristics of the underlying signal. Popular choices of such models include sparse autoencoder (SAE) networks, deep belief network (DBN), and convolutional sparse coding (CSC).

The key idea behind SAE networks is to train a stack of fully connected layers that encode the input into a lower-dimensional latent space that captures salient features of the signal. The decoder layer then reconstructs the original input from this latent space. The intermediate layers serve as additional sparsification mechanism, allowing the model to concentrate on relevant parts of the signal during training. Aside from reducing the dimensionality of the input, these architectures also help improve the robustness of the learned representation by adding noise injection and dropout layers.

Recent developments in DBN allow modeling nonlinear relationships among variables and obtaining global representations of the data. These models leverage the power of Bayesian inference and incorporate uncertainty in the parameters through stochastic pooling operations. Despite their advantages, SAE models are slower to train compared to DBNs because they need to backpropagate errors through a long sequence of layers, whereas DBNs can train faster and converge to better local minima. CSC models are relatively simple, making them easier to implement and debug, but they tend to perform worse in terms of prediction quality and scalability. Overall, SAE models offer an appealing alternative to dictionary-based methods for handling arbitrary datasets.
