Contextual bandits (CBs) is a class of machine learning algorithms that allow an agent to learn from interactions with different contexts or actions to take optimally in response to the context-dependent situations it faces. CBs have been used for recommendation systems as well as personalized news article recommendations, healthcare interventions, advertisement targeting, and many other applications. The basic idea behind CBs is simple: given some information about the user’s preferences (e.g., demographics, past behavior), predict which action should be taken next based on the current state of the environment (e.g., news articles being displayed). By using this algorithmic approach, users can receive personalized content tailored specifically to their interests and needs, without needing to interact directly with the recommendation system.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing CBs algorithms that combine various reinforcement learning techniques with deep neural networks (DNNs) to make effective predictions. These algorithms often outperform traditional matrix factorization models by taking into account both user preferences and the context in which they occur, enabling more accurate predictions. 

This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to CBs algorithms and how they can be applied in recommender systems. We will cover key concepts like environments, arms, policies, and rewards; explore popular variants of CB algorithms such as Thompson Sampling, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), and Deep Bayesian Bandits; provide detailed explanations of each variant's mathematical formulation and operation steps; discuss practical use cases of these algorithms in recommender systems such as personalized music playlist generation and personalized e-commerce shopping experience; and analyze the strengths and limitations of these algorithms compared to classic collaborative filtering approaches. At the end of the tutorial, we hope readers gain a deeper understanding of how CBs can help improve recommenders' performance in real-world scenarios.

We assume the reader has a solid background in machine learning, statistics, optimization, and probability theory. Familiarity with reinforcement learning and DNNs would also be beneficial but not required. Moreover, we do our best to ensure that all technical details are clear and concise so that even non-technical stakeholders can understand the core ideas and potential benefits of CBs.

7.What are Contextual Bandits and How Can They Be Used in Recommender Systems?
## 1.Introduction

This chapter introduces the basics of contextual bandit (CB) algorithms, including their history, types, examples, and main characteristics. It then focuses on the design principles and terminology underlying CBs, highlighting how the problem of learning optimal decisions over multiple contexts can be formalized and solved. Next, we survey several representative variants of CBs, emphasizing their similarities and differences. Finally, we illustrate how CBs can be applied in the field of recommendation systems, including personalized music playlists and product recommendation tasks.


### What Is a Contextual Bandit Problem?

A contextual bandit problem consists of a set of possible actions (arms) to choose from, where each arm may depend on one or more factors or attributes called contexts. Each time the learner makes a decision, it observes the outcome of its chosen action (either success or failure) along with additional contextual information provided by the environment. Based on this observation, the learner updates its beliefs about the likelihood of choosing each action in the future, which allows it to select the most promising option at each step.

The goal of a contextual bandit problem is to maximize the expected reward obtained by the learner, assuming that the learner knows the true value function representing the payoff distribution of every action. To achieve this, the learner must balance exploration (i.e., exploring new options to gather information) and exploitation (i.e., selecting options that are known to be effective) to efficiently find the highest-valued options while avoiding getting trapped in suboptimal local minima. Exploration helps learn more robust strategies, while exploitation guarantees good performance in the face of uncertainty.

### Examples of Contextual Bandit Problems

1. Advertising Optimization: A company decides to invest in advertising by running an online campaign. To determine what ads to display on social media platforms, the company analyzes historical data regarding user engagement rates and clicks on ads. This data is available to the company as contextual observations collected during previous campaigns. The company wants to optimize the placement of ads to increase engagement rates while ensuring sufficient clicks per ad. 

2. Personalized Recommendations: Suppose you want to develop a recommender system for movies on Netflix. Your model uses your past ratings of movies and feedback on whether you watched them to generate a personalized movie recommendation. Given certain genres, keywords, or preferences, your model selects a subset of relevant movies for you to watch based on your past behavior. In contrast to conventional collaborative filters, contextual bandits offer two crucial advantages when dealing with large datasets:

   - **Scalability:** With massive amounts of data, traditional collaborative filtering methods may struggle to handle the volume of interactions necessary for personalized recommendations. Contextual bandits can leverage the ever-increasing availability of cheaply generated mobile app usage data to train models quickly and accurately.
   
   - **Privacy Preserving:** Many companies rely on recommender systems to generate revenue streams through targeted marketing campaigns or customized search results. However, collecting sensitive user data such as age, gender, location, or income poses ethical challenges to businesses, particularly when those data might be combined with publicly available data. Using contextual bandits, these companies can still collect valuable insights and deliver personalized experiences while protecting privacy.

3. Personalized News Article Recommendation: As online news consumption grows exponentially, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google News seek to recommend relevant articles to users based on their individual interests. One way to accomplish this task is to use contextual bandits algorithms. For example, a platform could run experiments across different topics, geographies, and languages to determine the optimal ordering of articles to show to each user. The result would be personalized news feeds that prioritize content according to a user's specific preferences and behavior.

4. Healthcare Interventions: Medical researchers are interested in leveraging big data to identify drug combinations that are likely to work together to reduce mortality rate and patient outcomes. Similarly, clinicians and hospitals need to continually tailor therapy plans to patients' unique needs, making contextual bandits a natural fit for these problems.

### Main Characteristics of Contextual Bandit Algorithms

Contextual bandit algorithms differ from standard supervised learning algorithms by treating the problem of making choices under uncertain conditions as a sequential decision process instead of a single-step prediction problem. Traditional supervised learning techniques require labeled training data consisting of features associated with each sample and corresponding target values indicating the correct output. On the other hand, contextual bandit algorithms operate in real-time, receiving noisy inputs about the environment that they must respond dynamically to.

Here are the main characteristics of typical contextual bandit algorithms:

1. **Non-stationary Environments:** Contextual bandit problems typically involve changing user behaviors, contexts, or rewards over time due to changes in user profiles, product popularity, and external events. Therefore, existing bandit algorithms designed for stationary environments are ill-suited to address these challenges. Instead, continuous adaptation techniques are needed to keep up with shifting dynamics.

2. **Sparse Feedback:** Contextual bandit problems can be highly sparse, meaning that very few samples are observed at any given point in time. To deal with this challenge, batch sampling methods, such as Gradient Bandit, Thompson Sampling, and UCB, can be efficient because they use only full batches of data to update parameters rather than mini-batches or randomly selected instances. 

3. **Deep Neural Networks:** Since contextual bandit problems involve complex nonlinear relationships between user behavior, contexts, and rewards, deep neural networks (DNNs) are commonly employed as the fundamental building block of modern CBS algorithms. Deep neural network architectures can capture complex dependencies among input variables, leading to better predictive performance than linear models.

4. **Off-Policy Learning:** Reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find the optimal policy by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback about the resulting actions. However, there exist many settings where the true optimal policy cannot be easily identified and is unavailable. Thus, off-policy learning techniques, such as Q-learning and Double Q-learning, enable the algorithm to exploit other policies learned from related tasks to estimate the value of different actions. 


## 2.Design Principles and Terminology

### Key Concepts

Before diving into the core components of contextual bandit (CB) algorithms, let's first define some key concepts:

1. Environment (Environment): An environment is defined as the setting or context in which the agent operates. Depending on the type of problem being addressed, the environment might consist of static properties such as a fixed set of products or users, or dynamic properties such as the weather patterns, stock market prices, or social media trends. Dynamic environments change over time and therefore require adaptive decision making mechanisms that can adjust to sudden fluctuations in the environment. Typically, the environment contains the following elements:

   - State (State): The state represents the current situation or context within the environment. It includes features describing aspects of the world that influence the agent's decision-making process, such as user profile, item features, or agent context. 
   
   - Reward (Reward): The reward signal determines the utility that the agent receives after taking an action in the environment. When the agent takes an action, it receives a numerical value called the reward r(t). The value of the reward depends on the action performed and the subsequent state transition caused by the action. Rewards might include positive or negative signals, depending on whether the agent achieves a higher level of satisfaction or chooses undesirable outcomes.  
   
   - Action (Action): Actions represent the set of possible activities that the agent can perform in the environment. Depending on the type of problem being addressed, actions might range from simple button presses to more sophisticated operations such as searching for items or suggesting friends. Actions affect the state of the environment and can either succeed or fail. 
       
     Note: Some variations of CBS involve multi-armed bandits that simultaneously select multiple actions, which can further complicate the concept of actions.


2. Arm (Arm): An arm refers to a particular activity or decision that the agent can take in the environment. In the case of a contextual bandit problem, the arm corresponds to the possible action that the agent can take. Arms can vary significantly in terms of their features, cost, duration, and consequences. For instance, in a news recommendation problem, different articles might be eligible as candidates for different categories, and each category might have varying difficulty levels.


3. Policy (Policy): A policy defines the agent's behavior when faced with different sets of arms. During training, the agent begins by evaluating the effectiveness of its current policy in solving the problem. It then generates a new policy by updating its internal model of the environment and the effects of the arms on its overall performance. Policies can be deterministic or stochastic, depending on whether they assign equal probabilities to all possible actions or use a probabilistic distribution to represent uncertainty.


4. Reward hypothesis: The reward hypothesis asserts that humans are capable of optimally allocating resources to meet their goals and objectives. According to this hypothesis, individuals focus on achieving long-term high-value goals, rather than short-term gains that are easy to obtain and lead to minimal long-term consequences. The reward hypothesis suggests that optimizing immediate rewards is important for achieving long-term successes, whereas secondary considerations such as emotions and perceived risk can sometimes detract from long-term success. Therefore, aiming for high immediate rewards alone does not guarantee long-term success.


### Types of Bandits

There are three broad classes of CB algorithms:

1. Non-parametric Variants: Non-parametric variants of CBS try to estimate the distributions of the reward functions rather than relying on a prior assumption about the underlying reward function. Popular variants of non-parametric bandits include epsilon-greedy and thompson sampling.

2. Parametric Variants: Parametric variants of CBS assume that the reward function follows a known parametric distribution. Popular examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and boosting.

3. Deep Variants: Deep variants of CBS utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) as the primary component of the algorithm. These methods combine a combination of linear regression and neural networks to learn a flexible and expressive representation of the reward function. Examples of popular deep bandits include deep Bayesian bandits, deep contextual bandits, and deep reinforcement learning agents.


## 3.Thompson Sampling

One common variation of CBS is Thompson Sampling, which combines Bayesian inference with randomized controlled experiments to infer the posterior distribution of the unknown parameter $\theta$ given the observed data $X$. Specifically, the agent maintains a prior distribution over $\theta$, represented by the beta distribution, and updates it based on the results of the experiment. The experimental strategy involves randomly assigning the agent to treatments or control units based on the estimated propensity scores. Treatments receive an outcome drawn from a Bernoulli distribution whose parameter is determined by the treatment assignment, while controls receive an outcome uniformly sampled from the unit interval [0,1]. Once the experiment results are observed, the agent updates its belief about the parameters using Bayesian inference.

Formally, let $\theta$ denote the unknown parameter, $N(k)$ denote the number of times the arm k was pulled successfully, and $N(\lnot k)$ denote the number of times the arm k was pulled unsuccessfully. The agent starts by initializing its prior belief about $\theta$ using a beta distribution $Beta(\alpha,\beta)$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are hyperparameters determining the concentration of prior knowledge about the true proportion of the successful arm. Then, at each round i, the agent samples an arm k from a Bernoulli distribution whose parameter is inferred using the Beta prior distribution and the experiment results $N(k)$ and $N(\lnot k)$. If k is assigned to a treatment, the agent receives a binary reward drawn from a Bernoulli distribution whose parameter is updated based on the current guess about $\theta$. Otherwise, if k is assigned to a control, the agent receives a reward uniformly sampled from the unit interval. After performing an action, the agent updates its belief about the parameters based on the observed reward and the previous guess about $\theta$. The beta distribution becomes closer to the conjugate prior distribution of the binomial data $(\lnot N(k)+1, \lnot N(\lnot k)+1, N(k))$. Eventually, the agent converges to the optimal solution $\hat{\theta}$ using the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters.

Here's how Thompson Sampling works in practice:
