# 2. Data Governance
## 2.1 Introduction
Data governance refers to the set of policies, standards, procedures, and institutional arrangements that regulate the use, access, control, movement, disposal, sharing, and protection of personal data collected from individuals, organisations, and sources related to data subjects. It ensures that organizational data assets are managed responsibly and ethically, while satisfying legal, contractual, and regulatory requirements. 

For example, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System), and NIST SP 800-190 (Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments for Information Technology Systems) are some common laws, regulations, and guidelines that cover data governance. Similarly, cloud services providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Alibaba Cloud, and IBM Cloud offer built-in data governance mechanisms. 

However, it is crucial to consider other aspects of data governance such as risk management, monitoring, and auditing, which have significant importance in ensuring data security and compliance. Moreover, transparency and accountability are critical to ensure that stakeholders understand who has access to what data, why, when, and under what conditions. This requires careful design of both technical infrastructure and business processes to achieve data governance goals.  

To implement successful data governance in any enterprise setting, several factors need to be considered including the following:

1) Privacy Concerns: Companies often face concerns regarding data privacy. They must ensure that their customers' privacy is protected according to relevant laws, regulations, and guidelines, and comply with ethical standards and best practices. 

2) Legal & Contractual Requirements: Companies may have specific legal or contractual obligations surrounding the collection, storage, use, transfer, and disposal of personal data. For instance, in Europe, GDPR provides additional requirements for public sector entities. Therefore, proper documentation needs to be established and followed, especially if there are potential conflicts of interest.

3) Risk Management: It's essential to establish a robust framework for managing risks associated with data breaches, accidental deletions, unauthorized access, and intrusion attempts. Risk assessments should involve analyzing threats, vulnerabilities, and risks associated with the handling of personal data. Furthermore, it is important to monitor and report incidents relating to data security events.

## 2.2 Data Classification
Classification of personal data is vital to determine its sensitivity level and manage data flow accordingly. Personal data can be classified into four main categories:

1) Sensitive: Sensitive data typically includes personal identifiers, passwords, credit card numbers, etc., which could potentially be misused if stolen or shared improperly. Examples of sensitive data include medical records, financial data, and employee information.

2) Critical: Critical data represents business-critical information about a person or organisation. Examples of critical data include customer databases, payment details, contracts, or marketing preferences.

3) Internal: Internal data are non-sensitive but valuable to an organization. Examples of internal data include business strategy, staff payroll records, product specifications, etc.

4) Public: Public data refer to information gathered online without consent from individuals. Examples of public data include browsing history, location data, social media profiles, news feeds, etc.

It is important to classify data appropriately depending on the intended purpose, context, and sensitivity level of the data. By classifying data into separate categories, companies can manage data flows, limit unnecessary sharing, protect sensitive data, and comply with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines.

## 2.3 Data Flow Management
Managing data flow refers to defining and implementing the appropriate processes for ingesting, processing, securing, storing, sharing, and archiving data. There are three primary data flow management approaches:

1) Centralized Data Warehouse: The centralized data warehouse stores structured and semi-structured data from different sources and makes it accessible to multiple departments within the company. This approach offers simplicity and scalability, but it may not always work well with complex data models or unique requirements.

2) Staged Data Ingestion: Staged data ingestion involves moving data from source systems towards destination systems in smaller batches, rather than a single batch of data. This reduces overall load on the system and increases data integrity. However, it requires additional development time and resources to create staged pipelines and integrate with existing systems.

3) Big Data Architecture: The big data architecture combines distributed computing platforms, cloud computing, and advanced technologies to analyze large volumes of data quickly and extract useful insights. This approach uses specialized hardware and software frameworks to handle massive amounts of data.

Each data flow management approach has its own advantages and limitations, and companies should choose the one that suits their specific needs.

## 2.4 Data Privacy and Compliance
Privacy and compliance are two terms commonly associated with data governance. Privacypolicy explains how users’ data is handled and what kind of data they provide to third parties. Compliance means adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and policies that affect personal data. Implementing privacy policy and maintaining compliance programs are essential elements of data governance. Some key points to consider when developing privacy policy:

1) Identify stakeholders: Ensure that you collect, store, process, transmit, and share only necessary personal data. Identify and communicate your privacy policy to relevant stakeholders, such as legal counsel, HR department, and employees. Make sure that everyone involved knows how to exercise their rights under the law.

2) Provide clarity: Clearly define the types of personal data that you collect, how long you keep it, and where you store it. Include contact information for privacy questions, and describe how your data will be used and disposed of after its retention period ends.

3) Set expectations: Communicate expectations for data use, data disclosure, and data access requests clearly and responsibly. Use clear language, ensure that people know exactly what type of data you hold, and explain when and how you will use it. Limit use of cookies and other tracking technology unless explicitly required by law or directed by a user.

4) Address changes: Continuously update the privacy policy to reflect changes in data collection, storage, usage, and transmission practices or when new regulations come into effect.

5) Support enforcement: Enforce privacy policy and other compliance measures by providing notice to affected individuals and authorities, taking action against those who violate the policy, and conducting regular audits to identify and remediate violations.

# 3. Data Collection and Storage
## 3.1 Introduction
When it comes to collecting and storing data, there are several steps to follow before actually starting to acquire, prepare, and curate data. Here are five essential steps that every data scientist or analyst must take:

1) Define the Problem: Before acquiring any data, start by identifying the problem being solved and determining the scope of the project. This includes identifying the industry, target audience, and goal.

2) Acquire Data: Once the problem statement is defined, proceed to acquire the data. Various sources such as surveys, reports, logs, email messages, social media posts, API calls, and sensors are commonly used to obtain data.

3) Prepare Data: After acquiring data, it needs to be prepared for subsequent analysis. This includes cleaning, filtering, and formatting the data so that it can be analyzed effectively. Common data preparation tasks include converting data types, correcting typos, eliminating duplicates, and resolving foreign keys.

4) Curate Data: Curation refers to creating a consistent and complete version of the raw data that can be used for later analysis. This includes combining similar datasets together, imputing missing values, and standardizing the format of fields.

5) Store Data: Once the data is ready, it needs to be stored securely. Depending on the size and complexity of the data, choosing a suitable storage solution would depend on factors such as speed, redundancy, accessibility, and cost.

Therefore, data collection and storage play a fundamental role in enabling data science projects to succeed. By following these steps properly, data scientists can efficiently build analytics solutions that can answer complex business problems.

## 3.2 Data Types and Formats
The type and format of data plays a vital role in deciding which analysis technique or tool is most appropriate for a given task. Common data types include numerical, categorical, text, datetime, spatial, and image data. Each data type requires a different type of analysis techniques or tools, such as statistical tests for numerical data, classification algorithms for categorical data, clustering algorithms for spatial data, and deep neural networks for image data.

Common file formats for storing data include CSV (Comma Separated Values), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML (Extensible Markup Language), and Parquet (columnar binary data). While CSV files are easy to read and interpret, JSON and XML files can contain nested structures, which can be difficult to manipulate programmatically. Parquet files are compressed columnar data files that can significantly reduce storage space and improve query performance.

Sometimes, data sets may require merging data from multiple sources, which can sometimes be challenging because the schemas and formats of the data may differ. However, data normalization techniques can simplify the integration process by removing duplicate rows, standardizing the schema, and avoiding redundant columns.

## 3.3 Data Quality and Errors
Quality and errors can become major bottlenecks in any data pipeline. Mislabeled data, incorrect feature engineering, and inconsistent data formats can cause huge delays or even crashes in downstream analysis. It's therefore crucial to thoroughly review the quality of the data and develop processes to detect and remove errors early in the pipeline. Below are some key points to consider:

1) Understand the Context: Determine whether the data is accurate and relevant for the particular scenario at hand. Be aware of biases introduced by the sample population, temporal correlations, historical events, and outliers.

2) Identify Data Issues: Use statistical methods such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, quartiles, and scatter plots to identify any obvious errors or outliers. Look for incomplete or missing values, duplicated entries, and abnormal ranges of values.

3) Document Issues: Keep track of data issues over time by documenting them in a spreadsheet or database, along with metadata such as timestamp, original source, and reasons for error detection.

4) Fix Data Issues: Fix data issues by manually correcting or dropping erroneous data entries. If possible, automate the correction process using programming languages such as Python or SQL.

5) Validate Correctness: Verify that the corrected data is correct by running additional checks such as comparing it to external data sources or executing regression tests.

## 3.4 Scalability and Cost Considerations
Scalability and cost are critical factors in deciding how much data to acquire and store. There are several ways to optimize data storage costs:

1) Optimize File Size: Compressing data files can greatly reduce their size, leading to reduced storage costs. Leverage compression libraries such as gzip or Apache Hadoop's snappy library to compress CSV and JSON files.

2) Partition Large Data Sets: Partitioning large data sets allows for efficient parallel processing and improves query response times. Group related data items together and store them in separate physical partitions or files.

3) Index and Shuffle Data: Creating indexes on frequently queried fields can improve query response times. Sorting data randomly can improve join performance.

4) Simplify Data Processing: Simplify data processing by reducing memory footprint and CPU utilization. Minimize I/O operations by caching frequently accessed data in memory or disk caches.

Optimizing data collection and storage strategies can lead to substantial savings in storage costs, which ultimately leads to improved data processing capabilities and faster decision-making processes.
