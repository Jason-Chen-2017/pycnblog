## 2.1. Explainable Machine Learning(XAI)
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that uses techniques to generate human-interpretable explanations for its decision-making process or behavior. The goal of XAI is to improve the transparency and trustworthiness of machine learning models through easy-to-understand representations, enabling humans to understand why the model made certain predictions or behaviors. Common applications of XAI include loan approvals, credit scoring, and fraud detection. Other notable topics covered under XAI include natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive maintenance.

## 2.2. LIME
Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a popular algorithm for generating local explanations for individual predictions made by black-box models. It involves taking multiple samples around the prediction point and fitting locally linear regression models to them, which are then used to estimate the importance of features responsible for those predictions. These feature weights are then visualized as a feature attribution map, providing an interpretable representation of the model's decision making process. Similarly, LIME is often paired with other techniques such as anchors or perturbation tests to achieve higher accuracy results.

## 2.3. SHAP
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is another popular algorithm for explaining the output of complex models. It computes Shapley values, which represent the impact of each feature on the final model output. This information is then displayed graphically using force-directed graphs, highlighting important features and allowing users to quickly identify patterns within data. SHAP is particularly useful for high-dimensional datasets or black-box models that are difficult to interpret manually. 

## 2.4. Anchor Explanation Method
Anchor explanations are similar to LIME but differ in two main ways. First, they do not require access to the underlying model training data, instead relying solely on the raw input data itself. Second, they produce explanation maps for any classification model without requiring a background dataset or labeled instances. Instead, they leverage randomly selected "anchors" points that lie close to the decision boundary between the positive and negative class labels.

## 2.5. Counterfactual Explanations
Counterfactual explanations seek to change one or more variables in the context of an observed outcome to obtain new outcomes that are unrelated to the original observation. For example, if you see a tumor in an image, a counterfactual explanation might suggest altering the intensity or size of the tumor to decrease its severity. Counterfactual explanations are widely used in clinical trials and marketing campaigns to assess treatment effectiveness.

## 2.6. Attributions
Attributions refer to the reasoning or belief processes involved in making a decision. They capture the extent to which each predictor variable influenced the outcome of the system. Attributions can be computed automatically using techniques such as gradient descent or integrated gradients, or handcrafted based on domain expertise.

## 2.7. Model Agnostic Explanations
Model agnostic explanations use generic statistical techniques instead of machine learning algorithms to explain the predictions of black-box models. By treating the model as a black box function, the attributions produced by the method are unconstrained by the modeling assumptions. Examples of model agnostic explanation methods include Saliency Maps and Deep Taylor decomposition.

## 3.1. LIME算法原理和操作步骤
LIME stands for Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations. LIME works by selecting an instance from the test set, locating the most relevant features for that instance using a weighted linear regression, and then aggregating those feature contributions into a single, interpretable explanation. Let’s break down the basic steps: 

1. Select Instance from Test Set: To start, we need to select an instance from the test set to perform our explanation on. One way to do this would be to sample randomly from the test set until we find an instance whose prediction needs to be explained. However, sampling blindly may lead to misleading explanations since there could be rare classes or outliers in the test set. Therefore, another option is to choose an instance based on a rule such as “the instance closest to a known anomaly” or “an instance with an interesting property”. Once we have chosen an instance, we proceed to step 2. 

2. Calculate Linear Regression Coefficients: Next, we need to compute coefficients of the linear regression model that best fits the surrounding neighborhood of the instance in question. This means finding the weight assigned to each feature that makes up the instance's predicted label. To accomplish this, we first create a kernel function that assigns low weights to instances outside the local region of interest (around the instance of interest), and high weights to instances inside that region. Then, we fit a weighted linear regression model to the data, using the weights calculated above as the target variable. This gives us a measure of the contribution of each feature towards the overall prediction. 

3. Aggregate Feature Contributions: Finally, we aggregate all the feature contributions found in step 2 to form a single, interpretable explanation. There are several approaches to doing so, but one simple yet effective approach is to rank the features by their absolute value of contribution, and then show only the top k features alongside their corresponding coefficients in the explanation. This ensures that the explanation is both informative and concise, without overwhelming the user with too many details. 

The formula for calculating the weighted linear regression coefficients is given below:



where xi represents the i-th feature, γ(x) represents the kernel function applied to x, yi represents the i-th label associated with x, wj represents the j-th weight vector representing the relevance score of each feature to the instance, and m represents the number of samples in the local neighborhood.

## 3.2. SHAP算法原理和操作步骤
SHAP stands for SHapley Additive exPlanations. SHAP is a unified framework that combines ideas from game theory and machine learning to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations. Let’s break down the basic steps:

1. Estimate Fidelity Score: Given a set of features x, we want to estimate how much the model depends on each feature independently. This tells us how much each feature contributes to the final prediction. We do this using a technique called Shapley Values, which assign a monetary reward to each player in a coalition, according to their share of the total cost of the joint action. Mathematically, let c_S(x) denote the conditional expectation of the outcome given that x belongs to the set S, and v_i(x) = sum_{k∈S} {c_k(x)} − {c_{-i}(x)}, where {-i} denotes the complement of S containing the i-th element. Then, the Shapley Value of i is defined as: shap_i(x) = E[v_i(x)]. 

2. Compute Dependence Coefficients: Now we compute the dependence coefficient for each feature i, j, which measures how strongly i affects the prediction when j changes. Mathematically, this is done by computing the correlation between the shapley values of i and j. Specifically, the dependence coefficient is equal to the Pearson correlation coefficient between shap_i and shap_j across all possible feature combinations. 

3. Visualize the Dependencies: We now visualize the dependencies found in step 2 using bar plots or scatter plots. If there is no interaction term, we simply display a bar plot showing the absolute value of the shapley values sorted in descending order. If there is an interaction term, we display a scatter plot with the two shapley values on either side of a color scale that shows the strength of the interaction term. 

Here's the general formula for computing the Shapley value of i:

shap_i(x) = E[f(x) * (Ic(f)(x)^i + Oc(f)(x))], where Ic(f)(x)^i indicates the portion of f(x) contributed by i independent factors, and Oc(f)(x) indicates the remainder term.

## 3.3. Anchor Explanation方法原理和操作步骤
Anchor explanations are similar to LIME, but work differently because they don't rely on the availability of background data and don't assume a pre-defined decision boundary between the positive and negative class labels. Rather, they randomly sample candidate anchor points that lie close to the decision boundary between the positive and negative class labels, and construct explanations accordingly. Here's the basic idea:

1. Sample Candidates: Start by choosing a random instance from the test set and considering whether it falls on the decision boundary between the positive and negative class labels. We call these candidates anchor points. 
2. Generate Anchors: Next, we generate multiple sets of candidates centered around each anchor point, by varying the magnitude and position of the anchor point slightly.
3. Train Classifier and Extract Important Features: We train a binary classifier on the generated candidate sets and extract the most important features that contribute significantly to the classifier's decisions.
4. Combine Anchors and Important Features: Using the extracted importants features and the learned classifiers, we combine them to form a set of explanations for the anchor points themselves.
