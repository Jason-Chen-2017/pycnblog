# 1.简介
  

Product line management (PLM) is the process of planning, organizing, developing, managing and selling a set of products that satisfy customer needs while satisfying various internal constraints such as quality, cost, flexibility, scalability and profitability. It involves planning, development, manufacturing, sales and support activities for all aspects of the product from conception to distribution.

The two most commonly used methodologies in PLM are Business Requirement Document (BRD) and Product Model Book (PMBOK). Each has its own strengths and weaknesses based on different factors, but they share some common principles. The objective of this article is to discuss how these techniques compare with each other and which one is better suited for specific use cases.

BRD and PMBOK methods have been around since the early days of product development. However, there have been significant changes over time with new versions coming out every year or so. This article will focus solely on comparing their key concepts and principles.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Business Requirements Document (BRD)
Business requirements documents (BRDs) provide an overview of what the business wants and why it needs particular features or functionalities within a product. They typically list all the stakeholders' needs and expectations along with any relevant information about the market and competition. 

It's crucial to create clear and concise definitions of terms and acronyms used in the document to avoid confusion. For example, "customer" should be defined consistently throughout the document.

In addition to describing customers' needs, the BRD includes use case scenarios and user stories that illustrate how the system will function when certain actions take place. These scenarios can also serve as acceptance criteria for testing purposes.

Overall, the BRD serves as the foundation for understanding and communicating the design and functionality of a product.

## 2.2 Product Model Book (PMBOK)
The Product Model Book is a structured framework that provides a guideline for creating a complete and accurate model of a product. In contrast to the BRD, it focuses more on how the actual product functions rather than just what it needs.

PMBOK covers several areas including introduction, purpose, scope, structure, processes, materials, deliverables, sources of risk, metrics, objectives, roles, responsibilities, and risks. These chapters outline the general approach taken by the company towards solving problems and achieving goals, identifying potential obstacles and limitations, and making trade-offs among competing alternatives.

It's essential to keep track of terminology and define them clearly before using them in the rest of the book. For instance, we might use the term "product" differently depending on where we're talking about the model itself versus the finished product being sold or shipped. 

Therefore, it's important to ensure consistency in terms of language usage across the entire model, including both overall structure and detail level.

The final part of the book often provides examples of realistic product models that showcase how the components work together in practice and allow decision makers to see the big picture.

Overall, the PMBOK is considered the industry standard for modeling complex systems at a high level of abstraction. While it requires expertise in multiple fields, it still provides a detailed and comprehensive roadmap for planning and developing products efficiently.

## 2.3 Commonality
Both BRDs and PM Books follow a similar format and cover many of the same topics, such as scope, resources, processes, and performance measures.

However, they differ significantly in terms of depth and breadth of coverage. The BRD sets the stage for defining all necessary details, including what the solution should look like, who it should benefit, and how users will interact with it. On the other hand, the PMBOK takes into account every aspect of the product from conception through to shipping.
