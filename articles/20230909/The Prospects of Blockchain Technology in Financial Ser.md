In recent years, the use of blockchain technology has grown tremendously in various industries such as finance and healthcare. However, it is still a relatively new field and there are many challenges to be solved before its widespread application can be considered a reality. In this article we will examine the prospects for blockchain technology in financial services.

Blockchain technology brings significant benefits to the financial industry through the ability to record transactions securely and ensure trust between parties involved. Blockchains have also been shown to significantly reduce costs associated with processing large volumes of data, allowing businesses to focus on core business processes rather than technical infrastructure. Although several companies and startups have launched their own blockchains-based applications within the financial sector, none have gained widespread traction yet due to several barriers that need to be overcome first. We believe these factors are becoming more manageable as time goes by but at this stage it remains challenging to see how blockchain technology could benefit the financial industry in general.

This article examines key concepts related to blockchain technology in the context of financial services, reviews existing research and development efforts, discusses practical applications and current issues relating to blockchain technology within the financial industry, and identifies potential areas where further research is required. Based on our assessment, we suggest ways forward that may enable greater adoption of blockchain technology within the financial sector.

# 2.Key Concepts: Terms & Definitions
## 2.1 Definition of Blockchain
A blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger or database used to record transactions and make them cryptographically verifiable. Each transaction takes place in blocks, which contain a hash pointer to previous block(s), timestamp, sender’s address, receiver's address, amount transferred, and any relevant data attached to the transaction. Once recorded, the information cannot be changed without alteration to all subsequent blocks. 

The term "blockchain" refers to a decentralized peer-to-peer network consisting of multiple nodes (computers) connected together via a communication protocol known as TCP/IP. A user must download software onto his or her computer to participate in the network, creating a local copy of the entire ledger. Any change made to the ledger requires consensus from a majority of nodes before being accepted by other nodes in the network. This process ensures that the data on the blockchain is accurate and free of tampering.




## 2.2 Distributed Ledger 
A distributed ledger or public ledgers is a shared digital database where records of events or activities occurring across multiple independent systems are stored and maintained in chronological order. The primary purpose of a distributed ledger is to store transactional data, i.e., accounting entries, payroll details, stock exchange orders etc., while ensuring that every participant agrees upon the same set of records. Consensus algorithms are used to ensure that different copies of the ledger remain consistent and up-to-date. Examples of distributed ledgers include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple.



## 2.3 Consensus Algorithm
Consensus algorithm is a mechanism used to establish agreement among participants in a distributed system when they communicate with each other over a network. There are three main types of consensus algorithms including proof of work, proof of stake, and proof of authority. They differ in terms of security and efficiency. Consensus algorithms help maintain the integrity and consistency of the distributed ledger.

### 2.3.1 Proof of Work (PoW)
Proof of work is the most common type of consensus algorithm used in blockchain networks. Participants compete to solve complex problems using computing power, typically called mining. When one node finds a valid solution to a problem, he broadcasts it to all others and adds it to his personal portion of the chain. By doing so, the network eventually achieves consensus on a single version of history, thus ensuring the integrity and consistency of the network. PoW uses electricity consumption as energy source, and some blockchains like Bitcoin use SHA-256 hashing algorithm based on complex mathematical computations. PoW is generally very difficult to attack because of the high computational requirements imposed by the algorithm.

### 2.3.2 Proof of Stake (PoS)
Proof of stake is similar to PoW but instead of solving computationally intensive puzzles, participants cast votes for the nodes who hold the right to add new blocks to the chain. Voters get rewarded for their support if their vote is counted as 'true', otherwise they lose their stake. PoS provides better economic fairness since participants receive rewards only if they provide valuable input to the network. Some examples of PoS-based blockchains include Cardano, Polkadot, and Cosmos.

### 2.3.3 Proof of Authority (PoA)
Proof of authority is another form of consensus algorithm where validators elected by a central authority approve the addition of new blocks to the chain. In this case, no proof of work is required as validation takes place directly by authorities. Similar to PoS, PoA is often preferred for permissioned blockchains where security is critical. Examples of PoA-based blockchains include Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Tezos.

# 3. Research and Development Efforts
To understand the concept of blockchain, we need to know about some of the key research and development efforts in the area of blockchain in the past few years. These include:
1. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAO): DAO was proposed as a way to govern and manage blockchain protocols through a decentralised autonomous organization (DAO). Its goal was to create a shared decision-making framework where people did not need to rely on a central party to decide on important decisions. However, DAO failed to gain much traction and was later abandoned after five years.

2. Smart Contracts: With the rise of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts were introduced as a way to automate legal agreements and payments. Smart contracts are programs that run on a blockchain network and execute automatically once certain conditions are met. They allow developers to build automated systems that interact with the real world economy. 

3. Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Traditionally, trading cryptocurrencies involves exchanging physical currency, making purchases, and managing wallets. Nowadays, there are numerous cryptocurrency exchanges available on the marketplace, providing easy access to buy and sell coins and tokens. Many of these platforms also offer token sales and airdrop campaigns to attract users towards their investment goals.

Overall, the introduction of cryptocurrencies has completely transformed the global financial ecosystem. Today, cryptocurrencies are widely used as digital payment methods, store of value, medium of exchange, and electronic money. Blockchain technology promises to further enhance the traditional finance industry by introducing new forms of trust and transparency. Nevertheless, it remains crucial to undertake rigorous research and testing to assess the suitability of blockchain technology for the financial industry.
