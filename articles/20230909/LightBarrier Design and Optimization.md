## 1.1 项目背景
Light barrier design (LBD) is a method for estimating the total weight of an article by measuring its individual components or packaging elements such as pallets, boxes, cartons, packages, or articles that can be stacked together without much physical contact between them. The LBD concept was first developed in the 1970’s by Ward et al. and has been widely used since then to estimate the weight of complex products like clothing and electronics.

## 1.2 Light Barrier Design (LBD)
The basic idea behind light barrier design (LBD) is to decompose a product into small, manageable components, measure their weights individually using standardized weight measuring devices, and add up the weights of these components to obtain an accurate measurement of the overall weight of the product. LBD eliminates any direct involvement with the internal structure of the item being measured, which makes it ideal for complex items and those that may not meet quality standards or have unique handling requirements. In some cases, additional information about the arrangement of components within the product is required to properly calculate their weights.

To perform light barrier design, one typically measures the thickness and dimensions of the material involved in manufacturing each component. These measurements are compared against a reference database containing standardized data on common materials, including density, specific gravity, thermal expansion coefficient, and viscosity. With this data available, one can use equations based on physics, thermodynamics, and mechanical engineering to determine the weight of each component. Once all the individual component weights have been determined, they can be added together according to their relative sizes to get an estimated weight for the entire product.

LBD has several advantages over more traditional weight measurement techniques. First, it allows for better control of measurement errors due to imperfections in the assembly process or other factors that do not affect the final weight of the item. Secondly, LBD is highly scalable and adaptable, allowing for easy adjustment of parameters if necessary to account for changes in market conditions or customer demands. Finally, while less precise than direct weight measurements, LBD still provides valuable information on the structural complexity and strength of an item.

## 2.关键术语
### 2.1 Material Thickness
The thickness of the material of the component being analyzed. It is usually measured by tracing the outer surface of the part from center outward at increments equal to half the width of the part. This is known as triangulation or the “cone test”. The thickness should be directly proportional to the volumetric mass of the material. 

The following formula describes the relationship between the thickness and the volumetric mass: 

$$thickness=\frac{\mu_{w}V}{d_{m}} \approx\frac{weight(kg)volume(m^3)}{\rho_{avg}(g/cm^3)}$$

Where $V$ is the volume of the material, $\rho_{{avg}}$ is the average density of the material, $\mu_{{w}}$ is the dynamic viscosity of water at room temperature, and $d_{{m}}$ is the diameter of the inner surface of the material. 

### 2.2 Stacking height 
The distance between the top surface of two consecutive parts, often given in multiples of a tolerance factor that reflects variability among the various products being analyzed. 

### 2.3 Box packing 
A technique used to combine different types of goods in bulk, most commonly through the use of cartons or boxes that are designed to hold a certain number of identical components. The contents inside a box can vary from few kilograms per box to tens of metric tons. 

Box packing creates challenges for LBD because the shape, size, and location of the individual pieces must also be considered when determining their individual weights. Additionally, the way in which the combined package is packed and secured can significantly affect its weight. For example, if the box is constructed from a single piece of wood, the entire weight of the box will depend on how well that piece was welded and welding tool weight was factored into the calculation. Similarly, if the box contains heavy electrical equipment or hazardous liquids, weighing the individual components alone may not provide a complete picture of the true weight of the combined unit. 

### 2.4 Uncertainty analysis
An approach where multiple methods are evaluated to understand variations in the resulting weight estimates caused by differences in input data or sampling methods. Statistical analysis methods can be used to compare results obtained across multiple samples and make inferences regarding patterns and relationships inherent in the data.

## 3.1 Step 1: Define Requirements
The client determines what kind of object he wants to design an LBD system for and sets out specific requirements, such as minimum dimension, maximum weight capacity, type of container, etc., for the solution. Based on these requirements, the manufacturer prepares a sample model or prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of LBD for his desired object.

## 3.2 Step 2: Prepare Reference Data Base
The manufacturer prepares a database that includes standardized data on common materials. Specifically, it lists the density, specific gravity, thermal expansion coefficient, and viscosity of different materials. This data is needed to convert the raw measurements taken during the LBD procedure into estimated weights for each component. Depending on the scale of the project, the manufacturer may choose to use only a subset of the reference data or integrate external sources of data.

## 3.3 Step 3: Collect Measurements
After defining the desired object and specifying the specification for the LBD system, the manufacturer begins collecting data on its own production line or supplier's stockpile of similar objects. Each piece of the object is carefully measured using appropriate tools and procedures, and their thickness and dimensional properties recorded. All measurements are made to the same accuracy level. During this stage, the manufacturer checks the consistency of the data by verifying that the reported values agree with the expected outcome after accounting for error, rounding, and human interference. 

## 3.4 Step 4: Identify Components
Based on the collected data, the manufacturer identifies distinct components and groups them into categories or families based on their appearance or function. If the component list is already provided by the client, it should be reviewed and modified if necessary before proceeding further.

## 3.5 Step 5: Calculate Component Weights
Using standard formulas and calculations based on physicochemical principles, the manufacturer uses the thickness, density, and length of each component to calculate its weight. The calculated weight is checked against a reference database to ensure that it falls within acceptable limits. The manufacturer repeats this step for every identified component until all components have been assigned a weight value.

## 3.6 Step 6: Adjust Weight Calculation Methodology
If the manufacturer finds that the accuracy of the calculated weights does not meet the needs of the client, the methodology can be adjusted to improve accuracy. For instance, the manufacturer might consider adding friction losses or adjusting the assumptions used in the weight estimation equation.

## 3.7 Step 7: Add Up Components
Once the individual weights of all components have been determined, the manufacturer adds them up according to their relative sizes to obtain an estimated weight for the entire product. To avoid discrepancies due to rounding and imprecision, the manufacturer rounds off the final weight to the nearest whole kilogram. 

## 3.8 Step 8: Complete Final Analysis
Finally, the manufacturer performs an uncertainty analysis to identify potential sources of variation in the estimated weight, such as uncertainties related to experimental error, stochastic nature of the physical processes, and the influence of environmental variables such as weather conditions, transportation loads, noise levels, and pollution. The uncertainty analysis helps the manufacturer validate the reliability of the predicted weights and inform future improvements in the LBD system.
