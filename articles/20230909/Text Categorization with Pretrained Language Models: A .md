Text categorization is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP), where the goal is to assign documents or texts into predefined categories based on their content. Despite significant progress in recent years, there are still many challenges associated with text categorization that make it an active research area. One such challenge is the availability of large-scale labeled datasets for training deep neural networks. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of how to apply pre-trained language models to perform text categorization tasks. We also discuss the state-of-the-art approaches used in different domains and identify some limitations that need to be addressed further to achieve the best possible performance. Finally, we propose directions for future research to address these issues effectively. Overall, our objective is to foster collaborations between NLP researchers and machine learning engineers, as well as encourage new ideas and techniques that can help advance the field.

- Labeled dataset: This refers to a collection of annotated documents or texts that have been manually assigned labels according to their category or topic. It is essential for building any supervised learning model in NLP.
- Pre-trained language model: These are large-scale language models that were trained on large amounts of text data, using large computing resources, usually followed by fine-tuning to adapt the language model to specific tasks. The pre-trained language models offer strong advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making them ideal for various text categorization applications.
- Fine-tuned language model: This process involves retraining a pre-trained language model on a specific domain-specific corpus, which helps improve the generalizability of the language model. For instance, if you want to classify texts related to music genre classification, then you might use a pre-trained language model like BERT, fine-tune it on a massive corpus of songs, and train additional layers atop the output layer to predict the genre label.
- Tokenization: This process involves breaking down the raw text into smaller units called tokens. Each token represents a meaningful unit of text, such as words, punctuation marks, or characters depending on the type of tokenizer used. Commonly used tokenizers include wordpiece and sentencepiece tokenizers, both of which are subword level tokenization techniques.
- Embedding: Embeddings are learned representations of input text that capture semantic meaning, and are typically produced by applying an embedding matrix to each tokenized sequence. Word embeddings are commonly used to represent words in text.
- Classifier: This is the core component of any text categorization system. They take in a set of features extracted from the text, including its embedding, and produce a probability distribution over all categories. Traditionally, feedforward classifiers like logistic regression and neural networks have been used in text categorization systems. However, more advanced methods like transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise due to their ability to handle long sequences and learn complex patterns in unstructured text.

The basic flowchart for a typical text categorization pipeline includes the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Collecting and cleaning the textual data is a critical step in text categorization. Various sources such as news articles, social media platforms, customer feedback, etc., should be considered while collecting the data. Labelling the collected data with relevant categories becomes important before proceeding with downstream analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing: Once the data has been collected, preprocessing involves several operations such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and normalization. The output of this stage would be the cleaned and tokenized text.

3. Feature Extraction: After obtaining the cleaned and tokenized text, feature extraction is performed. This step involves converting the clean text into numerical vectors representing its features. There are several ways to extract features such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings. Bag-of-Words model simply counts the frequency of individual words present in the text, and TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, which assigns higher weights to rare but frequently occurring words. Word embeddings are vector representation of words obtained after training a language model on large corpora of text.

4. Model Training: During model training, the extracted features are fed into a classifier to obtain a probability distribution over the target classes. Different types of classifiers are available such as logistic regression, SVM, and random forests.

5. Evaluation: Once the model is trained, evaluation phase takes place to measure its performance. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used. Additionally, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and per-class precision-recall curves are generated for visual inspection.

6. Deployment: Depending upon the requirements of the application, the text categorization model may be deployed either online or offline. If it needs to be quickly updated with new data, batch inference can be done instead of real-time deployment.

Benefits of Applying Pre-Trained Language Models to Perform Text Classification Tasks:
- Accuracy: Pre-trained language models have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE in natural language understanding tasks, even outperforming human performance on certain tasks. This suggests that they can significantly boost the accuracy of text categorization models in many cases.
- Efficiency: Since most pre-trained language models are already highly optimized for computational speed, they can easily be applied to scale up to larger datasets or multi-task learning scenarios. As a result, they can reduce the time taken to build and evaluate text categorization models.
- Scalability: Pre-trained language models can be fine-tuned to suit varying levels of complexity and specific domains. By adapting the language model to your own specific problem, you can often enhance its performance without the need to spend months annotating and labeling a new dataset.
- Transfer Learning: Pre-trained language models not only allow us to start off with high quality language models that have already learned a lot about language semantics, but they also enable transfer learning through fine-tuning. Instead of starting from scratch, we can leverage a pre-trained language model and fine-tune it on a small amount of additional data to create a specialized variant of the model tailored specifically to your domain.
- Personalization: With personalized models, we can tailor our models to the user's interests, preferences, and goals. For example, if users tend to write negative comments about certain topics, we can train a sentiment analysis model that identifies those comments and automatically tags them as spam. Similarly, if users often ask questions or post comments on topics unrelated to politics or science fiction, we could customize a FAQ answering bot to better serve those users' needs.
# 5.目前存在的问题
Challenges in Applying Pre-Trained Language Models to Perform Text Classification Tasks:
- Dataset Size: Many popular datasets for text categorization come with millions of examples, leading to challenges in scaling up traditional ML algorithms. To address this issue, several techniques have been proposed, such as distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller models, compressed language models, and dynamic data augmentation.
- Computational Resources: Some pre-trained language models require a large number of GPU hours or TPUs to train, especially when fine-tuned for specific tasks. Therefore, it is common practice to limit the use of these models to low-resource environments such as cloud servers or mobile devices.
- Limited Domain Coverage: While pre-trained language models have achieved impressive results on wide range of tasks, they do not always work well in everyday language use cases. This happens because the underlying language models have been trained on English-language data, and there exists no guarantee that they will perform well in other languages outside of English-speaking countries.
# 6.未来的研究方向
Future Research Directions for Applying Pre-Trained Language Models to Perform Text Classification Tasks:
- Multilinguality: Most pre-trained language models are trained solely on English-language text. Even though multilingual models exist, they require vast amounts of parallel and monolingual data that are difficult to acquire. Nevertheless, it seems likely that once sufficient amounts of multilingual data become available, multilingual language models will begin to dominate the market.
- Adversarial Attack: Adversarial attacks are one of the most effective defenses against natural language processing systems. Currently, there exist several methods to generate adversarial inputs that mislead classifiers, such as gradient descent attacks and backtranslation. Although they are computationally expensive, adversarial attack on language models remains an open research question.
- Uncertainty Estimation: Language models generate uncertainty estimates for their predictions, but these estimates are often treated as black boxes. Using simple proxy measures, such as entropy or variance, does not always reflect the true confidence in the model prediction. Hence, efforts need to be made to understand and quantify the uncertainty in language models better.
