Self-supervised learning is a recently proposed machine learning paradigm where a model learns to generate or classify data without being explicitly provided with labeled examples. In this article we will cover the latest advancement in self-supervised representation learning known as "Sampling". 

In self-supervised representation learning, we train models on unlabeled images and use these trained models to extract meaningful features from raw data that are useful for downstream tasks such as classification or segmentation. These extracted features can be further used for various applications like object detection, image retrieval, and semantic segmentation.

One of the most popular methods for training self-supervised models is using contrastive learning strategies, where two augmented versions of an image are fed into the model at once - one version randomly perturbed, and the other version transformed in some way, such as flipping it horizontally or applying noise. This results in two pairs of augmented versions, one generated using random transformations and another generated using the same random transformation but applied twice to create negative samples. These positive and negative pairs are used to update the model weights while making sure they do not interfere with each other.

However, there have been several challenges associated with this approach:

1. Perturbations introduced by the differentiable transforms could lead to blurry or distorted views of the objects in the images which might affect performance during inference time.

2. The large number of negative samples required would make the training process very expensive, leading to slow convergence times.

3. It was difficult to choose appropriate transformations for generating good representations, especially when dealing with highly complex datasets.

To overcome these challenges, recent advances in self-supervised learning have adopted techniques such as simCLR, BYOL, SwAV and MoCo. Each technique addresses one of the key challenges posed earlier and provides significant improvements in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization ability. However, none of them completely eliminate all the drawbacks associated with traditional approaches and require more than just simple augmentation techniques.

Sampling has been proposed as a powerful new technique for self-supervised representation learning that combines the benefits of both contrastive and denoising methods. The basic idea behind Sampling is to sample negative pairs within a limited set of augmentations rather than relying solely on negatives created through pairwise comparisons. Rather than feeding entire sets of augmented versions into the model, Sampling limits the choice of transformations and only uses a subset of them during training. This helps reduce the computational cost associated with training and also reduces the amount of information needed to learn effective representations. Additionally, sampling allows us to apply any desired augmentation strategy, including those not found in conventional self-supervised learning algorithms.

The core ideas behind Sampling include:

1. Choose a subsample of augmentations to consider instead of considering all possible augmentations.

2. Introduce stronger regularizers by penalizing model parameters that deviate from their prior distribution.

3. Use a form of pseudo-labeling to improve robustness to occlusions and viewpoint changes.

We will now go through the background related to Sampling and then dive deeper into its inner workings and maths involved. We will also explain how Sampling works under the hood and how it compares to other state-of-the-art self-supervised learning techniques like SimCLR, MoCo, and SwAV. Finally, we will implement a PyTorch code snippet showing how to perform self-supervised representation learning using Sampling.

## Contrastive Learning vs. Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs)
In contrast to the traditional supervised learning problem where we provide the algorithm with labeled examples and ask it to learn underlying patterns from them, in contrastive learning models learn to generate similar instances from scratch without any external guidance. One such method called "Contrastive Predictive Coding" or CPC is based on DAEs.

Traditional DAEs take input vectors and produce output vectors corresponding to their reconstructions. Given a target vector, the loss function between the reconstructed vector and the original target vector is minimized. During training, the network learns a mapping from inputs to outputs while preserving the structure of the input space.

CPCs extend DAEs to handle sequences of variables instead of single vectors. A sequence is composed of multiple frames sampled sequentially from the video sequence. CPCs attempt to capture temporal dependencies among sequential frames by predicting future frame states given past observations.

Given a video clip, CPCs first encode it into a fixed-size feature vector using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, it generates predictions for future frames given previous ones using another CNN and applies a softmax layer to estimate the probability of each class label. This enables CPCs to capture spatio-temporal relationships between consecutive frames.

In contrast to DAEs, CPCs aim to minimize a reconstruction error that accounts for both the content of individual frames and their relationship with respect to others in the sequence. To achieve this, the CPC architecture consists of three components: an encoder, a decoder, and a predictor network. The encoder takes a sequence of frames and encodes it into a high-dimensional latent space, which is shared across all frames. The decoder then maps back to the original resolution and forms a reconstruction of the original video. The predictor network computes a prediction of what the next frame should look like given the current state of the hidden units in the LSTM cell.

During training, the predictor network tries to maximize the log likelihood of the predicted frame alongside the reconstruction losses. Since the whole goal is to preserve the dynamics of the video sequence, the optimizer updates the parameters of the encoder, decoder, and predictor networks jointly.

Overall, contrastive learning models and CPCs are two separate paradigms that share many similarities, but differ in the type of objective function they optimize. While DAEs may seem simpler and easier to understand, they suffer from problems such as vanishing gradients and lack of long-term dependencies due to sparsity constraints imposed by dense connections between layers. On the other hand, CPCs offer better representational power due to explicit modeling of motion dependencies, but are harder to train since they rely on backpropagation through time. Nonetheless, it remains an open question whether deep neural networks can combine the strengths of both approaches to build effective self-supervised models for vision and language tasks.

## Unsupervised Video Representation Learning
Video is an important modality of data that contains rich visual information and makes up a significant portion of our daily lives. Recent years have seen a surge in research interest around understanding and modeling videos, and one area of active research is unsupervised learning of video representations.

Unsupervised video representation learning aims to learn continuous embeddings of videos, i.e., embedding functions that map input videos to a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. There are several factors that contribute towards this goal, including motion, appearance, audio, and text cues present in the video. Despite these diverse sources of information, existing literature mostly focuses on learning independent embeddings for each source separately, leading to fragmented video embeddings that cannot easily capture cross-modal interactions. Another challenge is handling sparse annotations, i.e., incomplete labels assigned to certain segments in the video. Lastly, incorporating domain knowledge about video semantics and properties leads to improved disentanglement of visual, acoustic, and linguistic signals embedded in the same video embedding space.

A major milestone in this direction has been achieved by creating a collaborative effort between Nvidia and Facebook AI Research (FAIR), resulting in the MoCo framework for unsupervised video representation learning [2]. MoCo leverages mutual reinforcement between modalities to align embeddings learned from different views of the same video. As a result, MoCo captures multimodal correlations that were previously obscured because of the independence assumption. Furthermore, MoCo offers theoretical guarantees regarding the alignment quality and encourages consistency between views via intra-modality regularization. Overall, MoCo has become a popular benchmark for evaluating unsupervised video representation learning systems.

Another prominent approach is the family of BYOL methods [3], which leverage the ability of transformers to perform multi-modal self-supervision by jointly optimizing a common transformer for encoding and decoding the inputs and the projection head for projecting the encoded representations onto a shared space. By introducing an auxiliary task that forces the network to reconstruct its own inputs from their projected representations, BYOL achieves comparable performance to MoCo despite having fewer parameters and requiring less memory compared to standard linear evaluation protocols.

Recently, Facebook AI Research has released a new paper titled "SwAV: Scaling Up Visual Representation Learning Without Negative Examples" [4] that introduces a new perspective on self-supervised learning that takes advantage of weakly labeled data. Instead of treating every example independently, SwAV selects a small number of informative anchors and projects them to a shared low-dimensional space using a convolutional neural network (CNN). They show that swapping out the anchor points for different mini-batches improves performance significantly, leading to the creation of much larger batches without having to resort to additional data augmentation schemes. Similar to MoCo, SwAV provides stability and robustness through intrinsic mutual coherence built into the optimization process. Moreover, SwAV does not need any paired examples or negative pairs to train, hence eliminating the necessity for expensive negative mining procedures. Overall, SwAV demonstrates great promise for efficiently scaling up visual representation learning on large-scale datasets and achieving competitive performance in many challenging benchmarks.

It remains an open question if the strengths and limitations of these different unsupervised learning approaches can be combined to produce more comprehensive and efficient self-supervised video representations for downstream tasks. In this article, we focus on exploring the unique insights and theory behind Sampling as a novel technique for self-supervised representation learning.
