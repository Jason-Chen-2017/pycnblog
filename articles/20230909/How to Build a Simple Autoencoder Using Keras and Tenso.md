自编码器（AutoEncoder）是一种无监督学习的机器学习模型，它可以对输入数据进行高效的降维或特征提取，并且可以在无需标注数据的情况下生成合理的输出，相当于一个特征检测器或者特征提取器。它由两部分组成，编码器（Encoder）和解码器（Decoder）。编码器将输入数据转换为隐含特征，并通过一定规则去除冗余信息；而解码器则通过这个隐含特征恢复出原始输入。一般来说，自编码器的目的是希望能够从输入数据中提取一些有用的特征，并在此基础上重建出更加逼真的输出。因此，自编码器可以看做是一种自我复制的过程，它的输出是原始输入经过解码器重新生成的。

本文主要介绍如何使用Keras和TensorFlow实现一个简单的自编码器。具体地，我们将利用MNIST手写数字数据集训练一个非常简单的自编码器——一个全连接层的编码器和解码器。

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Introduction 

In this article, we will build a simple autoencoder using Keras library in Python with the MNIST dataset as an example. We assume that readers are familiar with basic deep learning concepts like neural networks, activation functions, loss function optimization etc., but not necessarily expert-level knowledge of Keras or TensorFlow libraries. It is also assumed that they have already installed Keras and TensorFlow on their system before following along with the tutorial. If you need any help installing these libraries, please refer to the official documentation provided by Keras and TensorFlow.


Firstly, let's start by importing necessary modules and loading the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9, where each image is of size 28 x 28 pixels:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.datasets import mnist

(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.
```
Here `_` denotes the labels associated with each digit, which are not needed for our purpose here. Note that we normalize the pixel values to be between 0 and 1 before feeding them into the network.

Next, we reshape the input data so that it has shape `(num_samples, height*width)`:

```python
num_samples = len(x_train)
height = width = x_train[0].shape[0]
input_size = height * width

x_train = x_train.reshape((num_samples, input_size))
x_test = x_test.reshape((len(x_test), input_size))
```

This means that each sample now has a single feature vector of length `input_size`, i.e., there are no longer multiple color channels or other additional features. Finally, we split the training set into a validation set:

```python
val_size = int(0.1 * num_samples) # use 10% of the training set for validation
x_val = x_train[:val_size]
x_train = x_train[val_size:]
```

Now we can define our autoencoder model using Keras layers. An encoder layer takes in the input image and outputs a latent representation, while a decoder layer reconstructs the original input from the latent representation. We'll use fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, and introduce some compression techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the latent space later on. For more advanced models, we could use convolutional or recurrent neural networks instead of dense layers. Here's what the code looks like:<|im_sep|>
