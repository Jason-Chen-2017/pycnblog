# 1.简介
  

Deep learning (DL), particularly in the context of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), has revolutionized many fields. It is an emerging technology that is quickly replacing some traditional machine learning methods such as decision trees and support vector machines (SVMs). DL is capable of extracting meaningful features from raw data automatically by deep neural networks. However, its performance can be heavily influenced by hyper-parameters like regularization, initialization, architecture selection and optimization strategy. To improve the generalization ability of DL models, we need to understand how different types of layers affect their output and how they are trained in a proper way. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) have been widely used for unsupervised feature learning in DL. In this article, we will explain RBM from scratch along with its pros and cons compared to other popular models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We will also demonstrate how to train RBM using common optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and momentum method. Finally, we will provide tips on choosing appropriate hyper-parameters based on your dataset and model complexity. This article is suitable for anybody who wants to understand more about how RBM works, why it performs well and how to use it effectively for DL tasks. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 深度学习
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning algorithms that are designed to learn complex patterns in large datasets through multiple non-linear transformations. The key idea behind deep learning is that complex high-level abstractions in the input data can be learned automatically from examples rather than being explicitly programmed. Deep learning algorithms work by stacking layers of neurons connected together using artificial neural network (ANN)-like connections. Each layer learns a set of features or representations from the previous ones, which are then fed into the next one until the final output is produced. These representations capture important aspects of the input data that are useful for classification, regression, etc., depending on the task at hand. The degree of abstraction in the learned features typically depends on the number of hidden layers and the size of each layer.

## 2.2 模型结构及其层次
In this section, we briefly discuss the main components of deep neural networks (DNNs) and some commonly used activation functions. DNNs consist of several fully connected layers interconnected by non-linear activations function. The choice of activation function is critical for ensuring that the gradients flow correctly and allow the weights to adjust efficiently during training. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, softmax, and maxout.



In addition to these standard layers, there are specialized layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and recurrent layers that are often found in image recognition tasks and NLP tasks respectively. There are also specialized variants of these layers such as depthwise separable convolution, self attention, and transformer.

## 2.3 概率分布模型——隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）
An HMM represents a sequence of observations generated by a dynamic process. Each observation depends on the current state but not on the past states. An HMM consists of two parts: an initial probability distribution $pi$ over the possible initial states and transition probabilities between adjacent states. Given an observed sequence, the probability of generating that sequence under the given model can be computed by following the chain of transitions from start to end.

## 2.4 深度置信网络（DCNNs）
A DCNN combines CNN and RNN architectures in order to extract hierarchical representations from images. It uses multiple parallel stacks of CNN layers followed by dense RNN layers. Different CNN layers may encode different levels of information while RNN layers help to exploit temporal dependencies across frames. The output from both CNN and RNN layers are combined to produce a global representation of the image that captures multiple spatial and temporal aspects of the visual scene.

## 2.5 对比学习
Contrastive learning is a type of unsupervised learning where pairs of similar inputs are identified and separated from pairs of dissimilar inputs. One approach to contrastive learning is Siamese networks, which contain two identical subnetworks whose outputs are concatenated before going to a shared linear projection layer for similarity computation. Another approach is triplet loss, which involves taking three copies of the same input sample, encoding them separately, and comparing their encodings against the ground truth label to identify the positive pair and negative pair. Contrastive learning is especially effective when dealing with large, unlabeled datasets because it requires no manual annotations and only needs a small amount of labeled data per class to achieve good performance. Other popular approaches include SimCLR, MoCo, SwAV, Barlow Twins, PIRL, BYOL, and BYOC.

## 2.6 生成对抗网络（GANs）
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of generative models that are used to generate new samples that appear realistic and authentic. GANs rely on adversarial training, which consists of two competing networks: a generator and discriminator. The generator takes random noise as input and transforms it into fake images that look realistic. The discriminator, also called the critic, takes real or fake images as input and tries to distinguish between them. During training, the generator learns to fool the discriminator and get better at creating realistic images. The discriminator learns to separate the true images from the fake ones, so it can evaluate the quality of the generator's output. By alternating between optimizing the generator and discriminator, GANs can learn complex distributions of data in an unsupervised manner. Popular applications of GANs include image synthesis, text-to-image conversion, style transfer, and anomaly detection.

## 2.7 循环神经网路（RNNs）
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks that deal with sequential data. They operate on sequences of vectors, where each element in the sequence depends on the preceding elements. Several versions of RNNs exist including vanilla RNNs, LSTM cells, GRU cells, and bidirectional RNNs. The most popular version of RNNs nowadays is the LSTM cell, which is specifically designed to handle long term dependencies in the input sequence.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
This part of the article will focus on explaining the core algorithm behind the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We begin by defining what an RBM is and why it exists. Then, we present the basic mathematical concepts underlying an RBM - visible units, hidden units, conditional probabilities, and free energy. Next, we go deeper into the theory of the RBM - how it learns and reconstructs data, how it avoids vanishing gradients, and how it can be trained using backpropagation. We also showcase various applications of RBM in various domains such as collaborative filtering, topic modeling, and music generation.

## 3.1 Restricted Boltzmann Machine(RBM) 是什么？
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a probabilistic model that aims to model the joint probability distribution of a set of binary variables. The model consists of a set of visible units (inputs) and a set of hidden units (outputs). Each visible unit receives input from either the data or the top hidden unit. The activation pattern of the visible units determines the state of the system. The activity of the hidden units determines the features that are passed down to the lower level. At any time step, the activities of all the hidden units form a probability distribution which is defined by a weight matrix connecting the hidden units to the visible units.

## 3.2 可见单元、隐藏单元及条件概率
The RBM is a binary classifier that maps the inputs onto a latent space. The visible units receive input from the dataset or the top hidden unit. The hidden units represent the features that are inferred from the visible units. If the i-th visible unit has value v_i, then its corresponding hidden unit j fires with a probability p_ij. We can write the conditional probability of observing the value vi given that the hidden unit is active j as follows:

$$p_{vi} = \frac{e^{W_{ij}v_i + b_j}}{\sum_{l=1}^{M'} e^{W_{il}v_i+b_l}}$$

Here, W is the weight matrix that connects the hidden and visible units, bi is the bias term, and M' is the number of hidden units. Note that the denominator adds up to 1 since the summation goes over all possible values of the hidden units. Thus, the likelihood of the observed data is calculated as the product of the conditional probabilities.

## 3.3 自由能、权重、偏置
We define the free energy of the configuration σ as follows:

$$F=-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T E_\sigma[h^{(t)}] + \log \left(\sum_{\sigma'\in \mathcal{P}(V)}\exp[-E_{\sigma'}]\right)\tag{1}$$

where T is the total number of steps, V is the set of possible configurations, h^(t) is the activity of the hidden units at step t, and P(V) is the set of all possible configurations. We denote the set of all possible configurations as Σ. Since the RBM is a binary classifier, the free energy is computed as the negation of the logarithm of the partition function Z. Therefore, the aim of the RBM is to minimize the free energy by finding the optimal configuration sigma.

To find the optimal configuration σ*, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of the model iteratively. The updates can be expressed as follows:

$$\Delta W_ij^t = \alpha(v_i^t\odot h_j^t - W_ij^t)$$

$$\Delta b_j^t=\alpha(1\odot h_j^t-b_j^t)\tag{2}$$

where α is the learning rate, odot is the element-wise multiplication operator, and the dots represent mini-batches. Similarly, we update the parameters of the visible units using the conditional probabilities.

Finally, we introduce a stochastic approximation trick to reduce computational cost. Instead of updating the parameters for every single batch, we randomly select a fraction of the mini-batch to update. The updated parameters are stored and used later to compute the gradients for the remaining mini-batch.

## 3.4 数据学习及重构过程
Once the RBM is trained, it can perform inference on new instances. First, we initialize the visible units with the input data and pass it forward through the network to obtain the hidden units. Next, we randomly activate the hidden units and send the resulting visible units back to the top hidden unit to obtain predictions. We repeat this process to obtain multiple predictions, which can be combined to estimate the average target variable. Alternatively, we can decode the hidden units into a continuous representation using a generative model such as a variational autoencoder (VAE) and then map them back to the original domain. 

During training, the goal is to make the network able to reconstruct the input data without losing too much information in the process. To do this, we first measure the difference between the input data and the predicted output using the error function. We then backpropagate this error through the network to update the weights and biases to minimize the error.

For a better understanding of how the RBM can learn and reconstruct data, let us consider an example. Consider the following scenario: Suppose we want to build an RBM that can classify whether an image contains a cat or dog. We assume that the input data consists of pixels representing the grayscale values of the image. We create a grid of visible units where each pixel corresponds to a visible unit. We fix the number of hidden units to 2, which means that the model has to divide the data into two groups. For example, if the pixel intensity of the center pixel is greater than the surrounding pixels, the second group should be activated more strongly than the first group. We call the first group "cat" and the second group "dog". Now, we connect the visible units to the hidden units using a weight matrix W and add a bias vector b to each unit. The probability of observing the visible units conditioned on the hidden units is given by Eqn.(3). We optimize the free energy F using gradient descent to find the configuration σ*. After training, the network can predict the labels for new instances based on the hidden units. When decoding the hidden units, we use a generative model such as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to obtain a continuous representation of the data and then project it back to the original domain.

One problem with the above procedure is that the model might become very confident even though the input may actually be ambiguous. This happens because the categorical nature of the classes makes it difficult for the model to decide between multiple equally likely configurations. To solve this problem, we modify the objective function to maximize the margin between the distributions of the two groups instead of simply minimizing the distance between them. Specifically, we change the sign of the free energy function in equation (1) as follows:

$$F=-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T E_\sigma[h^{(t)}]+c||\mu^a_1-\mu^a_2||^2+\log (\sum_{\sigma'\in \mathcal{P}(V)}\exp[-E_{\sigma'}])\tag{3}$$

Here, c is a constant that controls the tradeoff between maximizing the expected reward and encouraging the margin between the two distributions. If the two distributions are very far apart, the model will still try to maximize the reward by making sure that the two sets of hidden units fire approximately equally frequently. On the other hand, if the two distributions are close, the model will increase the strength of the activation of one set and decrease the strength of the activation of the other set to increase the separation between them.
