Blockchain technology has been gaining immense popularity over the past few years because of its ability to solve some critical problems facing traditional financial systems such as security, immutability, transparency, and scalability. It offers many benefits beyond its obvious use case for digital money, including:

1. Transparency - Blockchain transactions are permanent records that can be verified by any interested party, making it a transparent system. Anyone can see exactly what has happened with their account balance at any given time.

2. Security - Because all transaction data is public, there is no need for third parties to verify identity or validity. This makes the system more secure than traditional payment processing networks.

3. Immutability - Once a transaction has taken place on the network, it cannot be reversed or altered without changing the entire chain of blocks. This ensures the integrity of funds transferred across different entities.

4. Scalability - The blockchain technology allows applications to scale quickly and easily, enabling businesses to process millions of transactions per second while maintaining low latency times.

Moreover, blockchain technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have revolutionized finance and other sectors through their unique features and capabilities. However, while these platforms offer significant advantages, they also pose several risks alongside increased costs and complexities associated with implementation. In this article, we will discuss why blockchain and cryptocurrency investment is essential, how it works, and potential pitfalls to consider before deciding whether to invest in them.

# 2.概念术语说明

## 2.1 Blockchain
A blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that maintains a chronological record of every transaction made within it. Each block contains a set of encrypted records called "transactions", which contain information about the sender, recipient, and amount of each payment. All participants to the network have a copy of the complete transaction history, allowing anyone to validate and trust the data. Additionally, the concept of a decentralized network allows for new nodes to join or leave the network dynamically, ensuring high availability and resilience against attacks.

## 2.2 Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency refers to digital assets whose value is backed by mathematics rather than fiat currency (e.g., dollars, euros). These currencies are based on cryptography algorithms that help maintain a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger. They typically have blockchain-based ledgers where users exchange coins for goods and services and store their tokens in wallets. Some popular examples include Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple.

## 2.3 Peer-to-peer Network
A peer-to-peer network refers to a type of computer network where individual machines connect directly together without a central authority. P2P networks allow people to access valuable resources from anywhere around the world without the need for a trusted intermediary. Decentralized networks like BitTorrent, Freenet, and Tor enable users to share files anonymously and bypass geographical restrictions.

## 2.4 Consensus Mechanism
The consensus mechanism determines the order in which transactions take place and become finalized on the blockchain. There are two main types of consensus mechanisms: proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. Both approaches rely on computational power to determine the correct ordering of transactions.

Proof-of-work involves mining hardware devices, known as miners, who compete to find solutions that combine previously agreed upon values to create a hash code that satisfies certain criteria. Miners add blocks to the blockchain one at a time, adding them to the end of the chain. When a miner wins a block competition, they receive a reward in the form of newly minted bitcoins. The problem with proof-of-work is that it requires significant capital expenditure to build up enough hashing power to keep the network running effectively.

Proof-of-stake uses special voting principles instead of proof-of-work to arrive at the same result. Users stake their bitcoins in support of validators, who monitor the network and vote on valid transactions. Validators earn rewards for their work, but must pay a fee to participate in the protocol. Unlike proof-of-work, proof-of-stake does not require constant mining power, reducing capital requirements and increasing accessibility.

## 2.5 Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are self-executing programs embedded into the blockchain platform that execute when specific conditions are met. They act as automated transactions between multiple parties involved in a particular business activity. Smart contract technology enables real-world interactions to be digitally recorded and executed, streamlining processes and workflows. Examples of smart contract platforms include Ethereum, Quorum, and Hyperledger Fabric.

## 2.6 Distributed Ledger Technology
Distributed ledger technology (DLT) refers to a collection of protocols, tools, and techniques used to manage a shared digital infrastructure consisting of computers connected via a peer-to-peer network. DLT creates a single source of truth for managing financial transactions and enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and security of operations across various institutional boundaries. Blockchains and related technologies provide a means to leverage DLT for use cases ranging from banking, supply chains, and insurance.

## 2.7 Tokenization
Tokenization refers to the process of converting physical assets into digitally representable units, similar to the way companies convert shares into stock. Tokens can serve as mediums of exchange, payment channels, or security for products and services on the blockchain. Popular token standards include ERC-20 for fungible tokens and ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens.

## 3.1 Cryptographic Hash Functions
Hash functions take arbitrary input data and generate fixed-size output data that is usually cryptographically difficult to reverse engineer. One common example of a hash function is SHA-256, which takes a message and produces a fixed-length output of 256 bits. While SHA-256 provides strong protection against collisions and preimage attacks, it is still vulnerable to length extension attacks, where an attacker modifies existing hashed data to produce a longer fake hash.

To address this weakness, newer hash functions, such as BLAKE2, Skein, and KangarooTwelve, incorporate salts and personalization into their computation to make them more robust against these attack vectors. As long as the salt and personalization remain secret, even an attacker with malicious intent cannot mount length extension attacks.

In addition to producing a fixed-sized output, hash functions may also perform additional transformations on the input data, such as padding the input with zeros or XORing with a key. These enhancements do not significantly affect the strength of the hash function itself, but they ensure that differential characteristics between inputs are visible in the resulting hashes. For instance, if two identical messages are padded differently, their hashes will differ, indicating that they were processed differently. Similarly, if two identical messages are XORed with the same key, their hashes will match, indicating that the encryption was done using the same key. Together, these properties contribute to the flexibility and adaptability of blockchain technology.

## 3.2 Proof-of-Work Algorithm
The proof-of-work algorithm relies on miners solving a cryptographic puzzle involving random numbers, computations, and synchronization. Miners compete to solve the puzzle until they win the right combination of random numbers and computations to create a specific hash pattern. The winner receives the block reward and gets permission to add their block to the blockchain.

The basic idea behind the proof-of-work algorithm is that it is costly and resource-intensive to obtain large amounts of computing power. Accordingly, only those with substantial computational abilities and dedication to mining are able to successfully mine new blocks. Moreover, since miners must synchronize their computations to reach the same point in the sequence of random numbers, the overall speed of the network suffers due to congestion.

However, the fundamental innovation introduced by bitcoin is that mining power is distributed amongst a group of miners who voluntarily agree to compute the next block in the chain. By leveraging economies of scale and using a probabilistic approach, the bitcoin protocol eliminates the need for specialized mining equipment and vastly reduces the energy consumption required to run the network.

## 3.3 Merkle Trees
Merkle trees are binary trees containing hashed data stored sequentially. The root node represents the overall hash of all the leaf nodes below it, and each internal node represents the hash of its children. By comparing the roots of two subtrees, it is possible to confirm whether any changes occurred between the original data and its current version. This technique is commonly used in software distributions, file verification, and content delivery networks.

## 3.4 Proof-of-Stake Algorithm
Proof-of-stake is a variant of the proof-of-work algorithm that utilizes virtual voting power instead of requiring dedicated mining hardware. Instead of competing to guess randomly generated sequences, stake holders stake their tokens, and the network selects the best stakers to participate in the consensus process. Stakeholders receive periodic rewards for their contribution, but they must pay a small transaction fee to participate in the protocol. Since stake holders prove ownership of their tokens and vote based on the highest performing candidates, the system avoids concentrating power in few hands and improves both security and decentralization compared to proof-of-work.

## 3.5 Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are programs designed to automate the execution of transactions on the blockchain. They consist of structured sets of instructions that define the actions to be performed and the conditions under which they occur. A wide range of use cases for smart contracts exist, including asset management, lending/borrowing, identity authentication, and payment systems.

One advantage of smart contracts over traditional financial systems is that they remove the need for manual intervention and reduce errors caused by human error. Transactions are automatically triggered according to predefined rules and trigger events that update the state of the system. Furthermore, smart contracts can handle complex logic and transfer larger volumes of data with ease.

On the down side, however, smart contracts introduce an extra layer of complexity and risk that needs to be managed carefully, especially when dealing with sensitive information or highly regulated industries. Therefore, organizations looking to deploy smart contracts should closely evaluate their risks and benefits before committing to their deployment.

## 3.6 Distributed Ledger Technology
Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a collection of protocols, tools, and techniques used to manage a shared digital infrastructure consisting of computers connected via a peer-to-peer network. DLT creates a single source of truth for managing financial transactions and enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and security of operations across various institutional boundaries. 

By separating the storage and validation of data, DLT enables fast, efficient updates to global databases while protecting user privacy and preventing hacker attacks. Its distributed architecture, immutable records, and provable auditability enable DLT to transform the finance industry and reshape the global economy. 

Blockchains and related technologies are particularly useful for implementing DLT in financial systems because they offer several advantages:

1. Tamper-proof - Since all transactions are added to a public ledger, unauthorized actors cannot alter them once committed. 

2. High throughput - Large volumes of transactions can be processed in real-time, minimizing lag and improving customer experience.

3. Immutable records - Recording all transactions publicly on a distributed ledger ensures authenticity, accountability, and reliability.

4. Low fees - Payments made on a blockchain often do not incur significant transaction fees, reducing transaction costs and driving usage levels higher.

5. Scalability - Blockchains can accommodate ever-growing demand by expanding the network size and bandwidth.

However, DLT introduces several challenges that blockchain developers must overcome:

1. Complexity - Implementing a reliable and fault-tolerant distributed ledger requires advanced engineering skills and expertise.

2. Privacy - The introduction of private blockchains poses a challenge because it can jeopardize user privacy and reveal sensitive information.

3. Compliance - DLT brings significant new legal concerns and compliance burdens that need to be addressed.
