Technical analysis is one of the most important tools in investors' toolbox for analyzing financial markets. Technical analysis provides a deeper understanding of market trends and behavior than fundamental analysis alone can provide. It allows traders to identify hidden patterns that are difficult to detect with traditional methods like price charts or moving averages.

In this article, we will introduce several commonly used technical indicators and how they work. We will also explain some common trading strategies based on these indicators, including ranging from simple ones like buying low, selling high, and technical stop-loss signals to more sophisticated ones such as MACD crossovers and Bollinger bands. The article ends with a discussion on future developments and challenges related to technical analysis in investment management. 

This article assumes a basic knowledge of finance and technical analysis concepts. However, it should be accessible to anyone who wants to learn about technical analysis.

# 2. Background Introduction
## 2.1 Types of Technical Analysis Tools 
Technical analysis involves using mathematical models to analyze data, which gives insights into stock prices over time. There are two main types of technical analysis: systematic and quasi-systematic. Systematic analysis uses predetermined rules and procedures to determine trends and trade opportunities, while quasi-systematic analysis relies upon human intuition and subjective experience. 

The following chart shows the differences between systematic and quasi-systematic technical analysis:


Systematic technical analysis typically focuses on long-term trends within a consistent industry or sector. In contrast, quasi-systematic analysis looks at short-term trends within a given market without any specific target industry or sector. Quasi-systematic approaches have been applied successfully in commodities markets, equity indices, and currencies.  

Quasi-systematic technical analysis may seem less effective compared to systematic analysis but its use has increased due to the need for more subtle signals. For instance, when an individual seeks to trade volatility swings outside of established trends, quasi-systematic analysis offers a unique viewpoint by providing insight into small variations that might not otherwise surface in other forms of analysis.

## 2.2 How Do Technical Indicators Work?

Technical indicators measure various aspects of the economy, market conditions, or business cycles and help traders make strategic decisions on whether to buy, hold, or sell assets. They include oscillating lines, shadows, and bars that move across different time periods to show changes in prices, volume, momentum, reversals, and supports.

Most technical indicators use open, close, high, and low prices, as well as other information like volume, etc., to generate their calculations. Some technical indicators take historical data as input, while others gather real-time data feeds from exchanges or APIs. 

### Moving Averages (MA)

One of the most popular technical indicators is the Simple Moving Average (SMA). An SMA is simply the arithmetic mean of a selected range of closing prices over a specified number of days. SMAs allow traders to quickly spot uptrends or downtrends even before the start of a trend. 

For example, let's say you want to track a company's stock price and notice a sudden jump up after several months of stable performance. Using an SMA indicator, you could set your time period to 90 days and compare the current price against the 90-day SMA. If the difference between the current price and the SMA is greater than a certain threshold value, then you know there has been an impending trend change.

Another advantage of SMAs is that they can catch rapid changes in direction without making too many false alarms. This is because an SMA takes into account all previous data points in order to smooth out any noise or irregularities in the asset’s price movement. Additionally, SMAs are widely used in technical analysis tools like TradingView and MetaTrader 4.

### Bollinger Bands (BB)

Bollinger Bands are another type of technical indicator that measures the standard deviation of the daily closing prices and generates upper and lower bands. These bands indicate where the price is likely to be above or below its normal range. When the price moves beyond the upper band, traders may decide to sell, while if it moves below the lower band, traders may decide to buy. 

In addition to showing if prices are likely to increase or decrease, BB indicators help traders monitor for divergences from the typical trading range. Divergences occur when prices deviate significantly from the expected pattern, which can signal potential new trends or issues. Unusual price movements can reveal significant risks or opportunity areas that were previously unexplored.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Relative Strength Index (RSI), also known as just RS, is often used as a momentum indicator in technical analysis. RSI compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses relative to the magnitude of recent losses over a specified time frame to gauge overall market health.

An RSI reading of around 70 indicates that the stock is highly volatile; a reading of 30 indicates that the stock is relatively flat; and a reading under 30 indicates that the stock is becoming more bearish. The longer the time frame, the smoother the RSI curve becomes, giving traders a better idea of the stock's recent trend.

To implement RSI, you would need to select a time interval (typically one month or three months), calculate the average gain and loss per day during that time interval, and divide them by the average gain and loss per day over n intervals ago (usually ten). You would repeat this process for each day in the time interval. Finally, you would subtract the previous values from the latest value to get the daily change in strength.

You can combine RSI with other indicators, such as SMAs or Bollinger Bands, to create powerful trading signals. For example, you could use an RSI oscillator (which plots both RSI readings and the corresponding price) combined with an SMA to catch extreme momentum spikes or dips that suggest stronger buying or selling pressure. Similarly, you could use an RSI indicator and a Bollinger Band to trade when the stock price crosses above or below the lower or upper band, respectively. Overall, technical analysis offers a powerful way to stay ahead of the market and make smart investing decisions.
