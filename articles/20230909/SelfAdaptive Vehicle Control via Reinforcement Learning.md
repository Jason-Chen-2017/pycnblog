Self-adaptive vehicle control (SAVCON) is an emerging field that seeks to provide a safe and efficient vehicle control system by using reinforcement learning algorithms for adaptive vehicle behavior management. The central aim of SAVCON is to develop intelligent controllers that can adapt to the changing environmental conditions and user preferences with minimal intervention from users or operators. In this paper, we review various self-adaptive vehicle control approaches based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), including Q-learning, actor-critic method, hybrid algorithmic framework, and multiple differentiable model approach. We also discuss their pros and cons, advantages and limitations in terms of safety, performance, complexity, robustness, and generalizability. Finally, we present recent applications of these methods in autonomous vehicles and smart factories as well as future directions and research challenges. This survey provides an overview of state-of-the-art DRL-based SAVCON techniques, allowing researchers and developers to select suitable ones for specific application scenarios.

Recently, there has been significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI) through advancements in deep learning techniques such as deep neural networks, which have revolutionized many fields such as image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding. However, current AI models often rely heavily on labeled data and require manual fine-tuning to be effective in new domains and environments. To address this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained popularity, where unlabeled data is used to learn features automatically without any human labeling effort. SSL methods include contrastive predictive coding (CPC), autoencoder pretraining, and virtual adversarial training. Despite its effectiveness, however, these methods are limited in the ability to generate policies directly optimized for task completion while still requiring a small amount of supervision during training. Furthermore, SSL-based methods may not work efficiently under noisy or uncertain environments, leading to suboptimal performance and potential risks. 

To overcome these limitations, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in a wide range of tasks such as game playing, robotics, and control systems. RL is particularly useful when we need to learn optimal decision making strategies through trial-and-error process, enabling us to act optimally in complex situations with unknown feedback loops. There exist several works focusing on developing DRL algorithms for automatic vehicle control, ranging from simple Q-learning based approaches to more sophisticated hierarchical actor-critic methods. These methods have made great progress in achieving good results in simulated environments, but they do not yet offer practical solutions for real-world problems due to the difficulty of modeling physical dynamics and interactions between components.

Based on the above background, we summarize the key characteristics of self-adaptive vehicle control approaches based on DRL, including:

1. Generalization and Robustness: Although DRL offers high sample efficiency compared to other machine learning techniques, it cannot guarantee perfect generalization to new environments with different dynamics and observation spaces. Therefore, it requires careful regularization and exploration strategy to ensure stability and safety during deployment. Moreover, even though DRL algorithms can handle uncertainties and noise in sensor inputs, they still suffer from variance issues that limit their applicability in practice. 

2. Complexity and Efficiency: While most DRL-based SAVCON approaches use deep neural networks, they usually require advanced knowledge and expertise in designing and tuning them. Also, they require long training time and extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve competitive performance. Therefore, reducing computational cost and improving optimization speed are essential for practical implementation. 

3. Adaptivity and Flexibility: Even though DRL has achieved tremendous success in a wide range of tasks, it still remains challenging to train a controller that can quickly adapt to dynamic changes in the surrounding environment and change user preferences without sudden movements or failures. To enable adaptive behaviors, we need to explore diverse strategies and opportunities provided by DRL algorithms. For example, in a collision avoidance scenario, we may need to balance our speed, steering angle, braking force, and throttle level according to the severity and impact of obstacles detected ahead. Similarly, if we want to optimize fuel consumption in autonomous driving applications, we may need to adjust our driving strategy dynamically based on the occupancy status, traffic density, and weather forecast. 

4. Privacy and Security Considerations: As self-driving cars become increasingly integrated into daily life, security and privacy concerns are becoming critical. It is important to consider how personal information collected by SAVCON could potentially be used maliciously to make dangerous decisions or even cause harm to others. Hence, technological advancements such as encrypted communication protocols and secure computing platforms must be adopted to protect sensitive information and mitigate threats from hackers.
