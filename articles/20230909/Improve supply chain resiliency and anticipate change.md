Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) is a critical concern for organizations facing increasing uncertainty in their supply chains. SCR refers to the ability of an organization to maintain its supply chain operations despite potential adverse impacts from disruptions or failures that can affect key components such as raw materials, transportation vehicles, manufacturing equipment, suppliers, and customers. Improving supply chain resiliency requires evaluating multiple factors including design changes, business processes, risk management measures, technology upgrades, regulatory compliance, human resources training, vendor relationships, etc., to ensure that supply chains remain robust over time through preventative measures that enable them to adapt quickly to new situations and be flexible enough to cope with emerging challenges. The successful implementation of SCR strategies will significantly improve customer experience, satisfaction levels, productivity gains, and profitability while ensuring continuous business continuity. In this article we will explore how improved supply chain resilience plays a role in anticipating and managing change effectively using predictive analytics approaches. 

Predictive Analytics (PA) is becoming increasingly important in industry as it offers a promising way to identify patterns in data to support decision-making and optimize performance. Specifically, Predictive Maintenance (PM), also known as preventative maintenance, is one example where PA can play a significant role in improving resiliency by identifying root causes of failure early on before they become severe. However, current PM methods are limited to monitoring simple metrics such as sensor readings and may not provide complete insight into complex issues that require a thorough understanding of system dynamics. Therefore, advanced analytics techniques need to be employed to integrate several sources of information, including historical data, real-time telemetry, model predictions, and market trends, to produce more comprehensive insights about the health status of a component. This will help organizations to make better informed decisions about when and how to intervene in order to recover from failures and maintain supply chains reliably over time. To achieve effective results, IT departments should strive to harness the power of big data technologies to store, analyze, and mine valuable knowledge from diverse data sets across different domains such as logistics, finance, manufacturing, and marketing. These techniques will lead to improved decision making and operational efficiencies, ultimately leading to enhanced revenue generation, profitability, customer satisfaction, and productivity. 

In summary, increased visibility and control over supply chain processes and assets combined with predictive analytics techniques could provide powerful insights into both the state of the supply chain and future demand trends. By integrating various sources of data, the goal would be to create a reliable and efficient supply chain that is capable of handling adverse events and changing demands seamlessly without compromising quality, consistency, and service level agreements. With proper planning, execution, and communication, these strategies can have a significant impact on overall supply chain performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. We believe that implementing SCR strategies that involve deep integration of AI/ML capabilities, large scale data analysis, and proactive monitoring can help organizations enhance their ability to manage the rapid pace of change and effectively anticipate risks and opportunities that arise within their supply chains.

Let’s dive deeper into the specific concepts and techniques used in SCR management, and focus on how predictive analytics can be leveraged to improve supply chain resilience and anticipate change. 


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms 
## Types of Supply Chains 
A supply chain is defined as "a process that connects individual entities involved in the production, delivery, storage, distribution, and consumption of goods or services". There are three main types of supply chains: 

1. Product supply chain: A product supply chain involves the movement of products from supplier to manufacturer to end consumer, typically consisting of retailers, distributors, wholesalers, stores, and other intermediate parties involved in the transaction process.

2. Service supply chain: A service supply chain consists of businesses whose primary activity is providing some type of service, which often entails the flow of goods or services between providers and consumers. Examples include hospitality, consulting, accounting, insurance, and healthcare services.

3. Logistics supply chain: A logistics supply chain involves all elements of a company's operations related to moving goods or services around the world. It includes raw material supplies, intermediate processing facilities, packaging and shipping centers, and final destinations. 

All these supply chains have varying characteristics like complexity, speed, volume, latency, frequency of deliveries, and location. Some of the common problems faced by companies in each category are safety, quality, delays, costs, and regulation violations. Managing these chains efficiently becomes a challenging task as there are many variables at stake, ranging from weather conditions to human error, and constant change in customer preferences and expectations. Hence, Improved supply chain resiliency and anticipating change rely heavily on insights gained from analyzing the supply chain interactions across various industries, geographies, and cultures. 

## Supply Chain Management Systems (SCMS) 

SCMS is a suite of tools designed to coordinate the activities of multiple actors involved in the supply chain. SCMS provides a centralized view of the entire supply chain, enabling it to interact with different systems, such as procurement, warehouse management, production planning, financial tracking, and customer service. The purpose of SCMS is to streamline processes, automate workflows, increase transparency, minimize errors, and reduce costs. One such tool is IBM Strategic SCM Suite, which has been adopted by many companies globally. Its core modules are Procurement, Inventory Management, Order Management, Quality Management, Warehouse Management, Financial Management, Human Resources Management, and Project Management. 

The use of SCMS allows for faster responses to unexpected events, improves accuracy in decision making, reduces errors, and helps organizations prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. It enables organizations to forecast demand trends, plan inventory sizing, distribute parts to the right locations, handle returns safely, track quality issues, and monitor suppliers' performance. Additionally, it provides a single point of contact for employees, vendors, and customers, allowing them to access information and communicate easily.

## Component Health Monitoring

Component health monitoring is the process of detecting any unusual behavior or condition in the manufacture or assembly of a component during its lifecycle. Monitoring is usually performed using sensors installed inside the component itself, along with feedback mechanisms provided by downstream systems or operators. Components are classified into two categories - primary and secondary. Primary components represent essential building blocks required for assembly, while secondary components are those added to meet special functional requirements, such as higher temperatures or specialized applications. Commonly used sensors for primary components include thermal, vibration, and pressure sensors. For secondary components, digital cameras or microphones are commonly used to capture images or audio signals, respectively. Anomalous behaviors detected in a component can indicate a hardware issue, software bug, or a problem with the physical structure of the component. Once identified, corrective actions can be taken to restore component functionality while avoiding damage or downtime.
