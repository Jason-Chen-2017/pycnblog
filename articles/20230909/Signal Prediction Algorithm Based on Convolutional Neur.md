# 2. Concept and Term Explanation
## 2.1 What is Convolutional Neural Network?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), also known as ConvNet or Convolutional Layer Neural Network, is a type of artificial neural network designed specifically for image processing and computer vision tasks. It consists of interconnected layers of filters or feature detectors, which learn spatial relationships between patterns in the input data and produce new representations for them. Each layer applies a set of filters to the previous layer’s output to extract meaningful features. The final result of the last layer is typically fed through fully connected layers that perform classification or regression depending on the task at hand. A convolutional neural network can learn abstract features from raw inputs that help identify specific objects or characteristics within images or videos, making it particularly suitable for analyzing complex datasets that include visual imagery.

The architecture of a typical CNN includes several layers of filter/feature detectors arranged in a topological pattern, starting with an input layer that accepts raw data and producing a single vector output. The subsequent layers consist of a series of convolutional and pooling layers that apply filters to the previous layer’s outputs to extract spatial and temporal features respectively. These filters usually consist of small regions of weights that slide over the input volume to detect relevant features, resulting in smaller but more highly contextualized representations than traditional feedforward neural networks.

In addition to spatial and temporal features, the penultimate layer(s) can optionally include densely connected layers that combine low-level features to create higher-level abstractions, which ultimately lead to classification or regression outcomes. The number of neurons in these dense layers increases progressively until the output layer, which produces the final output for the network. As a general rule, the greater the complexity of the dataset and the larger the filter sizes, the better the accuracy of the classifier.

The architecture of a CNN depends heavily on the nature of the input data, such as image or audio sequences, and the size of the expected output, either class labels or continuous values. Some common types of convolutional neural networks include LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet.


## 2.2 Why do we use Convolutional Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting?
Time series forecasting is a challenging task because there are many factors affecting the movement of time series data, such as seasonality, trends, noise levels, and structural changes. Therefore, predictive models must be robust enough to handle such variations. One approach to solve this challenge is to use deep learning algorithms that capture both local and global dependencies in the input data. This approach enables us to generate accurate predictions even when given sparse or noisy data samples. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become one of the most successful deep learning approaches for time series forecasting tasks due to their ability to recognize patterns in spatiotemporal data without being affected by irrelevant features.

Here are some advantages of CNNs compared to other machine learning algorithms for time series forecasting:

1. Flexibility: CNNs are highly flexible and adaptable. They can take variable length input sequences, learn complex interactions among variables, and produce outputs with varying dimensionality. For example, they can adaptively adjust the receptive field size, stride, dilation rate, and padding to control the amount and resolution of extracted features.

2. Nonlinearity: CNNs enable nonlinearities such as max-pooling, softmax, sigmoid activation functions, ReLU, tanh, and linear activation functions in the hidden layers.

3. Regularization: CNNs offer regularization techniques like dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capability of the model. 

4. Reduced Overfitting: CNNs require less labeled data compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, leading to reduced overfitting risk. 

5. Efficiency: CNNs are computationally efficient and train faster than traditional machine learning algorithms. With appropriate hardware acceleration libraries, they can process large amounts of data efficiently. 

6. Scalability: CNNs are relatively scalable and can be applied to large datasets that exceed memory capacity. They can distribute the workload across multiple devices for parallel execution.

7. Visualization: CNNs can visualize the learned features by generating heat maps of activations generated by individual units in the intermediate layers. This helps in identifying areas of interest and observing the behavior of the model during training.



## 2.3 Terms Used in CNNs for Time Series Forecasting
### Input Data
Input data refers to the sequence of observations that are provided to the system for making predictions. It could be a time series of stock prices, sales figures, electric power consumption rates, social media sentiment analysis, or any other similar data that contains sequential events. The input data can vary in length, i.e., it can have different numbers of observations per day, week, month, year, or longer periods. 

For instance, if we want to forecast stock prices of Apple Inc. every minute, the input data would contain the opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, volume traded, trading activity indicators, company announcements, weather reports, news articles, and so forth. Depending upon the scenario, additional information such as macroeconomic factors, industry reports, or economic indicators might also be included as part of the input data. 

### Observations
Observations refer to the actual numerical values measured at each point in time. They comprise the input data and represent a snapshot of the system's state at a particular moment in time. The shape of the observation vectors varies according to the domain and purpose of the study. Examples of commonly used observation vectors include scalar values, vector values, and multivariate time series.

Scalar values describe quantitative measures such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and so forth. Vector values represent measurements that are combined together to obtain a magnitude and direction, e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates, sunlight intensity, wind direction and strength, and so forth. Multivariate time series include measurements taken simultaneously over multiple dimensions, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, GPS trajectories, and accelerometer readings.

Each observation vector is associated with a corresponding timestamp indicating the exact time at which the measurement was made. If the input data comes in a regular interval, the timestamps indicate the exact start time of each period. If the input data comes irregular intervals, the timestamps may not match exactly with the actual times of the measurements. In this case, it becomes difficult to align the predicted results with the original data since the two datasets don't necessarily share the same sampling frequency or duration. Hence, it is essential to preprocess the data to convert it to uniform sampling frequency before feeding it to the algorithm.

### Time Steps
The time steps refer to the number of consecutive observations that occur within the same unit of time. For instance, if the input data comprises daily observations, then the time step represents the number of days in each observation window. Similarly, if the input data comprises hourly observations, then the time step represents the number of hours in each observation window. When working with historical data, the time step should ideally be equal to the time interval between consecutive observations to ensure accurate predictions. However, in situations where the input data is too short, shorter time steps can still be used as long as they correspond to sufficient statistical variability in the underlying process.

### Feature Extractor
Feature extractor refers to the portion of the CNN architecture that takes in the observation vector as input and produces a collection of features that characterize the input signal. Typically, the first few layers of the CNN extract simple features such as edges and textures that tend to be invariant across different regions of the input space. These features act as input to higher-level features that depend on the surrounding context. The feature extractor learns to map the input space to a fixed dimensional representation that captures the underlying dynamics of the system.

### Filter / Kernel 
Filter or kernel refers to the matrix of weights that slides over the input volume to extract features. The size of the filter determines the degree of sparsity in the extracted features and controls the bandwidth of the signal. Filters that activate pixels with stronger gradients are said to be oriented selectively. The orientation of the filters depends on the choice of edge detection operator and the distribution of gradient orientations in the input space.

### Activation Function
Activation function specifies the non-linear transformation applied to the filtered output of each layer to introduce non-linearity into the system. Common activation functions include Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Sigmoid, Softmax, Tanh, and Linear. Relu activation is widely used in modern CNN architectures since it is computationally efficient and prevents vanishing gradients. Other activation functions like sigmoid and softmax allow the network to classify the input into multiple categories or probabilities, respectively. Tanh activation function reduces the range of the output to [-1, 1] which makes it useful for scaling the network outputs. The linear activation function leaves the input unchanged, which can be useful in cases where there is no requirement for non-linearity.

### Pooling Layer
Pooling layer is another critical component of the CNN architecture. It downsamples the feature maps produced by the feature extractor by taking maximum or average values within small neighborhoods called receptive fields. The goal of pooling is to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and increase the translation invariance of the features. Max pooling involves selecting only the pixel value with the highest response in the receptive field; mean pooling involves computing the average of all pixels' responses in the receptive field. Both pooling operations remove the spatial hierarchy and preserve only the most salient features.

### Dense Layer
Dense layer is a standard layer present in CNN architectures that connects the output of the final pooling layer to the fully connected output layer. The dense layers are responsible for transforming the low-dimensional feature representations into high-dimensional representations that facilitate classification or regression tasks. The number of nodes in the dense layers generally increases progressively until the output layer, which produces the final output for the network. The dense layers use activation functions like ReLU or Sigmoid to add non-linearity to the system. The number of neurons in the dense layers increases progressively until the output layer, which produces the final output for the network.
