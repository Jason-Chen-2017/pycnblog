2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into detailed discussions on how to trade cryptocurrencies successfully, let's clarify some basic terms and concepts used in this field. Here are some key points that need to be understood: 

1. Cryptocurrency: A digital currency whose value is backed by computer code and stored electronically on blockchains. There are several types of cryptocurrencies ranging from Bitcoin to Ethereum, all with varying levels of security, utility, decentralization and scalability. Users typically create wallet addresses to receive and store digital assets and transact within the network.

2. Crypto-exchange: An exchange service that facilitates trading of digital currencies, primarily focused on the trading of cryptocurrencies. Some commonly used exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, etc.

3. Market: The largest trading platform for digital asset transactions. It provides access to the order books of multiple crypto exchanges, allowing traders to view and enter orders at specific prices and quantities. Trading markets are divided into two categories - open-market and closed-market. Open-market exchanges allow anyone to place limit and market orders; whereas, closed-market exchanges have predefined rules and procedures for entering and exiting positions.

4. Wallet address: A unique identifier associated with an individual’s digital account held on a blockchain network. It serves as the primary method for sending and receiving digital currencies and tokens. User accounts can have multiple wallet addresses, depending upon the number of digital currencies they hold. 

5. Exchange rate: The price at which one digital currency can be exchanged for another. This applies both intra-blockchain and inter-blockchain exchanges. For example, if Bitcoin is worth $70k and someone wants to purchase Dogecoin, then he/she must pay $0.09 BTC per DOGE, i.e., an exchange rate of $0.09 USD per BTC.  

6. Order book: A list of buy and sell orders maintained by each exchange for a particular digital asset. It displays the current bid-ask spread, volume, and status of pending orders. 

7. Limit order: An order placed by a user specifying the quantity of an asset sought, price per unit, and directionality (buy or sell). These orders remain active until filled or canceled. 

8. Market order: An order placed by a user specifying the desired action (buy or sell), and not specifying any particular price. These orders are executed immediately at the best available market price within the exchange ruleset.

9. Fiat currency: A non-digital currency denominated in national currencies, such as USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc. 

10. Crypto-tax: Any tax imposed by governments or central banks on digital currencies and their activities. It ranges from simple transaction fees to complex legal requirements.

11. Technical analysis: A process of analyzing financial data to determine future trends, movements, and patterns. It involves identifying trading signals, calculating indicators, and evaluating past performance against the same period or time horizon.

12. Moving Average Crossover Strategy: A technical analysis technique that identifies trend reversals in the short term by comparing moving averages across different intervals of time, typically 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and daily. It compares the short-term signal line to long-term support and resistance lines to detect trend reversals.

In addition to these general terms and concepts, we will cover more specific details throughout the rest of the article.
