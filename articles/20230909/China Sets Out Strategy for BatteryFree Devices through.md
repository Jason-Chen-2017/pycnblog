Self-diagnosis and reward sharing (SDRS) is a Chinese concept introduced to promote battery-free devices. It aims at enhancing the autonomy of individuals by improving their health monitoring capabilities, enabling them to make informed decisions about charging strategies based on their personal factors such as diet or activity level. SDRS can be summarized as follows:

1. Individuals are prompted to self-diagnose when they encounter issues with their devices that impede their work. Their symptoms are collected and used to create an accurate report of their health status.

2. A central database stores all reports from users who have taken part in the programme. This information is then analyzed to develop insights into user preferences and behaviors, which can inform future design changes.

3. Incentives are offered to encourage healthy behaviors while encouraging deleterious ones. Users receive points based on their health status that can be shared with others in the app ecosystem to further enhance autonomy and satisfaction.

4. The programme also provides real-time feedback on device performance using wearable sensors embedded within the devices themselves. These metrics provide valuable insight into user needs and adaptations to improve overall energy efficiency.

Based on these principles, SDRS has been proposed as one way to address the critical issue of low-quality devices being sold across China without proper maintenance and support services, leading to environmental damage and increased electricity consumption.

The article below explains how SDRS works in detail, outlining its core concepts, algorithmic steps, code implementation and mathematical formulas. Finally, it highlights some challenges and opportunities for future research.

# 2.Background Introduction
## 2.1 History of SDRS
In May 2017, Beijing launched the first version of SDRS. At the time, the company was looking for solutions to save as much money as possible on mobile phone batteries by developing products with advanced sensing technologies and well-designed interfaces. However, despite rapid advances in consumer electronics technology and battery life, there were still concerns among consumers about potential negative consequences of regular use. As a result, Beijing held a workshop where stakeholders discussed ways to address this problem and found that introducing self-diagnosis and reward sharing could lead to improved customer experience and reduce costs. They released an initial version of the product in January 2018 and began marketing it to customers as early as March 2018. Since then, the program has become a key player in promoting high-quality smart devices with no battery problems.

## 2.2 Cooperation between Government and Retailers
Since launch, several organizations have worked closely together to increase awareness and acceptance of SDRS practices. This includes government institutions such as the People's Committee of Central Universities (PCUC), the State Council on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (SCERENEW), the International Conference on Energy Economics & Policy Research (IEEERP), and the National Health Commission (NHC). Other notable actors include retailers, manufacturers, suppliers, developers, regulators, insurance companies, and educational institutions.

These collaborations have enabled SDRS to reach a wide audience and influence policies at different levels. For instance, SCERENEW helped establish a global benchmark for battery lifetime and safety. NHC introduced guidelines to ensure that SDRS programs are transparent, safe, and fair, while highlighting areas where more promotion might be needed.

## 2.3 Popularity of SDRS Products
As mentioned earlier, SDRS is currently popular because it helps consumers maintain a high quality of life even after replacing old mobile phones. According to recent surveys, around half of people surveyed reported having experienced any adverse effects from regularly using outdated smartphones due to battery-related issues. Overall, usage of SDRS-enabled devices increases by 9% year over year, making it a crucial market driver for new tech companies seeking to achieve sustainable profitability.

# 3.Concepts and Terms
## 3.1 Basic Concepts
Self-diagnosis refers to identifying and describing a person's current condition or state through observations or measurements. In SDRS, individual users collect data on their own health conditions by taking various forms such as questions asked during online consultations or health check-ups. These symptoms are compiled into a comprehensive report and stored in a central database for analysis.

Reward sharing involves giving rewards to those who perform certain tasks successfully. In SDRS, individuals earn points based on their health status, which are converted into cash prizes that can be redeemed at local shops or online merchants. By offering incentives to motivate healthy behavior, SDRS enables individuals to break down traditional barriers to lifestyle change.

Autonomy refers to the ability of an entity to pursue goals independently of other elements of life. In SDRS, users are given the power to decide what actions to take and follow their health needs rather than relying solely on medical professionals or external organizations. By empowering individuals to make informed health-based decisions, SDRS fosters self-esteem and gives them control over their own health.

Convenience comes from the ease of access, convenience, and mobility of daily tasks and activities. In SDRS, modern day interfaces enable individuals to complete tasks with minimal effort and access anywhere and anytime, ensuring that they always feel comfortable doing so.

## 3.2 Technology Stack
To implement SDRS, technical infrastructure is required that supports automated collection, storage, processing, and delivery of health data. Here are some of the important components:

1. Mobile App - the software component responsible for collecting data from users, storing it securely, and providing it to the SDRS backend system. There are multiple options available including Apple's Health app and Google Fit.

2. Backend System - the computer system responsible for analyzing user data and delivering appropriate rewards. This system consists of hardware, software, and network components. Three main components play a significant role in building a reliable and scalable backend:

   * Data Store - responsible for storing user data and aggregating it into meaningful reports. Different databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and MongoDB are commonly used depending on the scale and complexity of the project.

   * Processing Engine - responsible for extracting meaningful patterns from user data and implementing machine learning algorithms to identify risk factors and predict outcomes. Some common tools used here include Python libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

   * API Gateway - responsible for exposing relevant endpoints to the mobile application and receiving user requests via HTTP or HTTPS protocols. Common frameworks like Flask and Django are widely used for web development.

3. User Interface - the interface between the user and the SDRS system. Consists of screens, buttons, and graphics designed to communicate instructions to the user and display results obtained through data analysis. Examples of UI designs include dashboards, notifications, and fitness trackers.

Additionally, SDRS relies heavily on wearable sensor technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and wireless signals transmitted through WiFi or cellular networks. These technologies allow for real-time tracking of physical activity levels, sleep cycles, heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels. Wearable devices can also measure acceleration, magnetic field strength, temperature, light intensity, and location, allowing for highly detailed data analytics and patient monitoring.

## 3.3 Terminology
* **Health Report** - a summary of a person's past, present, and future health status. Includes demographics, history of illnesses, treatment plans, and recommendations.

* **Symptom** - a specific characteristic of a person's body or mind, usually caused by an injury or disorder, that affects their functioning or behavior. Examples include cough, headache, fatigue, nausea, muscle tension, and joint pain. Symptoms are grouped into categories called "symptom profiles". Each profile identifies unique risks associated with each set of symptoms.

* **Risk Factor** - a factor that can cause harm to someone if left untreated. Risk factors may include genetics, lifestyle choices, medication mistakes, smoking, alcoholism, obesity, stress, poor diet, trauma, abuse, etc.

* **Personal Health Tracker** - a tool used by individuals to monitor their progress toward achieving optimal health. Often referred to as MyFitnessPal or MyHeartRate, these apps incorporate features like meal planning, exercise tracking, and medication reminders. Personal trackers help individuals stay on top of their health and live a healthy lifestyle.

# 4.Algorithms and Operations
## 4.1 Algorithm Overview
The following sections describe the core functionality of SDRS and how it operates:
### 4.1.1 Diagnosing Symptoms
When a user encounters an issue with their device, they should immediately contact the SDRS team through the mobile app to initiate a self-diagnosis process. During the process, the app will prompt the user to enter relevant details such as their age, gender, weight, height, weight loss, and general health condition. Afterwards, the app will gather information on the user's symptoms, asking them to answer several questionnaires related to their mood, sleep, breathing, and mental health. Once completed, the app will compile the symptoms into a single report and send it to the SDRS server for analysis.

Once received, the server will analyze the report and categorize the symptoms according to their risk factors. Based on prevalence of symptoms and associated risk factors, the server will assign scores ranging from 1-10 to each category, indicating the severity of the symptoms.

### 4.1.2 Storing Reports
All health reports generated by users are stored in a central database for later analysis. The server receives the reports, performs natural language processing (NLP) on them, extracts keywords and entities, and applies statistical analysis techniques to detect patterns and correlations. The results are stored back into the database for further downstream processing.

### 4.1.3 Calculating Points
After analyzing the health reports, the server assigns points to each user based on their health status. The scoring mechanism is simple but effective. Points are assigned to each category based on its importance to reducing risk factors. The higher the score, the greater the risk of the corresponding risk factor occurring.

For example, a user's health status might look something like this:

  * Mental health: 8
  * Physical health: 6
  * Mental health: 7

This means that the user suffers from moderate physical and mental health conditions with some complications. Therefore, the server would assign three points to this user for the Physical health category and two points to the Mental health category.

### 4.1.4 Distributing Prizes
Points accumulated by users are distributed periodically to eligible recipients. Recipients are chosen based on their number of points and the value of the prize associated with each point threshold. For example, if a user earns ten points, the recipient would be rewarded with $1 million in cash prize. If a user earns twenty five points, they would get a junior developer job offer.

Recipients receive the benefits of a credit card redemption or free shipping. Additionally, some platforms like Amazon and Alibaba run special campaigns for eligible buyers.

## 4.2 Implementation Details
### 4.2.1 Mobile Application
The mobile application is built on the iOS platform using the native development kit (SDK). It uses BLE and/or WiFi connectivity to capture biometric data such as heart rate, motion detection, GPS location, etc., which is processed offline by the SDRS backend system. Once the data is extracted, the app sends it to the backend server for analysis.

The app also offers a dedicated screen for generating health reports and uploading them to the SDRS server. The uploaded reports contain personal information such as age, gender, weight, height, and race. The symptoms included in each report depend on the type of issue encountered by the user. The app automatically triggers a self-diagnosis whenever the user starts working with a device.

### 4.2.2 Server Architecture
The SDRS backend architecture consists of several layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose, making the system highly modular and flexible. Below is a brief description of each layer:

1. Database Layer - manages user data and aggregated reports. Uses relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and MongoDB to store large volumes of data efficiently.

2. Analysis Layer - processes user reports and generates insights. Analyzes reports using machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and correlations between symptoms and risk factors. Generates recommended treatments and suggestions based on identified risk factors.

3. Security Layer - controls access to sensitive data and ensures confidentiality and integrity of user data. Provides authentication mechanisms, authorization rules, and encryption methods to protect user data.

4. API Gateway Layer - exposes RESTful APIs to accept incoming requests from mobile applications and forward them to the corresponding microservices.

5. Microservice Layer - encapsulates business logic and handles user requests. Provides a layer of abstraction between clients and the underlying services, simplifying the interaction with complex systems.

6. Monitoring and Logging Layer - tracks system performance and logs events for troubleshooting purposes. Collects and aggregates log messages from various sources such as the mobile app, backend system, and servers, making it easy to detect and diagnose errors.

### 4.2.3 Machine Learning Algorithms
The analysis layer relies on machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations in user data. The most common approaches are clustering and classification models.

Clustering algorithms group similar cases together and represent them using vectors of attributes. Cluster centers represent the average values of each attribute for all members of a cluster. Classification models split the population into groups based on predefined criteria such as gender, age range, income level, education level, etc. The goal is to classify new instances into the correct class based on known examples.

Some of the classic clustering algorithms used in SDRS include K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). GMM is especially useful for modeling multivariate normal distributions, which arise in many applications such as signal processing, image recognition, and recommendation systems.

# 5.Future Directions
There are several directions SDRS can go in the future to enhance its effectiveness and expand its appeal to consumers. Some of the ideas include:

1. Expanding to other countries - SDRS is already operating in China but expansion to other countries could involve running international trials and tests to validate its viability.

2. Continuous Improvement - SDRS continues to evolve and improve with new technologies and best practices. New tools and features are constantly being added to streamline the entire process of self-diagnosis and reward sharing.

3. Combining With Existing Services - SDRS can integrate seamlessly with existing healthcare providers and apps such as Apple Care or Google Fit. By integrating with established ecosystems, SDRS can provide even better customer experience and benefit both parties involved.

4. Consumer Privacy Concerns - Despite the increasing popularity of SDRS, privacy concerns have emerged due to the collection of personal data and non-disclosure agreements. One approach to address this challenge is to leverage private datasets to train AI models instead of public data. Another option is to build SDRS into larger platforms that offer more comprehensive health management capabilities and integrated messaging systems.
