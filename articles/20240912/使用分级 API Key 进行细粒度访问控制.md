### Blog Title: Fine-Grained Access Control with Hierarchical API Keys: Interview Questions and Algorithmic Problems for Top Chinese Internet Giants

### Introduction

In the era of digital transformation, API (Application Programming Interface) keys play a crucial role in ensuring secure and controlled access to various services and resources. Top Chinese internet companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance have set high standards for API security, using hierarchical API keys to achieve fine-grained access control. This blog post explores some typical interview questions and algorithmic problems related to this concept, providing comprehensive answer explanations and code examples.

### 1. Designing a Hierarchical API Key System

**Question:** How would you design a hierarchical API key system for a large-scale application?

**Answer:** A hierarchical API key system can be designed using a tree-like structure, where each node represents an API key and its children represent sub-keys. Here’s a high-level approach to designing such a system:

```python
class APIKey:
    def __init__(self, key, parent=None):
        self.key = key
        self.parent = parent
        self.children = []

    def add_child(self, child):
        self.children.append(child)

    def is_child_of(self, other):
        if self == other:
            return True
        if self.parent is None:
            return False
        return self.parent.is_child_of(other)
```

**Explanation:** This design allows for easy addition of child keys and checking if one key is a sub-key of another. For example, if we have a root key and its children:

```python
root = APIKey("root")
subkey1 = APIKey("subkey1", root)
subkey2 = APIKey("subkey2", root)
root.add_child(subkey1)
root.add_child(subkey2)

# Check if subkey1 is a child of root
print(root.is_child_of(subkey1))  # True
```

### 2. Authenticating API Requests with Hierarchical Keys

**Question:** How would you implement an API authentication mechanism using hierarchical keys?

**Answer:** To authenticate API requests with hierarchical keys, you can use the following approach:

1. Extract the API key from the request header.
2. Validate the key by traversing the hierarchical key tree.
3. If the key is valid, proceed with the request; otherwise, reject it.

Here’s a simple example:

```python
def authenticate_request(api_key, root):
    current = root
    while current:
        if current.key == api_key:
            return True
        current = current.parent
    return False

# Example usage
is_authenticated = authenticate_request("subkey1", root)
print(is_authenticated)  # True or False based on the key
```

**Explanation:** This example assumes that the API key provided in the request is a leaf node in the key tree. If the key is valid, the function returns `True`, indicating that the request can be processed.

### 3. Implementing Access Control Policies with Hierarchical Keys

**Question:** How would you implement access control policies based on hierarchical keys?

**Answer:** Access control policies can be implemented using a dictionary mapping keys to sets of allowed actions. Here’s a simple example:

```python
access_policies = {
    "root": {"read", "write", "delete"},
    "subkey1": {"read", "write"},
    "subkey2": {"read"},
}

def check_permission(api_key, action):
    if api_key not in access_policies:
        return False
    return action in access_policies[api_key]

# Example usage
is_permitted = check_permission("subkey1", "read")
print(is_permitted)  # True or False based on the action
```

**Explanation:** This example uses a dictionary to store the allowed actions for each key. The `check_permission` function checks if the provided key has the requested action in its allowed set.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored some interview questions and algorithmic problems related to hierarchical API key systems. These systems provide a powerful way to implement fine-grained access control, ensuring secure and efficient use of APIs in large-scale applications. By understanding the underlying concepts and algorithms, you’ll be well-prepared to tackle similar challenges in your software development journey.
