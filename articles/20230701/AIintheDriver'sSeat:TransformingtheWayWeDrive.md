To better understand the technical principles of AI in driver's seat, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and principles of AI and its applications. In this section, we will cover the fundamental concepts and principles of AI, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

### 2.1. Basic Concepts Explanation

* 2.1.1. Machine Learning (ML)
* 2.1.2. Deep Learning (DL)
* 2.1.3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* 2.1.4. Computer Vision (CV)

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve from data, without being explicitly programmed. It is based on algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. ML has a wide range of applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of ML that specializes in neural networks, which are highly complex algorithms designed to learn from data. Deep learning algorithms can recognize patterns in images and speech more accurately than traditional ML methods.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on developing algorithms to process, understand, and generate human language. It has applications in text-to-speech systems, language translation, and sentiment analysis.

Computer vision (CV) is a field of AI that focuses on developing algorithms to analyze, interpret, and understand visual data. It has applications in object recognition, facial recognition, and autonomous vehicles.
