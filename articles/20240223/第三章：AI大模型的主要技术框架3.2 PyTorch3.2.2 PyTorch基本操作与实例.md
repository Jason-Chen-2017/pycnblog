## 3.2 PyTorch: PyTorch basic operations and examples

PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as natural language processing and computer vision. It provides tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. This chapter will introduce the basics of PyTorch, including tensors, computational graphs, automatic differentiation, and building neural networks.

### 3.2.1 Tensors

Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays of numerical values, similar to NumPy's ndarrays. In PyTorch, tensors are the primary means of storing and manipulating data. They can be created using various methods, including constructing from a list or converting from a NumPy array.

#### Creating tensors

To create a tensor in PyTorch, you can use the `torch.tensor()` function, which takes a Python list or another tensor as input. For example:

```python
import torch

# Create a rank-1 (vector) tensor
vector = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
print(vector)

# Create a rank-2 (matrix) tensor
matrix = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(matrix)
```

You can also convert a NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor using the `torch.from_numpy()` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
numpy_array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Convert it to a PyTorch tensor
tensor = torch.from_numpy(numpy_array)
print(tensor)
```

#### Tensor properties

Tensors have several important properties, such as their size, shape, and data type. To access these properties, you can use the `size()`, `shape()`, and `dtype` attributes, respectively. Here's an example:

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Access its properties
print("Size:", tensor.size())
print("Shape:", tensor.shape)
print("Data type:", tensor.dtype)
```

#### Tensor operations

PyTorch supports various arithmetic operations between tensors, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and element-wise functions like `sin()`, `cos()`, and `exp()`. Here's an example:

```python
import torch

# Create two tensors
a = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Add them together
c = a + b
print(c)

# Compute the element-wise product
d = a * b
print(d)

# Apply a function to each element
e = torch.sin(a)
print(e)
```

### 3.2.2 Computational graphs and automatic differentiation

Computational graphs are directed acyclic graphs that represent mathematical expressions, where nodes represent operations and edges represent inputs and outputs. PyTorch uses computational graphs to perform automatic differentiation, making it easy to compute gradients for optimization tasks.

#### Defining a computational graph

To define a computational graph in PyTorch, you typically create a forward pass function that defines the operations. The `torch.nn` module contains several predefined modules, including fully connected layers and convolutional layers, which can be combined to build complex models.

Here's an example of defining a simple computational graph using `torch.nn`:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self):
       super().__init__()
       self.fc = nn.Linear(2, 2)

   def forward(self, x):
       return self.fc(x)

model = SimpleModel()
input_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2]])
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor)
```

#### Computing gradients

Once you've defined your computational graph, you can use PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities to compute gradients. By default, PyTorch records all operations performed on tensors, allowing you to backpropagate through the graph to calculate gradients.

The `torch.autograd` module contains functions to manually control the gradient calculation process. The most common functions are `backward()` and `zero_grad()`.

Here's an example of computing gradients using automatic differentiation:

```python
import torch

# Define a function with respect to which we want to compute gradients
def loss_function(predicted, target):
   return ((predicted - target) ** 2).mean()

# Create a model and some tensors
model = SimpleModel()
input_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2]], requires_grad=True)
target_tensor = torch.tensor([[3, 4]])

# Forward pass
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)

# Compute loss
loss = loss_function(output_tensor, target_tensor)

# Backpropagate to compute gradients
loss.backward()

# Print gradients
print("Gradient for input_tensor:", input_tensor.grad)
```

### 3.2.3 Building neural networks

Building neural networks in PyTorch involves combining predefined modules from the `torch.nn` module, such as fully connected layers (`nn.Linear`), activation functions (`nn.ReLU`), and pooling layers (`nn.MaxPool2d`). These modules can be stacked to create complex architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks.

#### Creating a fully connected network

Here's an example of creating a fully connected network in PyTorch:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class FullyConnectedNetwork(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_outputs):
       super().__init__()
       self.fc1 = nn.Linear(num_inputs, 16)
       self.fc2 = nn.Linear(16, 32)
       self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, num_outputs)
       self.relu = nn.ReLU()

   def forward(self, x):
       x = self.fc1(x)
       x = self.relu(x)
       x = self.fc2(x)
       x = self.relu(x)
       x = self.fc3(x)
       return x

network = FullyConnectedNetwork(784, 10)
```

#### Training a neural network

Training a neural network involves optimizing its parameters using gradient descent to minimize a given objective function, often a loss function between predicted and actual values. Here's an example of training a fully connected network using stochastic gradient descent:

```python
import torch.optim as optim

# Load dataset
# ...

# Instantiate the network, loss function, and optimizer
network = FullyConnectedNetwork(784, 10)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(network.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Train the network for a certain number of epochs
for epoch in range(epochs):
   running_loss = 0.0
   for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
       inputs, labels = data
       optimizer.zero_grad()
       outputs = network(inputs.view(-1, 784))
       loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
       loss.backward()
       optimizer.step()
       running_loss += loss.item()
   print("Epoch [{}/{}], Loss: {:.4f}".format(epoch+1, epochs, running_loss/len(trainloader)))
```

#### Saving and loading models

To save and load trained models in PyTorch, you can use the `torch.save()` and `torch.load()` functions, respectively. Here's an example:

```python
# Save the model
torch.save(network.state_dict(), "model.pt")

# Load the model
loaded_network = FullyConnectedNetwork(784, 10)
loaded_network.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pt"))
```

### Real-world applications

PyTorch is widely used in various real-world applications, including:

* Natural Language Processing (NLP): tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation.
* Computer Vision: applications such as image recognition, object detection, and style transfer.
* Reinforcement Learning: training agents to perform tasks in complex environments.

### Appendix: Common questions and answers

**Q: What's the difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch?**

A: Both TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular open-source machine learning libraries, but they have some differences. TensorFlow has a more rigid structure, where computation graphs must be defined beforehand, while PyTorch allows for more dynamic graph construction during runtime. This makes PyTorch more flexible and easier to debug, especially for beginners. TensorFlow, however, has stronger support for production-level deployment and distributed computing.

**Q: How do I install PyTorch?**

A: To install PyTorch, visit their official website at <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>. Select your operating system, package manager, and desired version, then follow the instructions provided.

**Q: How do I convert a NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor?**

A: You can convert a NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor using the `torch.from_numpy()` function, like so:

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

numpy_array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor = torch.from_numpy(numpy_array)
print(tensor)
```

**Q: How do I convert a PyTorch tensor to a NumPy array?**

A: You can convert a PyTorch tensor to a NumPy array using the `numpy()` method, like so:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
numpy_array = tensor.numpy()
print(numpy_array)
```

**Q: How do I reshape a tensor in PyTorch?**

A: In PyTorch, you can reshape a tensor using the `reshape()`, `contiguous()`, or `permute()` methods, depending on your specific needs. The `reshape()` method changes the shape without altering the data, while `contiguous()` ensures that the underlying memory layout is contiguous. The `permute()` method rearranges dimensions, which is particularly useful when working with multi-dimensional tensors.

Here's an example of each:

```python
import torch

# Create a rank-2 tensor
tensor = torch.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
print("Original tensor:", tensor)

# Reshape the tensor
reshaped_tensor = tensor.reshape((2, 3, 3))
print("Reshaped tensor:", reshaped_tensor)

# Ensure contiguous memory layout
contiguous_tensor = reshaped_tensor.contiguous()
print("Contiguous tensor:", contiguous_tensor)

# Permute dimensions
permuted_tensor = reshaped_tensor.permute((1, 0, 2))
print("Permuted tensor:", permuted_tensor)
```
