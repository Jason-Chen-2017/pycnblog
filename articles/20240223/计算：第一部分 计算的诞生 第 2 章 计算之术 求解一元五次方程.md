=============================================================================================================

*By the Zen and Art of Programming*

## 1. Background Introduction

The history of algebra can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks. However, it was not until the 16th century that mathematicians started to explore the solutions of polynomial equations systematically. In particular, the Italian mathematician Scipione del Ferro discovered a method for solving cubic equations in the early 16th century, which was later refined by his student Antonio Maria Fiore. Later on, NiccolÃ² Fontana Tartaglia and Gerolamo Cardano made significant contributions to the theory of equations, culminating in the publication of Ars Magna in 1545.

In this chapter, we will focus on univariate quintic equations, which are polynomial equations of degree five. Despite the fact that quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations can be solved exactly using radical expressions, the general quintic equation cannot. This is known as Abel-Ruffini theorem, which states that there is no general formula for solving quintic equations using only arithmetic operations and radicals.

However, specific quintic equations can sometimes be solved exactly, depending on their coefficients and structure. For example, Bring-Jerrard radical can be used to solve some quintic equations. In addition, numerical methods such as Newton-Raphson or Durand-Kerner can be used to approximate the roots of quintic equations with arbitrary precision.

In this article, we will explore the background, theory, and practice of solving univariate quintic equations. We will start with the basic definitions and properties of polynomial equations, then move on to the Bring-Jerrard radical and its applications. We will also discuss numerical methods for approximating the roots of quintic equations, along with practical examples and applications.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

### 2.1 Polynomials and Polynomial Equations

A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients, combined using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. For example, the expression `3x^2 + 2x - 5` is a polynomial of degree two (or second degree) in one variable x. A polynomial equation is an equation that equates two polynomials, such as `3x^2 + 2x - 5 = 0`.

Polynomials have several important properties, such as degree, leading coefficient, and roots. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable(s) in the polynomial. For example, the degree of the polynomial `3x^2 + 2x - 5` is two. The leading coefficient of a polynomial is the coefficient of the term with the highest degree. For example, the leading coefficient of the polynomial `3x^2 + 2x - 5` is three. The roots of a polynomial are the values of the variable(s) that make the polynomial equal to zero. For example, the roots of the polynomial `x^2 - 3x + 2` are 1 and 2.

### 2.2 Solvability of Polynomial Equations

As mentioned earlier, quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations can be solved exactly using radical expressions, while the general quintic equation cannot. This is due to the Abel-Ruffini theorem, which states that there is no general formula for solving quintic equations using only arithmetic operations and radicals. However, some special cases of quintic equations can be solved exactly, as we will see in the next section.

### 2.3 Bring-Jerrard Radical

The Bring-Jerrard radical is a radical expression that can be used to solve certain types of quintic equations. It is named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel and the British mathematician George Jerrard, who independently discovered it in the 19th century.

The Bring-Jerrard radical is defined as follows:

$$
y = \frac{1}{5} \left(-1 + \sqrt[5]{1 + 5\alpha} + \sqrt[5]{1 - 5\alpha}\right)^5
$$

where $\alpha$ is a parameter related to the coefficients of the quintic equation. Specifically, if the quintic equation is written in the form $x^5 + px^4 + qx^3 + rx^2 + sx + t = 0$, then $\alpha$ is given by:

$$
\alpha = \frac{p^5}
{5^5} + \frac{p^3q}
{5^4} - \frac{p^2r}
{5^3} - \frac{ps^2}
{5^3} + \frac{qt}
{5^2}
$$

If the value of $\alpha$ satisfies certain conditions, then the Bring-Jerrard radical can be used to express the roots of the quintic equation exactly using radicals. However, not all quintic equations can be solved using the Bring-Jerrard radical, as we will see in the next section.

## 3. Algorithmic Principles and Detailed Operational Steps and Mathematical Models

### 3.1 Solving Quadratic Equations Using the Quadratic Formula

Before discussing the solution of quintic equations, let us review how to solve quadratic equations using the quadratic formula. Given a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the quadratic formula is:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}
{2a}
$$

The quantity under the square root, $b^2 - 4ac$, is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If the discriminant is positive, then the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. If the discriminant is zero, then the quadratic equation has one repeated real root. If the discriminant is negative, then the quadratic equation has two complex conjugate roots.

### 3.2 Solving Cubic Equations Using Cardano's Method

Cardano's method is a general method for solving cubic equations of the form $x^3 + px = q$. It involves introducing a new variable $u$ and writing the cubic equation as a system of two equations:

$$
x = u + v
$$

$$
u^3 + v^3 = -p
$$

$$
uv = \frac{q}{3}
$$

Solving for $u$ and $v$ from the last two equations and substituting into the first equation yields the solution of the original cubic equation. Cardano's method can also be extended to solve depressed cubic equations of the form $x^3 = px + q$.

### 3.3 Solving Quartic Equations Using Ferrari's Method

Ferrari's method is a general method for solving quartic equations of the form $x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0$. It involves introducing a new variable $z$ and writing the quartic equation as a quadratic equation in $z$:

$$
z^2 + \frac{p}{2} z + \frac{\Delta_0}{4} = y^2
$$

where $\Delta_0$ is a function of the coefficients of the quartic equation. The solution of the quartic equation can then be expressed in terms of the solutions of the quadratic equation in $z$ and the original quartic equation.

### 3.4 Solving Quintic Equations Using the Bring-Jerrard Radical

As mentioned earlier, the Bring-Jerrard radical can be used to solve certain types of quintic equations. The algorithmic steps for using the Bring-Jerrard radical to solve a quintic equation are as follows:

1. Transform the quintic equation into the normal form:

$$
x^5 + px = q
$$

where $p$ and $q$ are constants determined by the original quintic equation.

2. Compute the value of $\alpha$ using the formula:

$$
\alpha = \frac{p^5}
{5^5} + \frac{p^3q}
{5^4} - \frac{p^2r}
{5^3} - \frac{ps^2}
{5^3} + \frac{qt}
{5^2}
$$

where $r, s,$ and $t$ are constants determined by the original quintic equation.

3. Check whether the value of $\alpha$ satisfies the condition:

$$
\left(\frac{1 + 5\alpha}
{5}\right)^{5/4} + \left(\frac{1 - 5\alpha}
{5}\right)^{5/4} > 1
$$

If this condition is satisfied, then the Bring-Jerrard radical can be used to express the roots of the quintic equation exactly using radicals. Otherwise, the Bring-Jerrard radical cannot be used, and numerical methods must be employed instead.

4. Compute the value of $y$ using the formula:

$$
y = \frac{1}{5} \left(-1 + \sqrt[5]{1 + 5\alpha} + \sqrt[5]{1 - 5\alpha}\right)^5
$$

5. Express the roots of the quintic equation using the formula:

$$
x_k = y^{1/5} \omega_k \exp\left(i\frac{2k\pi}
{5}\right) - \frac{p}{5y^{4/5}}
$$

where $\omega_k$ are the fifth roots of unity, given by:

$$
\omega_0 = 1
$$

$$
\omega_1 = \exp\left(i\frac{2\pi}
{5}\right)
$$

$$
\omega_2 = \exp\left(i\frac{4\pi}
{5}\right)
$$

$$
\omega_3 = \exp\left(i\frac{6\pi}
{5}\right)
$$

$$
\omega_4 = \exp\left(i\frac{8\pi}
{5}\right)
$$

Note that the formula for the roots of the quintic equation involves complex arithmetic, even if the coefficients of the quintic equation are real. However, if the discriminant of the quintic equation is positive, then all the roots of the quintic equation are real. In this case, the complex parts of the roots cancel out, and the roots are given by real radical expressions.

### 3.5 Numerical Methods for Approximating the Roots of Quintic Equations

If the Bring-Jerrard radical cannot be used to express the roots of a quintic equation exactly using radicals, then numerical methods can be used to approximate the roots with arbitrary precision. There are several numerical methods available for approximating the roots of polynomial equations, such as Newton-Raphson, Durand-Kerner, and Jenkins-Traub. We will discuss two of these methods in more detail below.

#### 3.5.1 Newton-Raphson Method

The Newton-Raphson method is a iterative method for finding the root of a function. Given a function $f(x)$ and an initial guess $x_0$, the Newton-Raphson method generates a sequence of approximations $x_{n+1}$ to the root of the function by computing the tangent line to the graph of the function at the current approximation $x_n$ and finding the intersection of the tangent line with the x-axis. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}
{f'(x_n)}
$$

For solving polynomial equations, we can use the Newton-Raphson method to find the roots of the polynomial by defining the function as $f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + a_0$, where $a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}$ are the coefficients of the polynomial. The derivative of the function can be computed as $f'(x) = n x^{n-1} + (n-1) a_{n-1} x^{n-2} + ... + a_1$.

The Newton-Raphson method can be applied to quintic equations by setting $n=5$ and computing the function and its derivative for each iteration until convergence is achieved.

#### 3.5.2 Durand-Kerner Method

The Durand-Kerner method is another iterative method for finding the roots of a polynomial. It is based on the idea of finding the eigenvalues of a companion matrix associated with the polynomial. The algorithm starts with an initial set of approximations to the roots and updates them iteratively until convergence is achieved.

The Durand-Kerner method can be applied to quintic equations by constructing the companion matrix associated with the quintic polynomial and computing its eigenvalues using a numerical library or software package. The eigenvalues of the companion matrix correspond to the roots of the quintic equation.

## 4. Best Practices: Codes and Detailed Explanations

In this section, we will provide some code snippets and detailed explanations for solving quintic equations using the Bring-Jerrard radical and the Newton-Raphson method.

### 4.1 Solving Quintic Equations Using the Bring-Jerrard Radical

Here is an example Python code for solving a quintic equation using the Bring-Jerrard radical:
```python
import cmath

def bring_jerrard(p):
   """
   Computes the value of the Bring-Jerrard radical for a given value of p.
   :param p: float or complex number
   :return: float or complex number
   """
   alpha = (p**5 / 5**5 + p**3 * p / 5**4 - p**2 * q / 5**3 - p * r**2 / 5**3 + q * t / 5**2) / 2
   y = (-1 + cmath.sqrt(1 + 5*alpha) + cmath.sqrt(1 - 5*alpha)) ** (5/4) / 5
   return y

def solve_quintic(coeffs):
   """
   Solves a quintic equation with given coefficients.
   :param coeffs: list of five numbers [a4, a3, a2, a1, a0]
   :return: list of five roots
   """
   p, q, r, s, t = coeffs
   y = bring_jerrard(-p / 5)
   fifth_roots_of_unity = [cmath.exp(2 * cmath.pi * k * 1j / 5) for k in range(5)]
   roots = []
   for k in range(5):
       omega = fifth_roots_of_unity[k]
       root = y**(1/5) * omega - p / (5 * y**(4/5))
       roots.append(root)
   return roots

# Example usage
coeffs = [1, -5, 10, -10, 5]
roots = solve_quintic(coeffs)
print("Roots:", roots)
```
In this example, we define two functions `bring_jerrard` and `solve_quintic`. The function `bring_jerrard` computes the value of the Bring-Jerrard radical for a given value of p. The function `solve_quintic` takes a list of five coefficients as input and returns a list of five roots.

The function `solve_quintic` first computes the value of p, q, r, s, and t from the given coefficients. Then it computes the value of y using the Bring-Jerrard radical. Finally, it computes the five roots using the formula described earlier and returns them as a list.

### 4.2 Solving Quintic Equations Using the Newton-Raphson Method

Here is an example Python code for solving a quintic equation using the Newton-Raphson method:
```python
import numpy as np

def newton_raphson(coeffs, max_iter=100, tolerance=1e-8):
   """
   Solves a quintic equation with given coefficients using the Newton-Raphson method.
   :param coeffs: list of six numbers [a5, a4, a3, a2, a1, a0]
   :param max_iter: int, maximum number of iterations
   :param tolerance: float, tolerance for convergence
   :return: list of five roots
   """
   a5, a4, a3, a2, a1, a0 = coeffs
   def f(x):
       return x**5 + a4 * x**4 + a3 * x**3 + a2 * x**2 + a1 * x + a0
   
   def df(x):
       return 5 * x**4 + 4 * a4 * x**3 + 3 * a3 * x**2 + 2 * a2 * x + a1
       
   x = np.random.rand() # initial guess
   for i in range(max_iter):
       if abs(f(x)) < tolerance:
           break
       x -= f(x) / df(x)
   return [x for _ in range(5)]

# Example usage
coeffs = [1, -5, 10, -10, 5, -1]
roots = newton_raphson(coeffs)
print("Roots:", roots)
```
In this example, we define a function `newton_raphson` that takes a list of six coefficients as input and returns a list of five roots. The function `newton_raphson` defines two auxiliary functions `f` and `df` to represent the polynomial and its derivative.

The main loop of the function iteratively updates the current approximation to the root until either the maximum number of iterations is reached or the absolute value of the polynomial evaluated at the current approximation is less than the specified tolerance.
