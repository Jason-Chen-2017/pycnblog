=========================================================================

by The Zen of Computer Programming Art

Introduction
------------

In today's fast-paced digital world, ensuring high availability (HA) for software systems is crucial for businesses and organizations to maintain their operations and meet customer expectations. High availability refers to the ability of a system or component to remain operational and accessible for a required level of time. In this blog post, we will explore the "Software System Architecture Golden Rules" that can help you achieve high availability in your software systems. These rules are based on proven principles, best practices, and real-world experiences from industry experts and practitioners. By following these golden rules, you can build reliable, robust, and highly available software systems that can withstand failures, reduce downtime, and improve user experience.
