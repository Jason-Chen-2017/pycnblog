## 1. Background Introduction
### 1.1 Introduction

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) has played an increasingly important role in business management since the 1990s. Traditionally, CRM systems focus on the collection, analysis, and utilization of customer information to help companies better understand customer needs, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately achieve sales growth and customer retention. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the emergence of large-scale model applications, the CRM field is experiencing a revolution.

Large-scale models, such as GPT-3, ChatGPT, and BERT, have demonstrated powerful capabilities in text understanding and generation, enabling them to process large amounts of data and extract valuable insights. The application of these large models not only changes the way data is processed but also redefines the possibilities and boundaries of CRM. The application of large-scale models in CRM can improve data analysis and decision-making efficiency, as well as bring more personalized customer experiences.

This article aims to explore the application of AI large-scale models in CRM, analyzing the new ideas and opportunities they bring. We will discuss the application scenarios of large-scale models in CRM, core algorithm principles, mathematical models and formulas, project practices, and practical application scenarios. In addition, we will recommend relevant tools and resources, summarize future development trends and challenges, and answer common questions.

#### 1.2 Overview of Large-scale AI Models

Large-scale AI models refer to neural network models with hundreds of millions or even trillions of parameters. These models can capture complex data patterns through learning large amounts of data and achieve excellent performance on multiple tasks. Some of the most representative large-scale models include GPT-3, ChatGPT, and BERT.

- **GPT-3**: Developed by OpenAI, it has 175 billion parameters and is currently the largest natural language processing model. GPT-3 excels in text generation, question-answering systems, and language translation.
- **ChatGPT**: A chatbot based on GPT-3 developed by OpenAI that can engage in natural conversations with humans and answer various questions.
- **BERT**: A pre-trained language model developed by Google with several billion parameters, widely used in tasks such as text classification, question-answering systems, and sentiment analysis.

These large-scale models are trained on large amounts of text data, enabling them to understand and generate natural language, which plays a crucial role in CRM applications.

#### 1.3 Overview of Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) refers to the strategies and methods used by companies to maintain and manage their relationships with customers. Traditional CRM systems typically include functions such as customer information management, sales management, marketing management, and customer service management. However, with the increase in data volume and complexity, traditional CRM systems face the following challenges:
