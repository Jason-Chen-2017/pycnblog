# Remove duplicates and clean the data
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Tokenize the text
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(data['description'])
```

**Step 1: Load the Dataset**

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using the Pandas `read_csv` function. The file should contain columns with relevant information, such as descriptions of tourist attractions. In this example, we assume there is a single column named 'description' containing text data.

```python
data = pd.read_csv('tourism_data.csv')
```

**Step 2: Clean the Data**

Data cleaning is performed to remove any duplicate or incomplete entries. This ensures that the dataset is free of noise and inconsistencies, which can negatively impact the model's performance.

```python
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
data.dropna(inplace=True)
```

**Step 3: Tokenize the Text**

Tokenization is the process of breaking the text into smaller units, such as words or subwords. This is necessary for the model to process and understand the text data. In this example, we use the `AutoTokenizer` from the Hugging Face Transformers library to tokenize the text.

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(data['description'])
```

The `tokenize` function splits the text into tokens and returns a list of tokenized words. These tokens will be used as input for the model during training and inference.

# Initialize the Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_data,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

**Step 1: Load the Model**

We load a pre-trained GPT-2 model using the `AutoModelForCausalLM` class from the Hugging Face Transformers library. This model is capable of generating text based on the input tokens.

```python
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('gpt2')
