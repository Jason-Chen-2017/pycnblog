### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

In the realm of AI 2.0 and cloud computing platforms, mathematical models and formulas play a crucial role in enabling intelligent systems to learn, make predictions, and automate decision-making processes. This section delves into the detailed explanation and examples of key mathematical models and formulas used in AI 2.0 applications, such as neural networks, gradient descent, and backpropagation.

#### Neural Networks

Neural networks are at the heart of AI 2.0, enabling machines to learn and make predictions from data. A neural network consists of interconnected layers of artificial neurons, each performing a specific function in the learning process.

**Mathematical Model:**

A simple neural network can be represented as follows:

\[ 
y = \sigma(\boldsymbol{z}) 
\]

Where:
- \( y \) is the output of the neural network.
- \( \sigma \) is the activation function, often a sigmoid or ReLU function.
- \( \boldsymbol{z} \) is the weighted sum of inputs and their associated biases.

**Example:**

Consider a simple neural network with a single hidden layer, where the input is \( \boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, x_2) \) and the weights and biases are \( \boldsymbol{w} = (w_1, w_2) \) and \( \boldsymbol{b} = (b_1, b_2) \), respectively.

The weighted sum of inputs and biases can be calculated as:

\[ 
\boldsymbol{z} = \boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{b} 
\]

Applying a sigmoid activation function, we get:

\[ 
y = \sigma(\boldsymbol{z}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\boldsymbol{z}}} 
\]

#### Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning models, such as neural networks. The goal of gradient descent is to adjust the model's parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.

**Mathematical Model:**

The gradient descent algorithm can be represented as:

\[ 
\boldsymbol{w}_{new} = \boldsymbol{w}_{current} - \alpha \cdot \nabla_{\boldsymbol{w}} \mathcal{L} 
\]

Where:
- \( \boldsymbol{w}_{current} \) is the current value of the weights.
- \( \alpha \) is the learning rate, which determines the step size of the parameter updates.
- \( \nabla_{\boldsymbol{w}} \mathcal{L} \) is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.

**Example:**

Consider a simple linear regression model with a single feature, where the weight is \( \boldsymbol{w} \) and the bias is \( \boldsymbol{b} \). The loss function is the mean squared error (MSE):

\[ 
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 
\]

The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight can be calculated as:

\[ 
\nabla_{\boldsymbol{w}} \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - y_i) x_i 
\]

Applying gradient descent, we update the weight as:

\[ 
\boldsymbol{w}_{new} = \boldsymbol{w}_{current} - \alpha \cdot \nabla_{\boldsymbol{w}} \mathcal{L} 
\]

#### Backpropagation

Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks by efficiently calculating the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's weights and biases. The algorithm works by propagating the error backwards through the network, adjusting the weights and biases at each layer.

**Mathematical Model:**

The backpropagation algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. **Forward Pass:**
   - Compute the weighted sum of inputs and biases for each layer.
   - Apply the activation function to obtain the output of each layer.
2. **Backward Pass:**
   - Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output of the last layer.
   - Propagate the gradients backwards through the network, updating the weights and biases at each layer.

**Example:**

Consider a simple neural network with a single hidden layer, where the input is \( \boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, x_2) \), the weights and biases for the hidden layer are \( \boldsymbol{w}_h = (w_{h1}, w_{h2}) \) and \( \boldsymbol{b}_h = (b_{h1}, b_{h2}) \), and the weights and biases for the output layer are \( \boldsymbol{w}_o = (w_{o1}, w_{o2}) \) and \( \boldsymbol{b}_o = (b_{o1}, b_{o2}) \).

1. **Forward Pass:**
   - Compute the weighted sum of inputs and biases for the hidden layer:
     \[ 
     \boldsymbol{z}_h = \boldsymbol{w}_h \cdot \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{b}_h 
     \]
   - Apply the sigmoid activation function to obtain the output of the hidden layer:
     \[ 
     \boldsymbol{a}_h = \sigma(\boldsymbol{z}_h) 
     \]
   - Compute the weighted sum of inputs and biases for the output layer:
     \[ 
     \boldsymbol{z}_o = \boldsymbol{w}_o \cdot \boldsymbol{a}_h + \boldsymbol{b}_o 
     \]
   - Apply the sigmoid activation function to obtain the output of the output layer:
     \[ 
     \boldsymbol{a}_o = \sigma(\boldsymbol{z}_o) 
     \]

2. **Backward Pass:**
   - Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output layer:
     \[ 
     \nabla_{\boldsymbol{a}_o} \mathcal{L} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \boldsymbol{a}_o} 
     \]
   - Propagate the gradients backwards through the network, updating the weights and biases at each layer:
     \[ 
     \nabla_{\boldsymbol{w}_o} \mathcal{L} = \boldsymbol{a}_h \odot \nabla_{\boldsymbol{a}_o} \mathcal{L} 
     \]
     \[ 
     \nabla_{\boldsymbol{b}_o} \mathcal{L} = \nabla_{\boldsymbol{a}_o} \mathcal{L} 
     \]
     \[ 
     \nabla_{\boldsymbol{a}_h} \mathcal{L} = \boldsymbol{a}_h \odot (\boldsymbol{w}_o \odot \nabla_{\boldsymbol{a}_o} \mathcal{L}) 
     \]
     \[ 
     \nabla_{\boldsymbol{w}_h} \mathcal{L} = \boldsymbol{x} \odot \nabla_{\boldsymbol{a}_h} \mathcal{L} 
     \]
     \[ 
     \nabla_{\boldsymbol{b}_h} \mathcal{L} = \nabla_{\boldsymbol{a}_h} \mathcal{L} 
     \]

By iterating through the forward and backward passes, the weights and biases of the neural network are updated to minimize the loss function, enabling the network to learn and make more accurate predictions.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the mathematical models and formulas used in AI 2.0 applications, such as neural networks, gradient descent, and backpropagation, are crucial for enabling intelligent systems to learn, make predictions, and automate decision-making processes. By understanding these models and their associated formulas, developers can build and optimize AI 2.0 applications that leverage the power of cloud computing platforms to deliver innovative solutions across various industries.
