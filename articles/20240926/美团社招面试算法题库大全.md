### 1. Background Introduction

#### 1.1 Importance of Meituan Social Recruitment Algorithm Question Bank

In today's job market, technical interviews, especially algorithm interviews, have become a crucial threshold for programmers and software developers to enter top companies like Meituan. As a well-known Chinese and global internet food delivery platform, Meituan places strict requirements on technical talent. The social recruitment algorithm question bank is an essential component of Meituan's interview process, as it not only tests candidates' proficiency in algorithms and data structures but also their ability to analyze and solve problems.

This study aims to systematically organize and analyze the algorithm questions in Meituan's social recruitment question bank, with the intention of helping candidates better understand and master these questions, thereby improving their interview success rate. This paper will delve into these algorithm question banks in-depth, including the background of the questions, problem-solving approaches, key code implementations, and optimization strategies.

#### 1.2 Challenges and Opportunities of Algorithm Interviews

Algorithm interviews typically cover a wide range of areas, including mathematical problems, data structure design, algorithm optimization, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more. For candidates, algorithm interviews present both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in understanding the questions, designing efficient algorithms, and accurately implementing them within a short time; the opportunity lies in demonstrating their logical thinking, programming skills, and problem-solving abilities.

The social recruitment algorithm question bank of Meituan contains a large number of questions with diverse types, including both basic questions and more complex algorithm problems. These questions are thoughtfully designed, often involving multiple knowledge points to test candidates' comprehensive abilities. By systematically studying and solving these questions, candidates can not only improve their technical level but also better prepare for other technical interviews.
