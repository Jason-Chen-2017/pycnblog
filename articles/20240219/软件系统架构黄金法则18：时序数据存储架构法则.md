## Background Introduction

### The Emergence of Big Data Systems

With the rapid growth of data from various sources such as sensors, social media platforms, and financial transactions, there is an increasing need to store and process large volumes of data efficiently. This has led to the development of big data systems that can handle massive amounts of information and enable real-time analytics.

### Time-Series Data in Modern Applications

Time-series data refers to sequences of measurements or observations made at different points in time. These data types are common in many modern applications, including monitoring systems, IoT devices, financial market analysis, and scientific research. Due to their importance, efficient storage and processing techniques for time-series data have become crucial in modern software architecture.

### Challenges in Storing Time-Series Data

Storing time-series data comes with several challenges due to its unique characteristics. Some of these challenges include high volume, variable sampling rates, and the need for efficient querying and aggregation operations. Addressing these challenges requires specialized algorithms, data structures, and tools designed specifically for time-series data.

<a name="core-concepts-and-connections"></a>

## Core Concepts and Connections

### Basic Definitions

* **Time-Series Data:** A sequence of data points recorded over time, usually at uniform intervals.
* **Sampling Rate:** The number of data points collected per unit time.
* **Downsampling:** Reducing the number of data points in a time-series by averaging or selecting representative samples.
* **Quantization:** Representing continuous values using a finite set of discrete levels.
* **Lossless Compression:** Compressing data without losing any information.
* **Lossy Compression:** Compressing data by discarding some information, typically resulting in reduced precision or accuracy.

### Key Components in a Time-Series Data Storage System

* **Data Ingestion:** The process of collecting and storing incoming data streams.
* **Data Processing:** Performing computations on stored data, including downsampling, quantization, and compression.
* **Data Querying:** Retrieving specific portions of stored data based on user requests.
* **Data Indexing:** Organizing data for efficient retrieval and querying.

### Relationship Between Core Components

A typical time-series data storage system consists of the following components:

1. Data ingestion receives raw data streams and stores them in their original form.
2. Data processing applies various techniques such as downsampling, quantization, and compression to optimize storage usage and improve query performance.
3. Data querying retrieves specific subsets of data based on user requests, which often involve filtering, sorting, and aggregating operations.
4. Data indexing is used to speed up querying by organizing data in a way that allows for faster access and retrieval.

## Algorithmic Principles, Steps, and Mathematical Models

### Downsampling Algorithms Overview

Downsampling is a technique used to reduce the number of data points in a time-series while preserving its overall shape and trends. Common downsampling methods include:

* Average Downsampling
* Max/Min Downsampling
* Median Downsampling

### Commonly Used Downsampling Techniques

**Average Downsampling:** Calculate the average value between two consecutive data points and replace the original points with the calculated average. For example, given a time-series with a sampling rate of 1 second, average downsampling with a factor of 2 would result in a new time-series with a sampling rate of 2 seconds.

**Max/Min Downsampling:** Select either the maximum or minimum value between two consecutive data points. This method preserves extreme values but may lose some information about intermediate values.

**Median Downsampling:** Select the median value between two consecutive data points. This method provides a better representation of the central tendency compared to average downsampling and is more robust to outliers.

### Quantization and Lossy Compression Techniques

**Quantization:** Divide the range of possible values into a fixed number of discrete levels, assigning each level a unique integer code. This reduces the precision of the stored data but allows for more efficient storage and processing.

**Lossy Compression:** Discard some information from the original data, typically resulting in reduced precision or accuracy. Common lossy compression techniques for time-series data include delta encoding and differential pulse code modulation (DPCM).

### Mathematical Model for Time-Series Data Storage

The mathematical model for time-series data storage involves three primary steps:

1. Downsample the original time-series data to reduce the number of data points.
2. Apply quantization to represent continuous values using a finite set of discrete levels.
3. Compress the quantized data using lossless or lossy techniques to further optimize storage usage.

## Best Practices: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

### Python Implementation of Downsampling Algorithms

Here's an example implementation of average downsampling in Python:
```python
def average_downsample(data, factor):
   assert len(data) % factor == 0, "Data length must be divisible by the downsampling factor."
   downsampled = []
   for i in range(0, len(data), factor):
       avg = sum(data[i:i+factor]) / factor
       downsampled.append(avg)
   return downsampled
```
This function takes a list of data points and a downsampling factor as input and returns a new list containing the averaged data points.

### Optimizing Storage with Quantization and Lossy Compression

To implement quantization in Python, you can use the `numpy` library to map floating-point values to integer codes:
```python
import numpy as np

def quantize(data, num_levels=256):
   min_val = np.min(data)
   max_val = np.max(data)
   interval = (max_val - min_val) / num_levels
   return np.floor((data - min_val) / interval).astype(int)
```
This function maps the input data to integer codes ranging from 0 to `num_levels - 1`. To apply lossy compression, you can use the `differential_encode` function below, which implements delta encoding:
```python
def differential_encode(data):
   encoded = [data[0]]
   for i in range(1, len(data)):
       diff = data[i] - data[i-1]
       encoded.append(diff)
   return encoded
```

## Real-world Use Cases

### Monitoring Systems

Monitoring systems like Prometheus and Grafana rely heavily on time-series data to store and analyze metrics related to system performance, resource utilization, and application behavior. Efficient storage and processing techniques are crucial for real-time monitoring and alerting.
