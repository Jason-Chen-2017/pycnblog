## 1. Background Introduction

### 1.1 What is Computational Invariant Theory?

Computational Invariant Theory (CIT) is a branch of algebraic geometry and computational mathematics that focuses on the computation of invariants and equivariants for algebraic varieties and groups. It has wide applications in various fields such as computer graphics, robotics, physics, and engineering.

Invariant theory studies the symmetries of mathematical objects under the action of groups. An invariant is a function or quantity that remains unchanged under the group action. Equivariant is a generalization of invariant, which changes predictably under the group action. The study of invariants and equivariants provides insights into the structure and properties of mathematical objects, and has practical implications for solving problems in science and engineering.

With the advent of modern computers and algorithms, CIT has become a powerful tool for computing invariants and equivariants in a wide range of applications. This article introduces the basic concepts, algorithms, and applications of CIT, with a focus on its practical use in computer graphics and robotics.

### 1.2 Historical Overview

Invariant theory has a long history dating back to the work of French mathematician Évariste Galois in the early 19th century. However, the computational aspect of invariant theory only emerged in the late 20th century, with the development of efficient algorithms and software tools for computing invariants and equivariants.

The pioneering work of David Hilbert and his followers in the early 20th century established the theoretical foundations of invariant theory, but the computational aspects remained elusive until the advent of modern computers and algorithms. In the past few decades, there have been significant advances in CIT, including the development of efficient algorithms for computing invariants and equivariants, the design of user-friendly software tools, and the application of CIT to various fields such as computer graphics, robotics, physics, and engineering.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

### 2.1 Algebraic Varieties and Groups

An algebraic variety is a geometric object defined by polynomial equations in a finite-dimensional vector space over a field. For example, a line in the plane is an algebraic variety defined by the equation y = mx + b, where m and b are constants. A circle in the plane is another algebraic variety defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 = r^2, where r is the radius of the circle.

A group is a mathematical object consisting of elements and operations that satisfy certain axioms. Invariant theory deals with linear algebraic groups, which are subgroups of the general linear group GL(n,K), where n is the number of variables and K is the field. The most common groups in invariant theory are the special linear group SL(n,K), the orthogonal group O(n,K), and the symplectic group Sp(2n,K).

### 2.2 Invariants and Equivariants

An invariant is a function or quantity that remains unchanged under the group action. For example, the length of a line segment is an invariant under translation and rotation. The area of a circle is an invariant under similarity transformation.

An equivariant is a generalization of invariant, which changes predictably under the group action. For example, the position vector of a point in the plane is an equivariant under translation, which changes by adding a constant vector. The moment vector of a point in the plane is an equivariant under rotation, which changes by multiplying a rotation matrix.

### 2.3 Computational Invariant Theory

Computational Invariant Theory (CIT) is the branch of algebraic geometry and computational mathematics that focuses on the computation of invariants and equivariants for algebraic varieties and groups. The main goal of CIT is to develop efficient algorithms and software tools for computing invariants and equivariants in various applications.

CIT involves several key steps:

1. Define the algebraic variety and the group action.
2. Compute the generators of the ring of invariants or equivariants.
3. Compute the syzygies (relations) among the generators.
4. Compute the normal form of invariants or equivariants.
5. Apply the computed invariants or equivariants to solve practical problems.

These steps involve advanced techniques from algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, and computer algebra systems.

## 3. Core Algorithms and Operations

### 3.1 Ring of Invariants and Hilbert Series

The ring of invariants is the set of all polynomials in the variables that remain unchanged under the group action. The Hilbert series is a generating function that encodes the dimensions of the graded components of the ring of invariants. The Hilbert series can be computed using Molien's formula or other methods.

Once the Hilbert series is known, the generators of the ring of invariants can be computed using Gröbner basis methods or other methods. The generators form a minimal set of algebraically independent invariants that generate the whole ring of invariants.

### 3.2 Syzygies and Buchberger's Algorithm

A syzygy is a relation among the generators of the ring of invariants. The syzygies form a module, which can be computed using Buchberger's algorithm or other methods. Buchberger's algorithm is a general algorithm for computing Gröbner bases of modules, which can be used to compute the syzygies of the ring of invariants.

The syzygies provide important information about the structure and properties of the ring of invariants. They can be used to test whether two invariants are equal, to simplify expressions involving invariants, and to construct new invariants from old ones.

### 3.3 Normal Form and Finitely Generated Algebras

The normal form of an invariant is a unique representative of its equivalence class under the group action. The normal form can be computed using various methods, such as the Reynolds operator or the Fitting lemma.

Finitely generated algebras are algebras that can be generated by a finite set of elements. The normal form provides a way to decide whether two elements of a finitely generated algebra are equal modulo the ideal of relations. This is useful for testing whether two invariants are equal, and for simplifying expressions involving invariants.

## 4. Best Practices and Code Examples

### 4.1 Computing Invariants and Equivariants

Here is an example of how to compute the generators of the ring of invariants for the special linear group SL(2,C) acting on binary forms of degree d:
```python
import sympy as sp
from invariant_theory import *

# define the variables and the group action
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
G = SL(2,C)

# define the binary form
f = x**d + sp.factorial(d)*sp.binomial(d, 2)*x**(d-2)*y**2 + ...

# compute the generators of the ring of invariants
R = InvariantRing(G, f)
gen, rel = R.generators()
print("Generators:", gen)
```
This code defines the variables x and y, the group action of SL(2,C) on binary forms of degree d, and the binary form itself. It then computes the generators of the ring of invariants using the `InvariantRing` class from the `invariant_theory` package.

### 4.2 Testing Equality of Invariants

Here is an example of how to test whether two invariants are equal modulo the ideal of relations:
```makefile
from invariant_theory import *

# define the variables and the group action
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
G = SL(2,C)

# define the invariants
I = G.invariant('x^2*y^3 + y^5 - x^5*y')
J = G.invariant('x^2*y^3 + y^5 - x^3*y^2')

# compute the normal form of I and J
N = Ideal([I])
I_nf = N.normal_form(J)

# test whether I and J are equal modulo the ideal of relations
if I_nf == J:
   print("I and J are equal")
else:
   print("I and J are not equal")
```
This code defines the variables x and y, the group action of SL(2,C), and two invariants I and J. It then computes the normal form of I modulo the ideal generated by I and tests whether it is equal to J. If they are equal, the code prints "I and J are equal", otherwise it prints "I and J are not equal".

## 5. Applications in Computer Graphics and Robotics

### 5.1 Shape Matching and Recognition

Computational Invariant Theory (CIT) has been applied to shape matching and recognition in computer graphics and robotics. Given two shapes described by point clouds or meshes, CIT can be used to compute their invariants and equivariants under rigid motions or other transformations. These invariants and equivariants can be used to compare the shapes, identify similarities and differences, and recognize the same shape under different viewpoints or deformations.

### 5.2 Motion Planning and Control

CIT has also been applied to motion planning and control in robotics. Given a robot with multiple degrees of freedom, CIT can be used to compute the invariants and equivariants of its configuration space under various constraints and objectives. These invariants and equivariants can be used to generate feasible trajectories, optimize energy consumption, and ensure safety and stability.
