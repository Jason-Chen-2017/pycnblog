         ## 2.1 What is Test Automation?

         Test automation is a process that allows the testing of software by simulating user actions and system behaviors using automated scripts or tools. It helps in increasing efficiency, reducing errors, ensuring quality, and improving productivity through the use of scripts and tools to perform repetitive tasks automatically. 

         In simple terms, test automation involves writing code to simulate real-world scenarios such as navigating web pages, clicking buttons, filling forms and verifying results. The goal behind this is to reduce human error and increase overall test coverage. Automated tests can also be used for regression testing, which ensures that newly added features don’t break existing functionality.


         There are several different types of test automation:

         - Manual Testing: This involves carrying out tests manually on various platforms like desktop, mobile devices and tablets, which can become tedious and time-consuming after a certain period of time. 
         - System Testing: This includes testing an entire system to ensure it meets all requirements from the customer perspective. 
         - Integration Testing: Tests involve multiple applications working together to provide a seamless experience for users. 


         ## 2.2 Why Use Test Automation?

1. Improve Product Quality: The best way to improve product quality is by testing it before release. By automating testing processes, you can catch bugs early in the development cycle and fix them earlier than later.

2. Reduce Errors: One of the most common reasons why people choose not to automate their tests is that they have low confidence in the accuracy of the manual testing procedures. With test automation, you get more accurate results with less chance of making mistakes. 

3. Increase Speed: Automated testing reduces the amount of time it takes to run tests because there are fewer variables involved in the process. Additionally, there are no issues with changes made to the codebase since the last test was ran. 

4. Increase Coverage: When tests are automated, you can cover a wider range of cases, including edge cases and corner cases that may not have been considered during manual testing. This makes it easier to detect and address any potential problems.

## 2.3 Tools & Frameworks for Test Automation
There are many tools and frameworks available for implementing test automation strategies. Some popular ones include Selenium WebDriver, Appium, Cucumber, Robot Framework etc. Here we will look at some key tools commonly used for test automation:

### 2.3.1 Selenium WebDriver

Selenium WebDriver is one of the most widely used tool for test automation using the browser. It provides a programming interface for writing functional and end-to-end UI tests on web applications, mobile websites, and hybrid apps. The API supports several browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, Opera Mobile, Android Webview, iOS Native app, and RemoteWebDriver servers. It also has support for remote execution of tests on cloud services like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, and others.

Some of the main features of Selenium WebDriver include:

- Cross-platform compatibility: Selenium WebDriver works across different operating systems and browsers, allowing developers to write platform independent tests.
- Easy to learn: The learning curve for Selenium WebDriver is quite easy. It uses Java syntax and follows the object-oriented design pattern of Page Object Model. 
- Flexible usage: Selenium WebDriver is highly customizable and extensible, enabling developers to modify its behavior according to their specific needs.
- Support for modern languages: Selenium WebDriver has bindings for Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and JavaScript/TypeScript. Moreover, it offers support for other programming languages thanks to third-party libraries like webdriverio.

Here's how you can set up Selenium WebDriver in your project:

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.*;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;
import org.testng.annotations.*;

public class GoogleSearchTest {

    private WebDriver driver;
    private String baseUrl = "https://www.google.com";
    private String searchText = "test automation";
    
    @BeforeMethod
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        // Set chrome options to disable any popup windows
        ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
        options.addArguments("--disable-notifications");
        options.addArguments("--disable-infobars");
        
        // Initialize chromedriver and open google website
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/path/to/chromedriver");
        driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
        driver.get(baseUrl);
    }

    @AfterMethod
    public void tearDown() throws Exception {
        if (driver!= null) {
            driver.quit();
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testGoogleSearch() throws Exception {
        // Find search input box element using XPATH and enter search text 
        WebElement searchBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@title='Search']"));
        searchBox.sendKeys(searchText + Keys.ENTER);

        // Wait for page to load and assert title contains search text
        Thread.sleep(5000);
        Assert.assertTrue(driver.getTitle().contains(searchText));
    }
    
}
```

This example shows how to set up a basic test case using Selenium WebDriver. We first initialize the chromedriver and navigate to the Google homepage. Then, we find the search input box element using XPATH and type our desired keyword followed by Enter key. Finally, we wait for the page to load for five seconds and make sure the title of the loaded webpage contains the search text. If either of these conditions fails, then the assertion will fail and an exception will be raised.

If you want to configure more complex setup, such as running tests on remote machines, parallel execution or customized reporting formats, then you should refer to the official documentation provided by Selenium.

### 2.3.2 Appium

Appium is another popular framework used for automating native, hybrid, and mobile web apps on both iOS and Android platforms. It is built on top of Selenium WebDriver, so you can leverage the same powerful capabilities of the latter while adding additional features specifically designed for mobile app testing. It also integrates with third party plugins like Mocha for server-side testing or Jasmine for front-end testing.

One advantage of using Appium over Selenium WebDriver is that it provides access to advanced device-specific APIs beyond what WebDriver supports natively. For instance, with Appium, you can manipulate camera, GPS location, microphone, accelerometer, and other hardware components directly within the context of your tests. Another feature worth mentioning here is the ability to record and replay test sessions.

To get started with Appium, follow the installation instructions from the official site and install required dependencies. Once done, you can create your first test script as shown below:

```javascript
const wd = require('wd');
const chai = require('chai');
const expect = chai.expect;

describe('Sample App Test', function () {
  let driver;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Set Appium capabilities
    const caps = {
      platformName: 'iOS',
      platformVersion: '13.5',
      deviceName: 'iPhone Simulator',
      udid: '<UDID>', // Replace <UDID> with actual UDID of the simulator
      app: '/path/to/your/app.ipa' // Replace /path/to/your/app.ipa with actual path of the application file
    };

    // Create a new instance of WebDriver
    driver = await wd.promiseChainRemote({
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 4723
    });

    try {
      // Start the session and launch the app
      await driver.init(caps);

      // Click the login button
      const loginBtn = await driver.elementByXPath("//UIAApplication[1]/UIAWindow[1]/UIAButton[1]");
      await loginBtn.click();
      
      // Type email and password into respective fields
      const emailField = await driver.elementById("email");
      await emailField.clear();
      await emailField.setImmediateValue("<EMAIL>");
      const passField = await driver.elementById("password");
      await passField.clear();
      await passField.setImmediateValue("mysecretpassword!");

      // Tap on the submit button to sign in
      const submitBtn = await driver.elementById("submit");
      await submitBtn.tap();

      // Verify successful login
      const successMsg = await driver.elementByName("Success message");
      expect(await successMsg.text()).to.equal("Login Successful!");
    } finally {
      await driver.quit();
    }
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    console.log("Clean up step");
  });

  describe('#sampleFeature()', function () {
    it('should do something useful', async () => {
      // Add your test logic here...
    });
  });
  
  // More test cases go here...
  
});
```

This example demonstrates how to create a sample test suite using Appium. We start by setting the necessary capabilities for the iOS simulator. We then connect to the Appium server and initialize a new session. Next, we locate the elements corresponding to the login button, username field, password field, and submit button using XPATH expressions and tap on each of them accordingly. After that, we clear and fill the form inputs with valid credentials. Finally, we check whether a success message appears indicating a successful login.

Note that we have used the chai library to add assertions to verify the expected outcomes of our tests. Also note that the `finally` block is used to quit the driver even if an unexpected error occurs during the test execution.

Overall, Appium is a great choice when it comes to building mobile app tests as it provides access to sophisticated device management functions and integration with other testing tools. However, keep in mind that it requires specialized knowledge about the target app's architecture, layout, and user interactions to successfully write robust tests.
