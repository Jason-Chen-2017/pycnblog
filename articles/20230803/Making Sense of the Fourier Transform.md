         The Fourier transform is a central concept in signal processing and has applications in various fields such as audio, image processing, data compression, bioinformatics, medical imaging, seismic analysis etc. In this article we will cover what is the fourier transform, its properties, and how to apply it effectively for digital signal processing tasks.

         ## 2.1.Fourier transform

         Let's start by defining what is the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform (FT) is a mathematical operation that transforms a function from time-domain into frequency domain, or vice versa. It can be defined as:

         $$ F(u)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-j2\pi ut}\,dt $$ where $f$ is an input function in time-domain, $\hat{f}$ denotes the corresponding output function in frequency domain, and $u$ is the independent variable representing the frequency.


         The FT converts a function from one representation of space (time) to another (frequency). This means that if you have a sinusoidal wave at different frequencies ($x_i$), then applying the FT would result in a spectrum of their amplitudes ($|F(u)|$) as shown below. 


         

         As we can see from the above diagram, the area under each curve represents the amplitude of the corresponding frequency component. So, when we analyze signals using the Fourier transform, we end up with a set of curves instead of just one plot like we get when we analyze them on a graph.  


         We also need to understand some terminology before moving further.

          - **Real-valued function:** A real-valued function is a function whose values are either positive or negative reals numbers. For example, $(-3+4i)$ and $2$, $1+i$, and $e^{i\pi/2}$, are all examples of real-valued functions.

           - **Complex conjugate:** For any complex number $z=a+bi$, its complex conjugate is denoted as $a-bi$.

            - **Fourier pair:** Two functions $f$ and $\hat{f}$ are said to be Fourier pairs if they satisfy following relation:

              $$\forall u \in \mathbb{R},\{f(t),\,\hat{f}(u)\}=\delta(t-u)$$

               Where $\delta(\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function. Hence, a sequence of samples $\{(f_n)\}_{n=1}^{N}$ can be transformed into its corresponding frequency components $\{\hat{f}_k\}_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}$ using the Fourier transform, which gives us the vector form:

               
               $$\mathcal{F}\{f_n\}=[\hat{f}_1,\,\hat{f}_2,\dots,\hat{f}_K]$$
               

             And visa versa, given the vector $\{f_m\}_{m=1}^{M}$, we can recover its original form in the time domain using inverse Fourier transformation:
             
             $$\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{[\hat{f}_1,\,\hat{f}_2,\dots,\hat{f}_K]\}=[f_1,\,\f_2,\dots,\f_M]$$
             
             Here K represents the total number of frequency bins used during the FFT computation.

         ## 2.2.Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

        DFT is the most basic algorithm for computing the discrete Fourier transform of a finite length input signal. The DFT is based on the fact that any signal can be represented as a sum of sine waves of varying frequencies, phase shifts, and amplitudes. Therefore, we can separate the signal into these constituent parts and compute the frequency domain separately for each of these parts. Once we know the amplitudes of each part, we combine them back together to obtain the complete frequency spectrum of the entire signal.


        To implement the DFT, we use the following steps:
        
        1. Define the window size M and choose the required sampling rate fs.
        2. Create a table of sample indices n={0...M-1}.
        3. For each index n, calculate the value of t=n/fs and store it along with x[n].
        4. Multiply the value of e^(-j2pi un) for each sample index n and add them to the table.
        5. Take the dot product of each row in the resulting matrix with the vector containing the values of x[n]. The i-th element of the resulting vector contains the value of the DFT at frequency bin k=i.
        6. Normalize the resulting vector by dividing it by N=M, where N is the total number of points in the signal.
 
        Finally, we obtain the DFT of the signal as follows:
        
        $$\mathcal{F}\{x[n]\}=X[k]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-jk2\pi/(N)}$$
        
        Where X[k] is the vector containing the values of the DFT at frequency bin k=0 through k=N-1.

     
        However, there are several drawbacks of the DFT algorithm, including its slowness and limited accuracy due to discretization error. More advanced algorithms like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) address these issues and provide efficient implementations for both forward and backward transformations.

        
     
     ## 2.3.Properties of the Fourier transform

     Before we go ahead with implementing the actual code, let’s look at some important properties of the Fourier transform.

    ### Property 1: Linearity of the Fourier transform
    
     The Fourier transform satisfies the property of linearity, meaning that multiplying two signals together is equivalent to adding their spectra pointwise. That is, 
    
     $$ (\mathcal{F}\{a_1x_1 + a_2x_2\})(u) = \mathcal{F}\{ax_1\}(u) + \mathcal{F}\{ax_2\}(u)$$ 
     
    ### Property 2: Parseval's theorem
    
    One more important property of the Fourier transform is Parseval's theorem, which states that the squared magnitude of the input signal does not change when it goes through the Fourier transform. That is, 
    
    $$\mathrm{Tr}[|f_x(t)|^2] = \mathrm{Tr}[|X_k|^2]$$
    
    The first equality holds because the absolute value of the DFT is always non-negative. The second equation holds because the square of the value at frequency bin k equals the sum of squares of all the points multiplied by the coefficient of e^(j(2\pi kn)/N), which is proportional to the power of the signal at that particular frequency.
    

                   ### 2.4.Implementing the Fourier transform algorithm
                    
                      Now let’s put everything into perspective by implementing the Fourier transform algorithm ourselves.<|im_sep|>
