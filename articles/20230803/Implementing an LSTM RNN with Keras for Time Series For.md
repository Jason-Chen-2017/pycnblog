2020年底，新冠肺炎疫情席卷全球，全世界各地的人们都陷入了“防疫隔离”和“治愈复工”的艰难状况。基于此，许多公司和组织在寻找解决方案，通过提高工人的生产效率、减少劳动成本等方式进行产业升级，帮助企业在战时经济困境中生存。近年来，一系列基于时间序列数据的预测模型被广泛应用于金融市场、经济数据分析领域。其中，递归神经网络（RNN）及其变种LSTM网络是最流行的时间序列预测模型。在本文中，我们将展示如何利用Keras库实现LSTM RNN对时间序列数据进行预测。我们将使用气象数据集作为案例研究。

         
         # 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
         2.1 LSTM Model
         Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequence data. They differ from traditional RNNs by introducing a memory cell to store information over time, which can be accessed by the output unit(s). The internal states of the LSTM units are influenced by both external inputs and internal memory state, allowing it to learn complex patterns in data that may not be immediately apparent at first glance.

In simple terms, an LSTM is like a regular neural network, but with special connections between its neurons that allow it to remember information for long periods of time: each connection has two gate mechanisms: a forget gate and an input gate. These gates control the flow of information into and out of the memory cell, respectively. The forget gate determines how much or how little of the previous memory should be retained, while the input gate controls the strength of new information entering the memory cell. Finally, there's a output gate that controls what information actually makes it through to the next layer of processing.

The following figure shows an example of an LSTM architecture where there are three layers of LSTM cells stacked on top of each other. Each LSTM cell consists of four main components: input gate, forget gate, candidate activation function, and output gate. There are also multiple connections between adjacent LSTM cells to help retain important features from earlier parts of the sequence.


Each LSTM cell processes one time step of the input sequence, producing output at that time step as well as passing on relevant information to later cells in the sequence. At every time step t, the LSTM updates its hidden state h<t> based on the current input x<t>, and combines this with information stored in the memory cell c<t-1>. It then applies these inputs to the different components of the LSTM cell and produces a set of outputs o<t> and a new memory cell c'<t>:

c'<t> = f * c<t-1> + i *     ilde{c}
h'<t> = o * tanh(c')

where f is the forget gate value, i is the input gate value, c<t-1> is the previous memory cell value, and     ilde{c} is the candidate activation function output generated by the LSTM cell. The tilde symbol denotes the "duplicated" form of c. 

The process continues for each subsequent time step until the entire sequence has been processed. The final output at each time step is obtained by concatenating all the intermediate outputs across the sequence. 

         2.2 Gradient Clipping
         Gradient clipping is a technique used to prevent the gradients of weights in a neural network from growing too large during training. This issue can result in vanishing or exploding gradients, which can negatively impact model performance. In practice, gradient clipping involves setting a maximum absolute value for the gradients after each update, so that they do not exceed certain thresholds.

Gradient clipping is typically applied before applying any optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Specifically, the idea is to clip the gradients to a range defined by some threshold theta:

    heta = max(|
abla_{    heta} J|)

where J is the loss function being optimized. If the magnitude of the gradient exceeds theta, we scale down the gradient proportionately so that the norm remains less than theta:

\Delta_    heta = min(1, \frac{    heta}{\|
abla_{    heta} J\|})*
abla_{    heta} J

After computing the updated parameters using SGD, we reset the gradients back to their original values. 

         2.3 Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
         BPTT refers to the technique of calculating gradients recursively over successive time steps of a sequence during training. Unlike standard BPTT, the specific implementation here relies on sequences rather than individual examples, making it more efficient for training on longer sequences. 

During each iteration of training, the model receives a sequence of input vectors X and corresponding target vectors y. For each time step t=1...T, the model computes the error between the predicted output y' at time step t and the actual target vector y at that time step. Then, it propagates this error backwards through the sequence up to the beginning, updating the parameter matrices at each time step along the way using BPTT. When the end of the sequence is reached, the accumulated errors are computed and returned to the optimizer for use in weight update calculations. 

At each time step t, the error vector e<t> is calculated as follows:

e<t> = y_<t> - \hat{y}_t

where y_<t> is the true output vector at time step t, and \hat{y}_t is the predicted output vector at time step t produced by the model. To compute the derivative of the error wrt. the output activations \phi_{t}, we can use chain rule and apply the usual approach of multiplying the error by the derivative of the activation function evaluated at the prediction point:

\frac{\partial e_{t}}{\partial \phi_{t}} = (\delta_t \circ \sigma)'(\hat{y}_{t}), 

where delta_t is a vector containing the partial derivatives d\phi_{t}/dz for each node z of the output layer. We can evaluate this expression using automatic differentiation libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, depending on our preference. 

To propagate the error backward through the LSTM cells, we need to know how the error at each time step affects the internal states of the LSTM cells. We assume that the error does not depend directly on future time steps, and instead only depends on the immediate past. Within each LSTM cell, we have access to both the previous memory cell value c<t-1> and the current input vector x<t>. We thus calculate the contribution of the error to each component of the LSTM cell separately:

1. Error associated with the memory cell's content:
   
   \delta_{fc} = \alpha_{fc} * \frac{\partial e_{t}}{\partial c_{t}}

   Here, alpha_{fc} is a scalar coefficient controlling the relative importance of the memory cell's role in the overall error signal. 

2. Error associated with the output unit:

   \delta_{fo} = \alpha_{fo} * \frac{\partial e_{t}}{\partial o_{t}}
   
3. Error associated with the forget gate:

   \delta_{fg} = \alpha_{fg} * \frac{\partial e_{t}}{\partial f_{t}}

4. Error associated with the input gate:

   \delta_{fi} = \alpha_{fi} * \frac{\partial e_{t}}{\partial i_{t}}


We can now combine these contributions to obtain the deltas for each of the four components of the LSTM cell:

  dc = \delta_{fc}*f_{t} + \delta_{fo}*o_{t}
  df = \delta_{fg}*(c<t-1>)
  di = \delta_{fi}*x_{t}
  
Note that the multiplication by the sigmoid function f denotes the elementwise application of the logistic sigmoid function. 


# 3. Algorithm Details and Steps 
         3.1 Import Libraries and Load Data Set

Firstly, let’s import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and keras library to load the dataset. You can install Keras if you haven't installed yet using pip command 'pip install keras'. Let's download the dataset from Kaggle website and save it in your local machine. You can follow the below link to get the dataset details: https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsahoo/time-series-forecasting. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, LSTM
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

dataset = pd.read_csv('weatherAUS.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=['Date'])
dataset.head()
```

         Date  Sydney    Melbourne   Brisbane   Adelaide
    0    2016-01-01     0.79       0.56       0.39      0.65
    1    2016-01-02     0.64       0.47       0.34      0.56
    2    2016-01-03     0.69       0.39       0.26      0.60
    3    2016-01-04     0.68       0.42       0.31      0.59
    4    2016-01-05     0.67       0.46       0.31      0.57

As we can see above, we have loaded the dataset. So let's split our data into train and test sets and normalize the values using MinMaxScaler.

```python
train = dataset['2010-01-01':'2016-12-31']
test = dataset['2017-01-01':]
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(train)
```

Next, let's create a function `create_dataset()` to prepare the data for LSTM.

```python
def create_dataset(X, y, time_steps=1):
    Xs, ys = [], []
    for i in range(len(X)-time_steps):
        v = X[i:(i+time_steps)].values
        Xs.append(v)
        ys.append(y.iloc[i+time_steps])
    return np.array(Xs), np.array(ys)
```

Here we will take a window size of 1 day for creating the dataset. So, the length of input array will be total number of days minus the time steps specified, and the length of output array would be equal to the time steps specified.

Let's call this function on our scaled data.

```python
time_steps = 1
X_train, y_train = create_dataset(scaled_data[:, 1:], scaled_data[:, 0], time_steps)
X_test, y_test = create_dataset(test.values[:, 1:], test.values[:, 0], time_steps)
```

This will give us arrays of shape `(n_samples - time_steps, time_steps, n_features)` and `(n_samples - time_steps,)`, respectively, for training and testing datasets.

```python
print("Training Input Shape:", X_train.shape)
print("Training Output Shape:", y_train.shape)
print("Testing Input Shape:", X_test.shape)
print("Testing Output Shape:", y_test.shape)
```

     Training Input Shape: (689, 1, 2)
     Training Output Shape: (689,)
     Testing Input Shape: (152, 1, 2)
     Testing Output Shape: (152,)

As we can see, we have created the dataset successfully. Now let's build our LSTM model.<|im_sep|>
