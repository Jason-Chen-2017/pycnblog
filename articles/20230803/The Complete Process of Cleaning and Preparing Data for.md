 Data is essential in the modern world where AI and machine learning has a significant impact on all aspects of our lives from finance to healthcare and transportation. Therefore, it’s crucial that we clean and prepare data before applying machine learning algorithms. In this article, we will go through each step involved in cleaning and preparing data using popular libraries like pandas and NumPy in python. Finally, we will apply various methods and algorithms to handle missing values and outliers in the dataset to get better results in prediction models.

         This article aims at providing comprehensive guidance towards handling dirty datasets for building accurate and reliable machine learning models. By following the steps mentioned below, you can expect to achieve high-quality predictions with appropriate insights. We have worked on multiple real-world datasets including bank marketing, customer churn analysis, medical diagnosis, traffic prediction, etc., and found that the approach provided here can help in reducing model errors and improving accuracy of predictive models.

         Our goal as authors is to provide you with an easy-to-understand guideline that helps you avoid common pitfalls while working with real-world datasets. We believe that by being proactive about identifying and correcting issues, you can greatly improve your quality of life as a machine learning practitioner. Let's dive into it!

         # 2.Basic Concepts and Terminologies
         Before jumping into the main part of this article, let us first understand some basic concepts related to data preparation which are important to follow throughout:

         ## 2.1 Missing Values
         A dataset usually contains missing values, which do not carry enough information for certain calculations. These values need to be removed so that the remaining data can be used effectively for modeling purposes. Some commonly seen types of missing value include:

            - Null/NaN
            - Zeroes
            - Blank spaces
            - Outliers

        ## 2.2 Outliers
        An outlier refers to a data point that lies outside the overall distribution of data points. It might cause problems when training a machine learning algorithm because these outlying data points can skew the result and lead to poor performance. Common causes of outliers include measurement errors, incorrect input data, or extreme events occurring in the data collection process. To remove outliers from the dataset, one approach is to use statistical techniques such as Z-score normalization or IQR (interquartile range) methodology.

        ## 2.3 Normalization vs Standardization
        There are two standardization techniques that differ slightly in their scaling factor. Both techniques scale the features between 0 and 1:
        
        ### Standardization
        Mean removal and scaling: Subtract the mean of the feature and divide by its standard deviation.
        
        ### Min-max Scaling
        Feature scaling between minimum and maximum values: Scale the range of the feature values between 0 and 1. Formula: new_value = (old_value – min)/(max–min)


        # 3.Cleaning Steps For Machine Learning
        Now that we have understood what exactly are missing values and outliers, let's discuss how to handle them during data cleaning stage:

        ## 3.1 Handling Missing Values
        Firstly, we identify the percentage of missing values present in the dataset. If it’s above a certain threshold, then we need to decide whether to replace the missing values with zeros or drop those rows altogether. Depending on the nature of the problem, zero replacement could introduce bias but could also help build more accurate models if there aren’t too many missing values. On the other hand, dropping the rows would significantly reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

        Next, we perform imputation based on the type of variable. Imputation involves replacing the missing values with estimated values based on the available data. Two commonly used techniques for numerical variables are mean substitution and median substitution. For categorical variables, mode substitution can be applied. However, it’s recommended to compare different imputation techniques and select the most suitable technique based on the characteristics of the dataset.

        Lastly, once we have handled the missing values, we need to check if the remaining data is still complete i.e., no row or column should contain only missing values. Also, we should verify the consistency and completeness of the dataset after removing the missing values. We can also analyze the correlation between the missing variables to detect redundant columns and choose to delete them. 

        ## 3.2 Handling Outliers
        Detecting outliers in the dataset requires exploratory data analysis techniques. Here, we look for unusual observations that deviate significantly from the norm. Once identified, we may consider either rejecting the observation or modifying it depending on the severity of the issue. One possible way to identify outliers is to use box plots and z-scores. Box plots show the quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3), interquartile range (IQR), and extremes of the data set. Any observation beyond the upper whisker or lower whisker is considered an outlier. The smaller the z-score, the less likely the observation is an outlier. Another approach is to use robust scaler instead of standardization which makes it less sensitive to outliers than standardization. RobustScaler subtracts the median and scales the data according to the interquartile range (IQR) of the data.

        After detecting and handling outliers, we need to validate the cleaned dataset again to ensure that they don't affect the accuracy of the final model. Specifically, we should ensure that the number of samples, features, and labels match and that the relationships among the variables remain consistent.

        ## 3.3 Combining Multiple Datasets
        When dealing with large datasets, combining multiple datasets can significantly increase the size of the dataset and help in getting more insightful results. There are several ways to combine multiple datasets including vertical concatenation, horizontal concatenation, and merge operations. Vertical concatenation involves merging two datasets horizontally alongside each other. Horizontal concatenation involves merging two datasets vertically together. Merge operation involves joining two datasets based on shared attributes. However, it’s recommended to carefully evaluate the benefits of each combination strategy and pick the best option based on the size and complexity of the dataset.
