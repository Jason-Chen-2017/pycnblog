# 1.简介
         

        Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular field of research due to its ability to learn complex decision policies from large amounts of data without supervised training. However, the current implementations are highly single-threaded, which can lead to slow training times for high-dimensional environments or long episode lengths that require multiple iterations over the same environment. To address this problem, several parallel techniques have been proposed, such as asynchronous actor-critic architecture, distributed parallelism, and proximal policy optimization (PPO). In this article, we will discuss how these parallel techniques can be used to accelerate deep reinforcement learning training by reducing the time required to train models on larger environments. We will also provide an open source implementation using Pytorch library for DRL applications based on these techniques.

         ## 2.1 Asynchronous Actor-Critic Architecture (A3C) 
        The A3C algorithm is one of the most widely used methods for deep RL training in games like Atari. It uses multiple threads to run multiple instances of an agent concurrently, which allows it to perform better exploration than other algorithms with a shared experience replay buffer because each thread works independently while sharing their learned parameters through gradients updates.
 
        One drawback of the A3C algorithm is that the centralized critic network can get stuck in local minima, making it difficult to converge efficiently. Therefore, another approach was proposed, namely the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) algorithm, where the critic network is decoupled from the actor networks. This means that during training, each agent only interacts with its own environment, allowing them to explore independently without interfering with others’ experiences. 

        ## 2.2 Distributed Parallelism
        There are different ways of distributing work across multiple nodes in a cluster for parallelizing computing tasks. Some common approaches include data parallelism, model parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and hyperparameter tuning.

        Data parallelism refers to dividing the input data into smaller subsets, processing each subset separately, and then aggregating the results. Model parallelism involves splitting a single model into multiple parts and running them simultaneously on different devices. Pipeline parallelism breaks down computation into smaller steps and runs them sequentially on different devices, improving the utilization of GPU resources. Hyperparameter tuning involves optimizing the hyperparameters of a model using multiple machines in parallel, providing more efficient use of available computational resources.

        For deep reinforcement learning (DRL), some common strategies for achieving scalability involve parallel execution of the agents, distribution of rollout trajectories, and multi-GPU training. 

	## 2.3 PPO
    PPO is a gradient-based method for solving reinforcement learning problems that requires minimal changes to standard DRL algorithms. It uses a penalty term in the objective function to prevent the new policy from significantly diverging from the old one. 

    Another improvement made to PPO is introducing clipped surrogate objectives, which allow the policy update step to take place even when the KL divergence between the new and old policies becomes very large.

    Finally, one key technique introduced in recent years to improve performance of DRL models is batch normalization, which helps to stabilize the learning process and speed up convergence. Batch normalization makes it easier for the model to identify patterns in the input data and regularizes the output of intermediate layers, which can help to avoid exploding or vanishing gradients.
