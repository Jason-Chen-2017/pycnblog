        ## 1. Introduction
        
        A model is an essential element of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that predicts or classifies inputs into categories or outputs decisions. The accuracy and effectiveness of a machine learning model often depends on its explanability. Explanations play an important role in trusting the output of models. Despite their importance, it remains challenging for developers to create reliable, explainable, and fair model explanations.

        With the advancements in deep neural networks, model interpretability techniques have emerged as powerful tools for explaining predictions from complex black-box models. However, building explainable models has become more difficult due to several challenges such as choosing the right explanation technique, selecting features, optimizing attribution scores, and ensuring fidelity and robustness. In this article, we will discuss how to build effective and efficient model explanations with emphasis on:

        1. Understanding the different types of explanations used in AI system development
        2. Choosing appropriate methods and parameters for creating explainable models
        3. Optimizing attributions to ensure robustness and fidelity
        4. Ensuring explainability through user input validation and handling edge cases
        5. Validating and improving explainability results using practical use-cases
        6. Handling errors and exceptions when deploying models with explanations
          
        ## 2. Types of Explanation Techniques
        
        There are various types of explanation techniques used in AI system development. Some popular ones include:
        
        1. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME): This method generates local feature importances by perturbing individual input instances and measuring changes in predicted outcomes. LIME can be applied to both classification and regression tasks.
        2. Integrated Gradient: This method assigns weights to each feature based on its contribution towards increasing the prediction score. It also provides detailed visualizations of the feature influence on the outcome.
        3. Shapley Values: This method considers all possible coalitions of input features and calculates the marginal contributions of each feature to the final outcome. SHAP values can provide global understanding of the impact of each feature on the overall prediction score.
        4. Surrogate Models: These are models trained on training data but whose decision boundary does not match the actual model's behavior. By comparing surrogate model predictions with true labels, we can identify which features contribute most to the difference between them.
        5. Partial Dependence Plots: This plot shows the relationship between the target variable and a set of selected features for each point in the input space. Each partial dependence plot represents the marginal effect one or two features have on the target variable.
        6. GradCam: This method applies a convolutional filter to the last layer of the DNN to visualize the regions within the image that contributed most to the prediction.
        
        Depending on the type of problem and data, some of these techniques may work better than others. For instance, if the task involves many categorical variables, using shapley value approach could give more accurate explanations compared to lime or integrated gradient approaches. Similarly, if there are noisy or inconsistent data points, using LIME could lead to better explanations over other techniques. On the other hand, gradcam can provide insights only for computer vision applications while SHAP values can be helpful in tabular datasets.
    
        ## 3. Challenges Faced While Building Explainable Models
        
        To develop explainable models, several challenges need to be addressed including:
        
        1. Data sparsity: Most datasets contain multiple features that do not affect the outcome significantly. Removing those irrelevant features reduces the complexity of the dataset and improves efficiency in training the model.
        2. Overfitting: If the model learns too closely to the training data, it becomes biased and fails to generalize well to new examples. Regularization techniques like Lasso/Ridge regression, early stopping, and batch normalization help avoid overfitting.
        3. Non-convex optimization: Many explanation techniques rely on non-convex optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent. Random restarts and other heuristic strategies improve convergence rates and stability.
        4. Unbiased Attributions: Calculating attributions without bias requires adding random noise to prevent any single feature dominating the result. Importance sampling can further reduce variance in attributions.
        5. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features can greatly enhance the interpretability of the model. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and autoencoders can capture important patterns in the data.
        6. User Input Validation: When deployed in real-world systems, users should validate the input data to ensure that they conform to the expected format and constraints. Error handling code needs to be incorporated to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
        7. Edge Cases: Understanding and handling edge cases can sometimes be critical during the deployment phase. Certain combinations of inputs might cause numerical instabilities or null pointers. 
        8. Monitoring Metrics: Since explainability directly affects the performance of the model, monitoring metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score are crucial for detecting abnormal behaviors.
        
        ## 4. How Do We Optimize Attributions for Robustness and Fidelity?
        
        Once we understand the underlying mechanism behind each explanation technique, we must optimize the attributions generated for robustness and fidelity. Attributions represent the magnitude and direction of the impact of each feature on the outcome. Hence, good attribution methods should produce attributes that correctly reflect the contribution of each feature to the overall prediction score. Let’s go through the steps involved in optimizing attributions:
        
        1. Positive Attribution Optimization: Positive attributions indicate positive impact on the prediction score. Therefore, we want to select features that increase the prediction score instead of decreasing it. Negative attributions suggest negative impact on the prediction score and hence, we try to minimize the absolute value of negative attributions. One way to achieve this is to penalize negative attributions during the loss function calculation.
        2. Robustness: Outliers can strongly affect the interpretation of the model’s predictions. To address this issue, we can apply smoothing techniques like moving average smoothing, exponential decay, or boxcox transformation. These methods smooth out the attributions across different input instances to remove any unusual variations. Another option is to train a separate model to estimate uncertainties associated with the attributions. This uncertainty estimation can be useful for identifying outlier cases where the model makes poor predictions.
        3. Sampling Strategy: As discussed earlier, calculating attributions without bias requires adding random noise to prevent any single feature dominating the result. However, this strategy can introduce bias even after removing correlated features. To counteract this, we can use importance sampling to randomly sample examples from the dataset based on their similarity to the current example. This helps to balance the representation power of all features and ensures unbiased attributions.
        
        ## 5. How Can We Ensure Explainability Through User Input Validation and Handling Errors?
        
        Deployment of explainable models in production systems poses additional concerns related to security and reliability. Therefore, it is crucial to validate user input data and ensure proper error handling. Here are some ways to perform input validation and error handling:
        
        1. Type Checking and Constraints: Before processing any input, make sure that it conforms to the expected format and satisfies certain constraints. Type checking helps catch common programming mistakes, whereas constraints enforce rules that cannot be violated without causing errors. Examples of constraints include minimum length, maximum value range, allowed characters, etc.
        2. Output Limitation: Analyze the sensitivity of the model to small changes in input. Set limits on the number of decimal places returned by the model, or specify the range of allowable outputs. Also consider setting thresholds on the size of explanations produced so that the output stays within reasonable bounds.
        3. Graceful Error Handling: During deployment, handle unexpected inputs and internal errors gracefully. Provide clear error messages, return HTTP status codes, or log error details. Make sure to monitor the health of the service regularly and take corrective action if necessary.
        
        ## 6. Final Thoughts
        
        Building explainable models requires careful consideration of the design choices, algorithmic implementation, hyperparameter tuning, and testing. Although achieving high levels of accuracy and interoperability is a key goal, developing explainable models remains a long-term challenge. It is essential to carefully evaluate and test the effects of your explanations before putting them into production.
