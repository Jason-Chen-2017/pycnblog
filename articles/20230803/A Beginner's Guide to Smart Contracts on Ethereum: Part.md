# 2. Basic Concept and Terminology
## 2.1 What is a smart contract? Why do we need it?
A smart contract is an agreement or transaction that can be executed automatically on a blockchain without intervention by a third party. In other words, it is a programmed code that defines the rules for carrying out financial transactions between two or more parties based on certain conditions. 

The main purpose of smart contracts is to automate business processes. They eliminate the need for humans to manually perform repetitive tasks, such as managing accounting records or issuing invoices. This makes them useful in reducing costs, improving efficiency, and enhancing transparency across businesses.

There are several types of smart contracts used in various industries, including financial services (e.g., insurance), governance (e.g., voting systems), goods and services (e.g., logistics networks) and even real-estate (e.g., property titles). Most notably, they have become increasingly popular with cryptocurrency users who value convenience, speed and cost savings over traditional banking systems. However, they also face new security threats from hackers, fraudulent activity and unintended consequences. Therefore, proper use and education are critical for their widespread adoption.

Another important aspect to consider when working with smart contracts is that they are essentially decentralized ledgers that store digital assets like currency and equities. As a result, they may not always behave as expected due to network errors, malicious actors or technical issues. To mitigate these risks, it’s essential to validate smart contracts thoroughly before deployment. Moreover, careful management of keys is required to ensure security throughout the lifecycle of the contract.

In summary, smart contracts offer significant benefits for organizations seeking to reduce costs, improve productivity, enhance trust, increase customer engagement, and ultimately save time and effort. By leveraging smart contract technology, organizations can unlock new revenue streams and build bridges to existing markets. Thus, the development of smart contracts has gained immense momentum in recent years and will continue to grow in popularity as more people begin to appreciate its potential benefits.
