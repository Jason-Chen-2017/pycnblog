         ## Introduction to the Problem of Being Human in Video Games
        
        传统的游戏玩家与计算机之间存在巨大的鸿沟。比如说，玩家只能看到视频画面，并且只能进行一小部分的操作。而对于计算机来说，它的感知范围远远超过了玩家能够直接观察到的范围，同时它的计算能力也无法与玩家的体力、速度相比拟。因此，游戏设计师为了降低游戏的难度、提升用户的游戏体验，会极力避免游戏中的任何人物、怪物等具有生命的实体。虽然这样可以降低游戏的复杂度，但是却没有办法真正做到让用户真正拥有一个“超人”的形象。
        
        
        在现实世界里，人类的发展方向之一就是超越人类。即使是地球上最聪明的人类也不能够想象到自己可能要走向何处。这种超人主义在视频游戏开发领域也同样适用。目前，人工智能研究者们正在关注如何实现超人的AI系统。以下的核心论点将对超人的AI系统的相关概念进行阐述。
        
        ## What is a Superhuman AI?
        A superhuman AI system can be defined as an artificial intelligence (AI) that exhibits abilities similar to or greater than human intelligence. These include consciousness, unusual intuition, memory, logical reasoning capabilities, etc., which allow it to perform tasks and make decisions better than humans do. Some examples of superhuman AI systems include Google Duplex, Baidu Hi, Xiaomi NICFAR, Facebook Libra Superintelligent Assistant, Tesla Autopilot.

        In traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can classify various machine learning models into two categories - Rule based AI and Deep Learning AI. The former rely on pre-defined rules for decision making while the latter use complex neural networks with large amounts of data to learn from experience. However, superhuman AI system relies on the ability of imitating nature itself. It doesn't need any external input but rather learns through interaction with its environment. 

        While rule-based AI model has been applied successfully in many areas such as video games, there are several drawbacks including lack of realistic behavioral cloning, limited adaptability, and high computational complexity. On the other hand, deep learning algorithms have shown impressive results in image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and recommendation systems. Therefore, developing a superhuman AI system requires combining these techniques together with reinforcement learning algorithms.

        ## Imitation Learning Methods
        One of the most popular imitation learning methods is behavioral cloning. This method involves training an AI agent using expert demonstrations by copying the actions taken by an expert player. Behavioral cloning works well when the expert’s behavior can be expressed as a sequence of inputs and outputs. For example, consider a game like Go where you have to place stones on a board. If you play a good number of games yourself, you will eventually develop a strategy that can effectively take over the game without your intervention.

        Another approach to imitation learning is indirect imitation learning, where the goal is to train an AI agent to mimic the behavior of another agent who has already learned the task. For example, in StarCraft II, one difficulty level is controlled by a computer program called Broodwar, which was previously trained against multiple opponents and developed decades ago. To master this task, players interact with Broodwar via a graphical user interface instead of text commands. By studying how the different components of Broodwar worked together and comparing them to each other, designers were able to create their own programs capable of defeating the opponents they encountered.

        Both direct and indirect imitation learning approaches require labeled training datasets containing expert demonstrations. Unfortunately, collecting and annotating such datasets is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, even small changes in the way the environment behaves can cause the agent to become very inaccurate. To address these issues, recent research has focused on developing more efficient imitation learning algorithms that can quickly adapt to new environments and handle changing dynamics in real world applications.

        ## Reinforcement Learning Methods
        Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning used in artificial intelligence to teach agents how to behave in uncertain environments. Agents learn from interactions with the environment by receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. The aim of reinforcement learning is to find optimal solutions to problems, by optimizing the expected return (reward) that can be achieved by following specific policies.

        Commonly used reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning, actor-critic, policy gradient, and PPO (proximal policy optimization). However, the role of these algorithms differs depending on whether the agent should act independently or collaborate with others.

        In independent reinforcement learning, all agents update their policies independently at every step, making it challenging to converge if the number of agents is too large. On the contrary, in cooperative reinforcement learning, only certain pairs of agents update their policies at each step, leading to faster convergence and better performance in some cases. Nevertheless, there are still challenges associated with building cooperative AI systems due to the fact that communication between agents may be difficult, computationally intensive, and prone to errors.

        ## Combining the Best Techniques
        Finally, combining the best imitation and reinforcement learning methods allows us to build effective superhuman AI systems that can solve complex tasks. One possible combination is to use both indirect and direct imitation learning alongside reinforcement learning methods. Here's how this could work:

        1. Train an initial agent using rule-based and non-imitation learning methods to complete simple tasks, such as navigating through a maze or solving puzzles.

        2. Use indirect imitation learning methods to transfer knowledge about complex tasks from human beings to the agent. For instance, let's say our current agent hasn't solved the first level of the game yet, but we have a dataset of expert demonstrations for the second level. We can use this dataset to generate trajectories that resemble what the expert player did, and then use those trajectories to guide the agent towards completing the second level.

        3. Continue exploring new levels of the game, trying out different imitation strategies, and refining the generalization skills of the agent using reinforcement learning. At each stage, we would evaluate the agent's progress and adjust the parameters of the imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms accordingly.

        4. Once we've completed all levels of the game and identified a strong solution to the problem, we can deploy the final agent for testing and evaluation purposes. This agent should not only outperform humans in terms of speed and accuracy, but also demonstrate the potential for emulating other forms of intelligence.

        Overall, building superhuman AI systems that can emulate human behavior is a significant challenge that requires advanced machine learning techniques and extensive experimentation. However, it seems promising that modern machine learning techniques coupled with creativity and curiosity can lead to breakthroughs in this field.
