# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

## 4.1 Spark Core Example

In this example, we will create a simple Spark Core application that counts the number of words in a text file.

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext

sc = SparkContext("local", "WordCount")

text_file = sc.textFile("input.txt")

word_counts = text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" ")).map(lambda word: (word, 1)).reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)

word_counts.saveAsTextFile("output.txt")
```

In this example, we first create a SparkContext object. This object is used to interact with Spark.

Next, we create a text file object that represents the input text file.

We then use the flatMap function to split each line of the text file into words.

We then use the map function to create a tuple that consists of the word and a count of 1.

Finally, we use the reduceByKey function to sum up the counts for each word.

## 4.2 Spark Streaming Example

In this example, we will create a simple Spark Streaming application that counts the number of words in a text file.

```python
from pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext

ssc = StreamingContext("local", "WordCount")

text_file = ssc.textFileStream("input.txt")

word_counts = text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" ")).map(lambda word: (word, 1)).reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)

word_counts.pprint()
```

In this example, we first create a StreamingContext object. This object is used to interact with Spark Streaming.

Next, we create a text file object that represents the input text file.

We then use the flatMap function to split each line of the text file into words.

We then use the map function to create a tuple that consists of the word and a count of 1.

Finally, we use the reduceByKey function to sum up the counts for each word.

## 4.3 MLlib Example

In this example, we will create a simple MLlib application that classifies a dataset of iris flowers.

```python
from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator

# Load the data
data = spark.read.format("libsvm").load("data/iris.txt")

# Split the data into training and test sets
(trainingData, testData) = data.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3])

# Create a RandomForestClassifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(labelCol="label", featuresCol="features")

# Fit the model to the training data
model = rf.fit(trainingData)

# Make predictions on the test data
predictions = model.transform(testData)

# Evaluate the model
evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="label", predictionCol="prediction", metricName="accuracy")
accuracy = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)

print("Accuracy = " + str(accuracy))
```

In this example, we first load the data into a DataFrame.

Next, we split the data into training and test sets.

We then create a RandomForestClassifier object.

We then fit the model to the training data.

We then make predictions on the test data.

Finally, we evaluate the model using a multiclass classification evaluator.

## 4.4 GraphX Example

In this example, we will create a simple GraphX application that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

```python
from pyspark.graph import Graph

# Create a graph object
graph = Graph(vertices=vertices, edges=edges)

# Find the shortest path between two nodes
shortest_path = graph.shortestPath(source=2, target=5)

# Print the shortest path
print(shortest_path)
```

In this example, we first create a graph object.

Next, we find the shortest path between two nodes using the shortestPath function.

Finally, we print the shortest path.
