Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are a class of mathematical equations that describe how a certain physical quantity changes over space and time. They are used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and finance. Solving PDEs can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially when dealing with complex geometries and nonlinearities.

MATLAB's Partial Differential Equations Toolbox provides a comprehensive set of tools for solving and analyzing PDEs. It includes a wide range of solvers for different types of PDEs, as well as tools for mesh generation, visualization, and post-processing.
