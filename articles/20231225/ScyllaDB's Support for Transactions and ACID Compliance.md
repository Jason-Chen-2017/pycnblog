## 1. Background and Motivation

The need for transaction support and ACID compliance in distributed databases arises from the challenges of ensuring data consistency, integrity, and reliability in a distributed environment. Traditional relational databases have long provided these guarantees through the use of transactions and ACID properties. However, as databases have evolved to support distributed systems, ensuring these properties has become more challenging.

ScyllaDB was designed to address these challenges by providing a high-performance, distributed NoSQL database that also supports transactions and ACID compliance. This allows developers to build applications that can take advantage of the scalability and availability of a distributed system while still ensuring that their data remains consistent and reliable.

### 1.1 Challenges in Distributed Systems

Distributed systems introduce several challenges that make it difficult to ensure data consistency, integrity, and reliability:

- **Network Partitions**: In a distributed system, network partitions can occur, causing nodes to become isolated from each other. This can lead to inconsistencies in the data if not handled properly.
- **Data Replication**: In a distributed system, data is often replicated across multiple nodes to ensure availability and fault tolerance. This introduces additional complexity in managing and synchronizing the replicas.
- **Concurrency**: In a distributed system, multiple clients can access and modify data concurrently, leading to potential conflicts and inconsistencies.

### 1.2 ACID Properties

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are properties that a transaction must satisfy to ensure data consistency, integrity, and reliability. The ACID properties are as follows:

- **Atomicity**: A transaction is either fully completed or fully rolled back. This ensures that the system remains in a consistent state even if a transaction fails.
- **Consistency**: The transaction must start and end in a consistent state. This ensures that the system remains consistent throughout the transaction.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are executed independently and do not interfere with each other. This ensures that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and survive system failures. This ensures that the system remains reliable even in the face of failures.

ScyllaDB's support for transactions and ACID compliance addresses these challenges by providing a framework that allows developers to build applications that can take advantage of the scalability and availability of a distributed system while still ensuring that their data remains consistent and reliable.

## 2. Core Concepts and Relationships

In this section, we will discuss the core concepts and relationships related to ScyllaDB's support for transactions and ACID compliance.

### 2.1 Transactions

A transaction is a sequence of operations that are executed as a single, atomic unit. Transactions can be composed of multiple read and write operations on one or more data items. The key properties of a transaction are atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID).

### 2.2 Consistency

Consistency is the property that a transaction must start and end in a consistent state. A consistent state is one where all the data items are in a valid and coherent state. Consistency ensures that the system remains consistent throughout the transaction.

### 2.3 Isolation

Isolation is the property that transactions are executed independently and do not interfere with each other. This ensures that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data. Isolation levels can vary from read uncommitted to serializable, with each level providing a different degree of isolation.

### 2.4 Durability

Durability is the property that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and survive system failures. This ensures that the system remains reliable even in the face of failures.

### 2.5 ScyllaDB's Transaction Model

ScyllaDB's transaction model is based on the two-phase commit protocol (2PC). The 2PC protocol is a distributed coordination protocol that ensures atomicity and durability in a distributed system. In ScyllaDB, the transaction coordinator is responsible for managing the 2PC protocol and ensuring that transactions are executed atomically and durably.

## 3. Algorithm Principles and Specific Operations and Mathematical Models

In this section, we will discuss the algorithm principles and specific operations involved in ScyllaDB's support for transactions and ACID compliance, as well as the mathematical models used to ensure these properties.

### 3.1 Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC)

The two-phase commit protocol (2PC) is a distributed coordination protocol used by ScyllaDB to ensure atomicity and durability. The 2PC protocol consists of two phases:

1. **Prepare Phase**: In the prepare phase, the transaction coordinator sends a prepare request to each participant (i.e., the nodes that are involved in the transaction). The participants then perform any necessary pre-commit checks and return a prepare response to the transaction coordinator. If all participants respond positively, the transaction coordinator sends a commit request to all participants. If any participant responds negatively, the transaction coordinator sends a rollback request to all participants.
2. **Commit/Rollback Phase**: In the commit/rollback phase, the participants either commit or rollback the transaction based on the response received from the transaction coordinator. If the participant received a commit request, it applies the transaction's effects to the data and acknowledges the commit to the transaction coordinator. If the participant received a rollback request, it undoes the transaction's effects and acknowledges the rollback to the transaction coordinator.

### 3.2 Mathematical Models

ScyllaDB uses mathematical models to ensure consistency and isolation in a distributed system. One such model is the vector clock, which is used to track the version of each data item as it is modified by different transactions. The vector clock allows ScyllaDB to determine the order of modifications and ensure that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data.

Another mathematical model used by ScyllaDB is the consensus algorithm, which is used to ensure that all replicas of a data item are consistent. The consensus algorithm is based on the Raft protocol, which provides a distributed consensus in a fault-tolerant system. The Raft protocol ensures that all replicas agree on the state of the data item and that any changes to the data item are applied consistently across all replicas.

## 4. Specific Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

In this section, we will provide specific code examples and detailed explanations of how ScyllaDB's support for transactions and ACID compliance is implemented.

### 4.1 Example 1: Simple Transaction

Consider the following CQL (Cassandra Query Language) code that creates a simple table and inserts a single row:

```cql
CREATE TABLE example (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);
INSERT INTO example (id, value) VALUES (uuid(), 'Hello, World!');
```

This code creates a table called `example` with a primary key `id` of type UUID and a column `value` of type TEXT. The `INSERT` statement inserts a new row with a randomly generated UUID and the value 'Hello, World!'.

### 4.2 Example 2: Transaction with Multiple Rows

Consider the following CQL code that creates two tables and inserts multiple rows in a transaction:

```cql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

CREATE TABLE example1 (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, value1 TEXT, value2 TEXT);
INSERT INTO example1 (id, value1, value2) VALUES (uuid(), 'Hello', 'World');

CREATE TABLE example2 (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);
INSERT INTO example2 (id, value) VALUES (uuid(), 'Hello, World!');

COMMIT;
```

This code begins a transaction and then creates two tables called `example1` and `example2`. It inserts a single row into each table with the same UUID. Finally, it commits the transaction.

### 4.3 Explanation

In both examples, the transactions are executed atomically and durably using the two-phase commit protocol (2PC). The transaction coordinator is responsible for managing the 2PC protocol and ensuring that the transactions are executed correctly.

In the first example, the transaction consists of a single `INSERT` statement. The transaction coordinator sends a prepare request to each participant, which performs any necessary pre-commit checks and returns a prepare response. If all participants respond positively, the transaction coordinator sends a commit request to all participants. If any participant responds negatively, the transaction coordinator sends a rollback request to all participants.

In the second example, the transaction consists of multiple `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements. The transaction coordinator begins the transaction and sends a prepare request to each participant. If all participants respond positively, the transaction coordinator sends a commit request to all participants. If any participant responds negatively, the transaction coordinator sends a rollback request to all participants.

In both examples, the effects of the transactions are permanent and survive system failures, ensuring durability.
