### 4.1 Aerospike Kubernetes Operator

The Aerospike Kubernetes Operator is a custom controller that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of Aerospike clusters on Kubernetes. The Aerospike Kubernetes Operator provides the following features:

- Automated deployment: The Aerospike Kubernetes Operator automates the deployment of Aerospike nodes by creating and managing Kubernetes resources such as Pods, Services, and ConfigMaps.

### 4.2 Aerospike Kubernetes Operator Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the Aerospike Kubernetes Operator to deploy an Aerospike cluster on Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: aerospike.com/v1alpha1
kind: AerospikeCluster
metadata:
  name: my-aerospike-cluster
spec:
  aerospikeVersion: 4.12.0
  nodes:
    - name: node1
      replicas: 3
      storage:
        memory: 4Gi
        disk: 10Gi
```

In this example, we define an AerospikeCluster custom resource that specifies the Aerospike version, the number of nodes, and the storage resources for each node. The Aerospike Kubernetes Operator processes this custom resource and creates the necessary Kubernetes resources to deploy the Aerospike cluster.
