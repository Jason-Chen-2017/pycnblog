## 2.1. Object Storage Concepts

Object storage is a distributed storage system that stores data as objects in a hierarchical structure called a namespace. Each object consists of a unique identifier, metadata, and the actual data payload. Object storage systems provide a RESTful API for accessing and managing objects, making it easy to integrate with various applications and services.

### 2.1.1. Objects

Objects are the basic units of data in object storage systems. They consist of three components:

- **Unique Identifier**: A globally unique identifier (GUID) that is used to locate the object within the storage system.
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the object, such as its creation date, size, and content type.
- **Data Payload**: The actual data stored in the object.

### 2.1.2. Namespace

The namespace is a hierarchical structure that organizes objects in the storage system. It is similar to the file system structure in traditional storage systems but provides a more scalable and flexible organization.

### 2.1.3. RESTful API

Object storage systems provide a RESTful API for accessing and managing objects. This API allows developers to easily integrate object storage with various applications and services, making it a versatile solution for managing large amounts of unstructured data.

## 2.2. Object Storage for Financial Services

Object storage can be used in various financial services applications, such as:

- **Data Archiving**: Object storage can be used to store and manage long-term data, such as transaction records and financial reports, ensuring data security and regulatory compliance.
- **Big Data Analytics**: Object storage can be used to store and process large volumes of unstructured data, such as customer information and social media data, to support advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Object storage can be used to store and replicate critical data, ensuring business continuity in the event of a disaster.

## 3.1. Object Storage Architecture

Object storage systems are typically composed of multiple storage nodes that are interconnected through a network. Each storage node contains a set of disks that store the objects. The system uses a distributed hash table (DHT) to map the unique identifiers of objects to their locations in the storage nodes.

### 3.1.1. Distributed Hash Table (DHT)

A DHT is a distributed data structure that maps keys to values in a decentralized manner. In object storage systems, the unique identifier of an object is used as a key, and the location of the object in the storage system is the associated value. DHTs provide a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for mapping objects to their locations in the storage system.

### 3.1.2. Data Redundancy and Replication

Object storage systems use data redundancy and replication techniques to ensure data availability and fault tolerance. Common techniques include:

- **Erasure Coding**: A data redundancy technique that encodes data objects into multiple fragments, called "shards," and distributes them across multiple storage nodes. Erasure coding provides a high level of data redundancy with a relatively low overhead.
- **Replication**: A data redundancy technique that creates multiple copies of an object and stores them in different storage nodes. Replication provides a high level of data availability but may have a higher overhead than erasure coding.

## 3.2. Object Storage Operations

Object storage systems support various operations, such as create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, as well as query operations. These operations are performed using the RESTful API and are described below:

### 3.2.1. Create Operation

The create operation is used to store a new object in the storage system. The object is typically divided into chunks, which are then encoded using a data redundancy technique, such as erasure coding or replication, and stored in multiple storage nodes.

### 3.2.2. Read Operation

The read operation is used to retrieve an object from the storage system. The unique identifier of the object is used to locate the object in the storage system, and the corresponding data is returned to the client.

### 3.2.3. Update Operation

The update operation is used to modify an existing object in the storage system. The object is typically divided into chunks, which are then encoded using a data redundancy technique, and the updated data is stored in multiple storage nodes.

### 3.2.4. Delete Operation

The delete operation is used to remove an object from the storage system. The unique identifier of the object is used to locate the object in the storage system, and the corresponding data is deleted from the storage nodes.

### 3.2.5. Query Operation

The query operation is used to search for objects in the storage system based on specific criteria, such as metadata or content type. The query operation uses the RESTful API to retrieve the objects that match the specified criteria.
