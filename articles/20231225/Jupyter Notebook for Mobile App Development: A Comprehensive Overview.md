### 3.3 数学模型公式详细讲解

In this subsection, we will discuss some of the mathematical models and formulas used in Jupyter Notebook for mobile app development.

- **Linear regression**: This is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The linear regression model can be represented by the following equation:

  $$
  y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon
  $$

  where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ are the independent variables, $\beta_0, \beta_1, \cdots, \beta_n$ are the coefficients to be estimated, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

- **Logistic regression**: This is a statistical method used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables. The logistic regression model can be represented by the following equation:

  $$
  \text{logit}(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_nx_n
  $$

  where $p$ is the probability of the binary outcome, $\text{logit}(p) = \log(\frac{p}{1-p})$, and the other variables are defined as in the linear regression model.

- **K-means clustering**: This is a machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into $k$ clusters based on the similarity of the data points. The objective of the K-means algorithm is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, which can be represented by the following equation:

  $$
  \min_{\mathbf{C}} \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{x \in C_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2
  $$

  where $C_i$ is the $i$-th cluster, $\mu_i$ is the centroid of the $i$-th cluster, and $|| \cdot ||$ denotes the Euclidean distance.

These are just a few examples of the mathematical models and formulas used in Jupyter Notebook for mobile app development. Depending on the specific use case, other models and formulas may be applicable.
