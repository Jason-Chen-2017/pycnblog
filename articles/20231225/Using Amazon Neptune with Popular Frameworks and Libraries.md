## 2. Core Concepts and Relationships

Before diving into the specifics of using Amazon Neptune with popular frameworks and libraries, let's first understand the core concepts and relationships involved in graph databases.

### 2.1 Nodes and Relationships

A graph database consists of nodes and relationships. Nodes represent entities or objects in the data, while relationships represent the connections between these entities. For example, in a social network, nodes could represent users, and relationships could represent friendships or followings.

### 2.2 Properties and Labels

Nodes can have properties, which are key-value pairs that store additional information about the node. Labels are used to categorize nodes based on their properties or roles in the graph. For example, in a knowledge graph, nodes could represent entities such as people, organizations, or concepts, and labels could be used to distinguish between these entities.

### 2.3 Graph Traversal

Graph traversal is the process of navigating through the graph by following relationships from one node to another. This can be done in various ways, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, or shortest path algorithms.

### 2.4 Graph Patterns

Graph patterns are specific configurations of nodes and relationships that can be searched for within a graph. For example, a common graph pattern is the "shortest path" between two nodes, which can be used to find the most direct connection between two entities in the graph.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the core concepts and relationships in graph databases, let's explore how to use Amazon Neptune with popular frameworks and libraries.
