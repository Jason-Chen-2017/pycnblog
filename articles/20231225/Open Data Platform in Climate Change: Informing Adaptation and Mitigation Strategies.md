## 1.4 Code examples and detailed explanations

In this section, we will provide code examples and detailed explanations for some of the core algorithms, principles, and operational steps in an open data platform for climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

### 1.4.1 Data collection

For example, let's consider the collection of climate data from a public API:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/climate_data"
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()
```

### 1.4.2 Data processing

For example, let's consider the processing of temperature data to calculate the average temperature:

```python
import numpy as np

temperatures = np.array([23.5, 24.2, 22.8, 25.1, 23.9])
average_temperature = np.mean(temperatures)
```

### 1.4.3 Data storage

For example, let's consider the storage of temperature data in a CSV file:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    "date": ["2021-01-01", "2021-01-02", "2021-01-03", "2021-01-04", "2021-01-05"],
    "temperature": [23.5, 24.2, 22.8, 25.1, 23.9]
})
data.to_csv("temperature_data.csv", index=False)
```

### 1.4.4 Data sharing

For example, let's consider the sharing of temperature data in a CSV file:

```python
url = "https://example.com/temperature_data.csv"
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.content
```

### 1.4.5 Tool development

For example, let's consider the development of a simple Python script to visualize temperature data:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(data["date"], data["temperature"])
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Temperature (°C)")
plt.title("Temperature Data")
plt.show()
```

### 1.4.6 Tool integration

For example, let's consider the integration of the temperature visualization tool with other data and tools using the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards:

```python
from ogc_standards import OGC

ogc = OGC()
ogc.integrate_tool("temperature_visualization", "temperature_data.csv")
```

### 1.4.7 Stakeholder engagement

For example, let's consider the engagement of stakeholders in the development and use of the open data platform through a web-based platform:

```python
from web_platform import WebPlatform

platform = WebPlatform()
platform.engage_stakeholders("climate_change_adaptation")
```

### 1.4.8 Monitoring and evaluation

For example, let's consider the monitoring and evaluation of the open data platform using key performance indicators (KPIs):

```python
from kpis import KPIs

kpis = KPIs()
kpis.monitor_and_evaluate("climate_change_adaptation")
```
