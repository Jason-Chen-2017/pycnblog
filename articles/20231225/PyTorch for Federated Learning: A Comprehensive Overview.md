## 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
### 3.1 Algorithm Overview
The federated learning process consists of the following steps:

1. Initialize the global model.
2. Select a subset of clients.
3. Train the selected clients locally.
4. Aggregate the local models.
5. Update the global model.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until convergence.

### 3.2 Mathematical Model
Let's denote the global model as $G$, the local model as $L$, and the selected clients as $C$. The federated learning process can be mathematically represented as:

$$
G \leftarrow \alpha \cdot G + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \frac{1}{|C|} \sum_{c \in C} L_c
$$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, $|C|$ is the number of selected clients, and $L_c$ is the local model of client $c$.

### 3.3 Specific Operations
#### 3.3.1 Model Initialization
Initialize the global model $G$ with random weights.

#### 3.3.2 Client Selection
Select a subset of clients $C$ to participate in the training. This can be done using various strategies, such as random selection, stratified sampling, or clustering-based methods.

#### 3.3.3 Local Training
Train the selected clients' models $L_c$ locally using their own data. This can be done using various optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive gradient methods.

#### 3.3.4 Model Aggregation
Aggregate the local models $L_c$ into a single model $A$. This can be done using various aggregation methods, such as weighted averaging or federated averaging.

#### 3.3.5 Global Model Update
Update the global model $G$ using the aggregated model $A$. This can be done using various update rules, such as the federated averaging rule or the federated learning rate rule.

#### 3.3.6 Iteration
Repeat steps 3.3.1-3.3.5 until the global model converges or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

        # Train clients locally
        for client in selected_clients:
            client.train_local(global_model)

        # Aggregate local models
        aggregated_model = client.aggregate_models(selected_clients)

        # Update global model

        self.model.load_state_dict(global_model.state_dict())
        self.model.train()
        # Perform local training using the client's data
        # ...
