## 1.4 Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

The code examples and detailed explanations in the application of big data technology in agriculture mainly include the following:

1.4.1 Python Code: Python is a popular programming language for big data processing. The following is an example of Python code for data preprocessing:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Clean data
data = data.dropna()

# Transform data
data['temperature'] = data['temperature'].astype('float')

# Integrate data
data = pd.concat([data, pd.get_dummies(data['season'])], axis=1)

# Save data to a new CSV file
data.to_csv('preprocessed_data.csv', index=False)
```

1.4.2 R Code: R is another popular programming language for big data processing. The following is an example of R code for data analysis:

```R
# Read data from a CSV file
data <- read.csv('preprocessed_data.csv')

# Analyze data using a linear regression model
model <- lm(yield ~ temperature + rainfall + season, data=data)

# Print the results of the model
summary(model)
```

1.4.3 Machine Learning Algorithms: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze big data in agriculture. The following is an example of a machine learning algorithm for predicting crop yield:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Read data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('yield', axis=1), data['yield'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)
```
