Bigtable is a distributed, scalable, and highly available NoSQL database. It is designed to handle large-scale data storage and processing tasks, and is widely used in various industries for log aggregation and analysis. The architecture of Bigtable consists of the following components:

- **Master Node**: The master node is responsible for managing the overall operation of the Bigtable cluster, including data distribution, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
- **Region**: A region is a logical grouping of tables and is responsible for managing the data distribution and load balancing within the cluster.
- **Tablet Server**: A tablet server is responsible for managing the data stored in a tablet, which is a subset of rows in a table.
- **Client**: The client is responsible for interacting with the Bigtable cluster, including data access and manipulation.

## 2.2 Core Concepts
Some of the core concepts of Bigtable for log aggregation and analysis include:

- **Table**: A table is the basic unit of data storage in Bigtable. It consists of a set of rows, each with a unique row key.
- **Row**: A row is a set of key-value pairs, where the key is the row key and the value is the data associated with the key.
- **Column**: A column is a set of key-value pairs, where the key is the column key and the value is the data associated with the key.
- **Cell**: A cell is the smallest unit of data in Bigtable, consisting of a row key, column key, and data value.

## 2.3 Associations
The associations between the core concepts of Bigtable for log aggregation and analysis are as follows:

- **Table**: A table is a set of rows, each with a unique row key.

# 4. Detailed Code Examples and Explanations
In this section, we will provide detailed code examples and explanations for Bigtable for log aggregation and analysis.

## 4.1 Data Storage
To store data in Bigtable, we need to create a table and insert rows into the table. Here is an example of how to create a table and insert rows into the table using the Bigtable API:

```python
from google.cloud import bigtable

# Create a Bigtable client
client = bigtable.Client(project='my-project', admin=True)

# Create a new instance
instance = client.instance('my-instance')

# Create a new table
table = instance.table('my-table')
table.create()

# Insert rows into the table
rows = table.rows()
rows.insert(
    'row1', {
        'column1': 'value1',
        'column2': 'value2'
    }
)
rows.insert(
    'row2', {
        'column1': 'value3',
        'column2': 'value4'
    }
)
rows.insert(
    'row3', {
        'column1': 'value5',
        'column2': 'value6'
    }
)
rows.commit()
```

## 4.2 Data Access
To access data in Bigtable, we need to read rows from the table. Here is an example of how to read rows from the table using the Bigtable API:

```python
from google.cloud import bigtable

# Create a Bigtable client
client = bigtable.Client(project='my-project', admin=True)

# Create a new instance
instance = client.instance('my-instance')

# Create a new table
table = instance.table('my-table')

# Read rows from the table
rows = table.read_rows()
for row in rows:
    print(row.row_key, row.cells)
```

## 4.3 Data Analysis
To analyze data in Bigtable, we need to perform range scans and sorted key scans. Here is an example of how to perform range scans and sorted key scans using the Bigtable API:

```python
from google.cloud import bigtable

# Create a Bigtable client
client = bigtable.Client(project='my-project', admin=True)

# Create a new instance
instance = client.instance('my-instance')

# Create a new table
table = instance.table('my-table')

# Perform a range scan
rows = table.read_rows(filter_=bigtable.RowFilter(column_qualifier='column1'))
for row in rows:
    print(row.row_key, row.cells)

# Perform a sorted key scan
rows = table.read_rows(filter_=bigtable.RowFilter(column_qualifier='column2'),
                       use_row_keys=True)
for row in rows:
    print(row.row_key, row.cells)
```
