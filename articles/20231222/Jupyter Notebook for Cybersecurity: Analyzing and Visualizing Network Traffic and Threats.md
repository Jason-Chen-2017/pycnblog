## 3.1. Core Algorithms and Principles
### 3.1.1. Packet Sniffing
Packet sniffing is a technique used to capture and analyze network traffic. It involves monitoring the data packets that are transmitted over a network, which can reveal information about the devices connected to the network, the applications they are using, and the data they are exchanging.

### 3.1.2. Flow Analysis
Flow analysis is a technique used to identify patterns and trends in network traffic. It involves analyzing the flow of data packets between devices, which can reveal information about the communication patterns and behaviors of the devices on a network.

### 3.1.3. Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual or unexpected behavior in network traffic. It involves comparing the observed network traffic to a baseline or model of normal behavior, and flagging any deviations as potential threats.

## 3.2. Specific Steps and Mathematical Models
### 3.2.1. Packet Sniffing
1. Choose a packet sniffing tool, such as Wireshark or TShark.
2. Configure the tool to capture network traffic on the desired interface.
3. Analyze the captured packets using various filters and views.

### 3.2.2. Flow Analysis
1. Choose a flow analysis tool, such as TShark or FlowScan.
2. Configure the tool to capture network traffic on the desired interface.
3. Analyze the captured flow data using various metrics and visualizations.

### 3.2.3. Anomaly Detection
1. Choose an anomaly detection tool, such as Suricata or Snort.
2. Configure the tool to capture network traffic on the desired interface.
3. Define a baseline or model of normal behavior for the network traffic.
4. Monitor the network traffic for deviations from the baseline or model.

## 3.3. Mathematical Models
- Packet sniffing: $$ P = \frac{N}{T} $$ , where P is the packet capture rate, N is the number of packets captured, and T is the time period of the capture.
- Flow analysis: $$ F = \frac{B}{T} $$ , where F is the flow rate, B is the total byte count of the flow, and T is the time period of the flow.
- Anomaly detection: $$ A = \frac{D}{N} $$ , where A is the anomaly detection rate, D is the number of detected anomalies, and N is the total number of data points analyzed.
