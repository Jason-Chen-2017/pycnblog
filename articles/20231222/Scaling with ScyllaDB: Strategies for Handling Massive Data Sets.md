## 2. Core concepts and relationships

ScyllaDB is a distributed database management system that is designed to handle massive data sets. It is a drop-in replacement for Apache Cassandra and is compatible with it. ScyllaDB is known for its high performance, low latency, and scalability. It is used by many large-scale applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

ScyllaDB is built on top of the following core concepts:

1. Distributed architecture: ScyllaDB is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It achieves this by distributing data across multiple nodes in a cluster.

2. NoSQL: ScyllaDB is a NoSQL database, which means it is schema-less and can handle unstructured and semi-structured data.

3. High performance: ScyllaDB is designed to provide high performance and low latency. It achieves this by using a custom storage engine and optimizing its algorithms for performance.

4. Scalability: ScyllaDB is designed to be highly scalable. It achieves this by using a partitioning and replication strategy that allows it to scale horizontally.

5. Compatibility: ScyllaDB is compatible with Apache Cassandra, which means that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for Cassandra.

These core concepts are related to each other in the following ways:

1. Distributed architecture and scalability: The distributed architecture of ScyllaDB allows it to scale horizontally, which means that it can handle an increasing amount of data and traffic by adding more nodes to the cluster.

2. NoSQL and high performance: The NoSQL nature of ScyllaDB allows it to handle unstructured and semi-structured data, which is important for high-performance applications.

3. Compatibility and scalability: The compatibility of ScyllaDB with Apache Cassandra means that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for Cassandra, which allows it to take advantage of the scalability features of Cassandra.

In the next section, we will discuss the core algorithms, principles, and specific operations and mathematical models of ScyllaDB.
