Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that can be used to train agents to make decisions in various environments. It is based on the idea of learning the value of actions in a given state and using that information to make decisions. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement, making it a popular choice for many applications.

Let's dive into the world of Q-learning!

## 1. Background and motivation

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions in an environment by interacting with it and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal of RL is to find a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

Q-learning is a specific type of RL algorithm that is based on the idea of learning the value of actions in a given state. The algorithm is model-free, meaning that it does not require a model of the environment to learn the optimal policy. This makes it more flexible and easier to implement in practice.

The motivation behind Q-learning comes from the observation that many real-world problems can be modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In an MDP, the agent starts in an initial state and can transition to other states by taking actions. The agent receives a reward for each action, and the goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.

Q-learning is a popular choice for many applications, such as robotics, game playing, and recommendation systems. It has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including playing Atari games, training self-driving cars, and recommending products to users.
