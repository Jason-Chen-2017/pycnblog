## 2. Core concepts and relationships

### 2.1 What is a Survival Function?

A survival function is a function that measures the probability of survival at a given time point. It is defined as the probability that a given individual will survive beyond a given time point.

### 2.2 What is a Hazard Function?

A hazard function is a function that measures the instantaneous risk of an event occurring at a given time point. It is defined as the probability of an event occurring in a small time interval, given that the event has not occurred up to that time point.

### 2.3 What is a Cox Proportional Hazards Model?

A Cox proportional hazards model is a statistical model that is used to analyze the time until a certain event occurs, such as death or failure of a machine. It is a semi-parametric model, which means that it makes no assumptions about the distribution of the underlying data. Instead, it makes assumptions about the relationship between the explanatory variables and the hazard function.

### 2.4 What is a Survival Curve?

A survival curve is a graphical representation of the survival function. It is a curve that shows the probability of survival at each time point.

### 2.5 What is a Kaplan-Meier Estimator?

A Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric estimator of the survival function. It is based on the observed data and does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the underlying data.

### 2.6 What is a Cox-Snell Residual?

A Cox-Snell residual is a measure of the goodness-of-fit of a Cox proportional hazards model. It is a statistic that is calculated from the observed data and the predicted hazards from the model.

### 3.1 Cox Proportional Hazards Model

The Cox proportional hazards model is a statistical model that is used to analyze the time until a certain event occurs, such as death or failure of a machine. It is a semi-parametric model, which means that it makes no assumptions about the distribution of the underlying data. Instead, it makes assumptions about the relationship between the explanatory variables and the hazard function.

The Cox proportional hazards model is defined as follows:

h(t|X) = h0(t) * exp(X^T beta)

where h(t|X) is the hazard function at time t, given the explanatory variables X, h0(t) is the baseline hazard function, and X^T beta is the linear combination of the explanatory variables.

### 3.2 Kaplan-Meier Estimator

The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric estimator of the survival function. It is based on the observed data and does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the underlying data.

The Kaplan-Meier estimator is defined as follows:

S(t) = prod(1 - d_i / (n_i - d_i +))

where S(t) is the survival function at time t, d_i is the number of events at time t_i, and n_i is the number of individuals at risk at time t_i.

### 3.3 Cox-Snell Residual

A Cox-Snell residual is a measure of the goodness-of-fit of a Cox proportional hazards model. It is a statistic that is calculated from the observed data and the predicted hazards from the model.

The Cox-Snell residual is defined as follows:

R(t) = - ln(S(t))

where R(t) is the Cox-Snell residual at time t, and S(t) is the survival function at time t.

## 4. Specific code examples and detailed explanations

In this section, we will provide specific code examples and detailed explanations of how to use Spark MLlib for survival analysis.

### 4.1 Loading Data

The first step is to load the data into a Spark DataFrame. You can do this using the following code:

```
val data = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("data.csv")
```

### 4.2 Preprocessing Data

The next step is to preprocess the data. This involves converting the data into the appropriate format, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. You can do this using the following code:

```
val preprocessed_data = data.na.drop().select("age", "sex", "event")
val categorical_data = preprocessed_data.select("sex").cast("String")
val encoded_data = categorical_data.map(row => (row.getAs[String](0) match {
  case "male" => 0
  case "female" => 1
}))
```

### 4.3 Training Model

The next step is to train the model. You can do this using the following code:

```
val model = new CoxPHModel().setLabelCol("event").setFeaturesCol("features").fit(training_data)
```

### 4.4 Evaluating Model

The final step is to evaluate the model. You can do this using the following code:

```
val predictions = model.transform(training_data)
val accuracy = predictions.select("prediction", "event").stat.accuracy()
```

In this section, we will provide answers to some common questions about Spark MLlib for survival analysis.

### 6.1 What is the difference between a survival function and a hazard function?

A survival function measures the probability of survival at a given time point, while a hazard function measures the instantaneous risk of an event occurring at a given time point.

### 6.2 What is the difference between a Cox proportional hazards model and a Kaplan-Meier estimator?

A Cox proportional hazards model is a statistical model that makes assumptions about the relationship between the explanatory variables and the hazard function.
