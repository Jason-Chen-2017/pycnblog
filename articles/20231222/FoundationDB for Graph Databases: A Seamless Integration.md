# 2. Core Concepts and Relationships
In this section, we will explore the core concepts and relationships that are involved in the integration of FoundationDB with graph databases.

## 2.1 FoundationDB Core Concepts
FoundationDB has several core concepts that are important to understand when working with graph databases:

### 2.1.1 Database
A FoundationDB database is a collection of key-value pairs that are stored in a distributed, ACID-compliant manner.

### 2.1.2 Tables
A table is a collection of key-value pairs that are grouped together based on a common key prefix. Tables are used to organize data in FoundationDB and to improve query performance.

### 2.1.3 Records
A record is a collection of key-value pairs that are stored together in a single row. Records are used to represent entities in FoundationDB.

### 2.1.4 Attributes
Attributes are the values associated with a record. They can be of various data types, including strings, numbers, and binary data.

## 2.2 Graph Database Core Concepts
Graph databases have several core concepts that are important to understand when working with FoundationDB:

### 2.2.1 Nodes
Nodes are the entities in a graph database. They represent entities in the real world, such as people, places, or things.

### 2.2.2 Edges
Edges are the relationships between nodes in a graph database. They represent the connections between entities in the real world.

### 2.2.3 Properties
Properties are the attributes of nodes and edges in a graph database. They provide additional information about entities and their relationships.

## 2.3 Relationships between FoundationDB and Graph Databases
The integration of FoundationDB with graph databases involves mapping the core concepts of graph databases to the core concepts of FoundationDB. This mapping allows developers to work with complex data relationships in a seamless manner.

### 2.3.1 Nodes as Records
In FoundationDB, nodes are represented as records. Each node has a unique key that identifies it, and the attributes of the node are stored as key-value pairs within the record.

### 2.3.2 Edges as Relationships
In FoundationDB, edges are represented as relationships between nodes. These relationships can be stored as key-value pairs within the records of the nodes involved in the relationship.

### 2.3.3 Properties as Attributes
In FoundationDB, properties of nodes and edges are represented as attributes of the records that store the nodes and edges. These attributes can be of various data types, including strings, numbers, and binary data.

# 3. Core Algorithms, Operations, and Mathematical Models
In this section, we will explore the core algorithms, operations, and mathematical models that are involved in the integration of FoundationDB with graph databases.

## 3.1 FoundationDB Algorithms and Operations
FoundationDB has several algorithms and operations that are important to understand when working with graph databases:

### 3.1.1 ACID Compliance
FoundationDB is fully ACID-compliant, ensuring that transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. This compliance is achieved through the use of multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and write-ahead logging.

### 3.1.2 Distributed Consistency
FoundationDB uses a distributed consistency model that allows it to maintain consistency across multiple nodes. This model is based on the Raft consensus algorithm, which ensures that all nodes have a consistent view of the data.

### 3.1.3 Query Optimization
FoundationDB uses a query optimizer that analyzes the structure of the data and the queries being executed to determine the most efficient way to execute the queries. This optimizer is based on a cost-based approach that considers factors such as the number of nodes and edges, the depth of the graph, and the distribution of the data.

## 3.2 Graph Database Algorithms and Operations
Graph databases have several algorithms and operations that are important to understand when working with FoundationDB:

### 3.2.1 Graph Traversal
Graph traversal is the process of navigating the graph structure to find paths between nodes. This operation is important for applications that require link analysis, such as social network analysis and recommendation systems.

### 3.2.2 Graph Analytics
Graph analytics is the process of analyzing graph data to extract insights and patterns. This operation is important for applications that require deep analysis of complex data relationships, such as fraud detection and supply chain management.

### 3.2.3 Graph Querying
Graph querying is the process of querying graph data using a graph query language, such as Cypher or Gremlin. This operation is important for applications that require complex data relationships to be queried in a declarative manner.

## 3.3 Mathematical Models
The integration of FoundationDB with graph databases involves several mathematical models that are used to represent and manipulate graph data:

### 3.3.1 Graph Representation
Graphs can be represented using adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, or edge lists. In FoundationDB, graphs are typically represented using adjacency lists, as this representation allows for efficient storage and querying of graph data.

### 3.3.2 Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms, such as shortest path, betweenness centrality, and page rank, are used to analyze graph data. These algorithms are typically implemented using iterative or recursive approaches, and they can be executed in FoundationDB using the native graph API.

### 3.3.3 Graph Querying
Graph querying can be represented using graph patterns, which are sets of nodes and edges that define the structure of the query. In FoundationDB, graph querying is typically executed using a graph query language, such as Cypher or Gremlin, which allows for declarative querying of graph data.

# Create an edge between two nodes
edge_key = database.create_edge(node_key, 'knows', 'person', {'name': 'Jane Doe'})
```

## 4.3 Querying Nodes and Edges
To query nodes and edges in FoundationDB, you can use the native graph API provided by FoundationDB. This API allows you to execute graph queries using a graph query language, such as Cypher or Gremlin:

```python
# Query for nodes that know John Doe
nodes = database.cypher('MATCH (n)-[:knows]->(m) WHERE m.name = "John Doe" RETURN n')

# Query for edges between John Doe and Jane Doe
edges = database.gremlin('g.V().has('name', 'John Doe').outE('knows').inV().has('name', 'Jane Doe')')
```
