## 4. Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

In this section, we will provide code examples and detailed explanations for integrating React Native and Google Maps.

### 4.1 Code Example: Simple MapView

In this example, we will create a simple MapView component that displays a map with a marker.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <MapView
        style={styles.map}
        initialRegion={{
          latitude: 37.78825,
          longitude: -122.4324,
          latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
          longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
        }}
      >
        <Marker
          coordinate={{
            latitude: 37.78825,
            longitude: -122.4324,
          }}
          title="Marker"
          description="This is a marker"
        />
      </MapView>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
    height: '100%',
    width: '100%',
    justifyContent: 'flex-end',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  map: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
  },
});

export default App;
```

In this example, we create a simple MapView component that displays a map with a marker. The MapView component is styled using the StyleSheet API, and the initial region of the map is set to San Francisco. The Marker component is added to the MapView component with a coordinate, title, and description.

          title="Marker"
          description="This is a marker"
        />

        <Polyline
          coordinates={[
            { latitude: 37.78825, longitude: -122.4324 },
            { latitude: 37.78825, longitude: -122.4324 },
          ]}
          strokeColor="blue"
          strokeWidth={2}
        />

        <Circle
          center={{
            latitude: 37.78825,
            longitude: -122.4324,
          }}
          radius={1000}
          fillColor="rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)"
          strokeColor="rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"
          strokeWidth={1}
        />
      </MapView>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
    height: '100%',
    width: '100%',
    justifyContent: 'flex-end',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  map: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
  },
});

export default App;
```

In this example, we create a MapView component that displays a map with a marker, a polyline, and a circle. The Marker, Polyline, and Circle components are added to the MapView component with their respective coordinates, colors, and styles.

```

### 6.3 How do I add a custom marker to the map?

To add a custom marker to the map, you can create a custom marker component and add it to the MapView component. Here's an example of how to create a custom marker component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';

const CustomMarker = ({ coordinate, title, description }) => {
  return (
    <Marker
      coordinate={coordinate}
      title={title}
      description={description}
    >
      <View style={styles.marker}>
        <View style={styles.markerIcon} />
      </View>
    </Marker>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  marker: {
    width: 30,
    height: 30,
  },
  markerIcon: {
    width: 20,
    height: 20,
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    borderRadius: 10,
  },
});

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MapView
      style={styles.map}
      initialRegion={{
        latitude: 37.78825,
        longitude: -122.4324,
        latitudeDelta: 0.0922,

          longitude: -122.4324,
        }}
        title="Custom Marker"
        description="This is a custom marker"
      />
    </MapView>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we create a CustomMarker component that renders a custom marker on the map. The CustomMarker component takes a coordinate, title, and description as props, and renders a custom marker with a custom icon.

### 6.4 How do I add a polyline to the map?

To add a polyline to the map, you can use the Polyline component from the react-native-maps library. Here's an example of how to add a polyline to the map:

          longitude: -122.4324,
        }}
        title="Marker"
        description="This is a marker"
      />

      <Polyline
        coordinates={[
          { latitude: 37.78825, longitude: -122.4324 },
          { latitude: 37.78825, longitude: -122.4324 },
        ]}
        strokeColor="blue"
        strokeWidth={2}
      />
    </MapView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  map: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
  },
});

export default App;
```

In this example, we add a polyline to the map using the Polyline component. The Polyline component takes an array of coordinates as a prop, and renders a polyline with a specified stroke color and stroke width.

### 6.5 How do I add a circle to the map?

      }}
    >
      <Marker
        coordinate={{
          latitude: 37.78825,
          longitude: -122.4324,
        }}
        title="Marker"
        description="This is a marker"
      />

      <Circle
        center={{
          latitude: 37.78825,
          longitude: -122.4324,
        }}
        radius={1000}
        fillColor="rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)"
        strokeColor="rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"
        strokeWidth={1}
      />
    </MapView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  map: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
