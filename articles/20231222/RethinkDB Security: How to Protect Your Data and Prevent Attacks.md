### 1.1. RethinkDB Architecture

RethinkDB is a distributed database system that consists of multiple nodes. Each node contains a copy of the data and can be used for querying and storing data. The nodes communicate with each other using a gossip protocol, which allows them to discover and join the cluster.

RethinkDB uses a masterless architecture, meaning that there is no single point of failure in the system. Instead, each node has an equal chance of being elected as a coordinator, which is responsible for managing the cluster and handling client requests.

### 1.2. RQL Querying Language

RethinkDB provides a powerful and flexible querying language called RQL, which is based on the functional programming paradigm. RQL allows you to perform complex queries on your data using a simple and expressive syntax.

RQL supports various types of queries, including filtering, sorting, mapping, and reducing. It also provides built-in functions for working with dates, arrays, and strings.

### 1.3. Security Challenges

RethinkDB, like any other database system, faces security challenges. Some of the common security issues include unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial of service attacks. To protect your data and prevent attacks, it is essential to implement proper security measures.

In the next section, we will discuss the core concepts and relations related to RethinkDB security.
