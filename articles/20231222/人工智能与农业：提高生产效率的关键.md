农业是人类 earliest occupation and has always been the foundation of human civilization. Over the centuries, advancements in agricultural technology have led to increased food production and improved living standards. However, as the global population continues to grow, the demand for food also increases, putting pressure on the agricultural sector to produce more with less resources. In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced technologies into agriculture has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges.

AI has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by improving efficiency, reducing waste, and increasing sustainability. By leveraging data, machine learning, and automation, AI can help farmers make better decisions, optimize resource use, and enhance crop yields. This article will explore the role of AI in agriculture, the core concepts and algorithms involved, and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

# Load historical crop yield data
X = np.array([[2010], [2011], [2012], [2013], [2014]])
y = np.array([150, 160, 170, 180, 190])

# Train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

# Predict crop yield for a future year
future_year = np.array([[2022]])
predicted_yield = model.predict(future_year)
print("Predicted crop yield for 2022:", predicted_yield[0])
```

### 4.2 农业图像分类
