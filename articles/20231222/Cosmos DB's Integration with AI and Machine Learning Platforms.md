## 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

In this section, we will provide a code example that demonstrates how to use Cosmos DB with Python and TensorFlow to build and deploy a simple machine learning model.

### 4.1 Setup

First, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install azure-cosmos tensorflow pandas numpy
```

### 4.2 Cosmos DB Configuration

Configure your Cosmos DB account and create a new database and container:

```python
from azure.cosmos import CosmosClient, PartitionKey, exceptions

url = "https://<your-cosmos-db-account>.documents.azure.com:443/"
key = "<your-cosmos-db-key>"
client = CosmosClient(url, credential=key)
database = client.create_database_if_not_exists("my-database")
container = database.create_container_if_not_exists(
    id="my-container",
    partition_key=PartitionKey(path="/id"),
    offer_type="Standard"
)
```

### 4.3 Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the data using NumPy and Pandas:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

data = np.random.rand(100, 4)
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["feature1", "feature2", "feature3", "label"])
df.to_json("data.json", orient="records")
```

### 4.4 Model Training

Upload the data to Cosmos DB and train a TensorFlow model:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

container.upsert_item(id="0", data={"data": open("data.json", "rb").read()})

model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation="relu", input_shape=(4,)),
    Dense(32, activation="relu"),
    Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")
])

model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="binary_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
model.fit(container, epochs=10, batch_size=10)
```

### 4.5 Model Validation

Validate the model using a validation dataset:

```python
# Load the validation dataset
val_data = np.random.rand(20, 4)
val_df = pd.DataFrame(val_data, columns=["feature1", "feature2", "feature3", "label"])
val_data_json = val_df.to_json("val_data.json", orient="records")

# Upload the validation dataset to Cosmos DB
container.upsert_item(id="1", data={"data": open("val_data.json", "rb").read()})

# Validate the model
val_loss, val_acc = model.evaluate(container, batch_size=10)
print(f"Validation Loss: {val_loss}, Validation Accuracy: {val_acc}")
```

### 4.6 Model Deployment

Deploy the model to a production environment:

```python
model.save("my-model")
```
