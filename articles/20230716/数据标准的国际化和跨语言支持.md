Data standardization (DS) refers to the process of converting data from one format or structure to another that is suitable for a specific purpose such as interoperability between different systems. The key objective in DS is to ensure that all parts of an organization working with data share the same understanding of how it should be interpreted and processed, regardless of their underlying technical system architecture. Data standards play a crucial role in this regard by establishing consistent language, terminology, and formats for exchanging data across different organizations and stakeholders within a company. Without clear data standards, businesses would face significant challenges in sharing information across multiple platforms and organizations, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and security breaches. Therefore, while there are many benefits associated with having well-established data standards, companies must also strive to continually improve them over time as new technologies arise and emerge on the market. In particular, cross-language support plays a critical role in making data exchange more efficient and effective. 

There are several approaches to supporting cross-language support in data standards:

1. Language mapping: One approach involves creating mappings between different languages and versions of data elements. For example, if a company has data in English but wants to integrate it into its applications in French, they can create a set of translations that maps each English term to its corresponding French equivalent. This solution requires labor intensive translation work, however, and may not always produce accurate results due to differences in word choice, tone, or grammar.

2. Translating data standards: Another approach is to translate entire data standards documents in various languages, using automated tools like machine translation software or professional translators who have specialized skills in translating complex technical texts. While this approach can provide immediate benefit, it does require expertise in both data processing and linguistic terms and techniques. It is essential to make sure that translated data standards are reviewed and approved before being released to production use.

3. Codesets/Terminologies: A third approach is to develop codesets or terminologies for specific domains, which map internal business logic to pre-defined codes that represent those concepts. These codesets can then be used throughout the data ecosystem to enable automatic and reliable data exchange without requiring any human input. However, this method requires careful design and implementation, as well as regular updates and maintenance to keep pace with changing business rules. Overall, despite the numerous benefits of data standards and cross-language support, implementing these solutions can still be challenging for large organizations that need to coordinate multiple teams, communicate internally and externally, and deal with diverse cultures and languages. With the right strategy and resources, data standards and cross-language support can help achieve agility, consistency, and improved efficiency among businesses. 

In conclusion, data standards play a vital role in ensuring data quality, accuracy, and reliability. Cross-language support is necessary for enabling global communication and collaboration, yet it often remains elusive. Several practical strategies exist to address this challenge, including creating or adopting codesets and terminologies, developing international language mappings, and translating data standards. However, it is essential to remain up-to-date with current trends, technologies, and laws to maintain a robust, secure, and beneficial data ecosystem for all participants.
