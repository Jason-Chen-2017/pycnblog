## What is an open source software?
Open-source software (OSS) refers to software that is made freely available for anyone to use or modify. It often refers to software that is released under a license such as the MIT License which grants permission to use, study, change, and distribute the software, but does not prevent others from making their own changes or releases of the code. OSS has become increasingly popular due to its ability to meet the demands of modern society, while also providing opportunities for developers to learn new technologies and build skills in a collaborative environment. In fact, many companies have embraced OSS within their business strategies because they can leverage large amounts of knowledge and expertise without having to reinvent the wheel every time they need something specific done. Therefore, it’s essential for anyone involved with technology development to understand what OSS is and how it works so they can make better decisions about whether to rely on OSS components or develop custom solutions.
## Why should you care about OSS licenses?
In order to develop reliable and scalable systems, organizations must invest heavily in quality software engineering practices and resources. As mentioned earlier, OSS offers several benefits including increased transparency, community engagement, consistency, flexibility, reduced costs, and improved collaboration. However, if you don't carefully consider your choice of OSS license, you could end up being held hostage by those who claim copyright ownership over your work even after you've stopped using the component. This can lead to legal issues down the road when other developers want to incorporate your work into their projects. Therefore, it's important to choose the correct OSS license based on your needs and goals, such as commercial usage rights, patent protection, warranty protection, and support obligations. By following best practice guidelines, you can minimize these risks and ensure that your OSS contributions are used safely and effectively throughout your organization. Additionally, understanding the pros and cons of different OSS licenses will help you make the right decision for your project.
This article provides a comprehensive guide on all aspects of OSS licensing, from choosing the right one to applying them correctly in your projects. We'll start by exploring the basics of OSS, including why we should care and what OSS is. Then we'll move on to examining some common OSS licenses, explaining the rationale behind each and advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we'll demonstrate how to apply OSS licenses properly in your software development projects by creating a simple example app and adding appropriate comments to explain what each section does.

## OSI - Open Systems Interconnection 
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is a standardization body formed to create interoperability between various computer operating system platforms and software applications. It defines seven layers of communication protocols at the physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application levels. 

## SaaS(Software as a Service) & PaaS(Platform as a Service) & IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service)
SaaS stands for “software-as-a-service” and involves cloud computing where third parties provide applications over the internet. These applications run on a shared pool of hardware resources and users access them through web browsers or mobile apps. Popular examples include Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Dropbox. PaaS stands for “platform-as-a-service” and provides a platform where developers can deploy and run their applications without worrying about managing servers, networking, security, etc. Cloud providers like AWS offer both types of services alongside serverless functions. IaaS stands for “infrastructure-as-a-service” and refers to a model of cloud computing in which the cloud provider manages virtual machines, storage, and networking resources. Examples of IaaS include Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure. 

## FOSS(Free and Open Source Software) vs Proprietary Software
FOSS refers to free and open-source software, which means any software whose source code is publicly accessible and may be modified or adapted by anyone. On the other hand, proprietary software is created and owned exclusively by a company or individual. 

## GPL(General Public License) vs LGPL(Lesser General Public License) vs Apache License VS BSD License VS Mozilla Public License(MPL) 
GPL is the most commonly used copyleft license. It requires all derived works be licensed under the same terms as the original. LGPL is similar to GPL but permits the library to be linked with non-GPL programs provided the interfaces are preserved. Apache License and BSD License are both permissive licenses but differ in granting patent rights and additional restrictions. MPL is a strong copyleft license that explicitly requires distribution of the license and derivative works in a manner consistent with the MPL.
