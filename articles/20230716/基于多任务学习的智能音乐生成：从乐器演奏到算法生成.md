随着科技的发展和人们生活水平的提高，人们越来越多地喜欢听各种各样的音乐。很多音乐爱好者也希望能够通过计算机合成出符合自己胃口的音乐。但是，由于音乐作曲、创作过程复杂、耗时长，而且不同音乐风格之间的相似性不足，人们很难将多个音乐风格融为一体，因此，如何通过自动化的音乐生成技术帮助人们在不同的音乐风格之间快速切换，是当前热门研究方向之一。本文所要讨论的基于多任务学习（Multi-task learning）的智能音乐生成技术，即通过同时学习乐器演奏和歌词生成两个任务，来实现快速准确的音乐风格转换。

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 Multi-task learning
Multi-task learning (MTL) is a type of machine learning where several related tasks are learned simultaneously instead of sequentially or in parallel. It involves training the model to perform multiple different tasks with shared input features and transfering knowledge across those tasks to improve overall performance. In other words, MTL aims to train a single neural network that can handle multiple tasks by jointly optimizing for all tasks at once. 

## 2.2 LSTM-based sequence modeling
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are commonly used as recurrent neural network models for sequence modeling. They use feedback from previous time steps to compute current predictions. The basic idea behind LSTM is to capture long-term dependencies between sequences of data points without explicitly representing them as matrices and thus allowing the model to learn more complex patterns over longer periods of time. An LSTM cell contains four parts: an input gate, an output gate, a forget gate, and a cell state. These gates control the flow of information into and out of the cell and help to manage internal states within the cell. 

## 2.3 Attention mechanism
Attention mechanisms have been shown to be effective in capturing relevant contextual information during sequence modeling. A simple attention mechanism involves calculating an alignment score between each element of the input sequence and some set of references and then applying a softmax function to obtain a probability distribution over the input elements based on their similarity to the reference elements. The resulting vector represents a weighted average of the input sequence, where the weights correspond to the importance given to each input element towards producing the final output.

## 2.4 Autoregressive Model
An autoregressive model consists of two parts: an encoder and decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence to generate a fixed-size representation. The decoder takes this representation as its initial hidden state and predicts the next element in the sequence one step at a time. Each predicted element depends only on previously generated elements up to that point. This allows for efficient generation of sequential outputs while using an linguistically meaningful representation of the input sequence.

## 2.5 Music Generation Pipeline Architecture
The music generation pipeline typically comprises six main components: feature extraction, pitch detection, beat tracking, chord recognition, melody extraction, and MIDI synthesis. All these components take inputs such as audio signals or note arrays and produce corresponding outputs which are fed back into subsequent components as necessary. Here's how the music generation pipeline architecture looks like:

# 3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
## 3.1 数据集准备
对于机器学习模型而言，数据集的质量直接影响模型的训练效果。这里我们选取了包含多种风格的大规模音乐数据集MuseScore。数据集可以分为两类，训练集和验证集。训练集用于训练模型，验证集用于评估模型的泛化能力。该数据集由多人共同编辑并提供，涵盖了众多流行歌手的歌曲。每首歌曲都经过过严格的音乐审查，保证音乐品味符合要求。该数据集的大小为137GB，下载地址为http://musescore.org/en/handbook/music-database/downloads 。下载后可以得到一个音乐文件的文本描述，我们可以通过对文本进行处理，提取音乐特征作为输入数据。

为了能够直接用于模型训练，需要把所有数据统一成相同的音源。然后对每个音频文件，我们通过主程序调用某音源分析器（例如在线音乐分析器或开源音乐分析工具），提取出其中的音乐节拍信息、音符信息以及谱面信息等，并存入相应的数组中。这样就可以构造一张表，记录了这个音频文件对应的音乐特征，包括音色、节奏、和声合成方式等。我们会在下一小节对音乐特征进行详细说明。

## 3.2 音乐特征
### 3.2.1 Pitch
Pitch detection refers to identifying the fundamental frequency of a signal. In order to identify pitches accurately, we need to extract harmonic frequencies from the signal using techniques such as autocorrelation and wavelet transforms. We can apply filters to separate harmonics from noise, and then select the most prominent frequency component from the remaining spectrum. For music generation purposes, it may not be necessary to extract individual notes from the signal because the dynamics of the sound will usually control the timbre of the piece. However, pitch detection can still provide valuable insights into the rhythmic structure of a piece, which can inform the choice of melodies later on.

### 3.2.2 Beat Tracking
Beat tracking is the process of determining the tempo of a song by analyzing its metrical events, such as accentuated tonal structures or downbeats. One common algorithm for beat tracking is RNN-based Long-Short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). RNN-LSTM captures the temporal dependencies of the musical events and generates probabilities for the occurrence of various metrical events, including whole, half, quarter, eighth, etc. At every timestep, the LSTM selects the event with highest probability and adds it to the current beat signature. After processing all the frames of the audio file, the estimated beat signature gives us an accurate estimation of the tempo of the song.

### 3.2.3 Chords Recognition
Chords recognition refers to the task of identifying the key of a song and detecting the dominant chord progression or any other relevant chord patterns present in the song. To accomplish this, we can use spectral clustering algorithms to group similar chroma vectors together based on their pitch content. Once we have grouped similar chroma vectors, we can choose the most representative ones based on their pitch content and determine what kind of chord they belong to according to the major scale pattern. As an alternative approach, we could also use traditional methods such as beat-tracking, texture analysis, or statistical measures of chord transitions.

### 3.2.4 Melody Extraction
Melody extraction is another important part of the music generation pipeline. Given a monophonic track, we want to automatically find the underlying melodic line that best matches the accompaniment or vocals. There are many ways to do this, but one popular method is to first align the melody to the main bassline, followed by peak finding algorithms to locate the highest energy regions along the amplitude curve. Another way to go about this problem is to build a deep neural network that learns to predict the melody from the spectrogram of the music.

### 3.2.5 MIDI Synthesis
MIDI synthesis is the process of converting the extracted features into a standardized MIDI format that can be played on virtual instruments or recorded on physical MIDI controllers. Many open source libraries exist for generating MIDI files, including mido, pretty_midi, and pypianoroll. We will discuss the details of this part in our implementation section below.
