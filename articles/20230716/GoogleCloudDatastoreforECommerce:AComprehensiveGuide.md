E-commerce platforms are becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated as businesses move to the cloud or migrate their IT infrastructure into virtualized environments where speed and scale become critical concerns. With such complexity comes a need to optimize data storage solutions that can handle large volumes of user data while also ensuring security, scalability, and reliability requirements. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers several options for storing e-commerce data in a reliable and scalable manner, including Bigtable, Spanner, Firestore, and Cloud Datastore. In this guide, we will be discussing how GCP's Cloud Datastore can be used to store e-commerce data efficiently with high availability and strong consistency guarantees. We will start by reviewing basic concepts related to Cloud Datastore before going through key features and benefits. Then we will discuss strategies for optimizing queries and data modeling for efficient retrieval. Finally, we will cover advanced topics like transactions, indexes, and backups to ensure data integrity and protect against potential threats. 

This comprehensive guide is intended for professionals who are familiar with cloud computing technologies and have experience building applications using NoSQL databases. It provides an overview of Cloud Datastore along with detailed explanations of its features, use cases, best practices, and performance considerations.

By the end of the article, you should have a better understanding of GCP's Cloud Datastore service and how it can be utilized to store and manage e-commerce data for your business needs. Additionally, you should gain insights on designing and managing a highly available and consistent database solution for your next e-commerce project. 


# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before delving into technical details about GCP's Cloud Datastore, let's briefly review some essential terms and concepts that may be unfamiliar to those who haven't worked with them before. These include entity types, properties, namespaces, and indexes.


## Entity Types 
An *entity type* refers to a collection of entities that share common characteristics or attributes, similar to tables in relational databases. Each entity in a specific entity type has a unique identifier called an *entity key*. The primary key of each entity serves as the entity key, which consists of one or more *properties*, which together uniquely identify the entity within its entity type. Properties represent the various pieces of information associated with each entity, such as name, age, address, email, etc. Different entities within an entity type may contain different sets of properties. For example, in an entity type representing customers, there might be properties like customer ID, name, email, phone number, billing address, shipping address, payment method, purchase history, etc. Similarly, in another entity type representing products, there might be properties like product ID, name, description, price, quantity, category, tags, etc. An application typically defines multiple entity types to model its domain objects.


## Properties
A *property* represents a piece of information that can be stored in an entity. Each property has a name and a value. The value can be either simple or structured depending on the nature of the data being represented. Simple properties simply hold a single value of a certain data type, such as strings, integers, floats, dates, booleans, etc. Structured properties can hold a set of related values, including lists, maps, nested structures, and combinations of these. For example, if a particular customer orders several items from a company's website, then the order entity could have a list property containing all the ordered items, each represented as a separate sub-entity. Each item entity would have its own properties such as title, description, price, quantity, image URL, etc., allowing for rich querying and indexing capabilities across the entire dataset.


## Namespaces
A *namespace* allows for logical separation of entity types, providing a way to group related entity types together without affecting their physical placement in the datastore. This makes it easier to organize data according to functional or organizational boundaries, enabling administrators to control access based on individual users' roles and responsibilities. By default, Cloud Datastore creates a top-level namespace called 'default'. However, administrators can create additional namespaces as needed to segment data and restrict access to sensitive information. When defining entity keys, administrators must specify a valid namespace unless they're creating entities at the root level. Administrators can also configure Cloud IAM policies to define access controls for specific namespaces or entity types.


## Indexes
Indexes help improve query performance by allowing Cloud Datastore to quickly locate relevant entities based on specified filters. Indexes are created automatically by Cloud Datastore when necessary, but can also be defined manually or programmatically. Each index specifies a set of properties and sorts them in ascending or descending order, indicating the direction in which results should be returned if two or more entities match the same filter criteria. Index creation requires specifying a set of properties, whether to sort in ascending or descending order, and any ancestor paths that should be included in the index. Once an index is created, it applies to all entities of the corresponding entity type and cannot be removed once created. Indexes can significantly reduce query latency, improving overall system performance and reducing the amount of data processed during queries.
