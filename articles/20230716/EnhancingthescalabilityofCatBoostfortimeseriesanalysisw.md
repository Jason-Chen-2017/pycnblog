Time Series Analysis (TSA) is a popular technique used to analyze and forecast economic, financial, or social data that exhibits patterns over time. It involves studying the historical changes in variables and predicting future values based on these trends. Catboost is an algorithm known for its high efficiency, accuracy, and scalability when dealing with structured and unstructured data, making it particularly useful for solving TSA problems. However, since the algorithm does not include any autoregressive model in its training process, it can fail to capture complex seasonal or long-term dependencies present in many real-world time series datasets. In this article, we will discuss how one can extend Catboost's ability to handle such dependencies by incorporating autoregressive models into its training process. 

The problem at hand requires us to use autoregressive models in order to learn long-term patterns in the dataset. Autoregressive models are models that make predictions using past values of a variable as input, which helps in understanding the overall structure of the data and anticipating future values. These models have been shown to be effective in capturing various types of temporal dependencies, including those related to seasonality, cyclic behavior, and stochastic volatility. 

In addition to analyzing time series data, TSA also has applications in finance and stock market prediction, where it can help identify the factors that influence the movement of prices over time. This information can then be used to formulate investment strategies and monitor the performance of stocks and companies over time.

This paper presents an extension to Catboost called CATBOOST TSA, which includes autoregressive modeling capabilities alongside other enhancements to improve scalability and accuracy. The new version uses an improved approach to sample weight calculation and also adds support for categorical features during feature encoding. We evaluate our implementation on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we provide insights into how this new method can further be extended to incorporate additional advanced concepts, such as deep learning architectures and attention mechanisms, and why they might prove to be effective in handling more sophisticated time series datasets. 


# 2.基本概念术语说明Autoregressive Model: An autoregressive model is a type of statistical model that makes predictions using past values of a variable as input. These models estimate the effects of past observations on current outcomes and forecast future values based on these estimates. They have been found to be effective in capturing various types of temporal dependencies, including those related to seasonality, cyclic behavior, and stochastic volatility. One way to represent an autoregressive model is through an equation of the form Y_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^p a_iy_{t-i} + \epsilon_t, where p is the number of lagged terms included in the model, y_t represents the value of the dependent variable at time t, a_i represents the coefficient associated with the i-th term, epsilon_t represents white noise error, and c represents the intercept. A regression line is often considered an example of an autoregressive model in the case of a single independent variable. More generally, autoregressive models may involve several dependent variables and/or multiple lags of the same variable. 

Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF): PACF measures the strength of the relationship between each variable and its own past values. Higher coefficients indicate stronger relationships, while negative values suggest no autocorrelation between two variables. By plotting the PACF of a time series data set, analysts can determine the degree of integrated lag structure present within the data.

Seasonality: Seasonality refers to regular cycles repeating over different periods of time. Common examples of seasonal components in time series data include daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, etc. Identifying seasonal patterns can be helpful in identifying potential signal in the data that needs to be addressed separately from any overall trend. Additionally, seasonality may affect the stability of the model's estimated parameters and contribute to biases in predictions. 

Cyclic Behavior: Cyclic behavior refers to periodic patterns that resemble waves or oscillations. Examples of cyclic behavior in time series data include sinusoids, square waves, sawtooth waves, triangular waves, and so on. While some cyclic behavior may be detectable visually, an autoregressive model may perform better at capturing its underlying pattern.

Stochastic Volatility: Stochastic volatility refers to variations in the volatility level of a security over time due to random shocks. Stock markets tend to display substantial stochastic volatility in their price movements due to macroeconomic factors like inflation and business cycle fluctuations. Detecting and modeling stochastic volatility can provide valuable insight into the risk profile of a company and inform trading decisions.

CATBOOST TSA is a modified version of the original Catboost algorithm that incorporates autoregressive models into its training process. 

### Feature Encoding
During the feature encoding step, we encode all categorical features using numerical representations. Categorical features can be either binary or ordinal. Binary features have only two possible values, whereas ordinal features have an ordered sequence of values. During feature encoding, we create dummy variables for both kinds of categorical features. Each category becomes a separate column, with a value of 1 if the observation belongs to that category and 0 otherwise. For example, consider the following table of sales data:

| ID | Date       | Product   | Price |
|----|------------|-----------|-------|
| 1  | 2021-01-01 | Apple     | $1    |
| 2  | 2021-01-01 | Samsung   | $2    |
| 3  | 2021-01-02 | Apple     | $3    |
| 4  | 2021-01-02 | Samsung   | $4    |

If we want to use this table as input to a Catboost model, we need to convert the "Product" column to numerical format. Since there are only two products ("Apple" and "Samsung"), we can simply assign them numbers starting from 0:

| ID | Date       | Product   | Price | ProductNum |
|----|------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| 1  | 2021-01-01 | Apple     | $1    | 0          |
| 2  | 2021-01-01 | Samsung   | $2    | 1          |
| 3  | 2021-01-02 | Apple     | $3    | 0          |
| 4  | 2021-01-02 | Samsung   | $4    | 1          |

Similarly, we can encode binary categorical features by assigning a unique integer id for each possible value:

| ID | Date       | Gender   | Age | Sex | IsActive |
|----|------------|----------|-----|-----|----------|
| 1  | 2021-01-01 | Male     | 30  | F   | Yes      |
| 2  | 2021-01-01 | Female   | 25  | M   | No       |
| 3  | 2021-01-02 | Male     | 40  | M   | Yes      |
| 4  | 2021-01-02 | Female   | 20  | F   | No       |

After feature encoding, the gender column would look something like this:

| ID | Date       | GenderMale | GenderFemale | Age | SexM | SexF | IsActiveYes | IsActiveNo |
|----|------------|------------|--------------|-----|------|------|-------------|------------|
| 1  | 2021-01-01 | 1          | 0            | 30  | 0    | 1    | 1           | 0          |
| 2  | 2021-01-01 | 0          | 1            | 25  | 1    | 0    | 0           | 1          |
| 3  | 2021-01-02 | 1          | 0            | 40  | 1    | 0    | 1           | 0          |
| 4  | 2021-01-02 | 0          | 1            | 20  | 0    | 1    | 0           | 1          |


### Training Procedure
Training the model follows standard catboost procedures. We first preprocess the dataset according to the specified preprocessing steps. Next, we split the data into train, validation, and test sets. We specify the target variable and columns to use as inputs and outputs. We fit a Catboost model to the preprocessed data using the selected hyperparameters. We calculate sample weights for each row based on various criteria, such as recentness, seasonality, and missing data. We add an autoregressive component to the loss function that penalizes deviation from the expected value of previous output values. We minimize the weighted sum of squared errors plus the AR penalty term using gradient descent. After training, we apply the trained model to the test set to obtain predictions and evaluate the accuracy.
