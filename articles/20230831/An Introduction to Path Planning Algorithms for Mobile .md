# Path planning is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics that involves the creation of paths or trajectories that allow the robot to reach its destination while avoiding obstacles and ensuring safe operation. Different algorithms exist for path planning but they have different characteristics such as computation time, performance, robustness, feasibility, and accuracy. In this article, we will introduce five popular algorithms used for mobile robot path planning: Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT), Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM), Visibility Graphs (VG), Fast Marching Methods (FMM) and Bidirectional Expansion A* (BAA). We also cover their properties, advantages and limitations. Finally, we provide insights into when to use each algorithm based on various factors such as robot size, environment complexity, motion constraints, etc. 

The purpose of this article is to explain how these path planning algorithms work at a high level, demonstrate them using sample code, and discuss their pros and cons along with an overview of potential future developments in this field. This article assumes some knowledge of computer programming, math, probability, geometry, and spatial representation. The examples shown are written in Python language.

# 2.基本概念术语
Let's begin by defining some basic terms and concepts related to path planning.

1. **State space**: refers to all possible configurations of the system that can be reached within a given amount of time. For example, in case of mobile robot navigation, state space could refer to all possible locations the robot can occupy during a fixed period of time, assuming it has a fixed velocity and does not encounter any obstacles. 

2. **Configuration space**: refers to the set of positions and orientations of the agent. It defines what is considered valid for the agent's state and includes every reachable point on the map except those blocked by obstacles. 

3. **Path**: refers to the sequence of states that the agent must traverse through to reach its goal configuration. Depending on the context, path might include one waypoints, timed intervals between points, or geometric trajectory following control inputs. 

4. **Start state** and **goal state**: represent starting and final position/orientation of the agent respectively. They define where the agent starts from and where it needs to reach. 

5. **Obstacle**: anything that blocks access to the desired area. It can be physical objects like walls, barriers, or virtual ones created by simulating sensors or actuators present in the world. 

6. **Distance metric**: a function that measures the distance between two states in configuration space. There are several common metrics such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Chebyshev distance. Some other common ones are Thomson distance or Minkowski distance which measure the difference in power consumption or total energy consumed over a path. 

7. **Heuristic function**: estimates the cost of reaching a particular state from the current state. Its main role is to reduce the search space by focusing on promising regions instead of exploring the entire state space. Common heuristics include straight line distances, minimum time required to reach the goal state, or shortest travel time amongst known obstacles. 

8. **Motion model**: specifies the allowed movements and actions that the agent can take in each state. Examples include linear and rotational velocities, joint angle commands, or torque controls. These models help determine whether the movement generated by the planner is likely to result in a collision free trajectory or not. 

9. **Collision detection**: checks if there exists a collision between the agent and any obstacle in its path. It generates a list of safe states for the agent without colliding with any object. 

10. **Local planner**: generates a local plan for the agent based on its current pose and sensor readings. It determines the optimal sequence of actions to follow from the current location towards the global goal. 

11. **Global planner**: generates a global plan that incorporates information about the surrounding environment and navigates through unknown terrain safely. It combines multiple local plans using optimization techniques to ensure smooth and efficient path formation. 

12. **Sampling strategy**: selects the subset of samples that should be explored during the process of generating a roadmap. Two commonly used sampling strategies are uniform random sampling and progressive sampling. Uniform random sampling selects states randomly from the state space, whereas progressive sampling adds more samples closer to the goal state. 

13. **Edge weight**: represents the likelihood of transitioning from one state to another. Common edge weights include step costs (equivalent to moving forward in meters per second), turn penalties (due to limited turning radius), or dynamic weight factor calculated based on recent observations.
