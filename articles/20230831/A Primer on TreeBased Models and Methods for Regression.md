# 1.简介
  

机器学习（ML）是一个活跃且火热的话题。在过去几年里，机器学习技术已经从各种领域应用到各个行业中。其中，最具代表性的就是图像识别、自然语言处理、推荐系统、分类模型等。然而，这些技术之所以被称为机器学习，是因为它们可以“学习”从数据中提取的模式并自动进行预测、分析或者类别化。

Tree-based models (TBM) are a type of ML algorithm that is particularly effective at solving regression and classification problems. They work by partitioning the data into smaller subsets or regions using a tree structure and then applying statistical methods such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting or support vector machines to each region to determine an output value.

In this primer, we will explore TBM algorithms from a mathematical point of view, looking specifically at their properties and how they can be applied in practice for both regression and classification tasks. We will also cover common pitfalls and challenges involved with these techniques, as well as pointers to additional resources and tools that you may want to use when working with TBM algorithms. By the end of this primer, you should have a solid understanding of what TBM models are, how they work under the hood, and some practical tips for choosing the right model for your problem.

Let's dive in!
# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
## 2.1 Trees
A decision tree is a widely used non-parametric supervised learning method that works by recursively splitting the feature space into smaller regions based on a chosen variable and a threshold value. Each leaf node represents a class label, while internal nodes represent conditions that lead to those labels being assigned to new instances. The goal of training a decision tree is to create a set of rules that best predicts the outcome of new observations given their features. Decision trees tend to perform well even with limited data due to their ability to handle high dimensionality and nonlinear relationships between variables. 

The main steps of building a decision tree are:

1. Calculate the entropy of the target variable for the dataset;
2. Choose the split point (i.e., variable and threshold) that produces the lowest entropy gain;
3. Split the original dataset along the selected variable and threshold into two new datasets;
4. Recurse on each new dataset until all leaves contain only one class or there is no more than one unique attribute left to split on;
5. Assign a majority vote across all examples that fall within a leaf to produce the final predicted class label.


Figure 1. An example decision tree trained on a simple binary classification task with two classes (red and blue). The root node splits the input space according to the value of x_1, and each resulting branch leads to either a red or blue leaf node depending on the value of y. The size of each branch indicates its relative importance or weight. The number of branches that reach each leaf node indicates its confidence level.

## 2.2 Random Forests
Random forest (RF) is another popular TBM algorithm that combines multiple decision trees together to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy. RF trains multiple decision trees on bootstrapped samples of the data and aggregates their predictions through averaging or voting. The idea behind bootstrap sampling is that it creates an ensemble of similar but slightly different models rather than relying on a single highly accurate model. In addition, RF tends to achieve higher accuracy compared to other models like logistic regression because it uses bagging (bootstrap aggregation), which reduces variance and helps prevent overfitting.

## 2.3 Gradient Boosting
Gradient boosting (GBM) is yet another powerful TBM algorithm that has shown impressive performance on many machine learning competitions. GBM also involves combining multiple decision trees, but unlike RF, GBM focuses on reducing bias instead of variance. It does so by iteratively adding new trees that correct for errors made by previous iterations. This approach forces the model to focus on areas where it has performed poorly during training, leading to improved generalization error. GBMs can often outperform traditional machine learning approaches like logistic regression, especially when dealing with complex datasets.

## 2.4 Regularization
Regularization is a technique that can help prevent overfitting by constraining the complexity of a model. There are several regularization techniques available for TBM algorithms including Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, and Bagging. These techniques add a penalty term to the loss function that measures the difference between the true and predicted values. For instance, if a coefficient (or parameter) becomes too large, the model starts to fit noise instead of signal and overfits the training data. By shrinking the coefficients towards zero, the regularization techniques push the model towards a simpler solution that better fits the data.

Bagging and boosting are two primary regularization techniques for TBM algorithms. Both methods involve creating an ensemble of models rather than just a single model. Bagging takes advantage of the fact that each individual model performs poorly on its own due to randomness inherent in bootstrapping. Bootstrapping randomly selects a subset of the data without replacement and fits a separate model on that subset. The result is an ensemble of models that generalize better than any individual model could alone. Similarly, boosting adds weak learners sequentially, each improving upon the previous learner by adjusting its weights accordingly. By selecting different learners at each step, boosting can achieve even better results than bagging alone.
