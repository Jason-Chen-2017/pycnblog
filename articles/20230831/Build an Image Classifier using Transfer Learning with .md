# 1.简介
  

Image classification is one of the most common tasks in computer vision. It involves categorizing images into different classes or categories based on visual features such as textures and shapes. In this article, we will learn how to build a deep neural network model for image classification by transfer learning from pre-trained models called CNNs. The main idea behind transfer learning is to use a pre-trained model that has been trained on large datasets like ImageNet to extract important features from our own dataset and fine-tune it further for our specific task. We can also use multiple layers of pre-trained models together to improve the accuracy of our classifier. In addition to these core concepts, we need to familiarize ourselves with some new terms such as VGG, ResNet, Inception, MobileNet etc., which are used extensively in transfer learning. Finally, we will implement the code for building the image classifier and evaluate its performance.
The goal of this blog post is not just to teach you about transfer learning but also to provide practical insights so that you can start applying it immediately without needing prior knowledge of machine learning algorithms or programming languages. However, if you have some background knowledge in either field, feel free to share your experience. Let's get started!
# 2.背景介绍
Transfer learning is a popular technique used in deep learning where a pre-trained model is used to extract useful features from a large dataset and then fine-tuned for a particular task. This process reduces training time and enables us to train high-quality classifiers on small datasets more quickly. There are several advantages of using transfer learning:

1. Speed up the development time significantly: Pre-trained models already contain a lot of learned features, which means that we don't have to spend time training them from scratch on our own data. Moreover, the extracted features are often very rich and useful for many other related tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and captioning. So by leveraging these pre-trained features, we can speed up the development process dramatically.

2. Reduce overfitting problem: Since the pre-trained model was trained on large datasets, it is likely to capture useful patterns and relationships among the input and output variables. As a result, it tends to generalize well to unseen data. On the other hand, when we fine-tune the pre-trained model on our own dataset, we can introduce additional noise or bias that can cause overfitting issues. To avoid this issue, we can regularize the weights during training to prevent neurons from memorizing the training set too closely.

3. Improve the accuracy of predictions: By extracting useful features from the pre-trained model, we can feed those features directly into a fully connected layer or a convolutional layer to make accurate predictions. These improved predictions can be better than those made solely from raw pixel values.

In this tutorial, we will discuss the following topics:

2. Different types of pre-trained models including VGG, ResNet, and Inception

3. Building an image classifier using Pytorch and implementing transfer learning

4. Evaluating the performance of the image classifier


# 3.基本概念术语说明
To begin with, let's briefly go over some commonly used terms and their definitions.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a type of artificial neural network that is specifically designed for processing spatial data, such as images. CNNs consist of layers of interconnected filters that apply transformations to the input image to detect certain features such as edges, corners, and textures. Each filter learns to identify a specific feature by analyzing its receptive field. In other words, each unit in a CNN operates on small local regions of the input data, thus creating a sparse representation of the entire input space. The resulting feature maps are passed through a pooling layer, which summarizes the information in the feature maps to reduce the dimensionality of the representation while maintaining the salient features of the inputs. The final output of the CNN is typically a set of class probabilities or regression values depending on whether the task is classification or regression respectively.

One advantage of CNNs over traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) is that they can automatically learn hierarchical representations of the input data. For instance, an image may contain several objects, and the CNN can automatically group these objects together according to their appearance similarities, even across scales. Similarly, audio signals may contain complex patterns of sound events and vibrations, and a CNN can learn to recognize these sounds accurately even under varying conditions such as variations in ambient lighting.

Transfer learning is a method of reusing parts of a pre-trained neural network for a new task. The pre-trained model is usually trained on a large dataset such as ImageNet, which contains millions of labeled images categorized into different classes. Once the model is trained, we can remove the last few layers of the network and replace them with our own custom layers. During the initial phase of training, the removed layers act as feature detectors and the remaining layers take care of the classification task. Afterward, the weight parameters of the remaining layers are adjusted to minimize the loss function for the new task. The key aspect of transfer learning is that it allows us to leverage powerful pre-trained models for solving challenging problems faster.

There are several types of pre-trained models available:

1. **VGG**: VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group, who published two papers titled "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition" and "SimCLR: A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations". Both papers propose a novel architecture that stacks multiple convolutional layers followed by max pooling operations. While the original paper uses only three convolutional layers in each block, later researchers extended the number of layers in each block until the depth reaches ten, allowing them to achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification. Another contribution of the paper is introducing a simple contrastive learning algorithm called SimCLR to further enhance the discriminative power of the CNN.

2. **ResNet**: ResNet is another breakthrough architecture proposed by He et al. in their 2015 paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition". They argue that stacking residual blocks leads to deeper networks that are easier to train and obtain better results. In practice, ResNet consists of several modules consisting of a stack of residual blocks followed by a linear projection operation. At the beginning of training, the model might not perform very well due to its narrow solution space, but as the training progresses, the residual connections help to create more robust solutions that can handle larger input sizes. One challenge faced by earlier versions of ResNet was that they had limited connectivity between consecutive blocks, leading to degradation of performance. Later researchers addressed this issue by introducing various skip connections that enable models to pass higher-level features to lower levels. 

3. **Inception**: Google released an updated version of GoogLeNet called Inception v3 in 2016. The name refers to the fact that the architecture now incorporates parallel branches of convolutional layers within the same block. Each branch produces a separate output with a different set of filters. Unlike standard CNN architectures that focus on capturing global features, Inception improves upon these approaches by exploiting both local and global information. An added benefit of Inception is that it helps to stabilize the training process by reducing the dependence on random initialization of weights. 

Now that we've covered some fundamental concepts and terminologies, let's move on to the actual implementation of the image classifier using transfer learning.
