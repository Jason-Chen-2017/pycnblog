# 1.简介
  

Twitter作为当下最流行的社交媒体平台，其用户量正在以惊人的速度增长。但同时也带来了一个新的问题，那就是:当一个用户关注其他用户后，他其实并不知道自己的关注者们都在干什么，他也不能让自己关注的人产生更大的影响。这就意味着，如果有人对你产生了兴趣，而你却没有回应，那么你的影响力将会越来越小，甚至可能会完全消失。因此，Twitter创始人Jeff Sessions曾经说过："Follow others and you may become their worst critic."这句话，虽然听起来有点莽撞，但确实道出了一个重要的事实:在社交网络上，追随真正热爱的人比在陌生人圈里追随他们还要难得多。那么，如何找到真正的好友呢?下面我们就一起讨论一下这个问题。

## 2.1 Followers & Following
> A person who is following another user on Twitter appears to that other user as a "follower". This means that the follower will receive notifications from the followed user when they tweet or post something of their own, or comment on someone else's post. They can also interact with the tweets and posts of the followed user in ways such as liking or retweeting them, replying to their comments, etc. However, unlike people who are merely being followed by someone else, followers have a right to express opinions and ideas themselves through tweeting, blog posts, photos, etc., which could potentially lead to their attention being boosted.

> When a user creates an account on Twitter, they start off not following anyone yet. As time goes by, users can choose to follow other users (known as "friends" on some platforms) who share common interests, preferences, or knowledge. Once a user has followed several people, it becomes difficult for them to keep track of all those updates – but if enough followers act in a certain way, this can create a powerful positive feedback loop where people can form strong connections over time. 

> On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are other types of social media accounts known as "sponsors" or "advertisers". These organizations typically use these features to promote their brand or products by recommending other users' profiles to view and engage with their ads. However, sponsorships and advertisements do not necessarily require following back, since sponsored content often gathers views without directly affecting the original authors. 

In conclusion, while many people may associate "following" and "followers", it is important to distinguish between the two concepts. Followers are individuals who follow another user; they receive notifications about new tweets, likes, and retweets made by the followed user, and they can participate in discussions and interactions on their behalf. While sponsors and advertisers might be associated with "following," they generally do not fall under the definition of what we commonly think of as follows. Instead, they are third-party companies promoting their services and products, rather than direct connections between users. In summary, it is crucial to understand the distinction between followers and follows, so that you can make informed decisions about how to interact with your social network.
## 2.2 Follow vs. Favorite vs. Retweet
In addition to viewing content created by the followed user, followers also gain access to different kinds of information related to the person they are following:
- Their Tweets/posts can appear on their profile page, alongside other recent activity like likes and retweets, giving them visibility into the user's public opinion and activities.
- Users can also explore other users' bios and websites by clicking on their names within tweets, allowing them to get more information about the individual before making a decision to follow or connect.
- If a user wishes to stay up-to-date with only a select group of users, they can mute specific ones using the "mute" feature available at the bottom of their timeline. Alternatively, users can block specific users who they disagree with or who they don't want to see their posts shared with anymore.
- Finally, if a user finds one or more interesting posts, they can save them to their favorites list, allowing them to easily access them later. Likewise, if a user wants to reshare an informative or entertaining post, they can "retweet" it, copying its contents and forwarding it to their followers. Retweets can provide valuable insights and inspiration for creators, but should be used judiciously to avoid spamming users or creating promotional friction.
