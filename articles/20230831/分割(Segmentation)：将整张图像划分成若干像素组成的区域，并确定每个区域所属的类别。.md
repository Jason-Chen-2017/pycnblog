# 1.简介
  

图像分割（Segmentation）是计算机视觉领域的一个重要方向，它旨在从原始图像中提取感兴趣的对象、道路、场景等，并对其进行分析和理解，实现图像内容的自动化识别、理解和检索。图像分割的主要任务是将图像中的物体、空间、场景等进行细化，并按照其特征进行分类、识别和定位。一般来说，图像分割可以分为两大类：结构分割和实例分割。结构分割就是将图像像素点分成不同的部分，如不同类别的物体，边界等；而实例分割则是依据物体的外形或轮廓，对同一个物体的不同位置进行分割。实例分割一般用于目标检测、跟踪等领域，而结构分割则被广泛应用于图像修复、风格迁移、超分辨率图像等领域。
传统的图像分割方法包括基于阈值的分割、轮廓检测、混合模型分割等。其中基于阈值的分割最为常用，它根据像素值或者颜色直方图等统计量，把图像像素点分为前景和背景两类。阈值往往通过经验手段设置或者通过优化算法求解。但是，阈值分割的方法容易受到噪声、光照变化、场景复杂性等因素的影响，并不一定精确。因此，为了更加准确地分割图像，近年来出现了基于机器学习的分割算法。机器学习是一种从数据中学习并改善模型的方式，可以用来解决图像分割相关的问题。目前，一些高级机器学习方法已经可以比较有效地实现图像分割任务。
# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1. What is Segmentation?
Image segmentation refers to the process of partitioning an image into multiple regions based on their visual features or characteristics. The goal of segmentation is to create segments with distinct semantic meaning that can be used for further analysis and processing. There are two main types of segmentation: structure-based (semantic segmentaton) and instance-based (object detection). In instance-based methods, we want to identify individual objects within an image while in structure-based methods, we aim to extract features such as borders, textures, shapes etc. from a whole image without caring about the contextual relationships between objects. In this article, I will mainly focus on structurally-based image segmentation using deep learning techniques. However, before moving ahead, let's briefly understand some fundamental terms and concepts related to image segmentation:

1. Image: An image can be any type of digital representation of information including but not limited to photographs, drawings, paintings, scenery images, medical scans, satellite images, and video footage. Images typically have a spatial dimension and may contain various attributes such as color, depth, texture, motion blur, sharpness, occlusion etc. 

2. Pixels: A pixel is a single point where an image takes on one value per channel such as red, green, blue, alpha values, intensity, depth, normal vectors etc. Each pixel has its own unique x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and z-coordinate location in space relative to other pixels.

3. Superpixel: A superpixel is a group of adjacent pixels whose properties (such as color, texture, shape, etc.) exhibit similarities. Some examples of superpixels include graph cuts, which represent high connectivity areas in images as superpixels, and rich feature extraction, which identifies important patterns in images and creates superpixels based on those patterns.

4. Object: An object is defined as a set of pixels that belong together due to common characteristics. For example, in an image of a human being, the pixels corresponding to his face would be considered part of the same object. Objects can also be thought of as connected components of a binary image after filtering out all isolated pixels.

5. Class label/category: A class label is a categorical assignment of an object to a particular category such as "cat", "dog" etc. It is useful when different objects need to be grouped together under a single classification scheme. For instance, in an image of a city, a road, and a person, we could assign each object to its respective category such as road and person categories. 

## 2.2. Why Use Segmentation?
One of the main reasons why we use segmentation algorithms is because it enables us to analyze complex real-world scenes more easily than if they were unprocessed. This leads to enhanced understanding of our data, faster decision making processes, better decision-making tools, and improved outcomes. By applying segmentation algorithms, businesses can increase sales, enhance customer experience, improve productivity, and optimize resources. Additionally, by separating objects within an image, artificial intelligence systems can help perform tasks like image search, recognition, and retrieval. Overall, segmentation technologies have become increasingly essential in fields ranging from medicine to agriculture to computer vision. Therefore, there is a growing demand for professionals who possess expertise in both machine learning and image processing to develop effective segmentation solutions.
