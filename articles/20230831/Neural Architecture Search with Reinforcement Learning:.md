## 1.1 概念介绍
在图像处理、自然语言处理等领域都有使用神经网络进行自动化任务的尝试，但传统的方法往往存在固定的结构（比如CNN），难以充分地利用神经网络的潜力和优化机遇。因此，近几年出现了深度强化学习（Deep Reinforcement Learning）方法，通过对动作空间和状态空间的探索来搜索并找到更适合任务的神经网络结构，以解决人类所面临的复杂问题。

Recent advances in neural architecture search using reinforcement learning have made tremendous progress towards finding more efficient and effective neural network architectures for a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art research on NAS techniques based on reinforcement learning (RL). We also present an overview of recent advancements, including automated neural architecture search, continuous NAS, multi-task learning, and transfer learning, as well as potential challenges and future directions. Finally, we discuss limitations, open problems, and opportunities for further research in NAS with RL. 

In summary, our review provides a comprehensive account of recent advances in NAS with RL techniques that provide new ways to automate the design of complex deep neural networks. By combining exploration and exploitation techniques, these algorithms can find better neural network architectures than handcrafted approaches while still achieving competitive performance. However, there are many open challenges, such as handling large models and high-dimensional input spaces, which require additional attention from the community. Moreover, recent work has shown that strong supervision is necessary to enable successful NAS and transfer learning, but few works have examined how to effectively leverage weak supervision or unlabeled data. Therefore, future work should focus on developing practical methods for leveraging domain expertise, small datasets, and large-scale experiments to promote NAS success in practice.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
Before delving into the details of various NAS techniques based on RL, let’s first understand some basic concepts and terms used commonly in RL literature.

2.1 Markov Decision Process(MDP)
A Markov decision process (MDP) consists of an agent interacting with an environment. At each time step, the agent takes an action, which affects the next state of the system. The reward function specifies the utility gained by being in a particular state. Given a policy π, the goal of MDP is to learn the optimal strategy for maximizing long term rewards, i.e., the value function Vπ = maxaQ(s,a;theta), where Q∗ denotes the optimal state-action value function, theta represents the parameters of the model, and s is the current state. 

2.2 Policy
The policy defines what actions the agent will take at each time step. It specifies the probability distribution over all possible actions given any state. A greedy policy selects the action that leads to the highest expected immediate reward at every state, whereas a random policy chooses an action uniformly randomly at each state.

2.3 Value Function
The value function assigns a real number to each state, which estimates the total reward that can be obtained starting from that state and taking an arbitrary action. The value of a state depends only on the values assigned to its neighbors, not on the actual transitions themselves. The objective of the value iteration algorithm is to estimate the value function in a way that it converges to the true underlying value function under the chosen MDP policy.

2.4 Q-Learning
Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to solve MDPs. It uses the Bellman equation to update the estimated values of the states and actions iteratively until convergence. At each iteration, the algorithm selects an action according to the current estimation of the value function, and then updates the Q function accordingly by adding a small amount of error to the previous estimate. This procedure guarantees that the updated estimate remains close to the optimal solution. 

2.5 Exploration vs Exploitation
Exploration refers to the act of trying out different actions to determine which one might lead to higher rewards. While exploring the space of possible actions, the agent may discover unexpected clues about the environment and exploit them to improve its knowledge of the task. On the other hand, exploiting known knowledge to make incremental improvements to the policy encourages the agent to stick to the best action so far and avoid unnecessary exploration. As the agent interacts with the environment, it gradually becomes more confident in its choice of actions and begins exploiting their effects rather than searching for novel ones.

2.6 Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL)
Deep reinforcement learning involves training agents to control environments using deep neural networks. DRL builds upon classical reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning by introducing several key features, such as deep neural network policies, experience replay, and off-policy learning. These techniques allow the agent to learn from trajectories generated by multiple actors in parallel, making it robust against stochasticity and diverse policies. In contrast to traditional RL algorithms, DRL requires significantly larger amounts of data due to its use of deep neural networks, which can make it harder to scale up to problems with millions of states and actions.
