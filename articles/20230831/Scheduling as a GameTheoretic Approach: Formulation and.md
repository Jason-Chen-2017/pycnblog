：Scheduling is an important problem in computer science that involves allocating tasks to resources for maximizing utilization of the system resources while satisfying various constraints such as precedence, deadline, and resource availability. In this article, we will explore how scheduling can be formulated as a game-theoretic approach using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). MDPs have been widely used to model decision making problems from both theoretical and practical standpoints. By introducing scheduling as a game-theoretic approach, we hope to provide insights into some fundamental aspects of scheduling as it relates to modern AI systems.

This article assumes a basic understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) concepts like games, strategies, state spaces, policies, value functions, and optimality criteria. It also provides a general overview of MDP models with examples drawn from real world applications. We assume readers are familiar with techniques for solving MDPs including dynamic programming, reinforcement learning, Q-learning, and Monte Carlo methods. 

In summary, the main goal of this article is to introduce the reader to scheduling as a game-theoretic approach and present relevant mathematical tools such as state transition dynamics and stochastic transitions to analyze and improve the performance of scheduling algorithms. The presentation should enable the audience to gain a deeper understanding of how scheduling has impacted various industries, specifically software development, healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Additionally, by providing sample code implementations and explanations, the authors aim to help readers understand and apply these principles more effectively to their own work. Lastly, they propose future directions in which scheduling could be applied to solve complex problems involving multiple agents or objectives. 


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Games and Strategies 
A game consists of two players and a set of actions available to each player. Each action results in a change in the state of the environment. Players take turns selecting actions based on the strategy function defined for them. At any point, if either player reaches a terminal state without a winner, then the game ends and there is no further play. A zero-sum game refers to situations where one player's expected reward does not depend on the other player's actions; alternatively, a positive-sum game refers to situations where one player's expected reward depends on the other player's actions. There are different variations of the classic tic-tac-toe game, including non-symmetrical games such as connect four or go, solitaire games, and card games.

One common strategy for a zero-sum game is to use minimax algorithm, which recursively evaluates all possible outcomes until the end of the game. Starting from the root node, the algorithm determines the best move by comparing the values of the current board position along with its children nodes through the outcome of the next turn. For instance, in tic-tac-toe, the maximum value of the current board position gives the algorithm information about whether it is advantageous to make the top left corner move or to block the opponent from winning. Minimax works well when both players follow the same strategy, but may result in suboptimal decisions under adversarial conditions. Other popular strategies include AlphaBeta pruning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), iterative deepening search, and expectiminimax. 

Another common strategy for a positive-sum game is Adversarial Search Algorithm (ASA), which simulates several iterations of self-play between two players against each other to find the most beneficial strategy. ASA uses neural networks to represent the policy functions and train them using temporal difference learning. As a result, ASA often finds better strategies than human experts in the games they play. However, ASA requires extensive computation power and can be slow to converge to a good solution. Therefore, more advanced approaches such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) have emerged to speed up training and achieve competitive results in games with large state spaces.  

Overall, various strategies can be used to evaluate the quality of a given strategy profile and identify areas for improvement. These strategies include exploitation vs exploration tradeoff, optimistic/pessimistic evaluation, and likelihood-ratio test. With proper tuning of hyperparameters, these strategies can significantly affect the performance of the resulting schedule. 

## 2.2 State Spaces
State space refers to the total number of states that a game can reach at any point during its play. In chess, for example, the state space includes every possible combination of pieces on the board, positions of all kingdoms and the game rules, and each piece's ability to perform legal moves. Similarly, in scheduling, the state space encompasses the full range of possible schedules for a particular job assignment, project allocation, inventory management task, etc., depending on the specific domain being considered. Identifying the critical parts of the state space and developing appropriate heuristics to prune the search tree can dramatically reduce the computational complexity required to obtain good solutions.

To create a rich enough representation of the state space, it is essential to capture the complex relationships among individual components, such as dependencies between jobs, projects, and people involved in the process. The exact meaning of the components and their interactions within the state space determine the scope and complexity of the problem. Consequently, designing a suitable state representation is crucial to ensuring effective planning and optimization. Common representations include tabular representation, graph representation, hybrid representation, and functional representation.


## 2.3 Policy Functions and Value Functions
Policy function specifies the probability distribution over the available actions for each state. It represents what action the agent prefers to take in each situation, conditioned on observing the current state. Action selection is typically based on evaluating the probabilities assigned to different actions in order to maximize utility or minimize penalties. On the contrary, value function estimates the long-term utility obtained by taking a certain action in a given state. The value function quantifies the expected return of the agent over many possible successor states, given the current state and the taken action. Both policy and value functions are key components of reinforcement learning.

Policy gradient method is another commonly used technique for optimizing policy functions. In this method, the agent adjusts its parameters according to the gradients computed based on the collected experience from playing the game. The parameter update rule directly computes the direction of the gradient as the product of the difference between the actual and predicted rewards, which leads to faster convergence than traditional gradient descent. To handle large state spaces, actor-critic method is used to decouple policy optimization from value function approximation. Actor learns the optimal policy by updating the network parameters to maximize the expected discounted returns, while critic learns the value function by estimating the expected return of the policy under a given observation. This separation allows the agent to focus on improving the policy quickly, without being blocked by computing accurate estimates of the value function.

## 2.4 Optimality Criteria
Optimality criterion measures the level of quality of a solution produced by an algorithm. In the context of scheduling, three common criteria are latency, completion time, and monetary cost. Latency measures the time elapsed since the start of a project until it is completed successfully, while completion time denotes the amount of time required to complete all tasks. Cost measures the financial costs incurred by completing a project before its due date, such as material purchases, personnel hires, and overhead expenses. Optimality criteria can guide the choice of scheduling algorithms, such as greedy heuristic algorithms or simulation-based optimization algorithms. Greedy heuristics optimize the objective by always choosing the task that brings the greatest progress towards the objective so far, regardless of the potential impact on overall performance. Simulation-based optimization algorithms simulate different scenarios to estimate the effectiveness of different schedules. They generate numerous candidate schedules and select the ones that are likely to achieve high performance, based on the statistics derived from simulated runs.


# 3. Mathematical Formulation
## 3.1 Background Introduction: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a class of decision-making problems where an agent interacts with an uncertain environment to decide on an action based on incomplete knowledge of its surroundings. An MDP consists of a tuple $(S, A, T, R, \gamma)$, where $S$ represents the set of states, $A(s)$ represents the set of actions available in state $s$, $T(s,a,s')$ represents the conditional probability distribution of the next state $s'$ given state $s$ and action $a$, $R(s,a,s')$ represents the immediate reward achieved after executing action $a$ in state $s$ and landing in state $s'$, and $\gamma\in[0,1]$ is the discount factor, which controls the importance of delayed rewards. The problem of finding the optimal policy is known as the Bellman equation, which defines the optimal value function $V^*(s)$ for each state $s$. The optimal policy $\pi^{*}(s)$ at state $s$ specifies the action with highest expected value for that state, i.e., $\pi^{*} = argmax_{a\in A} \mathbb{E}[R_t + \gamma V^*(S_{t+1})]$. Under certain assumptions on the MDP, such as finite-horizon, deterministic transitions, and known transition probabilities, closed-form solutions exist that give explicit expressions for $V^*$ and $\pi^{*}$. In reality, however, significant challenges arise because of the inherent stochasticity of the environment and imperfect perception. 

## 3.2 Formulating Scheduling as an MDP
Given a job assignment, a project allocation, or a machine allocation problem, let us consider the following scenario:
- There are n workers available for the job, represented by the set {w1, w2,..., wn}.
- Each worker has a skill set, consisting of k skills. Skill j is represented by binary variable xij, indicating whether worker i possesses skill j.
- There are m tasks associated with the job, each having a duration Dj and requiring a subset of skills Xj. Task tj is represented by the set {tj} U Xj, where tj represents the set containing only task tj and Xj represents the set of skills required by tj. 
- Job completion times vary based on the difficulty of the tasks and the current workload of the workers. Let c(ti,wi) denote the completion time of task ti for worker wi.

The problem of assigning tasks to workers can be formalized as follows: 
Let $S$ be the set of all possible assignments of tasks to workers, namely ${s|s=\{(i,j)|x_i^j=1\}\cup\{j|(i,\overline{j}): x_\overline{i}^j=1\}}$. Then $A(s)=\{a|\forall i:(t_i\cap s)\neq \emptyset, a=(s-\{t_i\})\cup \{t_i\}, |s|=k\}$ represents the set of valid actions that remove task ti from s and add it back to worker wi. Let $T(s,a,s')={c(\overline{t}_i,j):i\in s, j\not\in s'}$ denote the transition distribution from state s to state s'. Here $\overline{t}_i$ means the set of remaining tasks that need to be assigned to worker i, i.e., $\overline{t}_i=\{(t_{\prime}|t_{\prime}\in t_i\land s'\not\subseteq t_{\prime})\}$. Finally, let $R(s,a,s')=-\min_i\sum_{t\in s}D_t+\max_{i<j}\sum_{t\in s}(c(t,j)-c(t,i))$ denote the immediate reward for performing action a, assuming negative weights proportional to durations of tasks in descending order and higher absolute differences between completion times of tasks performed by distinct workers. 

The above MDP describes the core components of the scheduling problem: the state space includes all possible assignments of tasks to workers, the action space includes removing a task and adding it back to a free worker, and the transition function assigns uniform probability mass to all valid actions. Reward function reflects the relative benefits of achieving a smaller completion time for each task across all workers, while discourages unbalanced workload distributions. Although it is easy to derive optimal solutions, computing the optimal policy becomes impractical for larger state spaces and complex scheduling requirements. Instead, we must rely on efficient heuristics or metaheuristics to find approximate solutions efficiently, while considering additional constraints such as avoiding conflicts and meeting deadlines. 

To simplify our discussion, we assume that each worker is capable of processing only one task at a time. In addition, we ignore the uncertainty related to execution times and instead treat them as deterministic. This assumption simplifies the problem and avoids cluttering the notation with unnecessary variables. However, the key idea behind scheduling still applies - finding the most valuable assignments of tasks to workers while satisfying constraints like precedence, deadline, and resource availability.
