在机器学习领域，Principal Component Analysis (PCA)是一种特征降维的方法。它可以将高维数据转换到低维空间中，并保留最重要的方差特征，即主成分（principal components）。PCA是一种无监督的降维方法，不需要标签信息，只需要原始数据即可。

### 3.1 Problem of Dimensionality Reduction 

Suppose we have a dataset containing n samples with p features each. We would like to reduce this high dimensional feature space into a lower dimensional subspace that captures most of the information in the original space while minimizing redundancy. One way to achieve this is by applying Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which is a popular unsupervised method for reducing the number of dimensions in datasets. However, before going deep into PCA, let's understand why we need to perform such a task at all?

1. Information loss: It is well known that many complex problems can be simplified by reducing their input dimensionality. This helps us focus on the relevant information instead of overfitting noise and irrelevant features.
2. Visualization and interpretation: In high dimensional spaces, it becomes difficult to visualize and interpret the relationships between variables directly. By reducing the dimensionality, we are able to capture important patterns or structure within our dataset and explore it more easily.
3. Computation efficiency: Many machine learning algorithms require inputs with low dimensionality due to computational constraints. Furthermore, some algorithms may converge faster when working with reduced dimensionality representations than their full dimensionality counterparts.
4. Preprocessing: Since most machine learning models require numerical values as input, performing PCA allows us to preprocess the data so that it has zero mean and unit variance prior to feeding it to the model. This ensures that every variable has equal contribution towards the final output. 


### 3.2 PCA Algorithm and Mathematical Foundation 
PCA works by first finding the correlation between different features in the dataset. It then applies linear transformations to align these correlations along new axes that maximize the explained variance. These transformed axes represent the principal components of the dataset.

The main steps involved in implementing PCA are:

1. Standardize the data: To ensure that each feature has zero mean and unit variance, we need to center the data around zero and scale it up by dividing through the standard deviation.
2. Calculate the covariance matrix: A covariance matrix measures how two variables vary together. We will use numpy to calculate the covariance matrix C. 
3. Find the eigenpairs of C: Eigendecomposition of a symmetric square matrix reveals its eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues. Specifically, we want to find k eigenvectors whose corresponding eigenvalues correspond to the k largest nonzero eigenvalues of C. We can do this efficiently using the power iteration method implemented in scipy library.
4. Choose the top K principal components: After obtaining the eigenpairs, we choose the top K eigenvectors to form the basis of the new subspace. The weights assigned to each principal component determine how much each feature contributes to the variation captured by that component.
5. Transform the data onto the subspace: Finally, we transform the original data set X by multiplying it with the selected eigenvectors.

Let’s look closer at these five steps in detail. 

#### Step 1: Center and Scale the Data
We start by taking the following steps: 

1. Subtract the mean value of each feature from the data X. This centers the data around zero. 
2. Divide each observation by its standard deviation, giving us centered and scaled data Y.  

This step is crucial for achieving zero mean and unit variance. Without standardization, most machine learning algorithms assume that the input features are already normalized or follow a specific distribution, leading to incorrect estimates of the coefficients and predictions.   

Here's the python code for this step:  

    # subtract mean
    mu = np.mean(X, axis=0)
    X_centered = X - mu
    
    # divide by standard deviation
    sigma = np.std(X_centered, axis=0, ddof=0)
    X_scaled = X_centered / sigma
    
#### Step 2: Calculate Covariance Matrix  
A covariance matrix measures how two variables vary together. We take the dot product of each column vector in X_scaled with itself, resulting in a n x n matrix C, where n is the number of samples. Each element cij represents the covariance between i-th and j-th feature vectors. Here's the python code for calculating the covariance matrix:  

    cov_matrix = np.dot(X_scaled.T, X_scaled) / len(X_scaled)
    
#### Step 3: Find Eigenpairs of C  
Eigendecomposition of a symmetric square matrix reveals its eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues. Specifically, we want to find k eigenvectors whose corresponding eigenvalues correspond to the k largest nonzero eigenvalues of C. Here, we implement the power iteration method to efficiently find them.  

    # initialize random vector u and normalize it
    u = np.random.rand(cov_matrix.shape[0])
    u /= np.linalg.norm(u)
    
    # run power iterations to find eigenvectors 
    for i in range(k):
        v = np.dot(cov_matrix, u)
        u = np.dot(cov_matrix.T, v)
        
    eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eig(np.dot(cov_matrix, np.linalg.inv(np.diag(eigvals))))
        
#### Step 4: Choose Top K Principal Components  
After obtaining the eigenvectors, we select only those that correspond to the top K largest eigenvalues to form the basis of the new subspace. The weights assigned to each principal component determine how much each feature contributes to the variation captured by that component.  

    eig_sorted_indices = np.argsort(eigvals)[::-1]
    eig_top_K = eigvecs[:, eig_sorted_indices[:k]]
    
#### Step 5: Transform the Data onto the Subspace  
Finally, we transform the original data set X by multiplying it with the selected eigenvectors. We obtain the transformed representation of X as Z = X * W, where W is the weight matrix obtained after choosing the top K eigenvectors.  

    Z = X @ eig_top_K 

And that's it! We now have a transformed version of the input data in a lower dimensional subspace that contains most of the information from the original space while retaining the minimum amount of redundancy.
