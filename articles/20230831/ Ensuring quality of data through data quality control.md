Data quality refers to the degree to which data is accurate and complete, consistent with business requirements and standards. Data quality management (DQM) focuses on identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies within a dataset to ensure its reliability for use by downstream applications. The process involves several stages such as: 

1. Identifying sources of error
2. Determining the nature of the errors
3. Correcting the errors
4. Validating that corrections have improved data quality over time 

Data quality plays an essential role in various industries such as banking, healthcare, manufacturing, finance, transportation, insurance, retail, etc., where it becomes critical for decision making processes and delivering high value products and services. However, managing data quality can be challenging due to large volumes of data being stored, analyzed and processed continuously. It requires efficient methods for analyzing, cleaning, transforming and integrating datasets from different sources and enforcing rules and policies to maintain data quality. Therefore, there is a need for automated tools that support DQM efforts across all levels of organizations.

In this article, we will focus on how data quality can be ensured using automated machine learning techniques. We will cover the basics of data quality and then proceed towards building models to detect and correct errors in datasets. Finally, we will discuss the potential limitations of these approaches, challenges faced while implementing them and the future scope of research in this area.

2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the technical details, let's quickly go over some basic concepts and terminology related to data quality management.

Dataset: A collection of data items that are related to each other and intended to provide useful information about a specific topic or subject. In general, a dataset could represent transactions made online, sales data collected from multiple stores, medical records, etc.

Record: A single piece of data in a dataset, typically represented as a row or column containing values associated with attributes of interest. For instance, a record in a transaction dataset might contain information about a particular customer like their name, age, address, transaction amount, date of purchase, etc.

Attribute: A descriptive feature of a record, representing something measurable that may be relevant to the context of the data set. Attributes can include demographic information such as age, gender, income level, location, education level, occupation, etc.; temporal features such as dates, times, events; financial features such as amounts, account balances, etc.; logical features such as booleans, flags, enums, codes, categories, etc.

Data Element: An individual item or unit of measurement in a dataset. Examples of data elements include individual names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, birthdates, heights, weights, etc.

Entity Type: A collection of similar entities that share common characteristics and properties. Examples of entity types include customers, accounts, products, devices, employees, facilities, locations, vehicles, etc.

Attribute Types: Categories that group attributes based on certain criteria. They can include categorical attributes such as colors, sizes, brands, countries, genders, etc.; ordinal attributes such as ratings, scores, ranks, etc.; interval attributes such as prices, distances, durations, etc.; ratio attributes such as ratios, proportions, percentages, etc. Attribute types help organize and analyze data more efficiently, leading to better insights and decisions.

Metadata: Additional information about a dataset that provides additional context or understanding beyond the core data itself. Metadata includes descriptions, labels, tags, ownership, access permissions, usage guidelines, etc. Common metadata fields include creation date, last update date, source system, owner, status, license type, etc. Metadata helps improve overall data quality by enabling users to understand why a given dataset exists, who created it, what purpose it serves, how reliable it is, when it was last updated, etc.

Quality Control Rule: Policies or procedures defined by organizational leaders to guide data quality practices and activities. These rules typically specify the steps involved in evaluating, assessing, correcting and maintaining data quality within the enterprise. Quality control rules vary depending on the industry, domain or sector and are designed to align with company objectives, corporate strategy, goals, and business needs.

Data Quality Model: A mathematical model used to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, consistency and appropriateness of data sets and determine whether they meet predefined thresholds. Data quality models attempt to predict trends, patterns and relationships among data points, helping to identify areas of concern and suggest ways to improve data quality. There are many existing data quality models available, including statistical, machine learning, and rule-based models.

Automation: Process of translating manual tasks into automated ones by utilizing computer technology. This automation enables businesses to perform complex operations automatically at scale, increasing efficiency, productivity and reducing costs. Automated data quality management reduces overhead, improves data accuracy, speeds up analysis cycles, increases data integrity, and saves valuable resources.

Limitations and Challenges
Although data quality management has been studied extensively since the early days of data processing, it still faces several challenges in real-world scenarios. Here are some of the major limitations and challenges faced while applying automated data quality management strategies:

1. Complexity of Data Quality Models: Developing effective and robust data quality models is not an easy task, especially if dealing with highly complex data structures and relationships. Machine learning algorithms require massive datasets and extensive computational power, requiring specialized expertise and skillsets.

2. Noisy Labels: Unsupervised learning algorithms do not always produce clean labels and therefore cannot identify erroneous data accurately without human intervention. To deal with noisy labels, one approach is to incorporate domain knowledge and expertise into the algorithm training process to reduce false positives and negatives.

3. Imbalanced Data Sets: Most datasets are imbalanced, meaning they have significantly different distributions of positive and negative examples. When working with imbalanced datasets, accuracy metrics such as precision and recall become misleading, as they only measure performance for the minority class. Another challenge is ensuring that data preprocessing and balancing techniques effectively balance both classes during training and testing phases.

4. Non-Stationary Data: Real-world data is dynamic and non-stationary, meaning it changes over time. Overtime, new data samples become available and outdated data samples become obsolete. As a result, data quality monitoring systems must adapt dynamically to capture and monitor data quality changes over time.

The above mentioned challenges make it necessary for companies to invest significant effort in developing effective and scalable automated data quality management solutions. Despite these challenges, automated data quality management holds the promise of improving data quality over time and accelerating data-driven decision-making processes.
