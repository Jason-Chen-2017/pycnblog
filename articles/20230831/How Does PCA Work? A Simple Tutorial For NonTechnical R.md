Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular technique used for dimensionality reduction in machine learning and data mining. Although it may seem like a simple algorithm at first glance, its inner workings can be quite complex and counterintuitive to understand initially. This article aims to provide an accessible yet comprehensive explanation of the core principles behind PCA and how to apply it effectively. 

This tutorial will assume that you are familiar with basic linear algebra concepts such as vectors, dot products, and matrix multiplication. If not, I recommend reviewing some relevant material before continuing.

Before we get started, let’s clarify what exactly PCA is: PCA is a method for reducing the dimensions of a dataset while preserving most of the information content. The input space is usually high-dimensional, meaning there are many features or variables included in each observation. By using PCA, we can compress these observations into fewer dimensions while retaining as much meaningful information as possible. In other words, PCA finds patterns amongst the data and identifies which directions explain the most variance in the data. These principal components can then be used to represent the original data in a compressed form.

# 2.基本概念及术语
## 2.1 数据集
The dataset is a collection of instances or records of different items/objects. Each instance has multiple attributes or features associated with it, such as age, gender, income level, etc. Examples of datasets include sales data, stock prices, and customer behavioral data.

We typically represent the dataset as a matrix where each row represents one record and each column represents one attribute. Thus, if our dataset consists of three columns: age, gender, and income, then it would look something like this:

| Age | Gender | Income |
|---|---|---|
| 35 | Male | High |
| 40 | Female | Medium |
| 27 | Other | Low |
|... |... |... |

Each row corresponds to a single person, with their corresponding age, gender, and income levels recorded. We use capital letters to denote matrices and lowercase letters to denote vectors.

## 2.2 属性（Attribute）
An attribute is a measurable property of a phenomenon being observed. It could be categorical or continuous depending on the underlying nature of the phenomenon. Continuous attributes such as temperature have numerical values whereas categorical attributes such as color only have discrete categories. For example, in our dataset, age, gender, and income are all attributes.

## 2.3 特征（Feature）
A feature refers to a particular aspect of an object that can be measured or observed. For example, a dog's breed, height, weight, and hair length are features of dogs. Features are often described in natural language sentences. In our dataset, age, gender, and income are examples of features.

## 2.4 样本（Sample）
A sample is a subset of data taken from a larger population or data set. An individual unit or entity is considered a single sample when it cannot be further subdivided into smaller units. Examples of samples include customers, housing listings, and clinical trials.

## 2.5 维度（Dimension）
The number of axes or dimensions involved in a vector or system. For example, a point in three-dimensional space has three dimensions (x, y, z). Similarly, a matrix contains rows and columns, so the total number of dimensions in a matrix would be equal to the sum of the number of rows and columns. Dimensions can also refer to the number of features in our dataset, but they should always be treated as synonymous terms.

## 2.6 方差（Variance）
Variance measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. It is calculated by dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a set by the mean (average) value of the set. Variance is important because it helps us determine whether a given variable explains a significant portion of the variance in the dataset. A large variance means the data points vary widely, while a small variance indicates the data points are relatively close together.

## 2.7 协方差（Covariance）
Covariance describes how two random variables change together. Mathematically, covariance is defined as the average of the product of the differences between pairs of observations in both variables. Covariance gives us information about the degree of correlation between two variables. For example, if one variable increases while another decreases, their covariance would be positive. On the other hand, if one variable increases while the other stays constant, their covariance would be zero or negative.

## 2.8 相关系数（Correlation coefficient）
The correlation coefficient (r) quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It ranges between -1 and +1, with 1 indicating strong positive correlation, 0 indicating no correlation, and -1 indicating strong negative correlation. Correlation coefficients measure how well two variables move together or against each other. They are useful for determining whether certain relationships exist within a dataset. However, keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation!

## 2.9 奇异值分解（Singular Value Decomposition, SVD）
SVD is a mathematical technique used to factorize a matrix into three parts: U, Σ, V^T. Here, U is an orthogonal matrix (i.e., it is equal to its transpose multiplied by itself), Σ is a diagonal matrix consisting of singular values, and V^T is the transpose of an orthogonal matrix representing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. SVD allows us to efficiently perform various operations on the dataset such as data compression, visualization, and clustering.

## 2.10 次元减少（Dimensionality Reduction）
Dimensionality reduction involves compressing high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional representations that capture the most important factors in the data. Principal component analysis (PCA) is one common approach used for dimensional reduction. PCA seeks to identify patterns amongst the data and reduce them to a few uncorrelated variables called principal components. Once the data has been reduced to its principal components, we can visualize it to gain insights into the structure and distribution of the data.

Overall, PCA works by identifying patterns amongst the data and projecting the original data onto a new basis formed by the selected principal components. This process transforms the original data into a new representation that captures as much of the variation in the data as possible without losing any important information.
