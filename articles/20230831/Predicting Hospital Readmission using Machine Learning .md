# 1.简介
  

Hospital readmission is one of the most common complications that patients experience during their stay in a hospital or healthcare system. It occurs when a patient fails to make an appointed visit after they have been admitted due to various reasons such as medical conditions, disability, lifestyle changes, and so on. Patients who do not receive adequate care can lead to chronic disease and financial losses, which directly affect their quality of life. 

To reduce readmissions and improve the overall health outcomes of patients, several machine learning models have been developed to predict whether a patient will return for another round of treatment within a given period of time. In this article, we are going to talk about four commonly used machine learning algorithms for predicting hospital readmission: logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and neural network (NN). These algorithms are based on statistical approaches and are designed to identify patterns and relationships between variables that may be indicative of readmission.

In addition to these algorithms, we also discuss some techniques and data preprocessing steps required to apply these algorithms effectively. We will use Python programming language with scikit-learn library to implement these methods step by step. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of each algorithm using appropriate evaluation metrics and compare them under different scenarios.

## 2.1 数据集
We will be using publicly available dataset called "Diabetes Dataset" from UCI repository for our experiments. The Diabetes Dataset contains information collected from diabetes patients over a period of nearly two years, including the number of pregnancies, glucose concentration levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, age, and whether they had been diagnosed with diabetes or not. The target variable in this dataset is whether a patient has been diagnosed with type II diabetes or not (binary classification problem). All other variables are continuous features. 

The dataset contains 768 records with 9 input variables (columns) and 1 output variable (column). Here's what each column represents:

 - **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant.
 - **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
 - **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
 - **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
 - **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
 - **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
 - **Age**: Age (years).
 - **Outcome**: Class variable representing if a person has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## 2.2 概率模型、分类器和评估指标
### 2.2.1 概率模型
A probability model is a mathematical representation of a set of possible outcomes and the likelihood of those outcomes occurring. Probability theory provides foundational principles and mathematics for reasoning with uncertainty. A probability model can take many forms depending on the context, but it typically involves a description of all possible outcomes together with conditional probabilities for each outcome. For example, let X be a discrete random variable with a finite number of possible values {x1, x2,..., xk}, then its probability model might look something like this:

P(X=xi) = p_i, i=1,...,k, where pi is the probability of value xi. This assumes that the probabilities are mutually exclusive, meaning that P(X=x1) + P(X=x2) +... + P(X=xk) = 1.

More complex probability models may involve multiple random variables, additional factors that influence the outcome, and possibly hidden variables that cannot be observed directly. However, we will focus solely on simple probability models consisting of only binary random variables (e.g., coin flip results, success/failure events) and assume that there are no interactions between the variables.

### 2.2.2 分类器
A classifier is a function that maps inputs into outputs. Typically, classifiers assign inputs to predefined classes according to certain criteria, such as assigning new observations to the class of the nearest training point, or calculating the posterior probability of each class given the observation. Two common types of classifiers include binary classifiers (e.g., positive/negative labels) and multiclass classifiers (e.g., assigning inputs to one of three categories).

For binary classification problems, the simplest classifier is the logistic function, which produces a squeezed probability between 0 and 1. The logistic function takes any real-valued input z and returns a value y ∈ [0, 1] that corresponds to the probability that y=1, assuming the input z follows a standard normal distribution. Mathematically, the logistic function satisfies the equation:

y = 1 / (1+exp(-z)),

where exp() is the exponential function, and z is linearly combined with the weights w belonging to the input vector x:

z = Σwi * xi.

To train a logistic regression model, we need to find suitable values for the weight vectors w using optimization methods such as gradient descent. Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions on new instances by applying the logistic function to the weighted sum of input features. To evaluate the accuracy of the model, we can use standard performance measures such as precision, recall, F1 score, area under ROC curve, etc.

Similarly, for multi-class classification problems, we can use one-vs-rest approach, where we create a separate binary classifier for each class and assign each instance to the class with highest predicted probability. Alternatively, we can use a softmax function instead of sigmoid to produce more meaningful probability estimates.

### 2.2.3 评估指标
An evaluation metric is a numerical measure of how well the model performs on a particular task. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification problems include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under ROC curve. Similarly, common evaluation metrics for multi-class classification problems include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

When selecting a model, we should always consider both its prediction power and its interpretability, which often comes down to the choice of evaluation metric. If the goal is to achieve high accuracy without being bogged down by low-precision false positives or misclassifications, then we should use accuracy as the evaluation metric. On the other hand, if we want to explain why the model made certain predictions, then we should use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. By choosing the right metric, we can trade off between accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics, allowing us to balance performance against interpretability.

# 3. Logistic Regression
## 3.1 基本原理
Logistic regression is a widely used supervised learning method for binary classification tasks. It is closely related to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and it uses sigmoid function to convert linear combination of input features into a probability value between 0 and 1. Specifically, the sigmoid function squashes the linear predictor $z=\sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i x_i$ into the range $(0, 1)$, which makes it useful for classification tasks where the dependent variable is binary. Intuitively, sigmoid function maps any real value into a value between 0 and 1, making it easy to interpret as a probability. Moreover, the cost function used in logistic regression is convex and differentiable, which allows us to easily optimize parameters using iterative algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent.

Here is a schematic diagram illustrating the basic idea behind logistic regression:


Suppose we have a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \cdots, (x_N, y_N)\}$, where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is the feature vector of the $i$-th instance, $y_i\in\{0, 1\}$ is the binary label indicating whether the $i$-th instance belongs to class 1 ($y_i=1$) or not ($y_i=0$), and $\hat{\pi}(x_i)=P(y_i=1|x_i;\theta)$ is the probability of the $i$-th instance being labeled as positive (assuming a binary logistic regression model). 

The logistic regression model consists of a logit link function $\eta(\cdot)$ defined as $g(\cdot)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\cdot)}$, whose inverse is $h(\cdot)=\log(\frac{\cdot}{1-\cdot})$. The logit link converts a linear combination of input features $\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\cdots+\beta_px_p=z$ into a log odds ratio $g(\eta(z))$. Given a threshold $\gamma$, the logistic regression model assigns a binary label $y=\left\{  
                        \begin{array}{ll}
                          0 & : g(\eta(z))<\gamma \\ 
                          1 & : g(\eta(z))\geqslant \gamma \\  
                      \end{array}\right.$  

To minimize the misclassification error rate, we can define the loss function $\ell(y,\hat{y})=-[y\log(\hat{y})+(1-y)\log(1-\hat{y})]$ and use it to update the parameter vector $\theta$:

$\min_{\theta}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i\log(\hat{y}_i)+(1-y_i)\log(1-\hat{y}_i)$

where $\hat{y}_i=\sigma(z_i)$ is the predicted probability of the $i$-th instance belonging to the positive class (or equivalently, $1-\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability of the $i$-th instance belonging to the negative class):

$\hat{y}_i=\sigma(z_i)=(1+e^{-z_i})^{-1}$.

## 3.2 模型参数估计
The logistic regression model requires finding the optimal values of the parameters $\beta_j$ and the intercept term $\beta_0$ that maximize the likelihood of observing the observed data. Under suitable regularization assumptions, we can solve the following optimization problem:

$\min_{\theta}L(\theta|\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y};\alpha)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NL(y_i,\sigma(z_i);\mathbf{X}_i)$

where $L(\cdot)$ denotes the loss function, $\mathbf{X}_i=[1,x_i]^T$ is the augmented feature vector, and $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the logistic sigmoid function. We can add L2 regularization terms to control the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting:

$L(\theta|\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y};\alpha)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NL(y_i,\sigma(z_i);\mathbf{X}_i)+\lambda||\theta||_2^2$

The solution to this optimization problem depends on the specific form of the loss function used in logistic regression, and it can be solved using popular optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. There are numerous variations of the logistic regression model, and here we focus on a very basic version called OLS (ordinary least squares) logistic regression, since it is computationally efficient and does not require non-convex optimization procedures.

## 3.3 数据预处理
Before applying the logistic regression model, we must perform some data preprocessing steps to ensure that the input features are normalized and transformed into a space where the sigmoid function behaves appropriately. Specifically, we can normalize the input features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, and apply PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of the input space. Additionally, we can transform the categorical features into dummy variables to represent them as independent binary features, which improves the interpretability of the model.

PCA reduces the dimensionality of the input space while retaining important features along the principal components' directions. It works by identifying the directions of maximum variance in the data, projecting the data onto those directions, and discarding the projections onto less informative directions. Since PCA assumes that the covariance matrices of the original and reduced spaces are equal, it can preserve linearity and nonlinearities in the original data. Overall, PCA is a powerful technique for handling large datasets with many irrelevant features.

Finally, we can impute missing values using mean, median, mode, or other strategies, or use robust estimation techniques such as MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) to handle missing data.

# 4. Decision Tree
Decision trees are a type of classification and regression method that work by recursively splitting the feature space into smaller regions until each region contains only one class of instances or none. At each node, the algorithm selects the feature that best separates the instances into two groups of roughly equal size, and the split point corresponding to the selected feature is chosen optimally to minimize the average classification error at that node.

Unlike logistic regression, which operates on a single linear predictor $z$, decision trees can capture non-linear dependencies among features by using non-parametric models such as splines or kernel functions. Moreover, decision trees can deal with both categorical and continuous features, and can handle both regression and classification tasks by partitioning the feature space into intervals rather than points. They can also handle missing data efficiently because splits are performed conditionally on the availability of complete data.

However, decision trees suffer from overfitting problems, especially when applied to small subsets of the data or to highly correlated features. Moreover, the interpretation of the resulting decision rules can be difficult and prone to errors, especially for large trees.

Here is a schematic diagram showing the basic idea behind decision trees:


The decision tree model partitions the feature space into regions by repeatedly asking a series of questions about the features. Each leaf node represents a final answer, and intermediate nodes encode conditions for reaching those answers. During training, the algorithm evaluates the effectiveness of each potential split, and selects the best question at each node to maximize the expected reduction in classification error.

One way to estimate the impact of each feature on the classification error is to calculate the decrease in entropy associated with splitting the data using that feature. Entropy is a measure of unpredictability of the class labels, and lower entropies indicate better class separation. The reduction in entropy caused by a split is calculated as:

$reduction\_in\_entropy=-\frac{|D_l||D_r|}{|D|}H(D)-\frac{|D_l|}{|D|}H(D_l)-\frac{|D_r|}{|D|}H(D_r)$

where D is the full dataset, D_l and D_r are the left and right child datasets obtained by splitting the parent dataset at the current node, and H(D) is the empirical entropy of the labels in D:

$H(D)=\frac{1}{|D|}\sum_{i=1}^{|D|}I(y_i=1)log(|D_+)-(1-|D|)log(|D_-)$

where I(y_i=1) and |D_+|, |D_-| are the proportion of positive and negative examples in D, respectively. Decreasing the entropy of the entire dataset indicates improved class separation, and hence improving the classification accuracy. Therefore, the best feature to split on at each node is determined by minimizing this criterion.

Decision trees can be built using several algorithms, such as CART (Classification And Regression Trees) and ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3), which differ primarily in the way they choose the best split. CART builds binary decision trees by sorting the instances into two groups based on a chosen feature, while ID3 uses a top-down greedy search strategy to construct a binary tree by repeatedly choosing the feature that maximizes the information gain. Both methods aim to build a tree that is compact and as small as possible while achieving good generalization performance.

# 5. Random Forest
Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the accuracy of predictions. Unlike individual decision trees, random forests operate on bootstrap samples of the data generated from the original dataset using the bagging principle. Bagging means sampling with replacement, and it helps to avoid overfitting by reducing the correlation between the trees. Each tree in a random forest is trained independently on a subset of randomly sampled data and constructed to minimize the residual error. The final prediction is computed as the averaged probability predicted by all the trees in the forest.

Therefore, the key idea behind random forests is to combine multiple decision trees and generate a more accurate prediction by averaging their predictions across multiple versions of the same dataset. One way to do this is to randomly sample different subsets of features at each node during the construction process, thus increasing the diversity of the trees and reducing the bias towards any specific feature. This technique is known as the random subspace method. Another improvement to random forests is to use out-of-bag (OOB) validation to assess the importance of each tree in the ensemble and to select the best performing ones early on in the training process. Out-of-bag validation involves evaluating each tree on a distinct set of instances held out of the training procedure, ensuring that each tree contributes significantly to the final result.

Another advantage of random forests is that they can automatically tune hyperparameters such as the depth and width of the trees, as well as the minimum number of instances required to split a node. In practice, these hyperparameters can be optimized using cross-validation techniques such as grid search or randomized search.

# 6. Neural Network
Neural networks are a family of models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Like traditional machine learning algorithms, neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns from labeled data. But whereas traditional algorithms learn from a fixed set of input features, neural networks learn representations of the input that are progressively refined through transformations. The core idea behind neural networks is the ability to approximate arbitrary functions via complicated interconnected layers of artificial neurons. Neural networks can represent complex relationships between input features and predict outcomes with high accuracy.

Despite their appealing qualities, however, developing deep neural networks is still an elusive task, partly because the precise architecture and training strategy can be quite challenging. Many modern libraries provide high-level APIs that automate much of the training process, but manual tuning is still necessary for optimal performance. Nevertheless, neural networks offer promising alternatives to traditional machine learning algorithms and could play a crucial role in solving complex problems such as image recognition and natural language processing.
