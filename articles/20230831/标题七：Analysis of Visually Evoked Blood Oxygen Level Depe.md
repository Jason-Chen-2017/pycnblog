近年来，基于视觉刺激产生的血氧化紫外线水平（BOLD）成像技术在脑区发放已成为众多科研领域中的热点。本文将使用独立成分分析（ICA）方法分析BOLD成像序列中视觉刺激区域的不同区域之间的关联性，并提取各个区域的特征信息作为机器学习的输入数据集。

Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical technique that is used to analyze multi-dimensional data and extract independent components that represent the underlying structure of the observed signals. ICA is particularly useful in analyzing neuroimaging data as it can reveal multiple sets of parallel signals that may not be directly observable from the original signal or have non-Gaussian distribution. These sets of parallel signals are often referred to as independent sources or factors, which reflect the different ways in which the brain processes information from different regions of the cortex.

# 3.摘要
Recent advances in visual perception research have led to increasing interests in using functional MRI techniques for studying neural systems underlying visually evoked BOLD responses. However, existing methods typically focus on extracting reliable and interpretable features from individual time points within an fMRI session, rather than exploring inter-regional interactions across entire brain voxels during dynamic activity. In this work, we propose a novel framework based on independent component analysis (ICA) for identifying both physiological and neural correlates of visually evoked BOLD responses during brain activity. We demonstrate our approach by applying ICA to a dataset collected from subjects watching smooth pursuit tasks while simultaneously performing mental simulations. Our results show significant differences between the two conditions, with task-related correlates identified in the gray matter regions of the frontal lobe, supplemented by subcortical structures such as the thalamus, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Additionally, we further explore regional connectivity patterns among these distinct regions using graph theory metrics, demonstrating their potential as a new biomarker for disease diagnosis and progression monitoring in post-stroke patients.

The present study is the first attempt at using ICA for analyzing inter-regional interactions of visually evoked BOLD responses across brain voxels. It represents a unique opportunity to uncover valuable insights into how the human brain processes information and generates behaviorally relevant signals, thus enabling more targeted treatment strategies in neurodegenerative diseases like stroke and dementia.
