Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that best separates two classes of data points. The resulting hyperplane is called a support vector machine because it supports or "votes" for the data points within its boundaries, even if some data points are on the margin or far away from the hyperplane.

In SVM, the goal is to find the maximum-margin hyperplane which separates the positive class (also known as the "+1" class) from the negative class ("-1" class). Mathematically, this is equivalent to finding the largest possible distance between any point inside the plus-class and any point outside the minus-class. This hyperplane also separates these two classes with fewest number of misclassifications (hence the name "support vectors"). In practice, when there is no clear distinction between the classes, one may use a technique called kernel methods instead to project data into higher dimensions where linear separation becomes more apparent. 

The optimal solution to the problem of selecting the right hyperplane depends on many factors such as the choice of kernel function, regularization parameters, etc. Some other techniques include logistic regression and neural networks. However, SVM has several advantages over these methods:

1. Interpretability: SVM's decision boundary is linear, which makes it easy to understand and explain. 

2. Robustness: SVM is highly robust against outliers since they do not significantly affect its performance. Outlier detection algorithms often work better than traditional anomaly detection approaches using distances.

3. Scalability: Since SVM uses quadratic programming to solve optimization problems, it can handle large datasets efficiently. Training time complexity increases roughly linearly with the size of training set, whereas most other algorithms have exponential time complexity. Therefore, SVM is scalable to high dimensional spaces without sacrificing accuracy.

4. Kernel trick: Instead of directly computing the inner products of input vectors, SVM relies on a kernel function to implicitly map them into a higher dimension where their non-linear relationship can be captured. This allows SVM to capture complex relationships in the data while preserving the interpretability of linear decision boundaries. Many popular kernel functions exist such as polynomial kernels, radial basis function (RBF), sigmoidal kernels, and so on. 

Overall, SVM provides a powerful yet flexible tool for solving a wide range of pattern recognition and classification problems, including binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression problems. Its popularity continues to grow due to its ease of implementation, effectiveness, and interpretation. With appropriate feature selection, kernel function tuning, and parameter selection, SVM can perform well in a variety of applications.

## Hyperplane
A hyperplane is a subspace that lies in a higher dimensional space but does not intersect it. More formally, a hyperplane is a flat affine subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ consisting of all vectors $w\in \mathbb{R}^N$, satisfying the equation $w^T x + b = 0$. Here, $x$ denotes the input variables, $b$ is a bias term, and $(w,b)$ defines a unique hyperplane. When we speak about a hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^N$, we mean specifically the case when $N=2$. 

Hyperplanes play an important role in SVMs. They separate the positive and negative classes of data points and determine the degree of overlap between different classes. Among other things, they provide a way to interpret how good our model is at making predictions based on new examples, and they act as decision boundaries that help us make decisions on what label to assign to each new example. As mentioned earlier, hyperplanes can either be linear or nonlinear.

### Linear hyperplane
A linear hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined as $w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b = 0$, where $(w_1,w_2)$ define the direction vector of the line, and $b$ determines the offset from the origin along the direction vector. If we extend this definition to $\mathbb{R}^n$, then it becomes a generalized hyperplane equation: $\langle w,x \rangle + b = 0$.

For example, let's consider the following dataset with three classes:

| Class | Points | 
|:-----:|:------:|
| Blue  | $(0,0)$, $(0.5,0.5)$ |  
| Red   | $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$ |   
| Green | $(0,1)$, $(0,2)$ |  

We would like to build a classifier that can distinguish between the blue and green regions while ignoring the red region entirely. One approach could be to draw a straight line through the center of the red points and classify everything else accordingly. For example, we might fit the following linear hyperplane:

$$
w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 - 0.75 = 0 \\
w_1 &= 0 \\
w_2 &= 1 \\
0.75 &= b
$$

This line passes through the middle of the red area, passing through $(0.75,-0.75)$, which satisfies the given equation. We can see that this line only has one side facing towards the negative class, meaning it will correctly classify the blue points and ignore the rest. However, it doesn't take into account the shape of the blue region and won't give much information about the overall geometry of the class boundary. Similarly, we cannot use a linear hyperplane to fully separate the blue and green areas. To achieve full separation, we need a more complex model.

### Nonlinear hyperplane
Nonlinearity adds flexibility to the SVM model. We can encode non-linear relationships between features by using a non-linear transformation function $\phi(x)\rightarrow z$, where $z$ represents the transformed input vector. Then, we can use a linear hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^m$, where m is the number of dimensions after transformation, to separate the classes while taking into account the effects of non-linear transformations on the data.

Common non-linear transformations include polynomials, Gaussians, and Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). These functions allow us to express complex relationships between features and learn non-linear patterns. By applying these non-linear transformations, we can obtain hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^m$ that are capable of capturing the complex relationships in the original data.

One common type of non-linear transformation applied in SVM models is the radial basis function (RBF). This function takes the dot product of the input vector with a weight vector $\gamma^i$, where i ranges from 1 to n, and applies a Gaussian kernel with width $\sigma$:

$$
z_j = e^{-\gamma_{ij}\left \| x - x_j \right \|^2 / 2\sigma^2}
$$

Here, $\gamma_{ij}$ represents the dot product of the weights associated with the input variables $x_i$ and $x_j$, and $\sigma$ controls the smoothness of the RBF function. Intuitively, larger values of $\gamma$ increase the influence of nearby points and smaller values decrease the influence. The final result is stored in the transformed input vector $z_j$, which is fed into a linear hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^m$. Common choices for $\sigma$ are typically in the range [0.1, 1].

Other types of non-linear transformations, such as polynomials or sigmoidal functions, can be similarly implemented in SVM models to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

## Regularization
Regularization is a process of adding additional constraints to a cost function in order to prevent overfitting or improve the generalization capabilities of a model. In SVM models, regularization can be added to the objective function to control the trade-off between fitting the training data well and keeping the model simple enough to generalize to unseen data. There are various forms of regularization available in SVM, depending on the desired level of control and sensitivity of the learned decision boundary. 

1. L1-norm regularization encourages the solution to be sparse, i.e., contains only a small subset of features that contribute to the prediction. This can be useful when we want to identify the most important features in determining the class labels.

2. L2-norm regularization encourages the solution to be small in terms of its norm, i.e., having low magnitude or length. This can help to avoid overfitting the training data and ensure that the model performs well on new, unseen data.

3. Elastic net regularization combines both L1 and L2 regularization by adding a penalty term that balances their effects. This can lead to a smoother decision boundary and reduce overfitting simultaneously.

4. Penalty term can also be included in the cost function to discourage the model from selecting certain features or directions altogether. This can further reduce the risk of overfitting and simplify the model.
