Hierarchical clustering is a widely used technique in data mining and machine learning to group similar objects together into clusters or categories based on their proximity or similarity within a given dataset. The goal of hierarchical clustering is to produce a tree-like structure where each cluster contains instances that are homogeneous with respect to a set of attributes (variables). Hierarchical clustering can be performed using different algorithms such as single-linkage, complete-linkage, average linkage, centroid linkage, median linkage, etc., depending upon the desired level of granularity in the resulting hierarchy. In this article, we will focus on dendrogram visualization method for representing the hierarchical clustering results. 

Dendrogram visualization is one of the most effective methods for understanding and interpreting the hierarchical clustering results by displaying them graphically. Dendrograms are commonly used to illustrate the arrangement of related items in a hierarchy, either from top to bottom (as in a traditional pyramid) or sideways (as in an inverted V shape), which shows how the items relate to each other. Each node represents an item in the original dataset, and each edge represents the distance between two items. By traversing the edges from left to right or from top to bottom, it becomes easier to identify patterns and relationships among the clusters. Additionally, since it is not possible to display every individual object directly on the dendrogram, techniques like pairwise comparison plots and heat maps have been developed to supplement the dendrogram representation with additional information about the objects being grouped. 


The purpose of this paper is to provide a gentle introduction to dendrogram visualization method for visualizing hierarchical clustering results. We will start by reviewing some basic concepts of hierarchical clustering and its applications. Then, we will discuss the mathematical theory behind the dendrogram method for visualizing hierarchical clustering results. Finally, we will demonstrate various implementations of the dendrogram method using Python libraries. This article aims to complement existing resources by providing a concise yet thorough overview of the topic and making it accessible to a wide range of readers.


# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
## 2.1 Definitions and Examples
Hierarchial clustering refers to a process of grouping similar objects or observations into groups, called clusters, based on their proximity or similarity within a given dataset. It involves iteratively merging pairs of clusters that are most similar until all the objects belong to exactly one large cluster. There are several types of hierarchical clustering algorithms available, including: single-linkage, complete-linkage, average linkage, centroid linkage, median linkage, Ward's method, and Kruskal-Wallis algorithm. Here are some examples of hierarchical clustering applications:

- Market segmentation: Dividing customers into distinct segments according to their shopping preferences, behavioral patterns, demographics, products purchased, and other characteristics.
- Document clustering: Grouping documents by topics or themes, typically unsupervised because there is no labeled training data available.
- Social network analysis: Identifying communities of people who share common interests, connections, and activities.
- DNA sequence classification: Partitioning DNA sequences into families based on similar characteristics such as antibiotic resistance levels, chromosomal aberrations, mutations, etc.
- Text mining: Identifying relevant topics or keywords across multiple texts through their co-occurrence statistics.

In summary, hierarchical clustering is useful for organizing complex datasets into manageable and meaningful groups. However, the difficulties of identifying and extracting valuable insights from large amounts of data make interpretative tasks challenging. Therefore, graphical visualization tools have emerged as essential tools for analyzing these complex datasets.

## 2.2 Similarity Metrics and Distance Measures
Similarity measures measure the degree of similarity between two objects while distance measures represent the difference between the objects. For example, cosine similarity is often used to measure the similarity between vectors of numbers, and Euclidean distance is frequently used to measure the distance between points in space. Two popular similarity metrics used in hierarchical clustering include correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) and Jaccard similarity index. They both measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. While Pearson’s r considers only linear correlations, Jaccard similarity takes into account the overlap between the sets of elements being compared.

## 2.3 Dendrogram Concept
A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that represents the hierarchical clustering result. Each leaf node represents an individual object or observation, while internal nodes represent the merged clusters produced during the hierarchical clustering process. Internal nodes correspond to the midpoint of the longest vertical branch connecting the child nodes. At any point along the branches, the height reflects the number of objects contained in the corresponding cluster. Intuitively, a longer horizontal brace indicates greater separation between clusters, while a shorter horizontal brace suggests lesser separation. The height of the trunk corresponds to the total number of objects, and the root node serves as a starting point for traversal of the dendrogram. The leaves represent the final clusters formed after the last iteration of agglomeration.


The above image depicts an example of a dendrogram generated from a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Each dot represents a datapoint, and the lines connecting the dots indicate the order in which they were merged during clustering. The length of the lines determines the similarity between the underlying clusters, and the position of the line relative to the axis indicates whether the merge was done vertically or horizontally.
