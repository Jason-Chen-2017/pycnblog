Queues are ubiquitous in modern life. Whether it is our daily commute to work or the traffic at a busy intersection, we have been subjected to them all along: from handshaking to shopping malls to banks. However, they also serve as sources of complexity for various problems in queue theory and computer science. There exist many theoretical models for queues that offer easy-to-understand insights into their behavior but may not always be practical enough to solve real world applications. In this article, I will attempt to identify some gaps between theories and practice when it comes to designing algorithms and developing software systems for handling queuing systems. By discussing these gaps, we can gain insights into how to bridge the gap between theory and practice while still maintaining an effective, efficient solution for solving real-world problems with queuing systems.

2.队列论及其实践间差距
在现代生活中，队列无处不在。不管是每天的通勤或繁忙的交叉口，都要面对它们：从打招呼到购物中心再到银行，所有这些事情背后都隐藏着复杂的队列论模型。但是，在队列论和计算机科学中，它们也扮演着复杂性的角色。对于队列，存在众多理论模型，它们提供了易于理解的洞察力，但可能并不能很好地解决实际应用中的问题。在本文中，我将尝试识别一些论点和实践之间在设计算法和开发用于处理队列系统的软件系统方面的差距。通过讨论这些差距，我们可以了解如何实现理论和实践之间的沟通，同时仍然保持有效、高效的解决方案来处理队列系统带来的实际问题。

Let’s start by identifying some key points in both theory and practice.

3.关键概念及术语介绍
在理解queues的各种模型之前，需要先对队列的一些重要概念和术语进行介绍。

1. Little’s law
Little’s Law states that the average waiting time of a random process is proportional to the reciprocal of the rate parameter. It means that if you know the arrival rate and service time (or wait time) of a queue, then you can calculate the expected waiting time using the formula T = 1/λ. This law has been used extensively in queueing theory and even in statistical analysis and forecasting of customer demand and workload patterns. Despite its simplicity, Little’s law provides insight into the underlying dynamics of queueing systems. For example, if the probability of a customer being abandoned increases with increasing queue length, then the system becomes more congested, leading to higher total waiting times.

2. Tail drop model
The tail drop model assumes that customers experience loss of service due to arriving later than expected. The tail drop occurs when the last server available leaves the queue before the remaining customers have finished processing. The customers who were blocked behind the dropped customer experience reduced waiting time but must pay additional cost to rejoin the queue. This model offers insight into the effects of varying interarrival rates on queue lengths and utilization levels, which impacts the performance of the overall system.

3. Markovian arrival process
Markovian arrival processes assume that new customers enter the system independently of any previous ones. This implies that each customer enters the system independently at a constant rate, with no correlation between subsequent arrivals. The result is a stationary distribution of queue lengths, where the mean waiting time decreases as the number of servers approaches infinity. This model offers insight into the degree of serial dependence in the incoming customer flow. If there exists significant dependency among incoming customers, then traditional methods such as modeling one customer at a time would fail to accurately capture the dynamics of the entire queueing system.

4. M/M/n queue
A M/M/n queue represents a type of queueing system where n servers are available to handle incoming requests. Each customer encounters independent arrival and service processes with a Poisson(λ) distribution for arrival and exponential(μ) distribution for service. This means that each customer waits randomly until it is served and the next customer enters the system independently after serving his current customer. The result is a poisson point process whose intensity function is λ * μ^n. Among other things, this model captures the fact that customers preferentially choose faster servers over slower ones. Additionally, since all customers interact with the same set of resources (servers), this model is useful for understanding the implications of sharing resources across multiple customers.

5. M/G/k queue
The M/G/k queue is another type of queueing system similar to the M/M/n model except that k groups of servers share access to the resource pool. The departure process is shared between all groups and follows the M/M/n model, with individual groups having independent arrival and service processes. Despite the added complexity of grouping servers, this model offers insight into the effects of shared resources on queueing behavior. If several clients wish to use a common resource, then the overhead involved in managing separate resources adds up quickly.

6. Thompson sampling
Thompson Sampling is a method for choosing experiments based on the results obtained so far. It involves observing samples drawn from different distributions, and selecting the distribution with the highest sample proportion. This approach enables us to make accurate predictions about future outcomes without relying too much on prior assumptions or data. Thompson Sampling is commonly applied to online advertising and recommender systems, where choices need to be made based on user behavior rather than static data.

7. Density-dependent routing
Density-dependent routing refers to the concept of sending packets to certain links based on the amount of load present on those links. This approach helps balance loads across links to minimize bottlenecks and improve network efficiency. However, density-dependent routing alone cannot fully address issues like network congestion and increased latency due to switching overhead. Therefore, it requires careful consideration of other factors such as link capacity, delay, jitter, and error rates.

8. Early detection and congestion avoidance
Early detection and congestion avoidance techniques help reduce the chances of network congestion and increased latency by detecting and resolving network errors early, instead of letting them propagate throughout the network. This approach aims to limit propagation delays and increase throughput by allowing the network to adapt to fluctuations in traffic and network conditions dynamically. While early detection and congestion avoidance can provide benefits in terms of reducing costs, it is essential to consider issues such as false positives and misdiagnosis, which can lead to incorrect decisions and adverse affects on users. 

9. Token bucket
Token Bucket is a mechanism for regulating network bandwidth usage. It assigns tokens to flows based on their size and controls the flow rate according to specified limits. This technique helps ensure fairness and prevents excessive usage of network bandwidth, thus preventing congestion collapse. However, token bucket alone does not guarantee optimal performance under all scenarios, especially when combined with other techniques like routing protocols, traffic shaping policies, and buffer management strategies.
