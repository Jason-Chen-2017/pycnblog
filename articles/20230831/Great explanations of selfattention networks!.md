Self-Attention Networks (SANs) have been recently introduced as a powerful architecture for modeling sequential data with attention mechanism. In this article, we will cover the basic concepts behind SANs and understand how they work to give you an intuitive understanding of how it works. We will also provide step by step procedures on implementing Self Attention Network models using different deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc., so that you can easily build your own models and apply them in real world scenarios. Finally, we will talk about some future challenges and potential improvements that need to be addressed.

Attention: Attention refers to the process of selecting relevant information from multiple sources based on their importance or relevance to the current context. It is one of the core principles of SANs which allows the model to focus only on important parts of the input sequence instead of processing everything sequentially. The attention weights are computed based on both the query vector and key-value pairs obtained from the input features. There are three types of attention mechanisms used commonly in SANs - Content Based Attention, Location Based Attention, and Query-Key Attention. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. These terms and other related concepts will be explained later in detail while discussing each specific attention mechanism.

CNN/LSTM: CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network and LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory. They are two popular neural network architectures used extensively in image recognition tasks such as classification and object detection. Both of these architectures incorporate convolution layers to extract high level features from the input images and use long short term memory cells to capture temporal dependencies between the feature vectors.

Dropout Regularization: Dropout regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. It consists of randomly dropping out some neurons during training time, which forces the network to learn more robust representations of the data at hand. This helps avoiding the risk of overfitting which occurs when the trained model becomes too complex and starts capturing noise and not underlying patterns in the data.

Multi-Head Attention Mechanism: Multi-head attention mechanism refers to a design principle wherein multiple parallel attention heads are attached to a single feedforward layer. This makes the model capable of obtaining information from various aspects of the input simultaneously. The outputs of individual heads are then concatenated and passed through another feedforward layer before being outputted as final results.

Positional Encoding: Positional encoding adds non-linearity to the input sequences by adding sinusoidal or triangular functions as additional features to the input embedding. This is done to make the model aware of the relative positions of words in the sentence, thereby enabling better modeling of word order dependencies.

Transformer Model: Transformer model is a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture that uses multi-headed attention and positional encodings alongside stacked encoder layers and decoder layers to perform end-to-end translation tasks.

# 3. Self-Attention Network (SAN) Overview
## Introduction
Self-Attention Networks were introduced as a powerful architecture for modeling sequential data with attention mechanism. It was proposed in January, 2017, by researchers at Google Brain Team. The main idea behind SANs is to replace traditional RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) or LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) structures with multi-head attentions. The major advantage of SANs lies in their ability to handle variable length inputs without suffering from vanishing gradients problem. Instead of passing the entire sequence of input tokens through a separate gate, self-attention mechanism learns to assign weights to individual elements of the input sequence, making it easier to exploit local correlations between them. Additionally, the attention mechanism itself enables the model to selectively attend to relevant parts of the input sequence, resulting in significant improvement in performance compared to monolithic architectures like CNN or LSTM.

In addition to replacing traditional models, SANs also aim to improve upon existing approaches with enhanced efficiency and scalability. One recent trend in deep learning is transformers, which combines both CNN and RNN into a single structure called transformer model. Transformers, however, still struggle with long range dependencies and lack of interpretability due to the dense connections among all the components. Therefore, SANs combine the strengths of both worlds and effectively address both issues.



The above figure depicts the overall architecture of a Self-Attention Network. Here, the input sequence is first passed through several independent transformations (e.g., Convolutional Layers). The transformed features are then fed to multi-head attention module. The attention module takes care of generating weighted sums of corresponding features across the entire sequence. This approach encourages the model to pay more attention to important parts of the input sequence rather than attempting to summarize the entire sequence altogether. Then, after computing the attention weights, the resultant tensor is passed through further transformation layers followed by fully connected layers to produce the predicted output. Overall, the goal of SANs is to achieve good accuracy with fewer parameters compared to competing techniques. 


## Single Head Attention
Let's now discuss the working of single head attention mechanism. Let's assume that we want to compute the weight matrix W, given queries Q and keys K. Without loss of generality, let us denote the shape of the query, key and value matrices as (batch_size x seq_len x num_heads x hidden_dim / num_heads) respectively. We calculate the dot product of queries and keys elementwise, i.e.,

(Q x K)_ij = sum_{k=1}^{seq_len} q_ik k_jk = Q[i,:,:] * K[:,j,:]

where * represents the elementwise multiplication operation. Next, we normalize the dot product values using softmax function as follows,

A_ijk = softmax((Q x K)_ijk)

where A_ijk represents the normalized attention weights for query i in the jth position of the sequence. Finally, we multiply the attention weights with the original value matrix V to obtain the new representation r, which gives us,

r_ij = sum_{k=1}^{seq_len} A_ijk v_kj = \sum_{k=1}^{seq_len} A[i,k,:] v[:,j,:]

This equation computes the new representation r_ij using the attention weights calculated earlier. However, since our attention head is just one headed, we don't really require the complexity of calculating cross-correlation coefficients explicitly. Hence, we can simplify the computation even further as shown below,

r_ij = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} ((Q * W) * K^T)^T * V = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} ((Q * W) * K^T)^T @ V

Here, d is the dimension of the intermediate projection space, which depends on the number of heads and hidden dimensions per head. If we set d equal to h, then we get rid of the normalization factor. Also note that we are computing self-attention here; hence, we do not need any masking of the padding elements to ignore them while applying attention weights.

## Multi Head Attention
Now, let's consider the case of multiple attention heads. Suppose we have N heads and the shape of the query, key and value matrices remains the same as before (batch_size x seq_len x num_heads x hidden_dim / num_heads). Now, we split the queries, keys and values into N submatrices along the second axis, leading to Qh, Kh and Vh having shapes (batch_size x seq_len x num_heads x hidden_dim / num_heads) respectively. Similarly, we create N submatrices of zero matrices W' with shapes (num_heads x num_heads x hidden_dim / num_heads) for each attention head. We then iterate over all N attention heads and update the parameters of W' iteratively using backpropagation.

We then concatenate the attention scores from all the heads and pass it through a linear transformation to project the results onto a lower dimensional space. We repeat this process M times to accumulate multiple iterations of attention. Finally, we return the accumulated representation along with the last iteration of attention score matrix. At test time, we take the average of the N attention heads to obtain the final output. 

Note that we could potentially use dropout regularization inside each attention head to enhance generalization capability.

# 4. Steps to Implement Self-Attention Networks Using PyTorch
To implement Self-Attention Networks using PyTorch, we will follow the steps mentioned below:

Step 1: Import Libraries and Define Parameters.

```python
import torch 
import torch.nn as nn 

input_size = 512 # Size of Input Embedding Vector
hidden_size = 128 # Size of Hidden Layer Representation
output_size = 10 # Number of Output Classes
num_layers = 2 # Number of Self-Attention Layers
num_heads = 8 # Number of Attention Heads

embedding_layer = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim) # Define Word Embeddings
encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=embedding_dim, nhead=num_heads) # Define Encoder Layer
transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=num_layers) # Define Transformer Encoder

class SelfAttentionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = embedding_layer
        self.transformer_encoder = transformer_encoder
        self.fc = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        emb = self.embedding(x)
        enc = self.transformer_encoder(emb)
        logits = self.fc(enc[-1])
        return logits
    
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = SelfAttentionModel().to(device)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=epochs)
```

Step 2: Create Dataset and Dataloader objects.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset


train_dataset = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train', shuffle=True)
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_dataset['data'])

y_train = train_dataset['target']
dataset = TensorDataset(torch.tensor(X_train.todense()).float(), torch.tensor(y_train))

dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
```

Step 3: Train Model.

```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    running_loss = 0.0
    
    for i, data in enumerate(dataloader, 0):
        
        X_train, y_train = data
        
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        outputs = model(X_train.to(device)).squeeze()
        loss = criterion(outputs, y_train.to(device))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        running_loss += loss.item()
        
    print('[%d] Training Loss: %.3f' % (epoch + 1, running_loss/len(dataloader)))
    scheduler.step()
```

Step 4: Evaluate Model.

```python
test_dataset = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test', shuffle=False)
X_test = vectorizer.transform(test_dataset['data']).todense()

y_test = test_dataset['target']
testset = TensorDataset(torch.tensor(X_test).float(), torch.tensor(y_test))
testloader = DataLoader(testset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)

correct = 0
total = len(testloader.dataset)
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in testloader:
        inputs, labels = data

        outputs = model(inputs.to(device)).argmax(-1)
        correct += (outputs == labels.to(device)).sum().item()
        
print('Accuracy on Test Set:', round(correct/total, 3)*100,'%')
```
