# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that involves training an agent to learn how to make decisions in an environment by trial and error. It has received increasing attention due to its ability to solve challenging tasks with complex decision-making processes. However, training the agents effectively can be difficult as they often require many iterations to converge to a good policy. In this article, we will present various optimization methods for RL using deep neural networks as function approximators. These methods include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam optimizer, Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adadelta. We will also discuss some other common approaches such as proximal policy optimization (PPO). Finally, we will implement these algorithms and compare their performance on different environments and tasks. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art optimization techniques used in reinforcement learning and highlight future directions. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
The key concepts in reinforcement learning are:

 - **Environment**: The environment represents the world where the agent operates in. It provides the rewards, penalties, and observation space to the agent, which define what actions it should take or not based on past experiences. 

 - **Agent**: The agent interacts with the environment through observations and takes actions to maximize cumulative reward. There are two types of agents:

  + **Deterministic Agent:** A deterministic agent makes a single action at each time step given the current state of the system. 

  + **Stochastic Agent:** A stochastic agent outputs a probability distribution over possible actions instead of a single action. It then samples from this distribution during each time step and acts accordingly. 
 
  Note: In this article, we will focus only on deterministic agents since they provide better control over the policies being learned.
 
 - **State/Observation Space:** The set of all possible states or observations that the agent can observe throughout the episode. For example, if the agent observes images captured from a camera, the state space would be the set of all possible image configurations. 
 
 - **Action Space:** The set of possible actions that the agent can choose from at any given point in time. Actions could range from simple movements like forward, backward, left, right, up, down to more complex interactions with objects or entities like picking up an object or opening a door.

 - **Policy:** The policy defines the mapping between states and probabilities of selecting actions. It specifies which action to take at each state based on the history of previous actions taken and outcomes observed. Policies can have multiple parameters depending on the complexity of the problem being solved. For instance, a policy may include weights associated with each state-action pair representing the expected return when taking that action in that state.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most commonly used optimization technique in RL. SGD updates the policy parameters iteratively based on the estimated gradients of the loss function with respect to the policy parameters. The basic idea behind SGD is that the optimal policy parameter update direction can be derived from considering the expectation of the gradient across several mini-batches of experience sampled randomly from the full dataset. Specifically, the loss function J(θ) is defined as follows:

J(θ) = E_{d_t} [r_t] + γE_{d_{t+1}}[Q^π_t(s_{t+1}, π'(s_{t+1}; θ)-y)]

where d_t denotes the t-th trajectory segment, r_t is the discounted sum of rewards obtained after following the current policy from s_t, Q^π_t is the estimate of the Q-value function with respect to the policy π', y is the target value that needs to be achieved, and γ is the discount factor.

In order to derive the optimal policy parameter update direction, we need to differentiate the above equation w.r.t. the policy parameter vector θ. Let's consider a sample mini-batch {S,A,R,S'} drawn from the dataset D. Then the derivative of the loss function wrt. theta can be written as:

dJ/dθ = E_{d}[∇_θ log π(a|s;θ)(g_θ(s) − η*E_{a'∼π(.|s';θ)}[Q^π(s',a')])]

where g_θ(s) is the advantage estimate of the state s and η is the learning rate hyperparameter. Intuitively, the above formula computes the average of the gradients obtained from different trajectories in D, weighted by their advantages computed using the current policy π(.|s'). By updating the policy parameters θ towards the direction of the negative gradient, we can improve the quality of the policy and reduce the objective function J(θ).

To summarize, SGD updates the policy parameters in the direction of the negative gradient computed by sampling trajectories randomly from the dataset. The choice of the batch size determines the tradeoff between convergence speed and stability, while the learning rate controls the step size along the gradient path. Other hyperparameters such as momentum and nesterov acceleration can further enhance the convergence properties of SGD.
