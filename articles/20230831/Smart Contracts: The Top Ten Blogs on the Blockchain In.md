## 智能合约(Smart contract)

> In computer programming, a smart contract is a type of contract where the terms and conditions are set in such a way that they can be automatically executed by a computer. A smart contract consists of data fields, operations or functions, rules for execution, and an environment within which these contracts execute (such as blockchains). It may also include account management features and security measures to protect against malicious acts. 

简单来说，智能合约就是由计算机执行的一份协议，其中的条款和条件可以在计算机自动执行。一个智能合约包括数据字段、操作或功能、执行规则以及在其中执行这些合约的环境（如区块链）。它还可能包含帐户管理特性和安全机制，以防范恶意行为。

## DLT(分布式账本技术)

> Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), also known as blockchain technology, refers to distributed databases used to record transactions across multiple nodes, typically peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Transactions are grouped into blocks, which are cryptographically linked together, making it difficult to tamper with or falsify them without altering all subsequent blocks. This decentralized architecture has led to the rise of various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, among others. These technologies enable businesses to transact quickly and reliably, while still maintaining strong privacy and immutability guarantees.

分布式账本技术（DLT）通常被称为区块链技术。DLT是一个分布式数据库系统，用于记录跨多个节点（通常采用对等网络模式）的事务。交易会分组成区块，这几个区块彼此链接起来，使得它们难以篡改或伪造而不影响后续的区块。这一去中心化的体系结构促进了比特币、以太坊、卡达诺之类的加密货币的崛起。这些技术使得企业能够快速且可靠地完成交易，同时保持高度隐私和不可变性。

## 分布式数据库(Database)

> A database is a collection of structured information stored electronically in a computer system. The main purpose of a database is to store, retrieve, update, and manage large amounts of data over a period of time. Databases have been around since ancient times, but their use has increased dramatically over the years because of advances in computing power and storage capacity. Some examples of popular types of databases include relational databases, NoSQL databases, and graph databases.

数据库是一种用电子计算机存储、组织、处理和存储信息的集合。数据库的主要目的是为了存储、检索、更新、管理大量数据。早在古代，人们就已经使用数据库，但随着计算机能力和存储容量的飞速发展，它的应用也日渐广泛。目前流行的数据库类型包括关系型数据库、非关系型数据库和图形数据库。

## 一.Ethereum Developer Spotlight
作者：<NAME>, Co-Founder & CTO at ConsenSys

前言：The Ethereum Developer Spotlight series is created to provide invaluable insights from experienced Ethereum developers who work closely with our platform to deliver top notch experiences for users on both web2.0 and web3.0 platforms. Each spotlight interview includes a comprehensive understanding of the technical details behind developing applications using the most commonly used tools and frameworks for building dapps on the Ethereum platform. We hope this series helps developers gain valuable insights into how to build high quality dapps on Ethereum and connect more value to their users through their products and services.

本期介绍Ethereum开发人员的系列新闻，由ConsenSys创始人兼首席技术官George Bailey担任主编。主题为开发者关心的话题，旨在邀请来自以太坊社区最知名的开发人员，针对最新应用、工具和框架等方面，深入讨论和阐述技术实现细节，力求为开发者提供智慧、见解。希望借助这样的系列报道，能帮助开发者理解以太坊平台下构建应用的方法和技巧，推动更多优质dapp的发展，带来更多价值给用户。

内容概要：Ethereum是一个开源、基于区块链的平台。本期深入探讨了Ethereum开发者的工作情况和开发经验。
​- George Bailey：Co-founder and CTO of ConsenSys. He helped launch the first version of the Ethereum network in December 2015, alongside leading team members from Silicon Valley companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. Before joining ConsenSys, he was working at SingularityNET, a machine learning startup that built open source software for AI training, serving over 1 million customers worldwide.

- Introducing EVM Virtual Machine：In 2015, <NAME> explained the EVM virtual machine, which powers the Ethereum Network. He noted that the original version of Ethereum was written in a low level language called "Yellow Paper", which had several limitations that were addressed later with improvements such as a Turing Complete VM. In May 2019, the Turing complete capability was added to the EVM via a proposal called "Spurious Dragon".

- Optimizing Transactions on the Ethereum Network：With the advent of widespread adoption of smart contracts and the explosion in transaction volume, one of the biggest challenges for any block chain protocol is optimizing its performance and scalability. To address this challenge, the authors recommended batch processing techniques such as LASER or Accelerators, and introduced state channels, which allow users to transfer value directly between each other without involving a third party server.

- Connecting Web Applications to the Ethereum Network：In November 2017, Michael Smith demonstrated how to integrate an existing web application with the Ethereum network using Metamask. Using this integration, users can interact with smart contracts hosted on the Ethereum network and perform actions such as sending ether, submitting transactions, and executing arbitrary code.

- Developing Decentralized Applications on the Ethereum Platform：As the fastest growing developer ecosystem, Ethereum provides many resources for developing applications on the platform. From tutorials to development tools, the documentation provided by Consensys is extensive and easy to follow. Examples range from simple games to complex financial systems, and there is no limit to what you can create! Additionally, the decentralized nature of Ethereum makes it perfect for creating new models for finance, social impact, and other sectors.
