Attention mechanisms have become an important topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the rise of deep neural networks and their increasing computational power to handle large amounts of data. In this article, we will learn about attention mechanisms and how they work in sequence-to-sequence models such as transformer architecture used for machine translation tasks. This is a complex field, so we will try our best to explain everything clearly and concisely while providing simple code examples along with detailed explanations and explanatory images. Hopefully, this article can help those who are interested in understanding and implementing Attention mechanism in NLP or understand more deeply what happens behind the scenes when using them in modern architectures like transformers. 


In recent years, attention mechanisms have emerged as one of the most powerful tools for building state-of-the-art language models and natural language processing systems. These models are capable of capturing contextual relationships between words in sequences and generating accurate translations from one language to another without relying on traditional statistical techniques. The intuition behind these models lies in the fact that humans often use global information to make decisions, which includes not just local contexts but also previous and subsequent sentences and other related pieces of information. 

Transformer, the popular model architecture for machine translation tasks has been built upon attention mechanisms extensively. In this article, we will learn about different types of attention mechanisms and how they work inside transformer models for sequence-to-sequence learning. We will discuss various components involved in attention mechanisms and give insights into how it works for both self-attention and encoder-decoder type architectures. Finally, we will cover applications of attention mechanisms and some potential research directions for future research based on transformer models.


This article assumes basic knowledge of Deep Learning concepts, Neural Networks, Python programming, and Tensorflow library. If you don’t have any experience in these fields or if you want to get a deeper understanding of the content, please refer to other resources online. I will be updating this article regularly based on my own personal experiences. It may take several weeks before all sections are complete due to lack of time. Thank you for your patience! 



# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
Before discussing about attention mechanisms in detail, let's first understand some key terms and concepts that are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning.

## 2.1 Sequential Data
Sequential data refers to data where each input element depends only on the previous input elements. For example, consider a speech recognition system that takes audio signals as inputs and produces text outputs word by word. Each output depends only on the previously produced output. Another example of sequential data could be stock prices over a period of time. Each price observation depends only on the previous ones.

## 2.2 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a class of neural networks that operate on sequential data. RNNs allow neurons to store memory across timesteps and apply that stored information at every timestep. An RNN layer consists of a set of recurrent units, called cells, which process incoming data sequentially. There are two main types of RNN layers: vanilla RNNs and LSTM/GRU layers.

### 2.2.1 Vanilla RNN Layers
The vanilla RNN layers consist of a single cell or unit followed by either activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh or relu or no activation function depending on requirements. A vanilla RNN layer processes each input element separately and passes its output back to itself until the end of the sequence is reached. Each step of the process involves multiplying the current input with weights w_ih and adding bias b_ih, then passing through non-linearity g(.) to obtain the next hidden state h_t. Similarly, the output of each cell is calculated by applying weights w_ho and adding bias b_ho. To produce the final output, the network uses the last hidden state at the end of the sequence as well as all the intermediate states during training.



### 2.2.2 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Layers
The LSTM and GRU layers are extensions of standard RNNs and provide additional features such as long term dependencies and the ability to retain information even after the absence of input. LSTM and GRU cells include a forget gate, input gate, and output gate. The forget gate controls whether a particular piece of information should be retained in memory or forgotten. The input gate adds new information to the memory and the output gate decides which parts of the memory to keep and which ones to throw away. They both manage the flow of information through the cell and control how much short-term memory is available to the network. While LSTMs have higher computational complexity compared to GRUs, they perform better than standard RNNs in many tasks.
