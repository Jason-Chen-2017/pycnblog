Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning approach that enables agents to learn through trial-and-error interactions with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties accordingly. RL can be applied to a variety of sequential decision problems such as sequential resource allocation, inventory management, routing optimization, and pricing policies among other applications. This paper presents a survey of the research on reinforcement learning for sequential decision processes, focusing on the fundamentals and technical details about algorithms and implementations. In particular, we focus on multi-armed bandit problems, finite Markov decision process (MDP), policy iteration and value iteration, Q-learning, eligibility traces, n-step returns, dynamic programming methods for MDPs, model-based RL, and transfer learning. We also discuss future trends and challenges in RL for sequential decision processes, including computational complexity, scalability, sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation tradeoff, risk aversion, and bellman error analysis. Finally, we propose several open research questions related to the field. The potential impact of these questions is discussed briefly within this article.

# 3.背景介绍
Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most popular approaches in artificial intelligence due to its ability to solve complex tasks by discovering optimal actions based on feedback from the environment. Although there are many variations of RL algorithms, they share some common features. One fundamental assumption behind all RL algorithms is that agents interact with environments sequentially and receive reward signals at each step. These interactions result in the agent optimizing over time towards their long-term goals while taking into account the uncertainty associated with the unknown dynamics of the environment. 

In recent years, interest in RL for sequential decision processes (SDPs) has increased dramatically because SDPs have been shown to exhibit various desirable properties like probabilistic outcomes, non-stationarity, stochastic transitions, limited memory, and delayed effects. With the development of new deep neural network architectures, increasing computational power, and advanced techniques such as meta-learning, it is becoming possible to train models to perform complex sequential decisions efficiently. However, the underlying principles and foundations of RL remain mostly obscure, even though numerous works have made significant progress towards understanding them. 

The objective of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in reinforcement learning for sequential decision processes. To achieve this goal, we first introduce key concepts and terminologies that form the basis of modern RL for SDPs. We then present a general taxonomy of different reinforcement learning algorithms for SDPs and categorize them according to how they handle non-determinism and exploitation-exploration tradeoffs. Next, we analyze specific algorithms such as multi-armed bandits, finite MDP, policy iteration, value iteration, Q-learning, eligibility traces, and n-step returns, which are representative of the main categories outlined above. We also highlight how these algorithms can be combined together to build more powerful and effective strategies. Furthermore, we explore the relationships between different components of RL algorithms for SDPs, such as the representation of the environment, the planning algorithm, and the approximation function used to represent the value function. We conclude with a discussion of open research questions related to this topic and suggest directions for further research.

# 4.基本概念术语说明
Before going deeper into the detailed study of RL for sequential decision processes, let's go through some basic concepts and terms that help us understand RL for SDPs better.

1. Sequential Decision Problem (SDP): A sequential decision problem is defined as a decision task where an agent must select an action at every step of the episode given a sequence of observations $O_1, O_2, \cdots$, initially observed by the agent. The decision making process depends on both past choices and information acquired during previous steps. Examples include job scheduling, portfolio optimization, routing optimization, inventory management, pricing policies, etc., where the agent faces a series of decisions that affect subsequent outcomes. 

2. Reward Signal: At each step, the agent receives a scalar reward signal $r$ after taking an action $a$. If the agent makes a mistake, it will receive negative reward instead. The goal of the agent is to maximize cumulative reward over a finite number of episodes. 

3. Environment Dynamics: The behavior of the environment changes dynamically as a function of the agent’s actions, history of actions, and input signals. It can take various forms depending on the type of problem being solved, e.g., deterministic or stochastic, partially observable or fully observable. 

4. Agent Actions: An agent may choose any one of a fixed set of available actions at each step, i.e., each action defines the next decision point. 

5. Episode: The duration of interaction between the agent and the environment before the agent terminates. During each episode, the agent begins with a fresh start and performs a fixed sequence of actions until it reaches a terminal state. For example, if a video game agent is playing a puzzle game, the episode might last up to minutes. 

6. Observation: The initial observation $O_1$ provided to the agent informs her of the initial conditions and gives her access to certain information. 

7. MDP: The Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical framework introduced by Watkins and Johnson in 1994 to describe the way in which an agent navigates through an uncertain environment. It formalizes the assumptions about the agent’s perception, action selection, and reward generation. In essence, an MDP consists of four key elements: the states, actions, transition probabilities, and reward functions. 

8. State Space: The set of all possible states the agent can occupy throughout the episode. Each state represents a particular combination of attributes that define the current situation. 

9. Action Space: The set of all possible actions that the agent can take at each step. Every action either succeeds or fails with some probability. 

10. Transition Probabilities: The probability distribution that specifies the likelihood of moving from one state to another when taking an action. 

11. Reward Function: The expected numerical reward received at each state-action pair. It captures the benefit or penalty that the agent gets for taking a specific action in a particular state. 

12. Terminal States: Endpoints or dead ends of the MDP that terminate the episode. They do not allow the agent to continue the episode. 

13. Time Horizon: The maximum number of steps that the agent can execute before terminating the episode. It determines the length of the episode, since the agent starts with a fresh start at each episode. 

14. Discount Factor ($\gamma$): A discount factor $\gamma\in [0,1]$ controls the importance of future rewards relative to immediate ones. When $\gamma=0$, the agent cares only about the present reward; when $\gamma=1$, he/she regards all future rewards equally. Higher values of $\gamma$ imply higher importance placed on future rewards, encouraging the agent to consider longer term consequences. 

15. Trajectory: The path taken by the agent through the MDP starting from its initial state and following its selected actions. 

16. Exploratory Strategy: A strategy that aims to find out more about the environment without committing to a course of action early on. The exploratory component allows the agent to learn valuable insights about the world and improve its performance over time. Some common exploratory strategies are random walks, greedy strategies, tree search, and local hill climbing. 

17. Exploitative Strategy: A strategy that relies solely on knowledge learned from earlier experiences to make decisions. The exploitative component tries to exploit what it knows best, often leading to suboptimal solutions. Some common exploitative strategies are softmax policies, Thompson sampling, Bayesian learning, and adversarial strategies. 

18. Stochastic MDP: An MDP with continuous and/or discrete random variables in the transition probabilities. Common examples of stochastic MDPs include stock market trading, gridworld navigation, and robot control. 

19. Non-Stationary MDP: An MDP whose dynamics change gradually over time. Examples include queueing systems, traffic flow, or drug delivery. 

20. Limited Memory: An MDP with a restricted amount of memory capacity, typically corresponding to the size of the action space. Examples include multi-armed bandits, where each arm has limited resources and needs to be relearned periodically. 

21. Delayed Effects: An effect that affects the agent’s choice later in the episode than immediately upon taking an action. It arises from the influence of intervening events or actions, such as waiting for a customer to respond to an email message or booking a flight. 

22. Control Variate: An auxiliary variable added to the loss function to reduce the variance of the estimate of the true value function. The aim is to minimize the bias and reduce the variance of the estimator while maintaining the same level of exploration. 

# 5.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
Now let's look at the core algorithms involved in RL for sequential decision processes and the operations performed on the data. Firstly, we will explore the algorithms for single-step decision making:

1. **Multi-armed Bandit**: This algorithm involves k binary bandits, each with an independent payout rate, and the agent selects an action based on the maximum expected payout across the k options. The payouts may differ according to whether the chosen option was already highly recommended by others or not. At each step, the agent observes its total reward so far and updates its beliefs about which options yield high payouts using the Bernstein-UCB (BUCB) algorithm. The BUCB algorithm balances exploration (exploiting known good options) with exploitation (taking advantage of bad options). It maintains two estimates: the average reward for each arm, denoted $q_t(a)$, and the upper confidence bound (UCB) for each arm, denoted $u_t(a) = \sqrt{\frac{2\log t}{n_i(a)}}$, where $t$ is the current timestep, $n_i(a)$ is the number of times arm $a$ has been pulled prior to time $t$, and logarithmic terms are approximated using the running average formula. By combining these two estimators, the algorithm achieves near-optimistic bounds on the expected return for each arm and explores options proactively to discover those with high payouts.

2. **Finite Markov Decision Process (MDP)** : This classical model combines reinforcement learning with dynamic programming. Given the current state, the agent chooses an action based on a fixed policy and receives a reward based on the outcome of the action. Then, the agent moves to the next state and receives a discounted reward plus a bonus for entering the terminal state. The MDP solution uses value iteration or Q-learning to determine the optimal policy and value function. The latter requires specifying the parameters for computing the Q-value function and updating it iteratively using a temporal difference method. Similarly, value iteration computes the optimal value function of the MDP using dynamic programming, but without considering the agent's action. Instead, Q-learning directly learns the optimal policy by updating a parameterized policy function via gradient descent. Both methods require calculating the matrix exponential or discretization of the transition probabilities to compute the expected state-action values, respectively. Additionally, the policy evaluation loop converges to a stationary distribution of visitation frequencies under the policy derived from the value function, which helps avoid getting stuck in a local minimum.

Next, we will examine the algorithms for multi-step decision making:

1. **Policy Iteration** : This algorithm applies value iteration to approximate the optimal policy for each state and repeat the process until convergence. The policy iteration procedure alternates between evaluating the value function for the current policy and selecting a new policy based on the updated value function. The optimal policy is computed using linear programming solvers to optimize the average reward criterion. The policy improvement step uses the Bellman backup equation to update the policy based on the current estimated value function. The expectation maximization algorithm (EM) can be viewed as a special case of policy iteration with infinite horizon.

2. **Value Iteration** : This algorithm constructs a large-scale value function by recursively computing the expected reward at each state and acting greedily wrt the resulting action. The value function is initialized to zero and updated iteratively using a recursive formula based on the Bellman optimality equations. The exact solution becomes feasible only for small to medium sized MDPs, whereas the approximate solution obtained by policy iteration or Q-learning provides much faster convergence rates. Despite its simplicity, value iteration still remains computationally expensive compared to policy iteration and Q-learning, especially for larger MDPs with a wide range of reward magnitudes and non-linearities.

3. **Q-learning** : This algorithm modifies the standard TD algorithm to directly learn the optimal policy instead of relying on a predefined policy. It uses an epsilon-greedy exploration policy to decide whether to follow the current policy or choose a random action. The Q-function is represented as a table indexed by state-action pairs, and is trained using an off-policy variant of TD called SARSA. The SARSA update rule can be written as follows:

   $$Q_{t+1}(S_t,A_t) := Q_t(S_t,A_t) + \alpha[R_{t+1} + \gamma Q_t(S_{t+1},argmax_{a'}Q_t(S_{t+1},a')) - Q_t(S_t,A_t)]$$
   
   where $Q_t(S_t,A_t)$ is the estimated Q-value of the current state and action, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, $R_{t+1}$ is the reward received at the next state, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, $S_{t+1}$ is the next state, and argmax is the index of the largest element in a vector. The target value is calculated using the Bellman backup equation, and the estimate is updated based on the current error. The algorithm continues to generate experience by interacting with the environment, and the model is updated incrementally using batch processing.

4. **Eligibility Traces** : This algorithm augments the idea of trace-based learning in reinforcement learning to enable efficient computation of Q-values. It introduces a trace weighting scheme based on past observations and recent actions to adjust the learning speed and direction, reducing the need for full backups. The eligibility trace equation relates to the estimated value function and takes the form:

   $$\Delta\theta_t := \alpha\delta_t(\theta^\pi - \theta_{\theta_t})$$
   
where $\theta^\pi$ is the optimal parameter vector, $\theta_t$ is the parameter vector at time $t$, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\delta_t$ is the temporal difference error. The eligibility trace represents the degree to which the agent should update its estimate of the parameter vector based on the differences between the actual and estimated parameter vectors. The trace is initialized to zero at each state and accumulates over time.

5. **N-step Returns** : This algorithm reduces the variance of the temporal difference errors used by Q-learning by introducing multiple steps of credit assignment, which leads to better overall convergence rates. Specifically, at each step $t$, the agent adds the weighted sum of future rewards $G_t^n = R_{t+1}+\gamma R_{t+2}+\cdots+\gamma^{n-1}R_{t+n-1}\gamma^n$ to its estimate of the Q-value for the current state-action pair, with weights $(1-\lambda)\gamma^{i}$, $i=0,\ldots,n-1$, where $\lambda\in [0,1]$ is the mixing hyperparameter. The lambda parameter controls the balance between taking future rewards now versus waiting to accumulate future rewards later, leading to shorter-term bias vs. variance tradeoff. N-step returns can be easily incorporated into existing algorithms by modifying the target value calculation and updating the learning rate.

6. **Dynamic Programming Methods for MDPs** : There exist several efficient and scalable dynamic programming algorithms designed specifically for solving MDPs. Here are a few examples:

   * Iterative policy evaluation: Compute the expected returns at each state and update the estimate of the value function using a simple version of the Bellman equation. Repeat until convergence.
   * Policy iteration: Apply value iteration to estimate the optimal policy, and iterate until convergence.
   * Value iteration: Use dynamic programming to calculate the optimal value function directly from scratch.
   * Robust POMDP: Solve POMDPs with additive noise and constraints on the likelihood of observations. Uses Gaussian mixture filters and the particle filter for inference.
   
Lastly, we will discuss the relationship between different components of RL algorithms for SDPs:

1. **Representation of the Environment** : Different representations of the environment may lead to different estimation errors and computation costs. Linear functions may work well for low-dimensional spaces and global models for large and complex environments. 

2. **Planning Algorithm** : Planning refers to finding the optimal policy within a specified time constraint. While different algorithms such as forward search, backward search, CSP (constraint satisfaction problem) solver, etc. can be used for planning, they tend to be computationally expensive and not applicable for large real-time applications. Most practical applications rely on model-based methods such as model free, model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and model predictive control (MPC). MBRL includes dynamic programming methods, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), etc. MPC solves a linear system of equations to optimize the cost function. 

3. **Approximation Function** : The approximation function is responsible for representing the value function. The simplest representation is tabular, which stores the value of each state-action pair explicitly. Other alternatives include linear functions, kernel functions, neural networks, etc. Neural networks can capture complex dependencies between the states and actions and are particularly useful for high dimensional MDPs. The approximation function plays a crucial role in the speed and accuracy of the algorithm. It also influences the stability of the results, which can vary depending on the quality of the approximation. 

To summarize, the majority of RL algorithms for sequential decision processes involve computing value functions and policies and updating them using sampled experience from the environment. Many of these algorithms use various types of approximations and planners for efficient computation. With careful design of the representation of the environment, planner, and approximation function, we can develop robust and scalable algorithms that can effectively tackle a wide range of sequential decision problems.
