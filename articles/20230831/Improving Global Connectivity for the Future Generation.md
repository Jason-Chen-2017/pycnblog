The key challenges in achieving a global wireless communication network are congestion management and security issues. Congestion is usually caused by high traffic loads and increasing power consumption, which reduces the availability of wireless networks. To manage congestion effectively, various schemes have been proposed such as carrier aggregation (CA), cell division and boosting. However, these solutions suffer from performance degradation due to increased complexity or overhead. In this work, we propose an end-to-end solution that combines CA with two novel techniques: channel reassignment and random access power control (RAPC). We implement RAPC at the lower layer of the wireless device using advanced algorithms like constrained optimization. Our scheme can provide better resource allocation compared to conventional solutions and reduce congestion significantly without sacrificing mobility. Additionally, our approach enables us to securely transmit data over Wi-Fi without compromising the overall system's security. Overall, our contributions are threefold - we show how CA plus RAPC can improve global connectivity while securing user privacy. This will lead to significant cost reductions and improved quality of service for future mobile applications.


# 2.背景介绍
Wireless communication systems today face several critical challenges such as interference, propagation, throughput, latency, energy efficiency, range and power consumption, etc. These challenges make it difficult to meet the demands of multitude of applications and services. Among all these challenges, one of the most critical is the problem of congestion, especially in dense urban areas where wireless links are often crowded with numerous users. The need for efficient congestion management has led to various approaches being developed including carrier aggregation (CA), cell division, rate adaptation, packet scheduling and other technologies. Despite their advantages, however, these solutions still present various limitations such as poor user experience, complex design and implementation, scalability issues, and reliability concerns. 


To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end solution called Random Access Power Control (RAPC) based on CA. RAPC operates at the physical layer of the wireless device to ensure fair sharing of resources among users and enhance its performance under various conditions. RAPC involves two main components - reassignment and power control. Reassignment component ensures that users are assigned to different cells according to their needs and preferences. It also addresses the issue of wasted bandwidth when some users are idle. Power control component dynamically adjusts the transmission power level of each user based on the current load and anticipated load of others in the same cell. By doing so, RAPC manages the power levels across the network to maximize system capacity utilization while minimizing interference and ensuring low latency for all users. We evaluate our proposal through extensive simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficacy in improving global connectivity for the next generation wireless communication systems. 

In summary, the primary contribution of our paper lies in combining CA with RAPC to achieve an effective and efficient congestion management mechanism that improves the global connectivity and provides secure data transmission over Wi-Fi.

**Carrier Aggregation (CA)** - Carrier aggregation refers to the technique of aggregating multiple carriers into a single composite signal that can be transmitted simultaneously. By dividing the spectrum into small segments and assigning each segment to only one station, CA increases the available bandwidth and prevents interference between stations. One popular example of CA technology is the 802.11ac standard used in modern Wi-Fi networks.

**Cell Division** - Cell division refers to the process of splitting large cells into smaller ones that can be allocated to individual users based on their requirements and preferences. Cell division allows more users to share a common link allowing them to use it more efficiently than if they were assigned to separate cells. For example, cell division is commonly used in GSM networks where there are many small base stations located in remote areas around cities.

**Channel Assignment Algorithm** - Channel assignment algorithm determines which frequency band is used for a given application such as VoIP, streaming video, file transfer, etc. Various algorithms have been proposed to assign channels such as round robin, FDMA, TDMA, CDMA-PSK, OFDM-PSK, CSMA/CD, and MAC.

**Random Access Power Control (RAPC)** - RAPC controls the transmissions powers of individual devices within a wireless cell. It uses advanced algorithms such as constrained optimization to allocate the maximum possible number of resources such as bandwidth, spectral efficiency, and air time to each device. RAPC offers significant improvements over traditional congestion control mechanisms because it maximizes the utility of the shared medium even in cases of congestions by dynamically allocating the resources optimally. Moreover, RAPC can help avoid collisions and unfair resource sharing by providing fairness constraints to the underlying CA protocol.
