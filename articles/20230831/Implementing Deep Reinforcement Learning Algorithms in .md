# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that enables agents to learn how to make decisions under uncertainty by trial and error through interaction with the environment. The core idea behind RL is to create an agent that can take actions in the environment based on its perceptions and rewards received from doing so. In this article, we will discuss how to use deep reinforcement learning algorithms to train financial trading bots. 

Deep reinforcement learning involves training complex neural networks using reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning or actor-critic methods. We will introduce basic concepts and terminology related to finance before discussing the two main types of deep RL algorithms used for financial market analysis - deep Q-networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods like REINFORCE. We will also provide step-by-step code examples for implementing DQN and REINFORCE in Python using OpenAI gym library. Finally, we will outline future directions and challenges in finance and AI. Our goal is to inspire and inform researchers, developers, and practitioners about recent advances in finance and RL for financial applications. 


# 2. 基本概念术语说明
In order to understand the topic better, let’s briefly go over some fundamental terms and definitions:

1. **Agent**: An entity that interacts with the environment to maximize its reward signal. It learns to choose appropriate actions based on observations made by observing the environment. 

2. **Environment**: A world where the agent interacts and receives feedback from the surrounding entities. In finance, it refers to the set of variables that influence stock prices. For example, the opening price, closing price, volume traded, etc. 

3. **Action**: Actions are inputs given to the agent by the user which direct it towards performing certain tasks. Examples include buying/selling a stock at a specific price level, taking a riskier investment portfolio than average, increasing leverage on a trade, etc. In finance, an action typically consists of one or more securities being bought or sold simultaneously. 

4. **State**: A representation of the current state of the environment observed by the agent. In finance, the state usually includes information such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, moving averages, volatility indices, technical indicators, company performance metrics, news articles, social media trends, sentiment scores, weather data, and economic indicators.

5. **Reward**: Rewards are positive or negative values given to the agent after completing an action. They indicate whether the agent has achieved its goals successfully or not. In finance, the rewards are derived from the return generated by making a profitable decision.

6. **Episode**: A sequence of interactions between the agent and the environment that ends when either the agent finishes interacting or the end condition is met. 

7. **Experience replay**: A technique that stores past experiences and samples batches of them randomly to train the agent. This helps address high correlation issues encountered in traditional supervised learning approaches.

8. **Batch size**: Number of experiences sampled from experience replay at each iteration during training.

9. **Replay buffer**: A collection of stored experiences. Experience replay allows us to sample random batches of experiences from the replay buffer to improve training stability and sample diversity across different episodes. 

10. **Policy Gradient Method**: Policy gradients are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that optimize the parameters of a policy function instead of a value function. It directly estimates the expected returns by following a learned probability distribution defined by the policy network. 

11. **Q-Learning**: One of the most popular reinforcement learning algorithms used for training deep neural networks. It uses a table-based approach to estimate the optimal action-value function. 

12. **Deep Q Network (DQN)** : One of the best performing reinforcement learning algorithms used for training financial trading bots. DQN combines CNN architecture with a Q-network, which provides a better approximation of the optimal action-value function compared to tabular methods like Q-learning. 

13. **Advantage Estimation**: While calculating the loss in a standard PG method, the advantage term plays an important role. It calculates the difference between the discounted cumulative return of the selected action and the mean of all other actions available at that state. The advantage estimation technique involves subtracting the estimated value of the baseline action (such as a fixed initial guess) from the target action taken.

14. **Baselines**: Baselines represent a reference point against which we measure the improvement in our model's performance. When computing the loss in a standard PG method, we subtract the logarithm of the baselined policy probabilities from the sum of logarithmic probabilities of selected and unselected actions respectively.

15. **Trickle-down**: Trickle-down regulates the flow of rewards throughout the deep neural network hierarchy. It prevents any single node from independently influencing the final decision. Instead, it passes the total reward back through the entire network in a recursive manner until a terminal state is reached.

16. **OpenAI Gym**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It contains prebuilt environments for testing reinforcement learning agents and comes bundled with several classic control problems such as cartpole and mountaincar. 

17. **Tensorflow**: An open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. TensorFlow is widely used for building machine learning models and implements various APIs for training, evaluating, and deploying deep neural networks.
