Short text classification is the task of assigning a label to a short piece of text based on its content and contextual information. This field has recently received considerable attention due to its wide range of applications such as sentiment analysis, spam filtering, topic detection, etc. There have been many approaches proposed to solve this problem including machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with different architectures such as LSTM, GRU, transformers, etc. In this article, we will compare the performance of various deep learning models in classifying short texts based on their semantic features using word embeddings obtained through pre-trained language models like Google's BERT and Facebook's RoBERTa. We also examine how these models perform when trained on small datasets while achieving high accuracy results on large-scale benchmarks like Twitter sentiment analysis dataset. Finally, we present some practical recommendations on choosing appropriate deep learning models for short text classification tasks based on our empirical findings.

The goal of this research project is to provide insights into the performance differences between popular machine learning models for short text classification tasks that are widely used today, especially those using pre-trained language models. The specific focus here is comparing BERT and BiLSTM for the purpose of short text classification but similar comparisons can be made for other deep learning models using pre-trained language models. The contributions of this work include:

1. Experimental evaluation of two deep learning models for short text classification using pre-trained language models. 

2. Analysis of experimental results to identify the key factors that affect model performance, such as input size, pre-training data size, batch size, optimizer settings, learning rate schedule, hyperparameters, etc.

3. Designing an optimal set of hyperparameters for each model to achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

4. Providing practical guidelines for choosing appropriate deep learning models for short text classification tasks by considering factors such as domain knowledge, available training data size, computational resources, and desired level of accuracy. 

We hope that the proposed approach could shed light onto existing challenges and help advance the state-of-the-art for short text classification tasks using pre-trained language models.

In natural language processing, short text refers to documents having lengths ranging from one sentence to a few paragraphs. Classifying short text is important because it helps organizations better understand customer feedback, social media posts, product reviews, emails, and so on. Various deep learning models have been proposed to classify short text, including logistic regression, SVM, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and Reformer. 

Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are language models that were trained on massive corpora of text and then fine-tuned on specific domains to produce accurate representations of words, phrases, and sentences. Pre-trained language models play an essential role in natural language processing as they allow us to train powerful models without extensive labeled data. These models capture complex relationships between words and hence enable them to handle more complex languages and tasks than traditional statistical methods. 

Generally speaking, there are three main types of PLMs:

1. Word embedding models such as GloVe and fastText which map individual words to dense vectors where the cosine similarity of two vectors represents their degree of similarity. 

2. Transformer-based PLMs such as BERT and ALBERT which use transformer architecture to learn language representation. These models consist of multiple layers of encoders and decoders stacked together and trained jointly on a combination of masked language modeling (MLM), next sentence prediction (NSP), and sentence order prediction (SOP). 

3. Sentence embedding models such as Universal Sentence Encoder which encode entire sentences into fixed length vectors called sentence embeddings. The sentence embeddings can be compared directly with human annotations and hence give high quality predictions.

In this paper, we evaluate both BERT and BiLSTM for short text classification using pre-trained language models. Both models share a common feature extractor layer that processes the raw text inputs to generate feature vectors that represent the semantics of the text. The difference lies in the way they process the sequences of tokens within the text. BERT uses self-attention mechanism to compute interactions among tokens within the sequence. On the other hand, BiLSTM consists of cells that take sequential inputs and produce output at every time step according to hidden units, memory cells, and activation functions. These cells process the input sequence independently at each time step and do not require any external memory allocation. We compare the two models’ performance on various metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and latency. Additionally, we explore why certain models may outperform others and propose several practical guidelines for choosing appropriate deep learning models for short text classification tasks based on our experiment results.
