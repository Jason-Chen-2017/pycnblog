In this article, we will focus on text simplification, which is the process of transforming a complex sentence into a simpler form while still conveying its meaning accurately and maintaining its original rhetorical style. Text simplification can be used to improve readability and engagement, as well as to reduce the time required for comprehension by non-native speakers or those with cognitive impairments. In this work, we propose an approach to automatically simplify text using a pipeline architecture that involves three main components: pre-processing, simplification, and post-processing. The goal of our research is to create an automated system that can convert long sentences into concise forms that are easier to understand than their original counterparts. To achieve this, we use various techniques such as tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition (NER), and word embeddings to extract relevant information from the input sentence and use them in combination with language models like GPT-2 or T5 to generate simplified output texts. 

We believe that machine learning has the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing, particularly in text simplification tasks where human intervention is costly and limited. By leveraging techniques and algorithms from computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep neural networks, we hope to build accurate, robust, and scalable systems that automate this task and enable people to communicate more effectively.

**Text simplification**: A technique used to compress and condense a longer sentence into a shorter form without losing essential details but retaining the overall meaning and sentiment of the original sentence.[1] It helps in reducing reading times and promotes better understanding of the content.[2] There have been many works on this topic in different fields such as computer science, artificial intelligence, marketing, and psychology. Some of these approaches include:

 - **Lexicon-based methods:** These involve replacing words in a given sentence with simpler versions based on a predefined set of rules. For example, replacing 'the' with 'a', 'I' with 'you'.[3]

 - **Sentence compression:** This involves summarizing important aspects of the original sentence and discarding less significant ones. Examples of common techniques include removing stopwords, collapsing repeating phrases, and merging redundant clauses. 

 - **Machine translation techniques:** These involve translating the source sentence into another language and then back to English to obtain the simplest possible version.[4] However, some of these techniques may not produce the desired result due to the limitations of translation models such as errors caused by abbreviations and contractions.

 - **Knowledge-based methods:** These rely on knowledge graphs or ontologies to identify and replace specific types of concepts, events, or ideas. They also attempt to preserve the underlying meaning of the sentence rather than just deleting unimportant parts.

 - **Graph-based algorithms:** These utilize graph theory to analyze relationships between words and sentences and create new representations that encode the salient features of the original text.[5][6]

 - **Sentiment analysis:** This involves analyzing the emotions expressed in the sentence and adjusting the tone accordingly. Sentences with positive or negative sentiments are usually compressed into simpler expressions while neutral ones remain unchanged. 
 
 - **Question answering systems:** These aim to provide answers to questions based on extracted entities and relations among them. However, they often fail to capture all the nuances present in the context and require manual annotation to handle cases where text simplification would lead to inconsistencies.[7]

Therefore, there is no single best method for text simplification since each algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the problem at hand. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and simplicity and the choice of algorithm could depend on factors such as size of the dataset, availability of resources, performance requirements, etc. Therefore, building an effective automated text simplification system requires careful consideration of multiple factors such as user preference, budget constraint, and ethics considerations.

One of the most commonly used libraries for text simplification in Python is NLTK, which provides support for several preprocessing tools including lemmatization, stemming, and tokenization. Other popular open-source libraries include spaCy, Stanza, and AllenNLP.

GPT-2 and T5 are two popular transformer-based language models that were developed by Google and Salesforce respectively. Both models are capable of generating high quality outputs even in the presence of irrelevant contexts and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Additionally, both models have been shown to perform well on text simplification tasks compared to other state-of-the-art models. However, some challenges exist when training such large models like GPT-2 or T5 due to memory constraints, long training times, and high compute costs.

Another challenge in this area is developing evaluation metrics that measure the effectiveness of text simplification systems and make fair comparisons across various datasets. Common metrics include ROUGE score, BLEU score, METEOR score, and distinctness measures like cosine similarity between vectors produced by the language model and semantically similar texts in the corpus.

Finally, one limitation of current text simplification systems is that they cannot handle hierarchical or multi-modal inputs or output languages such as dialogues or conversations. Also, they tend to generate repetitive patterns that need to be corrected manually. Moreover, they do not account for subtle variations in writing styles or dialects, making them difficult to generalize to real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, if we address these issues, we can develop highly accurate, efficient, and scalable systems for text simplification.
