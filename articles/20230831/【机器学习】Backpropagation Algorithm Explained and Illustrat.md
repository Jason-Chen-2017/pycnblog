Backpropagation (BP) is one of the key algorithms used in deep learning for training neural networks. BP works by calculating error gradients at each layer, starting from the output layer and going backwards through the network to propagate errors to earlier layers. The algorithm updates weights based on these gradients using an update rule that takes into account both the current weight value and its corresponding gradient.

In this article, we will explain how Backpropagation works mathematically and step-by-step with some Python code examples to illustrate the process. We also cover some advanced topics like convergence issues, momentum, batch normalization, dropout regularization, and other techniques commonly used in modern deep learning models.

2.Basic Concepts
To understand Backpropagation, you need to have a good understanding of several basic concepts:
1. Activation function: Every node in the Neural Network has an activation function that decides whether it should activate or not depending upon the input values received from other nodes. Commonly used functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, etc.

2. Loss Function: A loss function measures how well the Neural Network model predicts the correct output given the input data. There are different types of loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross Entropy Loss, Hinge Loss, etc. Depending on the type of problem, we can use appropriate loss function to train our Neural Networks.

3. Gradient Descent: In order to minimize the loss function, we apply gradient descent which adjusts the weights of all neurons in the Neural Network towards their optimal state by following the negative slope of the loss curve at each iteration. It starts with random initial weights and tries to reach the minimum point where the loss is minimized.

4. Feedforward Pass: Feedforward pass refers to computing the outputs of each neuron after passing inputs forward through the network. Each node in the Neural Network receives the weighted sum of inputs from the previous layer and applies the activation function to produce the output. This process continues until the final output layer is reached.

5. Backward Pass: In backward pass, the error between predicted and actual output is calculated and then propagated backwards through the network to calculate the gradient of the weights leading up to the last hidden layer. The calculation involves multiplying the derivative of the activation function with the error signal at each layer to get the gradient of weights.

6. Weight Update Rule: Finally, the gradient obtained from the backpropogation is applied to the weights using an update rule. These rules involve either adding or subtracting a fraction of the gradient multiplied by a small learning rate to the current weight value. 

7. Forward Propagation vs Backward propagation: Forward propagation computes the output predictions while backward propagation calculates the errors between predicted and true labels and uses them to update the weights in the direction opposite to the gradient to improve the accuracy of the model.

8. One Hot Encoding: One hot encoding is a technique used when dealing with categorical variables such as classes. It converts the class label from a categorical variable to a binary vector having only one element set to 1 and the rest of the elements set to 0.

Before we move further, let's write down some important points regarding deep learning and machine learning:

9. Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with artificial neural networks with multiple layers of connected neurons. Layers learn features from raw data and combine them to make accurate predictions or classifications.

10. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNNs are specialized version of deep learning architectures designed specifically for computer vision tasks. They are useful for image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

11. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): RNNs are type of deep learning architecture designed specifically for sequential data processing. They are often used for natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and time series prediction.

12. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM): LSTM is another type of deep learning architecture that is particularly effective for sequence processing applications. It allows information stored in long-term memory to be passed along to later time steps without vanishing.

13. Autoencoders: An autoencoder is a type of Neural Network that learns to encode and decode input data. It consists of two parts - encoder and decoder. The encoder transforms the input data into lower dimensional space and the decoder generates reconstructed output based on the encoded representation. It is widely used for anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction.

14. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are a powerful generative modeling tool. They generate new samples from existing ones by training a generator network against a discriminator network. The generator network creates synthetic images that look similar to real images but are fake. Discriminator network evaluates the authenticity of generated images and provides feedback to the generator network to improve the quality of generated images.
