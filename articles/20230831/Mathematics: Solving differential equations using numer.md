## Differential Equations
A differential equation (DE) is an algebraic equation involving one or more functions of one or more variables. It describes a change in the value of a function between two points in time. A DE can be expressed in terms of the derivative of its solution. For example, consider the first-order linear differential equation $y'=f(x)\cdot y+g(x)$, where $y$ represents a function of $x$. If we know the values of $y$ at $x=a$, then we can find its value at any point after $a$ using initial conditions.

We generally classify DEs into three categories depending on whether they have a constant term ($c\cdot y'+d\cdot f(x)$), higher order terms ($r_n \cdot y^{(n)} + \cdots + r_0 \cdot y^0 + g(x)$), or no constants ($y'=f(x)\cdot y$):

1. Linear First-Order DEs: These include ordinary differential equations which depend only on the independent variable $x$:
   $$ y' = f(x) \cdot y $$ 
   with an initial condition $y(a)=C$ for some given constant $C$. 
   
2. Nonlinear First-Order DEs: This includes all types of DEs which do not satisfy the above property:
   $$ y' = f(t,y,\frac{dy}{dt},\dots,y^{(m)}) $$
   
3. Systems of DEs: These are multivariable systems containing multiple dependent variables and unknown parameters:
   $$ \begin{cases} y'_1 &= f_{1}(x,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n)\\ y'_2 &= f_{2}(x,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n)\\&\vdots\\ y'_n &= f_{n}(x,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n)\end{cases}$$
   
   Here, each $f_i$ represents a partial differential equation for $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$. The system has n variables $y_i$ and m equations.

In general, we refer to the right-hand side of the DE as the 'function', the left-hand side as the 'derivative', and the 'independent variable' as the 'parameter'. The coefficient functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ represent the unknown coefficients involved in the DE.



## Numerical Methods
Numerical methods are algorithms used to approximate the true solution of a DE within a finite interval of width $\Delta x$. There are numerous numerical methods available for solving DEs, but some commonly used ones are:

1. Euler's Method: This method approximates the value of $y$ at the next step using the formula:

   $$ y_{i+1}=y_i + h \cdot f(x_i,y_i)$$
   
   Where $h$ is the step size, $\Delta x=\frac{b-a}{N}$, $N$ is the number of steps, $x_i=a+(i-1)\Delta x$, and $y_i$ is the approximation up to step i.

2. Runge-Kutta Methods: These methods use four stages of varying step sizes to approximate the solution of the DE over a fixed interval. The most popular runge-kutta method is the fourth-order runge-kutta method.
