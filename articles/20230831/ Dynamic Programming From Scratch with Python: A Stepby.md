# 1.简介
  

Dynamic programming (DP) is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and building up a complete solution from these solutions to the original problem. It involves using mathematical optimization concepts like divide and conquer and memoization to reduce the number of computations needed in order to solve larger problems. DP has been around since the early days of computer science as part of efficient algorithms that can be used to tackle various real-world problems. The techniques behind DP have come a long way over the years, and DP still remains an important tool in modern computing. 

However, learning how to implement dynamic programming algorithms from scratch may seem daunting if you are new to this field or do not have much experience in programming languages other than Python. This article aims to provide a step-by-step guide on implementing DP algorithms from scratch in Python, with an emphasis on explaning each algorithm's core concept and how it works in detail. We will also go through some common pitfalls that arise while implementing DP algorithms and present ways to avoid them. At the end of this article, we hope readers understand better about what dynamic programming is and how it can help solve complex problems efficiently.

Before proceeding further, let us know your level of expertise in dynamic programming and any coding skills in Python. You should be comfortable working with arrays/lists, recursion, and basic data structures like dictionaries and sets. 

By the end of the article, you will learn:
* How to implement DP algorithms such as coin change, subset sum, knapsack, job scheduling, and sequence alignment efficiently in Python.

In summary, this article provides a detailed overview of dynamic programming from scratch in Python, including introduction, fundamental concepts, core algorithms, and practical applications. Readers who want to delve deeper into specific topics or wish to expand on their understanding of DP will benefit greatly from reading the entire article. 


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Divide and Conquer Approach
One of the main ideas behind the divide and conquer approach to DP is that we can break down a large problem into smaller subproblems which are easier to handle than the whole problem itself. Once we obtain the answers to all the small subproblems, we can combine them to form a final solution to the overall problem. In fact, many famous problems like sorting, searching, and matrix multiplication follow this approach. 

The most popular DP algorithms use recursive calls to split the problem into multiple subproblems until they reach a base case where there is only one element left. Then, the answer to the original problem is computed by combining the results obtained from the subproblems. One example of a DP algorithm is merge sort. Here, the problem of sorting a list of numbers is broken down into two halves recursively until each half contains only one element. These sorted lists are then merged back together in sorted order to get the final result. Another example is binary search, where we first compare the middle element with the target value. If the target value is less than the middle element, we discard the right half of the array and repeat the process with the left half. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we discard the left half of the array and repeat the process with the right half. When we find the target value at the midpoint of the array, we return its index.

## Memoization
Memoization is an optimization technique that stores previously calculated values so that they can be reused later instead of recalculating them again. This helps save computational time by avoiding redundant calculations. DP often uses memoization to avoid repeating the same computation multiple times and speed up the process. For example, consider the Fibonacci sequence. To calculate the nth Fibonacci number, we need to compute the previous two numbers repeatedly. Instead of doing that every time, we can store the already computed values in an array and reuse them whenever necessary. Similarly, DP algorithms often use memoization to optimize performance. 

Memoization is implemented by creating a cache variable that holds the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This saves time compared to recomputing the result every time. However, care must be taken to ensure that the cache is correctly updated whenever the input changes, otherwise the memoized result might become invalid. Therefore, it is essential to keep track of the dependencies between variables used in the memoized functions.
