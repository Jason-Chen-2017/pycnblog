Smart thermostats are widely used in modern homes to maintain temperature control over time. They allow users to monitor the room temperature and automatically adjust it based on user preferences such as seasonality or activity level. One of the most popular types of smart thermostats is WiFi-connected ones that use Wi-Fi networks for communication between the controller and the remote thermostat unit. However, these devices can be expensive and sometimes have limited functionality when there's no cellular connection available (e.g., at hot climates). In this article, we will build a smart thermostat using an Arduino microcontroller and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless technology. We will also discuss various factors affecting its performance and design principles to optimize its usage and comfort levels.

In general, building a successful smart thermostat requires many important technical skills, including electronics, software development, networking, data analysis, and marketing. However, with proper planning and execution, any smart thermostat can achieve great success by leveraging multiple technologies together and optimizing each aspect to work seamlessly within the context of daily living. 

We'll start with basic concepts, terminology, algorithms, and operations. Then move onto coding examples and explanations. Finally, we'll conclude with future trends and challenges. With careful consideration and attention to detail, our ultimate goal is to provide readers with clear, concise, and informative insights into how to build their own smart thermostat using Arduino and BLE technology.


## 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
Before diving into the details of building a smart thermostat, let’s first understand some fundamental terms and principles that are essential to understanding the system architecture. 


### 2.1. Temperature Sensor
The main component required to implement a smart thermostat is a temperature sensor. This device collects information about the ambient air temperature inside the room where the thermostat is installed. The temperature sensors vary in accuracy and measurement range, but they should always be calibrated to ensure accurate measurements. Some commonly used temperature sensors include: digital thermometers, analog meters, and resistance thermometers.


### 2.2. Wireless Communication Technology
Wireless communication technology plays a crucial role in enabling the transfer of data between a smart thermostat and the user’s smartphone app. There are several different wireless communication protocols used today, including Zigbee, Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi Multicast, Bluetooth, Near Field Communications (NFC), and GSM/UMTS. For our purposes, we will focus on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is a low power protocol designed specifically for IoT applications like smart thermostats. BLE enables small devices like our thermostat to connect directly without requiring a wired network or centralized server. It has a longer range than other wireless technologies, making it ideal for use in outdoor spaces and locations.


### 2.3. Microcontroller
An Arduino microcontroller is a small single-board computer that provides basic input/output capabilities via digital pins. These features make it ideal for prototyping new ideas and creating low-cost projects like our smart thermostat. The microcontroller operates on a powerful 3.3V logic level, allowing us to easily interface with various peripherals like sensors and actuators. Among others, we can use digital inputs and outputs to read and write signals from the temperature sensor, LED indicators, buzzer, and relay module.


### 2.4. Relay Module
A relay module works similarly to a physical wall switch. When the input signal goes high, it opens the circuit and allows current to flow through it. On the other hand, if the input signal falls below a certain threshold, the module closes the circuit and blocks any current flow. By controlling the state of the relay module, we can remotely activate the heating element, cooling element, or fan depending on the desired temperature set point.


### 2.5. Heater, Fan, and Temperature Control Algorithm
To regulate the temperature inside the room, a smart thermostat needs to communicate with the temperature sensor and the user’s smartphone application to receive instructions on what temperature they want the room to be maintained at. To accomplish this task, we need to determine how the heating, cooling, and ventilation elements operate in relation to one another and to the temperature sensor output. Here are three common methods to control the temperature:

* **Proportional control**: This method involves setting a target temperature and adjusting the heat or cooling element(s) accordingly. If the actual temperature is above the target temperature, the heater turns on to bring down the temperature faster; otherwise, the cooler turns on to increase the temperature faster. Proportional control ensures that the temperature stays within safe limits while providing flexibility and responsiveness to fluctuating demands. 

* **Integral control**: Integral control uses both the error term and the measured value of the process variable to adjust the action of the heating or cooling element(s). Error terms accumulate over time, leading to instability and oscillation around the target temperature. Integral control compensates for the accumulated errors by adding them to the heating or cooling element adjustment.

* **Derivative control**: Derivative control measures the rate of change of the error term and attempts to minimize it by adjusting only the sign of the heating or cooling element adjustment. This approach helps to reduce oscillation and improve stability at lower speeds.


Our thermostat will employ integral control algorithm because it combines the effects of both the proportional and derivative control techniques, ensuring that the temperature stays within acceptable bounds while providing more responsive and stable operation.


### 2.6. Smartphone Application
Smartphone apps are quickly becoming a critical part of everyday life for people of all age groups. While traditional thermostats display temperature values in static displays or push notifications, smartphone apps offer real-time monitoring and control of the thermostat. The Android platform offers native support for BLE connectivity and APIs that simplify the integration of Bluetooth LE devices. Additionally, smartphone apps can customize the appearance and behavior of the UI according to individual preferences and roles within the household.
