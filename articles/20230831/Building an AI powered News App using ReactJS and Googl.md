As we all know that artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the world today. As more and more companies are turning towards AI-powered solutions for their core businesses, news websites such as BBC News or CNN have embraced the use of AI in delivering top stories to users. But how can a company like BBC News leverage the power of AI without having any data scientists? In this article, I will explain how a company like BBC News leveraged the power of AI by building a new machine learning system based on TensorFlow and Google Cloud platform services. Specifically, I will cover:

1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - A brief overview of what AI is and why it’s transforming our lives and industries.
2. Terminologies used in Deep Learning - Familiarize yourself with some common terminologies used when working with deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short term memory networks, and GPT-3.
3. Setting up the Environment - Create your own virtual environment on your computer so you can start developing projects based on TensorFlow and Google Cloud Platform services.
4. Collecting Data - Use various sources such as RSS feeds or APIs provided by various content providers to collect relevant articles related to topics you are interested in.
5. Preprocessing Data - Clean, normalize, and tokenize the collected data before training the model.
6. Training the Model - Train the model using TensorFlow framework to predict the probability of whether each article belongs to one of two categories – political or non-political. The model should be able to learn patterns from the data and classify new articles accurately.
7. Deploying the Model - Once the trained model has been created, deploy it on the Google Cloud Platform to make it available to users.
8. Integrating the UI with the Model - Develop a user interface for the website where users can input keywords to search for news articles based on their interests. This interface needs to communicate with the deployed model through REST API calls and display the results to the users.
9. Monitoring the Performance - Continuously monitor the performance of the model and take necessary actions to improve its accuracy if needed.
10. Conclusion - Summarize everything you learned throughout the process and list out future improvements you could make.
This article is not meant to teach you about every aspect of creating a machine learning system nor is it intended to replace professional data science courses. It instead aims at providing insights into how companies like BBC News leveraged the power of AI to build their machine learning systems while also demonstrating technical knowledge required to understand the tools used. By the end of this article, you should have a better understanding of how to approach building machine learning systems using these technologies and be ready to implement them yourself. Let's get started! 

# 2.概述Artificial Intelligence(AI)是什么？为什么它正在改变我们的生活和行业？
The term "artificial intelligence" or AI refers to machines that mimic human cognitive abilities, enabling us to perform tasks that would normally require human intervention. These machines can think, reason, and act like humans do, which makes them interesting and useful in several areas such as robotics, image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Despite the popular hype associated with AI technology, many experts believe that it is still just a tool and does not yet possess true intelligence. However, recent advances in AI technology show that it is indeed capable of achieving impressive feats that had previously been thought impossible. For example, AlphaGo, a Go playing program developed by DeepMind and Google Brain, was able to defeat the world champion Lee Sedol in a game of Go from scratch, essentially simulating human brain activity. Similarly, Facebook's Siri and Alexa, chatbots that have already surpassed human capabilities, were developed using advanced machine learning algorithms. Thus, it is clear that AI is poised to become the dominant force in modern society and make significant changes to our daily lives.

In order to build an AI-powered solution, companies need to invest heavily in research and development. Machine learning techniques and tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras help developers create powerful AI models faster than ever before. These frameworks allow developers to train models on large datasets, making them much more efficient compared to traditional programming languages like C++. Additionally, cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud provide scalable computing resources alongside high-speed internet connectivity, allowing organizations to run complex models quickly. Companies like BBC News or CNN offer AI-powered news sites to deliver engaging, accurate, and well-researched stories to readers around the globe.
