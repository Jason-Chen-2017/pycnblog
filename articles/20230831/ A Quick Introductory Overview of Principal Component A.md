# 1.简介
  

Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as factor analysis or latent variable analysis, is a technique used to analyze and interpret high-dimensional data sets by transforming them into low-dimensional representations while minimizing the amount of information lost. PCA is commonly used in various fields including biology, finance, marketing, healthcare, and industry. In this article, we will provide an overview of PCA through mathematical concepts and algorithmic operations. We will explain how PCA can be applied for different applications like principal component regression and clustering. Finally, we will discuss some potential limitations and future directions of PCA. 

# 2.Concepts and Terminology
In order to understand the basic ideas behind PCA, let’s first go over some key concepts and terminology:

 - **Data**: The input dataset that needs to be analyzed, often represented as $X$, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature. 

 - **Covariance matrix**: A symmetric matrix that measures the interdependence between features. It is defined as $\Sigma = \frac{1}{n} X^TX$. 
 
 - **Eigenvectors**: The vectors that are associated with each eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, sorted in descending order based on their magnitude. They represent the directionality of variance along which samples cluster together.
 
 - **Eigenvalues**: The corresponding quantities describing the magnitude of the eigenvectors. If all eigenvalues have equal magnitude, then there is no need to perform any dimensionality reduction because the original data is already uncorrelated. However, if there exist large variations among the eigenvalues, they indicate that it may be beneficial to reduce the dimensionality of the data using PCA.
 
# 3.Algorithmic Operations
The main steps involved in performing PCA are as follows:

 1. Compute the mean vector, $\mu_X$ from the training set.
 2. Subtract the mean vector from every observation, so that each feature now has zero mean.
 3. Calculate the covariance matrix $\Sigma = \frac{1}{n} X^TX$, where $X$ is the centered version of the training set. This matrix measures the interdependence between features. 
 4. Obtain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Sort the eigenvectors in decreasing order of their corresponding eigenvalues and discard any vectors whose eigenvalues do not exceed a certain threshold value ($\epsilon$). This threshold determines how much information is retained after dimensionality reduction. 
 5. Project the centered training set onto the new subspace spanned by the selected eigenvectors. 

Let's apply these steps to a simple example to illustrate the process. Suppose we have the following two-dimensional dataset:

|     | Feature 1 | Feature 2 |
| --- | --------- | --------- |
|  1  |   1       |     0.7   |
|  2  |   0.9     |     0.6   |
|  3  |   0.8     |     0.5   |
|  4  |   0.6     |     0.4   |
|  5  |   0.5     |     0.3   |

First, we subtract the mean vector, obtain $X'$, and calculate its covariance matrix:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mu_X &= [(\frac{1}{5}(1+0.9+0.8+0.6+0.5)), (\frac{1}{5}(0.7+0.6+0.5+0.4+0.3))] \\[1ex]
       &= [0.3, 0.3] \\[1ex]
       
X' &= [(1-0.3),(0.7-0.3)] = [-0.2, 0.4] \\[1ex]
   &= [-0.2, 0.4], && Y = [1, 0.7, 0.9, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5]^T \\[1ex]
   
\Sigma &= \frac{1}{6}\left[-0.2 (-0.2)^T + 0.4(0.4)^T + 
                     0.7(-0.2)^T + 0.9(0.4)^T +
                     0.8(-0.2)^T + 0.6(0.4)^T +
                     0.5(-0.2)^T + 0.3(0.4)^T
                     \right]\\
     &= \frac{1}{6}[(0.04)(0.04)^T + (0.04)(0.04)^T + 
                    (0.036)(0.036)^T + (0.036)(0.036)^T +
                    (0.032)(0.032)^T + (0.032)(0.032)^T +
                    (0.028)(0.028)^T + (0.028)(0.028)^T]\\
     &= \frac{1}{6}[(0.01)(0.01) + (0.01)(0.01) + 
                    (0.0091)(0.0091) + (0.0091)(0.0091) +
                    (0.0082)(0.0082) + (0.0082)(0.0082) +
                    (0.0073)(0.0073) + (0.0073)(0.0073)\\
     &= \frac{1}{6}[(0.0046)\times 4 + (0.0046)\times 4 + 
                    (0.00421)\times 4 + (0.00421)\times 4 +
                    (0.00382)\times 4 + (0.00382)\times 4 +
                    (0.00343)\times 4 + (0.00343)\times 4]\\
      &= \frac{1}{6}[0.11\times 4]\\[1ex]
       &= \frac{0.11}{2}\\[1ex]
       
\end{align*}
$$
Next, we find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\Sigma$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\lambda_1 &= \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_{max}} \\
         &= \frac{(0.0123)}{(0.0123)}\\
         &= 1\\[1ex]
         
\lambda_2 &= \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_{max}} \\
         &= \frac{(0.0147)}{(0.0147)}\\
         &= 1\\[1ex]
         
v_1 &= [\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]\\[1ex]
    &= [-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]\\[1ex]
     
v_2 &= [\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]\\[1ex]
    &= [-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]\\[1ex]
\end{align*}
$$
Finally, we project the centered data onto the new subspace spanned by the selected eigenvectors:

$$
Z = V_k S U^\top X'\\
= [v_1\lambda_1, v_2\lambda_2]\cdot[\frac{0.11}{2},0]\\
=[-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\times 0.11,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\times 0.11]\\
=[-\frac{0.11}{2\sqrt{2}},\frac{0.11}{2\sqrt{2}}]\\
$$
This means that our transformed dataset has been reduced to one dimension and lies in a line passing through the origin, perpendicular to both the old axes. In other words, the same variation pattern still exists but it has been compressed to only one dimension. Note that since all the remaining variance is concentrated around the origin, we cannot recover the original data without additional context or information about the specific patterns present in the dataset. Nonetheless, PCA provides a powerful way to summarize and visualize complex multidimensional datasets in fewer dimensions, making it useful for exploratory data analysis and visualization tasks.
