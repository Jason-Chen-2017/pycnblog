# 1.简介
  

Differential evolution (DE) is a population based optimization technique that belongs to the class of stochastic algorithms. It has been shown to perform particularly well for global optimization problems where it can find solutions much faster than other population based techniques such as genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization. The basic idea behind DE is to randomly vary some of the parameters of the solution and then accept or reject this variation according to its fitness. The acceptance probability depends on the difference between the new fitness value and the current fitness value, which encourages exploration of better areas of the search space while discouraging local minima. Differential evolution works efficiently because it does not require recomputing the entire objective function at each iteration, but only evaluates a small number of candidate solutions and updates them using simple mathematical operations. Additionally, differential evolution can be parallelized easily since it involves updating only one individual at a time. 

In this article, we will implement Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm from scratch in Python programming language using NumPy and SciPy libraries. We will also explain how to apply DE to solve various optimization problems by demonstrating step-by-step examples. Finally, we will compare our implementation results with those obtained from the popular scipy library and discuss possible improvements. This article assumes intermediate knowledge of Python programming, linear algebra, optimization techniques, and scientific computing libraries like NumPy and SciPy. 

# 2.背景介绍
As mentioned earlier, differential evolution (DE) is a population based optimization technique that belongs to the class of stochastic algorithms. Population based optimization methods are used to optimize functions that depend on multiple variables or inputs. These types of problems arise in many applications such as image processing, computer graphics, pattern recognition, and finance. In general, these optimization problems have a complex non-linear structure and may have several local optima or even saddle points. Therefore, population based methods are highly effective in solving these problems. However, populations based methods often have high computational complexity compared to traditional gradient descent methods due to their requirement for evaluating large numbers of candidate solutions. In addition, they may take a long time to converge to the optimal solution especially when the dimensionality of the problem increases.

Differential evolution (DE) was introduced by Storn and Price (1997) in their paper “Differential Evolution -A Simple and Efficient Heuristic for Global Optimization over Continuous Spaces” [1]. At first glance, DE appears very similar to genetic algorithms such as mutation operators and crossover operators. Both DE and genetic algorithms use random mutations and reproductions to explore different regions of the search space and improve the overall performance. However, there are some key differences between both approaches:

1. Genetic algorithms are directed towards finding global minimums, whereas DE focuses on exploring the parameter space and finding local optima.
2. Genetic algorithms are characterized by having a larger memory footprint and requiring more complex selection mechanisms, whereas DE requires relatively less computational resources.
3. Genetic algorithms are mostly applied to problems with continuous spaces and real-valued decision variables, whereas DE can handle mixed integer and continuous design spaces.
4. Genetic algorithms suffer from being sensitive to initialization, whereas DE is completely unbiased.
5. Genetic algorithms do not guarantee convergence to the optimal point, whereas DE always finds a good approximation within a given tolerance level.
6. Genetic algorithms are often computationally expensive, taking upwards of hours for complicated problems, whereas DE typically runs in minutes for moderately sized problems.

Despite all these advantages, DE remains an active research area and continues to gain attention recently. Its widespread use is closely associated with the development of parallel computing technologies, specifically through the use of multicore processors. Furthermore, DE has become increasingly popular in the field of artificial intelligence because it offers significant advantages in terms of speed and robustness compared to conventional metaheuristics. Indeed, DE is commonly regarded as among the most powerful heuristics currently available for solving complex optimization problems.

In this article, we will present a step-by-step approach for implementing DE in Python programming language along with relevant concepts and math formulas. We will demonstrate how to apply DE to solve various optimization problems such as minimizing a scalar function, maximizing a vector function, and constrained optimization problems by explaining the core algorithm steps and code implementation details. Moreover, we will evaluate our implementation against those obtained from the popular scipy library and discuss possible improvements for further improvement.
