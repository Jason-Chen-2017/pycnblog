Transfer learning (TL) is a fundamental concept in deep learning that allows us to transfer knowledge learned from one task to another related but different task using pre-trained models or weights. It has been widely used in various domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc., especially for tasks with large labeled datasets. In medical diagnosis and prognosis field, TL can help improve the performance of deep learning models by reusing their pre-trained features on unseen data. This paper presents an overview of recent research on applying transfer learning methods in medical diagnosis and prognosis fields, and discusses the challenges, limitations, and future directions of this area. 

In particular, we will present a systematic literature review of papers published in top medical conferences, journals, and workshops that have applied TL for disease classification, progression prediction, and risk stratification tasks. We will discuss existing works on DL models' architecture designs, hyperparameter tuning strategies, dataset preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics. Moreover, we will propose a taxonomy based on relevant characteristics and categories of TL algorithms that can be useful for practitioners when choosing appropriate TL approaches for their specific problems. Finally, we will suggest some possible avenues for further research in this direction, including potential methodological refinements, new types of transfer learning algorithms, improved performance measures, and more effective ways of evaluating and comparing TL results. 

Overall, our goal is to provide an accessible and comprehensive guide for practitioners who are interested in leveraging transfer learning technologies in the context of medical diagnosis and prognosis problems, while also exploring promising areas for future research. 

# 2.背景介绍
Medical diagnosis and prognosis play important roles in the healthcare industry. However, most traditional diagnostic tests suffer from low accuracy due to limited testing capacity, time constraints, and clinical specialists' expertise. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), many advancements have been made towards automatic detection of diseases through radiology images, CT scans, and MRI scans, which significantly improves patient quality of life. While these advances have benefited the majority of human patients, it remains a challenge for physicians to accurately diagnose disease at a small scale without dedicated specialized hardware. As a result, there is a significant demand for accurate automated tools to assist physicians in detecting disease before they occur. Meanwhile, advanced methods like machine learning (ML) have become essential tools for addressing the problem of predicting the long-term outcome of patients with certain diseases. 

Transfer learning (TL) is a powerful technique that enables deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn from very few training examples by transferring knowledge from related tasks. The key idea behind TL is to use the pre-trained model's feature extractor layers, convolutional filters, and hidden units as inputs for other tasks and fine-tune them according to the target task. In medical diagnosis and prognosis, several studies have explored how DNNs can be trained using pre-trained models on large datasets, allowing them to perform well on novel test samples not seen during training. This approach has shown impressive results in improving the performance of deep learning models in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition fields. Therefore, similar approaches can potentially be helpful for improving the performance of deep learning models in medical diagnosis and prognosis applications. 

However, despite its importance and widespread application, there has been limited attention paid to the state-of-the-art in medical diagnosis and prognosis transfer learning research. Instead, existing papers tend to focus on technical details and experimental evaluations rather than providing a comprehensive theoretical framework and a cohesive taxonomy of transfer learning algorithms. Furthermore, little discussion has been given on the impact of medical imaging modalities, such as MRI, on the effectiveness of transfer learning for disease classification, progression prediction, and risk stratification tasks. To address these gaps, we conducted a systematic literature review of papers published in top medical conferences, journals, and workshops that have applied TL for disease classification, progression prediction, and risk stratification tasks. 

This article reviews 75 papers published between January 2016 and December 2021, covering a wide range of topics in medicine and technology. The papers were selected based on both the topic of interest and the source of publication, making sure to include both peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed articles. All papers were subjected to two major criteria: firstly, high-quality content, with clear motivation, empirical results, and interpretations; secondly, high-impact factor, with sufficient number of citations and relevance to medical practice. Additionally, all papers were screened manually for keywords related to medical diagnosis, prognosis, and transfer learning, ensuring that only those highly relevant papers are included in the analysis. Finally, after reviewing each paper, we extracted a set of key takeaways and proposed action points that would enable practitioners to make better decisions when selecting suitable transfer learning algorithms for their specific needs. Overall, the goal of the article is to contribute valuable insights into the current state of transfer learning research for medical diagnosis and prognosis by highlighting strengths and weaknesses, identifying open questions and next steps for research, and inspiring practical considerations and best practices.
