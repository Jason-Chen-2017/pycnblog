Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a class of deep learning models that were introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014.[1] The term GAN stands for Generative adversarial networks and was originally created with the goal of generating realistic images from randomly sampled input data. They achieve this through two neural networks working against each other: a generator network which learns to create new samples similar to the original dataset while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between the fake generated sample and the actual training examples. During training, both networks improve their ability to fool one another. 

In recent years, GANs have emerged as a powerful tool for image synthesis and manipulation tasks such as super resolution, colorization, photo-realistic rendering, and video stylization. These applications enable computers to produce high-resolution or completely synthetic media that can be used for various purposes such as self-driving cars, virtual reality headsets, and augmented reality applications on mobile devices.

The objective behind these generative approaches is to learn the underlying patterns and distributions of natural data and generate new, highly varied samples using them. GANs are particularly useful for computer vision tasks where raw pixel values may not be enough to capture complex relationships between different features present in an image. For example, if we want to classify a face image into different categories, traditional methods often rely on handcrafted feature extraction techniques based on object recognition algorithms, which may not provide sufficient detail and generalization to handle all possible variations in faces. However, GANs offer a more flexible approach to solving this problem since they can model the distribution of human facial appearance accurately without relying on specific features like eyes or nose. 

 In this article, we will discuss some fundamental concepts related to GANs and also look at how they can be applied to computer vision problems. We will cover the basic terminology, the key ideas behind GANs, and also see the differences and limitations between traditional machine learning and GANs in terms of bias and representation power. Finally, we will study some popular computer vision GAN architectures including CycleGAN, Pix2Pix, and StyleGAN. By the end of our discussion, we hope that readers will gain a deeper understanding about GANs, get inspired to experiment with them for various computer vision tasks, and ultimately build upon them to develop novel solutions that enhance quality and efficiency in various domains.
 
Let’s dive in!

# 2.Key concepts and terminology 

Before delving into the details of GANs, it is important to understand some of the core concepts and terminology associated with them.

1. Adversarial game - The main idea behind GANs is that there exists a competition between the generator network and the discriminator network over the generation of the desired output. This competition is called the "adversarial" game because the aim of the generator network is to fool the discriminator and trick it into believing its samples are genuine rather than being produced by the generator itself. To make things even more challenging, the generator must learn to come up with outputs that are diverse but still meaningful compared to those in the dataset. The discriminator network plays the opposite role and needs to identify the generator's fakes so that it can properly train the generator to become better at creating realistic outputs. Both the generators and discriminators are typically trained simultaneously during the process.

2. Latent space - GANs use a latent space to represent the input data. Instead of directly feeding in raw pixels as input, GANs map the inputs into a lower dimensional latent space where the complexity of the relationships between different features is reduced. This leads to more efficient training as well as better performance on downstream tasks. After training, the learned representations can then be projected back into the original input space and converted into images.

3. Mode collapse - One limitation of GANs is known as mode collapse. This occurs when the generator starts to produce mostly copies of the same set of samples instead of producing something new. This happens due to the conflict between the generator and discriminator during training, especially early in the training process. There are several ways to address this issue, such as introducing regularization techniques like dropout or adding noise to the input, increasing the size of the dataset, or using multiple generator and discriminator pairs.

4. Two networks - GANs consists of two parts: a generator and a discriminator network. The generator takes in random noise as input and generates an output that looks similar to the training examples. On the other hand, the discriminator receives either the training examples or the generated sample and tries to tell them apart. The discriminator works to minimize the loss function between the true labels and predicted labels obtained by the generator. The generator attempts to maximize this loss by minimizing the error made by the discriminator in predicting the fake samples as real. As mentioned earlier, the two networks compete with each other in the form of the adversarial game, and they eventually converge towards equilibrium after many iterations of training. The final result is the generator produces samples that resemble the training examples closely.

Now let’s move onto discussing the specific architecture of GANs and some popular ones used for computer vision tasks. 

# 3.Computer Vision GAN Architectures

There are three commonly used GAN architectures for computer vision tasks. Let us first focus on a simple version of the standard GAN architecture, known as the DCGAN[2]. Here is a schematic illustrating the structure of the DCGAN:
