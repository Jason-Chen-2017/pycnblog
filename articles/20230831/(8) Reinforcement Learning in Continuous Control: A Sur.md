Reinforcement learning (RL), also known as reward-based learning, is a type of machine learning technique used to design agents that learn by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for their actions based on the feedback received from this interaction. In continuous control applications, RL algorithms are typically designed to solve problems related to controlling robotic or mechanical systems that have both continuous and discrete variables. However, there exist several different categories within the RL literature that reflect the nature of these two types of variables, including Model-Based RL, Model-Free RL, Hybrid RL, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The objective of this survey article is to provide an overview of existing research efforts relating to RL techniques applied in continuous control applications, highlighting recent advances and outlining future directions for further development. 

Continuous control refers to tasks where an agent needs to interact with its environment over time while taking into account uncertainties such as stochasticity, delay, noise, and nondeterminism. These challenges require continual adaptation of the agent’s behavior towards new information and ensure optimal performance under varying conditions. As a result, continuous control has emerged as a central challenge for artificial intelligence (AI) researchers since it requires sophisticated decision making skills and effective real-time system control. Over the years, various methods have been developed to address this problem using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing research efforts in the field of continuous control using RL algorithms, specifically focusing on the intersection between model-free and model-based approaches and deep reinforcement learning. It starts with an introduction to RL terminology, followed by a detailed description of each method category and its respective subcategories, highlighting recent trends in the area. Next, we present an analysis of benchmarking experiments conducted to compare the effectiveness of various methods across various environments, tasks, and constraints. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open issues and future directions for research in this area.
# 2.基本术语及定义
This section briefly introduces some key terms and definitions related to the study of reinforcement learning in continuous control. We define relevant terms and concepts that may be unfamiliar to readers, including state space, action space, policy function, Q-function, value function, exploration/exploitation tradeoff, return, episode, and transition.

State space: The set of all possible states that the agent can occupy during an episode. In continuous control, the state space usually consists of multiple dimensions corresponding to different physical quantities, such as joint angles, cartesian coordinates, velocity, acceleration, force sensors readings, etc. State spaces can often be high dimensional, spanning tens to hundreds of dimensions depending on the complexity of the underlying system.

Action space: The set of possible actions that the agent can take at any given point in time. Actions typically include moving the robot arm forward, backward, left, right, rotating clockwise, counterclockwise, opening gripper, closing gripper, etc., but can vary significantly depending on the task being performed. Action spaces can either be discrete or continuous, with most controllable tasks using only continuous actions.

Policy function: The mapping between state space and action space that defines what action should be taken at any given state according to the agent's preferences. Policy functions specify how the agent should explore the state space to find suitable policies, which will eventually lead to better solutions for the given problem. In continuous control, policy functions are commonly neural networks implemented as function approximators, which predict the next action to take based on the current state.

Q-function: The expected total discounted reward obtained after taking a specific action from a particular state, assuming that subsequent actions are chosen optimally. The Q-function specifies the utility of taking a certain action in a certain state, and allows us to estimate the long-term reward for each action. In continuous control, Q-functions are computed using deep neural networks that map states and actions to scalar values representing the estimated return.

Value function: The predicted discounted future return obtained starting from a particular state without considering the effects of any other action. Value functions characterize the potential outcomes of an episodic task, providing a useful measure of uncertainty and help to determine when to terminate an episode early. In continuous control, value functions are often represented using function approximation techniques similar to those used for policy functions, although they do not necessarily represent probabilistic distributions.

Exploration/Exploitation tradeoff: The balance between exploring new states to expand the search space and exploiting knowledge gained from previous experience to guide decisions towards promising areas. Exploration helps to avoid getting trapped in local minima, whereas exploitation encourages the agent to rely on the best available options rather than searching blindly. Deciding how much to explore versus exploit is a crucial part of determining whether the agent is learning efficiently and meeting the desired level of performance.

Return: The sum of rewards obtained through successive steps of an episode. Return is commonly defined as the discounted sum of future returns, with higher discount factors indicating greater importance placed on earlier rewards relative to later ones. Returns are used as targets for training the policy function, guiding the agent towards achieving high returns during rollouts.

Episode: An individual run of the agent through an environment, consisting of a sequence of states, actions, and rewards. Episode lengths depend on the maximum number of steps allowed before termination due to a constraint such as collision or reaching a terminal state.

Transition: The occurrence of a change from one state to another, resulting in the generation of a new observation. Transitions describe how the agent arrives at a new state and may influence the agent's choices of actions and observations accordingly.

Model-Free RL and Model-Based RL are two main categories of RL algorithms, each with distinct strengths and weaknesses. In this section, we first discuss the history of model-free RL, then go on to introduce the fundamental ideas behind model-based RL, explaining how models aid in efficient decision making, provide a foundation for planning, and enable more generalization beyond the observed data.

## 模型-无模型方法历史回顾
Modern AI is heavily dependent on reinforcement learning (RL), which combines tools from statistics, computer science, and optimization to develop autonomous agents capable of adapting to changing environments and completing complex tasks. Despite extensive research, few attempts have been made to combine RL with domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities to make use of the rich structure of the world. Research in this direction started in the late nineteenth century, when work was initiated in earnest to build psychological theories of human cognition and computation, leading to the birth of theoretical foundations such as Bayesian inference and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). 

In the mid-twentieth century, a significant effort devoted to developing statistical models of the world were launched by researchers like Elizabeth Blackwell and his collaborators. Using mathematical formalisms and probability theory, they proposed mathematical models of perception, reasoning, movement, and behavior. Inspired by economists' viewpoint on behavioral finance, they argued that investors could understand financial markets by analyzing the market dynamics implied by the model rather than relying on heuristics or expertise. By combining insights from psychology, statistics, and economics, this approach led to the Model-Based Financial Analysis (MBFA) project, which focused on building computational models of markets and portfolios, allowing investment banks to adjust positions automatically based on market data.

However, the MBFA project did not focus solely on continuous control applications, instead opting to focus exclusively on managing fixed-income securities, a relatively simple class of financial instruments that exhibit clear patterns of interest rates, volatility, correlation, and covariation. While successful in producing robust results, this project limited the scope of modern RL research. Moreover, Blackwell's models required a highly specialized skillset, and the cost of developing them prohibits their widespread adoption.

In the following decades, research in model-based RL took off, with significant advancements in the field of imitation learning, decision trees, and probabilistic graphical models, particularly amongst social scientists who had a keen interest in applying AI to complex systems. Building upon the work of Blackwell and colleagues, researchers began to propose ways to incorporate prior domain knowledge into the decision-making process, enabling agents to act more autonomously and effectively navigate unknown environments.

The rise of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the last decade marked a shift in the paradigm of RL research, adopting a new perspective that emphasizes automatic training of complex neural networks to learn the optimal strategy in challenging environments. DRL offers several benefits compared to traditional model-based methods: 

1. End-to-end learning: Training DRL agents directly in a simulator or hardware platform allows for endless possibilities in the combination of algorithmic decision making with simulation environments.

2. Data efficiency: With access to vast amounts of simulated data, RL algorithms can train faster and more accurately, reducing sample complexity.

3. Flexibility: Since DRL algorithms are trained using gradient descent, they can optimize policies directly against complex objectives, including control, navigation, and planning.

Overall, the historical development of model-based RL is now considered to be mature and reliable enough to serve as a foundation for further advancement in the area of reinforcement learning in continuous control. Complementary approaches such as hybrid RL and IRL (inverse reinforcement learning) have also been introduced as alternatives to the standard model-based framework.

## 模型-无模型方法基本理论
In model-based RL, the agent interacts with the environment by updating its internal model of the system based on past experiences, which are stored in a memory buffer. Models capture important features of the environment, such as state transitions, interactions between objects, and natural laws, and allow the agent to plan ahead and improve its performance. To update the model, the agent samples from its experience and uses supervised learning to learn a representation of the environment that captures its essence. Once the model is updated, the agent can use it to generate predictions about the environment and take appropriate actions.

To handle continuous control tasks, models need to be extended beyond static state representations and action outputs. They must include additional components such as dynamic state variables and disturbances, and they should be able to handle uncertainty caused by stochastic dynamics and changes in dynamics properties. 

One way to extend a model is to consider hierarchical structures, where lower-level models feed their output back into the input of higher-level models until the final decision is made. Another option is to use deep neural networks to represent the model itself, similar to DRL algorithms. Both of these approaches can increase the accuracy of the model by abstracting away unnecessary details and capturing important features of the environment. However, deeper models can also become increasingly difficult to train and suffer from overfitting if overparameterized or too large. Additionally, careful regularization and hyperparameter tuning are essential to prevent the agent from falling into local minima and converging to erroneous policies.

Another important aspect of model-based RL is planning. Planning involves constructing a timeline of actions that optimize future returns, based on the model learned so far. There are several planning strategies that aim to achieve this goal, ranging from global optimization to local search approaches that incrementally refine plans during runtime. Traditionally, planning has been aided by techniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and POMDP solvers. However, MCTS has limitations in handling continuous control tasks, especially in situations where the number of possible actions is very large, requiring a fine-grained discretization scheme and specialized tree traversal algorithms. Nonetouchy tree traversals require approximate evaluation, which makes the algorithm impractical in practice. Nevertheless, the trajectory planning component of many model-based RL frameworks remains a major challenge.

Beyond model updates, model-based RL algorithms also require the ability to simulate the environment and interact with it in real-time. For example, they may use simulations to collect data for offline training or to perform model-based testing in real-time. Simulations may also offer additional benefits, such as the ability to evaluate the impact of different controller parameters and configurations on the agent's performance and stability.

## 深度强化学习综述
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a subset of model-based RL that applies deep neural networks to the entire model update step. Rather than simply learning a low-dimensional state representation or a table of probabilities associated with each action, DRL architectures contain one or more hidden layers that transform raw inputs into complex feature vectors. This approach enables the agent to capture non-linear dependencies in the environment and leverage complex decision-making strategies. 

Although deep neural networks can be powerful tools in RL, they come with several drawbacks. First, they require massive amounts of labeled data to train well, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Second, the convergence properties of vanilla gradient descent can be slow and prone to divergence, requiring careful initialization and regularization schemes to ensure stable training. Third, network weights tend to explode and vanish easily, causing instability or numerical overflow, and therefore are susceptible to adverse side effects.

Recent advances in DRL have focused on designing more complex architectures that can scale up to larger and more complex environments. One popular architecture is the actor-critic architecture, which contains separate networks for generating actions and evaluating state-action values. These networks can be trained independently and combined together to produce more accurate predictions. Other approaches include Q-learning variants that employ replay buffers to store and reuse previous experiences, and attention mechanisms that give greater weight to critical aspects of the environment for improved exploration.

Overall, the rapid progression of DRL research has led to a renewed interest in this topic, and several new methods have been proposed to tackle the ever-growing variety of continuous control tasks. This survey article gives a broad overview of existing research efforts in the field of RL in continuous control, highlighting recent advances and identifying future directions for further development.
