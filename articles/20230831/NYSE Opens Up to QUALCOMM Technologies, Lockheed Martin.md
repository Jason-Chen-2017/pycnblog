For now, let's move on to discuss the details of this transaction.

# 3.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the details of the acquisition plan, let's first understand some basic concepts related to finance, economics, and technology:

1. Finance - Financial accounting refers to recording financial transactions to produce financial statements and provide information about financial position of an enterprise. Here are some important terminologies used in finance:

    * Balance sheet - A summary of assets, liabilities, equity and owners’ equity of an organization based on its financial position at a particular point of time.
    * Cash flow statement - A summary of cash flows during a given period, typically covering net income, interest expenses, depreciation expenses, and change in working capital. 
    * Common stock - Securities issued to shareholders who own units of the corporation, weighted according to their ownership percentage.
    * Dividend payment - Proceeds paid to shareholders when a company pays dividends to common stock holders. 

2. Economics - Economic theory explains various phenomena involved in production, distribution, consumption, and exchange of goods and services between different individuals, institutions, nations, regions, and cultures. One important concept is utilitarianism, which stresses the importance of individual autonomy and preferences to maximize personal utility or minimize the harm caused to others. Another concept is efficiency, which means minimizing waste and maximizing profitability. Utility is a function of price and quantity. 

3. Technology - Technology is any natural or engineered object or system that enables us to perform certain tasks more efficiently, effectively, cost-effectively, or cheaply than before. Here are some important characteristics of technology:
    
    * Advances - Technological advances transform lives by enabling people to work smarter, faster, and more effectively. 
    * Abundance - The abundance of new technologies, businesses, and applications creates opportunities for entrepreneurs and professionals to grow and thrive.
    * Heterogeneity - Products and services produced using different types of technology often address different needs and requirements.
    * Complexity - New technology is never fully understood but requires careful consideration of multiple factors to optimize performance.
    
Now, let's talk about the acquisition plan itself.

# 4.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
The core algorithm behind the planned acquisition includes six steps:

1. Negotiations - Qualcomm and the three companies listed above negotiate their respective acquisition terms. 
2. Business alignment - Once the deal is finalized, Qualcomm and the partners jointly align their strategic goals, corporate objectives, and shared responsibilities towards achieving mutual success.
3. Technical feasibility assessment - Based on technical expertise, Qualcomm analyzes the viability and suitability of the proposed technology stack for integration into their existing architecture. 
4. Integration planning - Qualcomm prepares detailed documentation and proposals detailing the integration approach. They consider various metrics such as pricing and delivery dates, revenue streams, market share, and competition.
5. Consent and approval - After the technical feasibility analysis stage, Qualcomm presents the proposal to the stakeholders, including LMT, Valspar, and Comcast. If approved, then the merger happens and there is no dispute regarding the transfer of technology stacks and IP rights. Otherwise, the parties go back to their respective roles.
6. Go-live and post-launch activities - Once the deal is complete, Qualcomm begins implementing the required changes to integrate the partner technologies into its platform. It tests and validates the integration and launches the combined solution to the relevant markets. At the same time, LMT and Valspar begin adding their respective pieces of technology to Qualcomm’s platforms.

All these steps are essential to ensure smooth execution of the acquisition and improve Qualcomm’s overall position in the IT services industry.

# 5.代码实例和解释说明

Here's an example code snippet demonstrating Qualcomm's acquisition plan in Python programming language:


```python
def calculate_net_income(sales, costs):
    """Calculates Net Income"""
    return sales - costs
    
def calculate_operating_profit(revenue, operating_expenses):
    """Calculates Operating Profit"""
    return revenue - operating_expenses
    
def calculate_ebitda(income_before_tax, taxes):
    """Calculates EBITDA"""
    return income_before_tax - taxes
    

# Assuming data below

sales = 1000 # Sales revenue
costs = 500   # Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
cogs = 600    # COGS + Marketing Expenses + Administrative Expenses
total_expenses = cogs + overhead_expenses

# Calculate Net Profit after Tax (NPAT)
npat = calculate_net_income(sales, total_expenses)

# Calculate Revenue after Tax (RAS)
ras = npat / (1 - tax_rate)

# Calculate Operating Profit 
operating_expenses = fixed_opex + variable_opex  
operating_profit = calculate_operating_profit(ras, operating_expenses)

# Calculate EBITDA
ebitda = calculate_ebitda(npat - operating_profit, taxes)

# Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation
discount_rate =.10      # Annual discount rate
cashflows = [npat]       # List of future cashflows
npv = sum([cf/((1+discount_rate)**i) for i, cf in enumerate(cashflows)])

print("Net Profit after Tax (NPAT):", round(npat))
print("Revenue after Tax (RAS):", round(ras))
print("Operating Profit:", round(operating_profit))
print("EBITDA:", round(ebitda))
print("Net Present Value (NPV):", round(npv))
```

Explanation:

We start by defining a few functions to calculate key ratios such as Net Income, Operating Profit, and EBITDA. Then we define variables for necessary inputs such as sales, costs, and expenses. Next, we calculate Net Profit after Tax (NPAT) as follows: NPAT = Sales - Total Expenses.

Next, we convert NPAT to Revenue after Tax (RAS) assuming a tax rate of 10%. Since we assume zero depreciation expense, we simplify calculation by subtracting depreciation expenses from COGS and adjusting the RAS accordingly. Thus, RAS = (Sales - Depr. Exp.) / (1 - Tax Rate).

Similarly, we calculate Operating Profit by subtracting Fixed Operating Expenditure (Fixed OPEX) and Variable Operating Expenditure (Variable OPEX) and pass it to another function called "calculate_operating_profit". This gives us the actual Operating Profit.

Finally, we compute EBITDA as follows: EBITDA = NPAT - Operating Profit. Note that EBITDA does not take account of Taxes since it is included as a separate component in the Operating Profit. Also, we compute Net Present Value (NPV) by calculating present values of each cashflow at a specific discount rate and summing up the results. 

Using this methodology, we can easily assess the financial viability of the acquired technology stack and compare it with our current position in the IT services industry. We don't need to worry about complex calculations or dozens of formulas; instead, we just plug in our input data and get meaningful output. This saves valuable time and effort while still giving precise insights into the possible outcomes of the merger.
