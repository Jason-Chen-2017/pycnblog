 # 2.基本概念
## 概念定义
Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are both types of neural networks that are widely used for processing sequential data, especially time series data. RNNs consist of a chain of repeating modules where each module takes input from previous outputs and passes its output forward to next module. The output of one module becomes the input to another module until the final output is generated. On the other hand, LSTM networks were developed specifically to handle the vanishing gradient problem encountered by traditional recurrent neural networks. 

The key feature of an LSTM network is its ability to maintain information in long-term memory even when large changes occur within short time intervals. This property makes LSTM networks ideal for tasks that require making predictions about sequences or texts with long dependencies. LSTM networks use memory cells called "cells" that are capable of storing multiple pieces of information at once. Each cell has three inputs: the current input, the previous output, and a “forget” gate which controls what information to throw away or remember based on the current input and previous output. The output of each cell is determined by combining the cell’s internal state and the hidden states of all previous time steps through the use of gating mechanisms. 

Therefore, LSTM networks combine two important features of traditional RNNs – efficient processing of long-term dependencies and improved accuracy due to their use of memory cells. However, there are still many challenges associated with developing effective and scalable neural networks for NLP tasks. These include poor performance when dealing with variable length input sequences, difficulty training and fine-tuning models to different datasets, and limited support for parallel computation. 

To address these issues, modern researchers have been focusing on transforming RNN architectures into more effective and scalable models, such as Attention Mechanisms, Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Within the scope of this article, we will focus solely on explaining the fundamentals of traditional RNNs and LSTM networks, since they are commonly used in NLP tasks.<|im_sep|>

 ## Traditional Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN)<|im_sep|> 

 A vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) consists of a chain of repeating modules where each module takes input from previous outputs and passes its output forward to next module. At each step, the input vector contains both the current token embedding and the hidden state from previous time step. 

 

 Vanilla RNN architecture diagram: 


Here, $x_{t}$ denotes the input word vector at timestep t, $\hat{y}_{t}$ represents the predicted target output at timestep t, and h_{t} represents the hidden state of the RNN at timestep t. The weights are represented by θ while bias vectors are represented by b. The activation function here is usually hyperbolic tangent or sigmoid function depending upon the application requirement. 

 Traditional RNNs suffer from several drawbacks including long-term dependency problem, vanishing gradients, and sensitivity to initialization. To mitigate these issues, various extensions of RNNs have been proposed, among which are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Bidirectional RNNs. 

## Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)<|im_sep|> 

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was introduced in 1997 by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber et al., and is designed to solve the vanishing gradient problem that plagues traditional RNNs. It works by replacing the simple update rule of traditional RNNs with four separate gates - input, forget, output, and update. 

Input Gate: Controls how much of the input vector gets added to the hidden state. If the input gate is close to 1, most of the input vector will be added to the hidden state. 

Forget Gate: Controls how much of the previously stored information in the hidden state needs to be forgotten. When the forget gate is close to 1, most of the old information will not be retained. 

Output Gate: Determines how much of the newly updated information in the hidden state needs to be passed on to the next layer in the network. If the output gate is close to 1, most of the updated information will be passed on. 

Update Cell State: Decides how much new information is going to be added to the hidden state. Here, the candidate value is calculated as follows: 

$C^{'}_{t} = \tanh{(W_{f}[a_{t}, x_{t}] + W_{i}[a_{t}, h_{t-1}] + W_{c}[a_{t}, C_{t-1}] + b)}$

where $[a_{t}, x_{t}], [a_{t}, h_{t-1}], [a_{t}, C_{t-1}]$ represent concatenation operations between input vector, hidden state of the previous time step, and cell state of the previous time step respectively, and $W_{f}$, $W_{i}$, $W_{c}$, $b$ are weight matrices and biases. 

Finally, the cell state is updated according to the update equation:

$C_{t} = f_{t}\odot C_{t-1} + i_{t}\odot C^{'_{t}}$

where $f_{t}$ and $i_{t}$ are values obtained after passing the cell state through the forget and input gate respectively. The symbol $\odot$ indicates elementwise multiplication operation. And finally, the hidden state is computed using the output gate:

$h_{t} = o_{t}\odot\tanh{(C_{t})}$.
