Natural language processing is an important part of artificial intelligence and natural language technologies. It allows machines to understand human language, particularly in a way that humans can. In this article, we will learn how to process textual data with Python by building various applications such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition. We will use the popular Natural Language Toolkit library for Python to implement these tasks. 

In Part 1, we will cover basic concepts, terminologies, and algorithms used for text processing. This includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, word embedding, vector space model, bag-of-words model, and document classification. In addition, we will demonstrate how to preprocess textual data using regular expressions and NLTK libraries. Finally, we will look into advanced topics like part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing. 


To get started, you need some knowledge about Python programming language and familiarity with machine learning techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines. If you are already familiar with these concepts, you should be able to follow along easily. Otherwise, you may want to read up on these before starting the tutorial. 

By the end of the first part, you will have learned the basics of text preprocessing using Python and its related libraries such as NLTK and spaCy. You should also have a good understanding of how to perform various text mining tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition.











# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminologies
## Tokenization
Tokenization refers to the process of breaking down a piece of text into smaller parts called tokens. Tokens can be individual words or phrases or even sub-words depending on the level of granularity required. Common ways of performing tokenization include splitting the text into sentences, paragraphs, or documents based on specific delimiters such as periods (.), commas (,), semicolons (;), etc., while ignoring punctuation marks and whitespace characters. However, if your dataset contains long strings without spaces, you might want to consider applying additional heuristics such as counting vowels or consonants to determine when two words should be separated. Here's an example of tokenizing a string using regex:

```python
import re

text = 'Hello, world!'
tokens = re.findall(r'\w+', text) # find all alphanumeric sequences of characters (\w+) and return them as a list
print(tokens) #[‘hello’, ‘world’]
```

Here, `\w+` matches one or more alphanumeric characters. 

Another common technique for tokenization is to split the text into n-grams, where n is the length of each gram. These grams represent combinations of adjacent tokens within the same sequence of text, often useful for modeling patterns within natural language. Examples of bigrams (pairs of consecutive tokens), trigrams (triples of consecutive tokens), and four-grams (quadruples of consecutive tokens) can be formed from the following text:

```python
text = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
bigrams = ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'lazy', 'dog']
trigrams = ['the quick', 'quick brown', 'brown fox', 'fox jumps', 'jumps over', 'over the', 'the lazy', 'lazy dog']
fourgrams = ['the quick brown', 'quick brown fox', 'brown fox jumps', 'fox jumps over', 'jumps over the', 'over the lazy', 'the lazy dog']
```

You can tokenize longer texts by iterating through their lines or paragraphs and then running the tokenization algorithm on each line separately. Alternatively, you can use batch processing methods such as MapReduce to parallelize the tokenization process across multiple nodes.


## Stemming vs Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization are both processes used to reduce words to their base form. They differ in how they handle words that have different meanings but share the same root or stem. For instance, consider the word "running". Its stem is "run", whereas its lemma is "run". Both stemmers and lemmas aim to achieve similar goals of reducing words to their base forms. While stemmers operate at the word level, lemmas operate at the morphological level and are often more accurate than stemmers. Popular stemmers include Porter stemmer, Snowball stemmer, and Lancaster stemmer. 

While stemming removes some information while keeping other aspects of words unchanged, lemmatization ensures that all occurrences of a given word have the same meaning. In practice, lemmatizers are applied after stemmers to ensure maximum accuracy. Here's an example of stemming and lemmatizing a word using NLTK:

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

word = 'running'
stemmed_word = 'run'
lemma_word = 'run'

if '_' in word:
    stemmed_word = ''.join([lemmatizer.lemmatize(_) for _ in word.split('_')])
    
else:
    stemmed_word = lemmatizer.lemmatize(word)
    
    try:
        lemma_word = lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos='v')
    except:
        pass
        
print('Stemmed word:', stemmed_word) # output: run
print('Lemmatized word:', lemma_word) # output: run
```

In the above code, `_` represents any non-alphanumeric character. Since "running" has underscores in it, we apply the WordNet lemmatizer to each substring separately and concatenate the resulting lemmas together. By default, `WordNetLemmatizer()` uses the default POS tagger, so we don't need to specify a pos tag explicitly here. However, if we wanted to extract only verbs instead of nouns, we could add a check to see if the original word ends in a vowel.
