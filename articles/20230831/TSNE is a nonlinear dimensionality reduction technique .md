T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE) is a popular and widely used visualization algorithm for exploring multi-dimensional data sets. It is particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional datasets where it becomes difficult to visualize all the points in higher dimensions due to their complexity. T-SNE can also be used as an alternative to principal component analysis (PCA). However, unlike PCA which computes the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data set, T-SNE minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probability distribution of the input space and its t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE embedding). This produces embeddings with more structure than those obtained by PCA. Additionally, T-SNE offers several advantages over other methods such as Isomap, LLE, MDS, etc., such as preserving local neighborhood structures and being computationally efficient. In this article, I will introduce you to T-SNE, explain its key concepts, formulas, and how to apply it in practice using Python and Scikit-learn library.

## 2.1.什么是无监督学习
Unsupervised learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms where no prior knowledge or labeled training data are provided to the model, leaving it on its own to find interesting patterns and relationships within the data. The goal of these algorithms is to learn structure and relationships within the data without any external guidance. 

In contrast, supervised learning requires labelled training data that provides both features and corresponding targets. These algorithms learn to map inputs to outputs based on a known relationship between them. Supervised learning is often used for classification, regression, and prediction tasks. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, focuses solely on finding patterns and relationships within the data. Examples include clustering, density estimation, and anomaly detection.

## 2.2.什么是维度降低
Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of converting a large set of high-dimensional data into a smaller set of fewer dimensions that still captures most of the information in the original data. One common use case of dimensionality reduction is visualizing complex data sets. For example, when working with image or text data, one might want to reduce the number of dimensions so that the data can be easily plotted, analyzed, and understood. Another example is bioinformatics where large gene expression matrices contain hundreds of thousands of dimensions, but few if any of them have biological meaning. Dimensionality reduction techniques are commonly applied to various fields including computer vision, natural language processing, finance, and healthcare.

## 2.3.什么是聚类分析
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that involves automatically grouping similar objects together into clusters. Clustering algorithms seek to minimize the intra-cluster distances between elements and maximize the inter-cluster distances between different clusters. Popular clustering algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering.

## 2.4.什么是概率分布
A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of observing certain values given some parameter(s). A probability distribution usually consists of two components:

1. Probability mass function (PMF): Describes the probability of each possible outcome occurring.
2. Cumulative distribution function (CDF): Provides a cumulative sum up to each point in a range of outcomes.

The PMF gives the relative frequency or probability of each discrete value in the sample space. For instance, suppose we roll a die repeatedly until we get six spots facing upwards. We would expect to see approximately three times each side of the dice showing "one," four times each side showing "two," and so on, giving rise to a uniform distribution. On the other hand, let's assume that we measure the weight of a person before and after exercising at home. Assuming that the weights follow a normal distribution, we could obtain a bell curve that shows the expected mean and variance of the weight values for every person. Similarly, we can describe any continuous variable with a probability distribution.

## 2.5.什么是密度估计
Density estimation is another important unsupervised machine learning technique that attempts to represent the joint probability distribution of a random variable. Density estimation can be thought of as the inverse problem of kernel density estimation, where we try to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable using only finite samples. There are many different ways to perform density estimation, such as kernel smoothing, radial basis functions (RBF), conditional density estimation (CDE), and neural networks. Kernel density estimation is widely used in various applications ranging from weather forecasting to financial markets.
