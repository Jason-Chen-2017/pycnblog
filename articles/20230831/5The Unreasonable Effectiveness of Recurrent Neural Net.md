Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are the most successful type of artificial neural network for sequential data. They work well on tasks such as language modeling and speech recognition due to their ability to keep track of contextual information over time. Despite this success, they have been under-utilized in other applications like music generation and image captioning. In this article, we will explore a new model called Transformers that has significantly outperformed RNNs on various tasks including natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. We will discuss how Transformers use attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during training and inference, making them more efficient than RNNs at capturing long-term dependencies. Finally, we will showcase some code examples and insights gained from our experiments using these models.

In summary, by introducing Transformers, researchers have revolutionized the field of deep learning through improved performance and scalability without increasing computational complexity or requiring massive amounts of labeled data.

# 2. 背景介绍
Sequential data refers to any form of ordered data where each observation depends only on previous observations. This includes text sequences, stock prices, video frames, etc., all of which can be thought of as "time series" data. It is important to note that not every task requires sequential data since other types of data may also benefit from an RNN architecture.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of RNN cell, was proposed in 1997 by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber. The LSTM introduces several key improvements over traditional RNN cells, namely memory cell state maintenance and gate mechanisms, allowing the model to maintain information over longer periods of time. The key idea behind LSTM is to add extra layers of computation to enable better handling of long term dependencies in sequences.

However, despite its significant impact on sequential data problems, there remain challenges associated with applying traditional RNN architectures to larger scale tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. One such challenge is the vanishing gradient problem, which occurs when backpropagating gradients through large and complex networks. Several methods have been proposed to address this issue, but none have achieved satisfactory results so far.

Transformer, a recently introduced deep learning architecture based entirely on attention mechanisms, offers an alternative approach to addressing the vanishing gradient problem and improving upon standard RNN architectures. The main idea behind Transformer is to break down the inputs into smaller sub-sequences, pass them through separate transformer encoder layers, and then combine the resulting representations together using another transformer decoder layer. Each transformer block consists of multiple self-attention and feedforward layers that operate on different sub-sequences of the input. By doing so, the model can learn robust features across different positions in the input sequence without relying on explicit position encodings or attention masks. Additionally, because transformers do not require sequential data to be processed sequentially, they allow for parallel processing and greatly reduce the amount of required resources. 

# 3. 基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the details of the core algorithm principles and operations involved in Transformers, let’s briefly define some terms and concepts used throughout the paper:

1. Self-Attention Mechanism: Self-attention is a mechanism used by Transformers to capture local relationships between elements in a sequence. A common way to implement self-attention involves calculating the dot product between each element in the sequence and weighting those products according to learned parameters. These weighted sums become the new sequence representation after the attention mechanism. 

2. Position Encoding: Position encoding is a method used by Transformers to incorporate positional information into the embeddings generated by the self-attention mechanism. Typically, the positional information is represented as sinusoidal functions of the position along the sequence length.

3. Multihead Attention: Instead of performing one single attention operation on the entire sequence, multihead attention allows Transformers to compute different feature vectors for different parts of the sequence using separate sets of attention weights computed using different projection matrices. This technique reduces the dimensionality of the output space and allows for greater flexibility in capturing complex relationships among elements.

4. Encoder Layer: The encoder layer performs two major operations: first, it applies multihead attention to the input sequence using learned projection matrices; second, it feeds the result through a fully connected layer followed by dropout regularization.

5. Decoder Layer: Similar to the encoder layer, the decoder layer performs three major operations: first, it computes attention scores between the current target element and the previously generated outputs; second, it combines the attention scores with the output produced by the corresponding source element to produce a new set of output embeddings; third, it finally passes the combined embedding through a fully connected layer followed by softmax activation function for predicting the next word in the sequence.

Now that we have defined some basic terminology, let’s dive deeper into the actual algorithmic principles.

# 4. 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解

## 4.1 深度学习基础
For starters, let us understand what is meant by a “deep” neural network. Deep learning refers to machine learning techniques that are composed of many layers of non-linear transformations applied to the original input data. Intuitively, the idea of a deep neural network stems from the human brain’s ability to recognize patterns in higher-order interactions between simple units of the visual cortex. The same concept can be applied to the processing power of machines, particularly in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing, where high level abstractions and hierarchical structure of data make it possible to create powerful models.

A typical deep neural network typically consists of multiple hidden layers interconnected with nonlinear activation functions. The number of nodes in each layer is determined by the size of the input data and the complexity of the desired output. The activation functions serve to introduce non-linearity into the model and prevent the model from becoming too rigid, which could lead to overfitting or poor generalization. Dropout is often employed to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out some neurons during training, which forces the model to fit the training data in a more distributed manner instead of relying solely on the presence of specific nodes in the network.

Another essential component of a deep neural network is optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam, which update the weights of the network based on the loss function calculated during training. SGD uses mini-batches of training samples to estimate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights, while Adam further improves the convergence rate by adapting the step sizes automatically. Learning rate scheduling and early stopping are additional strategies for fine-tuning hyperparameters and reducing overfitting.

## 4.2 自注意力机制（Self-Attention）

Before describing the Transformers model itself, we need to clarify the nature of attention mechanisms and how they work within the Transformer framework. The attention mechanism captures the relationship between individual elements in a sequence and helps the model focus on important parts of the sequence while ignoring irrelevant information. To achieve this, the attention mechanism assigns a weight to each element in the sequence depending on its similarity to a fixed query point, which acts as a guiding light to selectively pay attention to certain regions of the sequence. The simplest form of attention is full attention, wherein each element receives equal weight, indicating that no particular element in the sequence should be given more importance. However, recent studies have shown that even full attention is insufficient to properly capture long-range dependencies in sequences, especially in NLP tasks where distant words tend to influence each other in a sentence rather than being isolated fragments.

To address this limitation, the Transformer model uses self-attention, which replaces the classic attention mechanism by computing the attention weights based on queries, keys, and values obtained separately for each element in the sequence. Here, the queries come from the previous layer of the network, whereas the keys and values come from the entire input sequence. For each query, the attention mechanism computes a score for each key-value pair, indicating the extent to which the query matches the corresponding value. The final set of attention weights is computed by normalizing the scores using the softmax function.


The advantage of using self-attention over traditional attention mechanisms is that it enables the model to consider global relationships among elements in the sequence without imposing any prior knowledge about the sequence order. Another advantage is that self-attention allows the model to generate variable-length output sequences while still retaining a coherent overall structure.

## 4.3 位置编码（Position Encoding）

To account for the relative spatial arrangement of elements in the input sequence, the Transformer model embeds each element using a vector representation obtained by concatenating a learnable parameter matrix and a position encoding. The position encoding adds geometric information to the embeddings, enabling the model to reason about the geometry of the objects in the scene, whether they are spread out or clustered closely together. Specifically, the position encoding is constructed using a fixed base function $PE(pos,2i)$ and a frequency-dependent factor $PE(pos,2i+1)$, where $pos$ denotes the position along the sequence length. As the distance between adjacent elements increases, the amplitude of the positional encoding decreases towards zero. Empirically, adding the position encoding plays an important role in improving the accuracy of predictions made by the model on a variety of tasks, ranging from natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.

## 4.4 多头注意力（Multihead Attention）

The key insight behind the Transformer model is to use multihead attention, which enables the model to jointly attend to different aspects of the input sequence using multiple heads and scaled dot-product attention. A head corresponds to a separate attention mechanism, which processes the input sequence independently to capture varying levels of importance for different parts of the sequence. This contrasts with the conventional approach of using a single attention mechanism that captures both short-range and long-range dependencies at once.

Each head generates its own set of attention weights, which are combined using concatenation before being fed into the next layer of the model. This effectively splits up the attention process into multiple attention heads, each responsible for generating a unique set of attention weights, leading to a stronger capability of capturing more complex relationships among elements in the sequence.

## 4.5 编码器层（Encoder Layer）

The encoder layer takes the embedded input sequence and applies multihead attention to it, producing a new sequence representation that captures the global structure of the input sequence. The encoder layer comprises two main components: multihead attention and a fully connected layer followed by dropout regularization. The former generates attention weights for each element in the input sequence, which are passed through a fully connected layer to obtain the output embeddings. The latter is used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out some neurons during training to force the model to fit the training data in a more distributed manner instead of relying solely on the presence of specific nodes in the network.

## 4.6 解码器层（Decoder Layer）

Similar to the encoder layer, the decoder layer takes the previous output and the encoded input sequence and produces the predicted output sequence. The decoder layer contains three main components: multihead attention, combining attention scores with the output produced by the corresponding source element, and a fully connected layer followed by a softmax activation function for predicting the next word in the sequence. The multihead attention module generates attention weights for each element in the input sequence and the previously generated output sequence, which are combined using concatenation before being passed through a fully connected layer to produce the updated output embedding for the current timestep. The softmax activation function ensures that the output probabilities sum up to one and represent a probability distribution over the vocabulary.

## 4.7 Transformer模型总结

Let's summarize the above explanations of the key components of the Transformer model:

- Self-attention: Computes attention weights based on queries, keys, and values obtained separately for each element in the sequence to capture local relationships between elements in the sequence.

- Position encoding: Adds positional information to the embeddings generated by the self-attention mechanism to help the model reason about the geometry of the objects in the scene.

- Multihead attention: Allows the model to jointly attend to different aspects of the input sequence using multiple heads and scaled dot-product attention.

- Encoder layer: Applies multihead attention to the input sequence and produces a new sequence representation that captures the global structure of the input sequence.

- Decoder layer: Takes the previous output and the encoded input sequence and produces the predicted output sequence. Uses multihead attention to generate attention weights and combines them with the output produced by the corresponding source element to produce the updated output embedding for the current timestep.

Overall, the Transformer model represents a novel paradigm for building deep neural networks capable of processing sequential data with a global viewpoint while retaining local relationships between elements within the sequence. While the primary motivation for its development was improved efficiency, the model achieves excellent performance on a range of tasks and prompts the question of why other approaches were not taken earlier. Nonetheless, the transformer remains a promising approach for solving sequential data problems, opening the door to exploring a wide range of emerging technologies that leverage deep learning to advance artificial intelligence.
