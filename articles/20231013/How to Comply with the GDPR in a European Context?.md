# 1.背景介绍

：
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the EU’s new data protection regulation that applies to all businesses and organizations across Europe, including those based within the UK, Ireland or Northern Ireland. The aim of this regulation is to strengthen privacy rights and ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws by providing greater transparency about how personal information is used, accessed, shared, and transferred over digital channels. It also aims to protect sensitive user data by designating it as personal data and establishing legal safeguards against unauthorised processing and access. 

In order for companies to comply with the GDPR, they need to have a strong understanding of what personal data is stored, processed and transmitted electronically, and why this may be necessary. This knowledge can then be used to identify risks associated with gathering, storing, maintaining and sharing such data, and develop suitable measures to address them while adhering to strict rules and best practices.

To further assist organisations, we will provide you with an overview of what personal data means in practice and the key areas where the GDPR might apply. We'll explain the different types of personal data, the purposes for which they are collected, and the ways in which they are processed and shared electronically. Finally, we'll discuss strategies for managing personal data and ensuring that relevant third-party service providers comply with the GDPR. By following these guidelines, organisations can effectively manage their personal data and meet the requirements set out by the GDPR in a cost-effective manner.

Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. It includes data such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, credit card details, IP addresses, biometric data, medical records etc. Personal data is often referred to as ‘end-user data’ because it concerns individuals who interact directly with an organisation or website. The term ‘organiser data’ refers to data held by an organisation itself – e.g., customer data, accounting information, employee information etc. 

There are several categories of personal data under the GDPR. These include:

1. Identifiers: Unique identifiers such as names, birthdates, passport numbers, tax identification numbers, or online identifiers like IP addresses.
2. Contact Information: Any contact information, such as mailing addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, social media profiles, preferences etc. 
3. Financial information: Bank account details, billing information, payment information, purchase history, transaction history etc.
4. Healthcare information: Patient demographics, health related data, treatment plans, diagnosis, medications taken, surgeries performed, immunizations received etc.
5. Sensitive personal data: Any other information that could be considered sensitive, such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, trade union membership, genetic data, sexual orientation, religious or similar beliefs etc. 
6. Legal information: Any data that falls outside the category of personal data but still contains valuable information regarding a subject, such as criminal convictions, employment history, marital status, or genetic test results.

Depending on the context, some of the above categories may not apply. For example, financial transactions involving small amounts of money may not require consent from the individual involved. Similarly, if an organisation sells its services or products to international customers without requiring the customer's permission, there would be no requirement for collecting contact information beyond a basic name, address and email address.

Furthermore, when dealing with sensitive personal data, it is important to treat it with caution and ensure appropriate safeguards are put in place to prevent unauthorised access, use or disclosure. Despite being classified as personal data, it should not be interpreted in a way that gives an irresponsible or biased view of someone else's actions or behavior. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise sound judgment when working with sensitive personal data.

Regarding sharing personal data between organisations, the GDPR provides specific provisions concerning third party transfers of personal data. However, this does not necessarily cover cases where one company gathers personal data on behalf of another, or where multiple companies share personal data for the same purpose. In either case, the transfer must take place using secure technologies and procedures to avoid potential security breaches or conflicts of interest.

Lastly, regardless of whether personal data is being collected, stored, maintained or shared electronically, organisational policies and procedures need to be designed to ensure that users understand and trust their personal data is protected, managed properly and disposed of securely after use. This includes clearly communicating the purpose, storage location, management methods, retention periods and recipients of personal data to all parties affected by it.
