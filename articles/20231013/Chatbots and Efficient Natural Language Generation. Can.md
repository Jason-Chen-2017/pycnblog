# 1.背景介绍


Natural language generation (NLG) is an important task in artificial intelligence (AI), especially for chatbots. As the success of many popular chatbots increases, more and more developers are developing chatbots with high-quality NLGs to help users interact with machines in natural conversation style. However, it becomes a challenge for these chatbots to learn natural language patterns and create new outputs that humans cannot do on their own.

In this article, we will focus on how to develop effective chatbots with efficient NLG models by analyzing its learning ability and training data requirements using deep neural networks (DNNs). We will also discuss several approaches towards achieving good performance with limited amount of training data. Finally, we will present our preliminary results based on experiments conducted using publicly available resources, which can serve as a baseline model for further research and development work.

Before diving into the core concept of chatbots and efficient NLG, let’s understand some key concepts related to NLP:

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): This is the field of computer science devoted to handling human languages such as English, Chinese or Japanese. It involves extracting meaningful information from text, such as named entities like people's names, organizations' names, locations, etc., verb tense and meaning, contextual understanding, sentiment analysis, parsing sentences, among others.
2. Text Generation: This refers to producing new texts through statistical methods or machine learning techniques. The goal of generating text automatically is to generate fluent and coherent text that conveys relevant information. Generating text requires two essential components - language modeling and sequence generation. In language modeling, the model learns the probabilities of different sequences of words occurring in a corpus of documents. In sequence generation, the model predicts next possible word given a sequence of words. The generated text typically has better quality compared to manual transcription.
3. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): These are a type of artificial neural network commonly used in various tasks including image recognition, speech recognition, and text classification. DNNs consist of layers of neurons connected with each other. Each layer processes input data and passes the output forward to the next layer. By passing multiple layers, DNNs extract complex features and relationships within the input data.

Now coming back to chatbots and efficient NLG...
A chatbot is a software program that provides services via messaging interfaces. It often responds to user inputs and takes actions such as searching, ordering, booking, etc. It can provide personalized responses, engaging conversations, or make recommendations. A chatbot typically uses natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to interpret user inputs and generate appropriate responses. 

Efficient NLG models are designed to produce high-quality responses by leveraging both linguistic patterns and large amounts of training data. For example, GPT-2, one of the most advanced generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, is trained on billions of web pages and articles, making it capable of generating highly informative content with comparable quality to state-of-the-art models while requiring minimal computational power.

It’s not uncommon for chatbots to have limited capacity due to hardware constraints or lack of training data availability. Therefore, efficient NLG models should be optimized to reduce the number of parameters required for inference so that they can scale down to small devices without significant degradation in response quality. Additionally, sophisticated optimization techniques like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation can help compress the model size and improve the inference speed at runtime.

In summary, efficient NLG models require careful design to achieve high-quality generation while reducing the number of parameters and memory usage required for inference. With access to vast amounts of training data and powerful computational resources, it is becoming easier for chatbots to learn natural language patterns and create new outputs that humans cannot do on their own.
