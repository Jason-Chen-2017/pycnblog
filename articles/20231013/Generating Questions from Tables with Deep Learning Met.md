# 1.背景介绍


With the rapid development of data sources and techniques for generating knowledge graphs from unstructured text or tables, extracting questions from tabular data has become a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) field. Extracting questions from table data is not an easy task as it requires analyzing complex relationships between various entities mentioned in the table cells. In this article, we will discuss different deep learning models that have been proposed to generate question-answer pairs from table data by using neural networks. We will also explain how these models can be used to improve automatic question generation performance on large scale datasets like WebTables. Finally, we will present our research results obtained on three publicly available datasets representing different levels of complexity of table structures. These datasets are called TableBank, Saxon Bank and ProteinNet bank. All the experiments conducted are done on machine learning frameworks like PyTorch.

In order to make use of deep learning models for extracting questions from table data, we need to first understand the basic concepts of neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Additionally, it’s important to know the structure of tabular data and its relationship with other types of structured and semi-structured data. We will cover each concept along with examples in detail to provide readers better understanding of this topic.

## Neural Networks(神经网络)
A neural network (NN) is a set of connected units or nodes together with some algorithmic rules defining their input, output, and behavior. The general architecture of a NN consists of layers of interconnected neurons, where each layer receives inputs from the previous layer, processes them through weighted connections or activation functions, and then passes the outputs to the next layer. A common example of a simple neural network model could be a single hidden layer with two inputs, one bias unit, and one output unit. This network would take two inputs, multiply them by weights, add the biases, apply a non-linear function, and finally produce a single output. Other architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRU) are more suitable for handling sequence or time-series based inputs than traditional fully connected NNs.


## Recurrent Neural Networks(循环神经网络)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are type of neural networks designed specifically for sequential or time-series data. RNNs work by maintaining an internal state through time, which is updated every time a new piece of information arrives at any given step in the sequence. The key feature of RNNs is that they can learn to remember past inputs and contextualize future predictions. They differ from conventional feedforward neural networks (FNNs) because they include feedback loops across time steps. An RNN typically includes multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers, along with a special “cell” or “memory” layer that captures and propagates information over time. The cell state contains both information about the current input and the history of prior inputs processed by the cell.

An essential part of training an RNN involves defining a loss function that measures the error between predicted and actual values. One popular choice is the mean squared error (MSE), which compares the difference between the predicted and target output vectors at each timestep. Another commonly used loss function is cross-entropy, which computes the negative log likelihood of the correct class label given the predicted probabilities produced by the softmax function applied to the output vector at each timestep. There are many other variations of loss functions depending on the specific problem being addressed.

The process of updating the parameters of an RNN during training is known as backpropagation through time (BPTT), where errors are accumulated through the entire sequence before updating the weights. To handle long sequences or variable-length input, RNN variants such as LSTM and GRU incorporate mechanisms that allow them to selectively retain or discard previously stored information based on their relative importance compared to newly incoming information.

Finally, when dealing with tasks involving longer sequences, the vanishing gradient problem becomes significant, where gradients computed during BPTT tend to become very small and propagate backwards through the network quickly leading to vanishing or exploding gradients. This issue is often addressed using techniques such as gradient clipping, weight regularization, or skip connections.

To effectively extract questions from table data, we need to leverage the power of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained on large amounts of labeled table data. Here, we will cover different approaches to building a pipeline that can automatically generate questions from table data:

1. Data preprocessing: Firstly, we need to preprocess the raw table dataset into a format that is appropriate for training a deep learning model. Preprocessing involves cleaning the data, removing irrelevant columns/rows, handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical ones, and normalizing the data. After this stage, we should have clean, normalized data ready for further analysis.

2. Model Architecture Design: Next, we need to design the architecture of the deep learning model that we want to train. We can choose between CNNs and RNNs depending on whether our input data is image or sequence based respectively. For CNNs, we can start with traditional architectures like AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, etc., and fine tune them using transfer learning technique to suit our purpose. For RNNs, we can use standard architectures like LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM, or Recursive Net based on our requirement. Each model architecture must consist of several layers, including input, hidden, and output layers, along with additional components like dropout or batch normalization.

Once we have defined our model architecture, we need to implement the forward pass and backward propagation algorithms to update the parameters of the model based on the loss function defined earlier. During training, we need to monitor the progress of the model’s accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to ensure that it doesn’t overfit or underperform on the training data. When testing the model on held-out test data, we evaluate its overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to measure its ability to generalize to new data. Finally, once the model achieves good performance, we can deploy it to generate question-answer pairs directly from user input without manual annotation or pretraining.

3. Evaluation Metrics: Once we have developed and tested our deep learning model, we need to assess its quality using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix. Accuracy is simply the number of correctly classified samples divided by the total number of samples. Precision measures the fraction of true positives out of all predicted positive samples, while Recall measures the fraction of true positives out of all actual positive samples. The F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric, taking their harmonic average. A confusion matrix provides a visual summary of how well the model performed on each class of samples, making it easier to identify areas where the model needs improvement. It shows the number of true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives for each class, allowing us to see which classes are most difficult to classify correctly.

4. Quantitative Analysis: To compare different models, we can use statistical tests such as t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test to determine if there is a significant difference between their performance on different benchmarks. Alternatively, we can visualize the results using box plots or scatter plots to show the distribution of performance scores for each model against a chosen benchmark. We can also use metrics such as MRR, MAP, P@K, and nDCG to evaluate the ranking quality of generated questions. We can also calculate human agreement ratings to gauge the effectiveness of our system, comparing the number of unique answers that were extracted from the gold labels versus those that were missed due to ambiguity or partial matches.
