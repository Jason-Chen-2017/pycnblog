# 1.背景介绍


Apache Airflow是开源项目，是一个用于数据科学工作流自动化的平台。它具有以下几个主要特点：

1、Airflow可以配置复杂的工作流程（workflow），包括顺序、并行、分支等。你可以定义不同的任务及其依赖关系，当触发某些条件时就会运行相应的任务。Airflow基于DAG（有向无环图）结构，易于理解和维护。

2、Airflow提供了可靠的监控功能，能够跟踪你的工作流执行情况。它能帮助你快速发现问题并且解决。

3、Airflow提供丰富的插件机制，允许你使用外部服务如数据库连接，Hadoop集群和机器学习框架等。

4、Airflow支持多种编程语言，包括Python，Java，C＃等。它还支持许多企业级的平台，如Redshift，S3，GCP等。

5、Airflow可以部署在单机或者分布式环境中。

Apache Airflow最初由Airbnb开发，它是一个用于管理复杂工作流的平台。Airflow还支持很多其他公司，如Stripe，Google Cloud Platform等。因此，Apache Airflow是一个成熟、稳定的工具，非常适合用来构建复杂的数据科学工作流。

本文将通过Airflow的介绍、核心概念、相关术语、安装和配置、基础用法、应用场景和未来展望，对Airflow进行全面的介绍。

# 2.核心概念与联系
## 2.1 Airflow介绍
Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. It makes it easy to carry out complex pipelines of tasks, such as ETL, data profiling, machine learning, etc., when certain conditions are met. In other words, it enables you to create custom workflows that conform to your organization’s data science process.

Apache Airflow provides three main functionalities:

1. Workflow Orchestration: Airflow allows you to define different tasks and their dependencies in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. Each node represents an individual task, while the edges define how they relate to each other. You can set up a workflow by creating DAG objects which can be scheduled and executed based on specific triggers or manually triggered.

2. Monitoring: Airflow comes with robust monitoring capabilities that help you track your workflow execution status. It gives you alerts for any issues detected during the run time and helps you quickly identify and resolve them.

3. Plugins: Airflow has a plugin mechanism that allows you to use external services like database connections, Hadoop clusters and machine learning frameworks. This feature makes Airflow very versatile and extensible.

Overall, Apache Airflow is an open-source tool that simplifies data analytics workloads and increases the speed at which new insights can be gained from data. It's well-suited for large scale enterprise environments, making it a popular choice among organizations worldwide.

## 2.2 Airflow核心概念
### 2.2.1 DAG
A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) defines the order in which individual tasks should execute within a workflow. In essence, it’s a representation of a workflow where each node represents a unique task and the arrows represent the dependency between them. The goal of using DAGs is to break down complex processes into smaller, manageable parts so that teams can more easily understand and troubleshoot problems.

The components of a DAG include:

1. Tasks: These are the individual steps needed to complete a particular job, such as fetching data from a source system, transforming it into another format, loading it into a destination system, running an analysis algorithm, etc. Each task typically consists of one or more operators that perform some operation on the input data and produce output data.

2. Operators: An operator is responsible for executing a specific action, such as copying files, querying a database, or running a Python script. They take inputs from previous tasks and pass outputs to subsequent tasks.

3. Triggers: Triggers determine when a DAG will start executing, either immediately after being added to the scheduler or on a specific date/time interval.

4. Schedules: Schedules allow you to automatically trigger a DAG at regular intervals rather than relying on manual triggers.

5. Dependencies: Dependencies define the order in which tasks must be completed before moving on to the next step in the DAG. For example, if Task A requires that Task B has already been successfully completed, then Task A depends on Task B.

### 2.2.2 Operators
Operators are pluggable modules that interact with external systems and implement various operations, including file transfer, SQL queries, and Python scripts. There are several types of operators available in Airflow, including:

1. BashOperator: Executes bash commands on the local machine or a remote host.

2. PythonOperator: Allows you to write custom code that runs inside a Python interpreter.

3. EmailOperator: Sends email notifications based on user-defined criteria, such as task success or failure.

4. HiveOperator: Allows you to interact with a Hive server and run HiveQL statements against tables stored in HDFS.

5. SparkSubmitOperator: Launches a PySpark application using spark-submit.

All these operators provide a consistent interface for interacting with external systems without having to write tedious boilerplate code.

### 2.2.3 Connections
Connections are configuration settings that specify how to connect to external systems, including databases, filesystems, cloud storage providers, and APIs. When configuring Airflow connections, you can specify authentication credentials, port numbers, timeouts, and other connection details. Once configured, these connections can be referenced by multiple operators throughout your DAG to simplify interaction with external systems.
