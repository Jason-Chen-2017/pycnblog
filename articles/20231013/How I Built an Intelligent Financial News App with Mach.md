## Introduction
In this article we will explain how I built a machine learning-based financial news app called "StockHawk". The main goal of the app is to provide users with personalized stock recommendations based on their investment preferences and market sentiments. This can help investors make better decisions when making investments in stocks or funds. It also helps improve overall financial literacy amongst the general public. 

We will start by outlining the problem statement that StockHawk aims to solve: what are the most relevant news articles for any given stock at the moment? For instance, if you want to buy Apple Inc., which company should you follow on social media, which news outlet covers its latest research results, etc. While some machine learning models exist for recommending products on e-commerce websites such as Amazon and Netflix, they have not been widely used for finance-related content yet. Most existing solutions rely heavily on text analysis techniques and libraries like NLTK or SpaCy, but these tools do not always capture complex relationships between words within a sentence.

For example, consider the following two sentences:

"Apple just announced it has raised $7 billion in new funding after more than three years of paying dividends."
"A popular tech startup recently secured additional funding from Merrill Lynch Partners Inc. through an SEC vote."

While both sentences seem similar, one clearly expresses the positive sentiment around Apple's recent funding announcements while the other focuses solely on the technology startup's recent acquisition. Yet machine learning algorithms would not be able to determine which sentiment is more impactful without careful feature engineering. In contrast, our approach uses neural networks and deep learning architectures to learn the underlying patterns and interactions between words in news articles. We hope this will enable us to create accurate and reliable recommendation engines for financial news articles.

This project was designed as part of my capstone project for Udacity’s Data Science Nanodegree program.

## Background Knowledge
To build a successful machine learning-based application for financial news recommendations, we need a good understanding of several key concepts and technologies. These include:

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Extracting insights from unstructured data like news articles requires natural language processing techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and so on. 

2. Text Mining: Our solution leverages various NLP techniques to extract meaningful features from the raw text data. However, there is no substitute for expert knowledge and intuition when analyzing large datasets like news articles. By carefully inspecting each article, we can identify areas where keywords or phrases commonly appear, correlations between different headlines, and patterns in word usage.

3. Sentiment Analysis: Understanding the emotional tone behind news articles is critical to determining their relevance to the reader's interests. Various approaches including rule-based systems, lexicon-based classification, and machine learning methods are available for this purpose. We use pre-trained sentiment analysis models like BERT or GPT-2 along with fine-tuning them using domain-specific labeled data.

4. Deep Learning Architectures: Neural networks are known for their ability to learn complex relationships between input data and output labels. When applied to financial news recommendations, we use convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to model complex sequence dependencies in the news articles.

5. Recommendation Systems: Once we have extracted useful features from the raw text data, we can use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques to generate personalized stock recommendations. Both techniques assume that people who read similar articles tend to engage in similar behaviors and purchase related items together. Collaborative filtering involves finding similarities between users' historical behavior and predicting their future preference. Content-based filtering relies on similarity measures between articles' contents instead of user behavior.

6. Deployment & Integration: Finally, once we have developed our recommendation engine, we need to deploy it into a web application or mobile app. To ensure scalability and maintainability over time, we need to employ CI/CD pipeline technologies like GitHub Actions or Jenkins. Additionally, we need to integrate our recommendation engine with external data sources like news APIs, social platforms like Twitter, and financial databases like Quandl to keep up to date with the latest trends and developments in the industry.
