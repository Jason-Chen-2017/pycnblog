# 1.背景介绍


Social Media has become a major driving force in modern life and people all over the world are creating profiles on various platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. The most important aspect of any profile is its follower count. The more you have a good following, the better it becomes for your brand or product. In this article we will learn how to analyze our Social Media Followers’ behavior using Python programming language with the help of several libraries available online such as Tweepy, TextBlob, pandas and NumPy.

In order to get started, we need to understand what type of data do we want to collect from our followers? Do we only care about their general interests or also their sentiment towards different topics or products? What kind of analysis can be done based on these insights? And finally, which libraries should we use to perform these tasks effectively and efficiently? These questions will guide us through the rest of the article. Let's dive into it! 

The scope of this article is limited to analyzing your Social Media Followers’ behavior based on basic demographic information such as age, gender, location, education level etc., but it can easily extend to other types of analysis depending upon our requirements and problem statement.

## 2.1 Followers vs Likes & Retweets:
Before exploring specific methods to analyze social media followers' behavior, let's first define some terms that we commonly encounter while working with social media:

1. **Follower**: A person who follows someone else on a platform means they are subscribing to the user's posts and updates.
2. **Like** / **Retweet**: When one likes/retweets a post by another user, it indicates a positive response to the post and therefore adds value to the author's profile. However, it does not necessarily mean that the author wants to promote his/her brand or service to everyone. 
3. **Engagement**: Engagement refers to the amount of interactions users receive on a platform, including comments, likes, retweets, shares, and replies. It represents how active a user is on a platform and helps them stay engaged and motivated. 

## 2.2 Demographics Information:
Based on the previous definitions, we can start our analysis by collecting information related to each follower's demographics such as name, username, email address, birthdate, gender, city, state, country, occupation, education level etc. This information could be useful in understanding their interests, preferences, behaviors, attitudes, opinions and reasons behind their actions. We would then proceed to gather additional data points such as number of followers, likes, retweets, engagements, number of posts published by the user, time spent on the platform, percentage change in engagement metrics between periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), etc. 

Some additional information that might be helpful during the analysis process include: 

1. Time zone information: Each user might set their preferred timezone according to their local time. Gathering this information could provide insight into their mood and affect their decision-making patterns. 

2. Language preference: Users may choose to write posts in multiple languages which affects their audience and potential market reach. Analyzing this information could provide valuable insights into how popular certain content is and where it is being shared.  

Once we have collected this information, we can begin performing various analyses such as clustering followers based on their demographics or generating insights based on aggregated data. 

## 2.3 Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment analysis refers to identifying and understanding the underlying emotional tone of a textual message. There are many techniques used for sentiment analysis such as lexicons, machine learning algorithms, rule-based models, and deep learning approaches. Here, we will focus on an approach called opinion mining and utilizing natural language processing tools such as NLTK library. Opinion mining involves extracting relevant features from customer reviews, tweets, blogs, etc., and classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral categories. Once we have obtained a dataset containing thousands of texts annotated with positive, negative, or neutral labels, we can train machine learning models to classify new documents as well.
