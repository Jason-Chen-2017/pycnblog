# 1.背景介绍


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a key technology for many financial applications, including fraud detection, investment management, risk assessment, and credit scoring systems. Despite the widespread interest of AI researchers in this field, there is limited knowledge available to practitioners on how it can be effectively leveraged by financial institutions in various contexts. The aim of this survey is to provide an overview of existing techniques used to integrate AI technologies into financial applications and discuss the potential impact of these techniques on different application domains. Moreover, we will explore current challenges and future directions that need further exploration to advance the state-of-the-art in integrating AI technologies into financial services. In particular, we will focus on three important areas where AI may have significant roles: identification of fraudulent transactions, improving portfolio diversification, and optimizing customer loyalty. We hope this review article can serve as a useful starting point for those interested in applying AI technologies in finance and pave the way towards a better understanding of the opportunities and limitations of such applications.
In order to perform effective integration of AI technologies into financial services, several factors are critical, including data quality, model accuracy, computational resources, scalability, and security considerations. Therefore, ensuring a secure environment, reliable processing pipelines, and constant monitoring of model performance are crucial components of any successful AI-powered solution. However, given the rapid growth of artificial intelligence algorithms, new threats and vulnerabilities may emerge in the near future, making it essential to continuously monitor the development of AI technologies and ensure their safety and effectiveness.

# 2.Core Concepts and Connection
## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as Machine Learning or Deep Learning, refers to the ability of machines to learn without being explicitly programmed. It combines multiple disciplines such as computer science, mathematics, statistics, and physics to create systems capable of thinking like humans and performing tasks that would typically require conscious human intervention. 

### History of AI
1956 - Symbolic AI 
1974 - Neural Networks 
1986 - Expert Systems 
1997 - Knowledge Representation and Reasoning 
2004 - Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
2010 - Computer Vision 
2014 - Robotics and Autonomous Vehicles 

### Terminology 
#### AI Algorithms 
Algorithms play an essential role in artificial intelligence and machine learning. They determine how the system takes input, processes it through mathematical calculations, makes decisions based on its output, and updates itself accordingly. There are two types of algorithms: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised algorithms learn from labeled data while unsupervised algorithms find patterns in data.

#### Data
Data represents all kinds of information collected or generated by sensors, machines, or humans about a specific topic. Data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured depending on how it is stored, processed, and analyzed. Structured data includes tables with rows and columns organized in a specific structure, such as relational databases. Semi-structured data consists of data that doesn't follow a strict schema, such as JSON documents or XML files. Unstructured data does not fit well within a traditional database structure and needs special handling methods, such as text mining and natural language processing.

#### Model 
A model is a representation of some process or phenomenon that exhibits desired properties or behaviors. Models help us understand complex real-world problems and make predictions based on inputs provided by users. Different models capture different aspects of reality, which makes them more accurate than generalized assumptions. Examples include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

#### AI Application 
An AI application refers to any software or hardware system that uses AI techniques to solve a problem or automate a task. Some popular examples of AI applications include image recognition, chatbots, speech recognition, personal assistants, recommendation engines, and virtual assistants. AI applications have a wide range of applications across a variety of industries, including banking, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and retail.

#### Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) 
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use brain signals and electroencephalography (EEG) to communicate with computers, allowing people to interact with machines in ways they couldn’t before. BCIs are increasingly used in medicine, gaming, entertainment, fitness, and other fields because they enable people to control devices like home appliances and vehicles using only their minds. BCI developers are building intelligent devices that can interpret and react to physical activity, emotional states, cognitive abilities, etc., enabling people to interface with machines in novel and creative ways.

#### Fuzzy Logic 
Fuzzy logic is a type of reasoning method that allows variables to take on various degrees of membership to categories. This enables fuzzy sets to approximate crisp sets in situations where only partial truth values are known. By incorporating uncertainty and imprecision into the system, fuzzy logic can produce more robust and responsive outputs compared to traditional approaches. Examples include adaptive modeling, control systems, and self-driving cars.

#### Reinforcement Learning 
Reinforcement learning is a technique that enables agents to learn from experience and adaptively select actions in response to changing conditions. It is widely used in robotics, gaming, and finance to optimize agent behavior over time. Agents use reward functions to evaluate the goodness of their actions and choose the next one accordingly. RL is particularly suited for environments where rewards are sparse or non-stationary. Examples include training deep reinforcement learning models to play video games, navigate autonomous vehicles, and manage stock market trends.

#### Deep Learning 
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves multi-layered artificial neural networks consisting of connected units. These networks are trained on large datasets using backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms to improve the accuracy of predictive models. The term "deep" comes from the fact that networks consist of layers of interconnected neurons. Advantages of DL include high levels of abstraction, ability to handle large amounts of data, and ease of parallelization. Examples include image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

#### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning architectures specifically designed to work with images. CNNs apply filters to the raw pixel data of an image to extract relevant features and patterns. They are commonly used for object recognition, detection, and segmentation tasks. Example applications include facial recognition, autonomous driving, and medical imaging.

#### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of deep learning architectures specifically designed to work with sequential data, i.e., data that presents chronological relationships between individual elements. RNNs use feedback loops to store previously seen data and utilize it when processing new inputs. The network's internal memory enables the algorithm to keep track of long-term dependencies in the data. Examples include sentiment analysis, language translation, and audio synthesis.

#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning frameworks that are especially powerful at generating realistic synthetic data. GANs combine ideas from generative models (describes how to create new data samples) and adversarial training (which encourages the generator to become better at creating realistic samples). GANs can generate high-resolution images, text, videos, and audio clips, among others. Examples include face generation, image-to-image translation, and music composition.

#### Self-Organizing Map (SOM) 
Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are another type of unsupervised neural network architecture. They map input vectors onto a two-dimensional lattice, similar to k-means clustering. SOMs try to minimize the difference between each vector's position and its neighbors' positions on the lattice during training. SOMs are often used for pattern recognition, clustering, visualization, and dimensionality reduction.

#### TensorFlow 
TensorFlow is an open source library developed by Google for numerical computation, primarily used for developing and training deep learning models. TensorFlow provides APIs for defining computational graphs, tensor operations, and automatic differentiation. TensorFlow supports numerous programming languages, including Python, C++, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Swift. Examples include deep learning models for image recognition, text processing, and language modeling.
