# 1.背景介绍


Conventional monofilament composites, i.e., those made from a single material filament with aligned and parallel layers are limited by the unidirectional flow rule in uniaxial tension tests or weak bending due to their simplistic geometry. In order to overcome these limitations, there has been growing interest in hybrid microstructure composites that have better structural properties and mechanical strengths than conventional monofilaments while still retaining their unique geometrical arrangement. One such class of composite is the heterogeneous composite made up of several different types of materials, called polyanisotropic nanocomposites, which can be grouped into two categories: multiferroic heterostructures and topological-insulated heterogeneous composite (TITC) systems. These structures combine multiple materials with distinct microstructural features, including submicron scale porous pores, high aspect ratio polycrystalline interfaces between them, and regularly shaped individual particles for organic or inorganic components. An example of TITC system includes polymer/biology interface composites, where biological filaments incorporated into a polymer matrix provide the crucial modulus reduction necessary to create strong and robust bonding and transportation across scales.
The key feature of this type of composite is its ability to generate a wide range of mechanical behaviors, including axial compressive loading, shear and bending, torsional and twisting, fatigue life extension, etc. However, it is not well understood how they behave under non-linear aerodynamics conditions. The lack of detailed models describing the aerodynamic response of these complex materials requires further research.

In this paper we present a theoretical model for the aerodynamic behavior of anisotropic topology-insulated multiferroic heterogeneous composite (MITIC) nanomaterials. The MITIC structure consists of a network of interconnected cylindrical particles embedded in a solid support matrix. The motion of each particle can exhibit anisotropy, leading to interactions among neighboring particles resulting in a multi-scale deformation pattern that affects both the macroscopic macroscopically stiffness of the composite as well as the microscopic particle shape and size distribution. By controlling the degree of anisotropy in the system through the relative permeabilities of the constituent materials, one can control the overall morphology and mechanics of the composite. This study provides insight into how a complex material composed of multiple materials responds to non-linear aerodynamic loads, and demonstrates how certain design choices affect the stability, mobility, and aerodynamic performance of the material. Specifically, we analyze the effect of the presence of pore-scale structures on the elastic properties and aerodynamic coefficients of the composite, as well as the effects of varying surface charge density on the response to flow past the pores. We also derive approximate analytical expressions for some important thermodynamic quantities related to energy generation, fluid flow and degradation kinetics in aqueous environments. Finally, we demonstrate numerical simulations using both experimental data and computational methods to verify our theoretical predictions.

The first step towards understanding the dynamics of the MITIC system is to define a mathematical framework based on continuum theory. Based on the fact that MITIC is a multi-scale system involving three spatial dimensions, we choose a model that uses Lagrangian formulation. We assume that all particles interact via springs and couples through shear, flexure, and axial strains. The latter leads us to use the thin-walled, Newtonian isotropic elasticity tensor E = ηI + λJ, where I and J represent the moment and product of inertia tensors, respectively, and η and λ are Lame constants. To account for the anisotropy of the material, we introduce the concept of fiber directionality, which determines the alignment of fibers along the principal axes.

To obtain the full solution of the equations of motion, we integrate the Lagrangian dynamics forward in time, subjected to external boundary conditions. Since the aerodynamic forces are assumed small compared to the internal forces, we neglect them and consider only the shear, flexure, and axial displacements acting on the individual particles. At each time step, we need to solve for the values of the displacement field at every point in space. We employ the explicit time integration method Runge-Kutta fourth-order method to numerically evaluate the equations of motion and compute the displacement fields and other physical quantities at every node in the mesh.

Based on the previous assumption of constant fiber orientation, we derive the anisotropic equation of state used to describe the behavior of the material. Using a constitutive relationship derived from Navier-Stokes equations and incorporating the notion of pore-scale effects, we derive the relation between the bulk and shear moduli ε and μ and the dilatational relaxation time τd, which characterizes the rate of transition between equilibration and deformation. Our model takes into account the presence of multilayer pores and reactive surfaces within the particle boundaries, which contribute to increase in the local thickness and decrease in the interparticle spacing during failure mode transitions.

Using the anisotropic law of thermal expansion, we establish a simplified expression for the temperature dependence of the intrinsic viscosity εν, which governs the thermally driven flow regime of the material. This allows us to identify mechanisms responsible for the evolution of deformation patterns and aerodynamic behaviour during heat stress tests. In particular, we show that low permeability regions may cause localized fluctuations in the drag coefficient of the material, whereas high permeability regions may result in large aerodynamic coefficients and momentum fluxes.

Finally, we test the model against various experiments performed on real-world MITIC samples, showing that it accurately captures the macroscopic and microscopic behaviors of the material and predicts significant differences in aerodynamic coefficients for various manufacturing techniques, stresses, and orientations of the fibers.
