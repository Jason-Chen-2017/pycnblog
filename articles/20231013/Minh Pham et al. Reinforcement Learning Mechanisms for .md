# 1.背景介绍


In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has been demonstrated to achieve high performance in various tasks such as robot control, image/video recognition, game playing, etc. However, the exploration capability of these algorithms is still a long way from ideal levels. In this work, we present an agent-environment interaction exploration mechanism based on deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Our approach explores new environments through interacting with the environment by adjusting actions taken by the agent. We conducted extensive experiments using several deep RL algorithms including PPO, A2C, DQN, DDPG and SAC. The results show that our approach can improve the exploration capability significantly compared to baseline approaches. Moreover, it also provides practical insights into designing better exploration mechanisms for agent-environment interactions.

Agent: An agent is any entity capable of taking actions in an environment according to its policy. In the context of deep reinforcement learning, an agent refers to a machine learning system that learns to take optimal actions in order to maximize rewards over time in some given environment. Examples of agents include robots, autonomous vehicles, and digital assistants.

Environment: Environment refers to everything outside the agent's perception. It includes physical objects or entities like walls, doors, furniture, and humans, along with their properties such as position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration. In other words, the environment is what makes up the world around us where the agent acts in. The environment may be static or dynamic, and sometimes episodic or continuous. For example, in robotics, the environment could be a large warehouse filled with different products and sensors deployed on each object therein.

Policy: Policy is a mapping between observations (the current state of the environment) and actions (what the agent should do next). In other words, it specifies how the agent takes actions at every step given the current state of the environment. Depending on the nature of the problem, a policy could be stochastic, deterministic, or probabilistic.

Reward: Reward refers to the feedback signal provided by the environment to the agent. It determines whether the agent's action was successful or not. Positive reward signifies good behavior while negative reward indicates bad behavior. Additionally, reward can be delayed or sparse depending on the nature of the task being learned. For instance, a self-driving car agent might receive very low positive reward for moving forward but much higher positive reward for turning left. This could result in the agent ignoring turns entirely until it receives sufficiently high rewards indicating that the turn was effective.

Exploration: Exploration refers to the act of trying out novel behaviors or actions in an attempt to find solutions to more difficult problems. Without proper exploration, a reinforcement learning agent would remain stuck in local minima and fail to solve harder problems. To explore efficiently, an agent needs to have multiple ways of approaching the same problem. One possible way of exploring is to interact with the environment and adaptively change its behavior accordingly.

Interaction: Interaction refers to the communication between the agent and the environment. By interacting with the environment, the agent can learn about the structure, dynamics, and goals of the environment. As a consequence, the agent can become more efficient and better able to plan and perform tasks. Interaction also allows the agent to obtain information about the internal states of the environment which helps in improving its ability to make decisions.

Expert Iteration: Expert Iteration refers to an iterative process used by an agent during training to discover good policies. During expert iteration, the agent plays games against experts who provide guidance and input in real-time. Experts provide instructions on which actions to take in different situations, allowing the agent to explore a wide range of behaviors without requiring direct supervision.

Our proposed exploration mechanism combines two key ideas. First, we use a model-based approach to predict the outcomes of future events and infer the preferences of the agent towards different actions within the environment. Second, we modify the standard actor-critic framework to incorporate exploration strategies designed specifically for agent-environment interactions. Specifically, we add additional updates to the critic function, enabling the agent to estimate uncertainty and value different options before making a decision. Furthermore, we introduce a concept called Random Network Distillation (RND), which uses a teacher network to generate random data points to train the student network. RND enables the agent to explore new environments effectively by generating diverse samples to imitate the distributions of previously seen data points. Finally, we propose a method called Expert Iteration, which leverages prior knowledge of human experts to guide the agent in finding solutions to challenging tasks.

The overall approach involves four main steps:

1. Predictive Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: We first create a predictive model of the environment using an ensemble of neural networks that represent the likelihood distribution of possible states and transitions. Using this model, we estimate the expected returns and values of different actions in the future. 

2. Action Selection Strategies: Next, we modify the traditional Actor-Critic framework to consider exploration strategies specific to agent-environment interactions. We define three types of exploration strategies: intrinsic exploration, extrinsic exploration, and hybrid exploration. Intrinsic exploration occurs when the agent explores directly within the action space defined by the agent's policy. Extrinsic exploration occurs when the agent explores outside of the known action space defined by the agent's policy, e.g., by interacting with the environment. Hybrid exploration involves combining both intrinsic and extrinsic exploration methods together. These strategies help the agent expand its understanding of the environment and encourage it to explore unexplored regions.

3. Deep Q-Networks with Uncertainty Estimation: We extend the traditional Deep Q-Network algorithm with a critic module that estimates uncertainties associated with each option in the action space. Critic modules output a set of predicted values representing the expected return for each option under the current policy condition. We then update the target networks to minimize the mean squared error loss between the estimated and actual return values produced by the corresponding target networks. With the addition of uncertainty estimation, the critic can identify actions with greater risk and focus exploration efforts on them.

4. Random Network Distillation: Since previous experiences are often valuable clues, we employ a technique called Random Network Distillation (RND) to transfer the knowledge learned from one model to another similar model trained on random inputs generated by the teacher model. RND trains the student model to mimic the distribution of features extracted from randomly sampled batches of experience. This reduces the dependence on stale gradients, improves generalization, and stabilizes the learning process.

5. Expert Iteration: Finally, we apply the Expert Iteration technique to teach the agent how to play complex games by giving it guidance and input from human experts. At each step, the agent observes the current state of the environment and selects an appropriate action based on the predictions made by the critic. When necessary, the agent queries the user for assistance via text-to-speech or visual cues. After each move, the agent evaluates its progress by receiving immediate feedback from the environment. If the agent fails to achieve satisfactory results, the Expert Iteration process repeats itself to hone in on suboptimal policies. If successful, the agent grows increasingly proficient at solving the assigned task.

Overall, our approach leads to significant improvements in the exploration capability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms by introducing suitable exploration strategies and techniques that exploit the unique characteristics of agent-environment interactions. The insights obtained from our study can be applied to designing better exploration mechanisms for other applications involving intelligent agents and complex environments.
