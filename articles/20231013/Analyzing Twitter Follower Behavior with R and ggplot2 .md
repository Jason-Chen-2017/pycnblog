# 1.背景介绍


Twitter是一个社交媒体平台,用户可以在其平台上分享自己的生活动态,互相交流感兴趣的话题等。通过Twitter可以了解到不同行业,各个国家的人士对某件事的态度,从而促进了社会的繁荣发展。随着社交媒体平台网站Twitter的普及,一些小型公司已经开始建立起自己的品牌,推广自己的产品和服务。但同时也带来了一个新的风险,那就是跟随者们在社交网络中的影响力。

Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or YouTube have attracted millions of users every year. It’s no surprise that Twitter is not an exception. However, it has become increasingly popular as well because of its user-friendly interface, low barrier to entry, easy sharing of content, and near constant updates. This popularity has made it a great platform for companies looking to gain traction in the marketplace. 

As more businesses use social media platforms, they are also attracting more followers, which creates several challenges: 

1. How can you identify new followers who might be interested in your brand? 
2. What kind of influencers do your followers promote your company or product towards? 
3. Can you monitor the behavior of these influencers to understand how they interact with their audience?
4. Do you need to build a personal network of potential customers by following influencers on various topics?

In this article we will analyze the behavior of Twitter followers using data from their profiles. We will answer some important questions such as:

1. Who follows whom most often? 
2. How long does it take for someone to start following another person? 
3. Which topics are people interested in?
4. Are there any factors associated with increased engagement between followers? 

To accomplish our analysis, we will be using R programming language along with the popular ggplot2 package for visualization purposes. The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into the behavior of Twitter followers and make better decisions based on those insights.


# 2. Core Concepts and Relationship

The core concepts behind analyzing Twitter follower behavior include understanding the structure of a Twitter profile, understanding followership networks, visualizing follower behavior, identifying key influencers within each network, and monitoring their engagement level with the overall community. Let's break down the steps involved in analyzing Twitter follower behavior:

## Understanding the Structure of a Twitter Profile
A Twitter profile consists of various components, including basic information about the user, bio, location, website, tweets, followers, and likes. Each of these components contains specific information about the user and can help us understand them better. For example, we may want to see if there are certain keywords or phrases commonly used by the user to describe themselves or their interests. We can also extract other relevant information such as the number of posts created per day, the average length of each post, and even the frequency of mentions of other accounts. 

## Understanding Followership Networks 
Followership networks allow us to visualize the relationships amongst different Twitter accounts. These networks show us who is following who and allows us to identify trending topics, hottest celebrities, or influential individuals within a niche industry. In order to construct a followership network, we first need to identify the central account(s) within the network. These central accounts typically serve as hubs or facilitators who are responsible for spreading out the news and connecting people together. Identifying the centermost accounts within the network helps us identify large communities whose members share similar interests. Once we have identified the central accounts, we can traverse through the network starting from each account and find the next level of connections. This process continues until all the followers of one side of the network have been added to the final list. 

## Visualizing Follower Behavior
Once we have constructed a followership network, we can begin exploring the patterns and behaviors of individual followers. One way to visualize follower behavior is to create a timeline of their activity over time. By examining the temporal dynamics of when they tweet, retweet, favorite, reply, etc., we can gain insight into what drives their engagement levels and whether they spend enough time interacting with others. Another useful tool is to plot the degree distribution of the graph, which shows us how many people are connected to each node (account). Degree distributions reveal interesting structural patterns, such as the presence of large clusters of connections across the network, or the existence of bots or spammers. Together, these metrics give us a deeper understanding of the behavior of Twitter followers and enable us to make informed business decisions.

## Identifying Key Influencers within Each Network
We can identify key influencers within each network by analyzing the patterns and interactions they exhibit. The two main types of influencers we should look for are celebrity accounts and established brands. Celebrity accounts are likely to contain high-quality content, while established brands usually present fresh ideas and perspectives. Both kinds of accounts can be valuable for marketing campaigns, but it is important to select only the right type depending on the target audience. Additionally, we may wish to pay attention to influencers who exhibit engaging behavior but don't necessarily speak for the organization itself. Finally, we may want to avoid using accounts like Verified Accounts or Business Accounts due to their reputation and authenticity.

## Monitoring Engagement Levels Within the Community
Monitoring the engagement levels of followers within the community enables us to understand how active they are within the entire ecosystem. We can measure engagement levels using various metrics such as follower count, retweet count, favorites received, and replies given. Overall, analyzing follower behavior provides us with a holistic view of the network and its members, allowing us to identify opportunities for growth and expansion.
