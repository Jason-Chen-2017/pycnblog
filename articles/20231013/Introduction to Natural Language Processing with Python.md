# 1.背景介绍


Natural language processing (NLP) refers to a subfield of artificial intelligence that is used to understand and manipulate human language in natural languages. It involves automatic speech recognition (ASR), text analysis, sentiment analysis, machine translation, topic modeling, named entity recognition, and much more. In this article, we will discuss the basics of NLP using Python libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob, etc. These libraries make it easy for developers to perform various tasks related to NLP like tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, parsing, dependency parsing, vectorization, clustering, classification, similarity measures, and summarization. 

We will also demonstrate how to use these libraries to build real world applications like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems based on user reviews. By the end of the article, you should have an understanding of the key concepts behind NLP, and be able to apply them to solve practical problems. 

Note: This article assumes that readers are familiar with basic programming principles and have some experience working with Python data structures and libraries. If you need a refresher or get stuck at any point, feel free to refer back to earlier articles or seek help from other sources. 

Let's start by importing the necessary modules and installing some libraries if they're not already installed. We'll be using the following libraries:

1. NLTK - A leading platform for building Python programs for NLP
2. spaCy - Industrial-strength library for advanced natural language processing
3. TextBlob - Simple and efficient library for processing textual data

```python
!pip install nltk==3.5
!pip install spacy
!pip install textblob
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt') # download punkt tokenizer
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') # download pos tagger
```

Now let's import the required libraries.

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from textblob import TextBlob
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
```

The first step is to tokenize the text into individual words using the `word_tokenize` function from NLTK. The second step is to remove stop words which are common English words like "the", "and", "a" etc., that do not carry significant meaning and can safely be removed without affecting the meaning of the document. Stop words may include technical terms like "algorithm," "code," "system," etc. which should not be included in our analysis since they don't add anything new to the text. Finally, we convert all words to lowercase so that we ignore their case during further processing. Here's what that code might look like:

```python
def preprocess(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    filtered = [w.lower() for w in tokens if not w.lower() in stopwords.words()]
    return''.join(filtered)
```

Next, we'll learn about the different parts of speech tags and the role they play in NLP. Parts of speech are categories of words based on their syntactic functions within a sentence. For example, noun indicates the name of something, verb indicates an action performed by someone, adjective modifies a noun, and pronoun indicates a person, place, thing, or idea being referred to. We'll be using the `pos_tag` function from NLTK to identify the POS tags for each word in the preprocessed text. Here's how we can implement this functionality:

```python
def postagging(text):
    tagged = nltk.pos_tag([preprocess(text)])[0]
    return [(t, l) for t, l in zip(tagged[::2], tagged[1::2])]
```

Finally, we'll focus on one specific task in NLP called Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER identifies important entities mentioned in the text such as persons, organizations, locations, times, products, and events. We'll be using the `spacy` library to perform NER on the preprocessed text. Here's how we can implement this functionality:

```python
def ner(text):
    doc = nlp(preprocess(text))
    return [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
```

With these three helper functions, we can now begin to explore various topics related to NLP.
