# 1.背景介绍


Conversational agents are increasingly gaining popularity due to their ability to communicate human-like language and handle a wide range of tasks such as task-oriented dialog systems, chatbots, and personal assistants (PA). However, building conversational AI that can generate engaging and coherent conversations remains challenging because of the complexity of natural language generation and understanding. To address this problem, we propose an approach called "Artificial Intelligence as Language Model" (AIoLM) that leverages recent advances in neural language modeling techniques for generating responses. In this work, we examine three key questions related to the role and limitation of word embeddings in conversational agents: 

1. What is the effectiveness of pretraining on learning human-like language? How does it compare with traditional supervised training methods?

2. Can GPT-2-style transformer models achieve high quality results despite its limited capacity for generating long sequences? Is there any tradeoff between model size, computation time, and accuracy in terms of convergence speed, perplexity, or output diversity?

3. How can we effectively train complex models like BERT, GPT-3, and T5 without relying solely on large corpora or expensive hardware resources? Will these powerful models ever be competitive with AIoLM based agents? 

We will present our findings and discuss future research directions. We hope that by addressing these important issues, conversational AI will become more robust, accurate, and capable of generating truly engaging and thoughtful conversations. 

The goal of this paper is to advance artificial intelligence research on conversational agent design using advanced techniques from deep learning and reinforcement learning, while also exploring ways to overcome the challenges faced by current models. Our technical contributions include: 

1. Introducing a new paradigm for building conversational agents where knowledge and reasoning capabilities are integrated into dialogue management through word embedding based retrieval models. This leads to improved response quality and reduces the number of required interactions with the user during conversation.

2. Proposing a novel technique called Weak Supervision for improving efficiency and reducing annotation cost when developing state-of-the-art language models for dialogue generation. By automatically predicting appropriate next sentences and masking out irrelevant parts of text, weak supervision allows us to significantly reduce the amount of labeled data needed to learn a high-quality language model.

3. Demonstrating how Transformer models trained on massive unstructured data sets such as WebText or BookCorpus can perform well in downstream generative tasks such as dialogue generation. We show that finetuning on downstream tasks alone achieves impressive performance boosts compared to other transfer approaches, even though fine-tuning requires careful hyperparameter tuning and data preparation. Moreover, we introduce two strategies for further improving generalization and computational efficiency of transformers-based models: model distillation and lightweight adapters. These techniques allow us to compress large models to small sizes and adapt them to different downstream tasks with minimal additional training data.

4. Finally, we provide insights into potential areas for future research along with a roadmap for future exploration and development. Specifically, we suggest that we should continue working towards developing better representations of language that capture the structure and semantic relationships among words, and encourage the community to pursue diverse applications of AIoT beyond conversational context.

In summary, this paper provides a systematic overview of the most significant challenges facing conversational agents and explores the latest techniques for building better models by leveraging machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques combined with neural networks. It demonstrates how modern language models have achieved impressive performance on various tasks including dialogue generation and question answering, while opening up new opportunities for research.
