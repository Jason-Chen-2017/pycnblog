# 1.背景介绍


Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence(AI), which deals with the interactions between computers and human languages for various tasks such as speech recognition, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, machine translation, etc. Within NLP, Text Generation involves generating new texts from given input sequences or sentences based on learned statistical models that capture underlying structure and syntax of natural language. In this paper, we have discussed several text generation models that are widely used for different applications, including sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model, transformer model, and GPT-2 model. We also briefly explored their advantages and limitations using benchmark datasets like Penn Treebank dataset and WikiText-103 dataset. Finally, we highlighted recent advancements in these models by presenting case studies of real-world applications where they have been applied to improve customer service support, generate personalized content, and automate chatbots. These results can be helpful for researchers and developers to design better systems and products for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Sequence-to-Sequence Model
In Seq2Seq model, an encoder processes source sentence and generates context vectors. Then, decoder takes these context vectors as inputs alongside with previous generated words/characters to predict next word/character. The hidden states of both the LSTM units are passed through a fully connected layer to produce probability distribution over output tokens. This process repeats until end of sentence token appears. During training phase, cross-entropy loss function is used to compare predicted probabilities with actual labels. At inference time, greedy decoding algorithm selects the most probable word at each step. Transformer model is another popular Seq2Seq architecture that uses multi-head attention mechanism instead of simple concatenation followed by feedforward layers to align longer sequences.
## Transformers
The basic idea behind transformers is to use self-attention instead of recurrence mechanisms like RNNs, CNNs, or LSTMs. It enables parallel processing of sequences and achieves state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks. Attention consists of multiple heads that work in parallel to focus on different parts of the input sequence to compute weighted average of features. Each head produces a set of queries, keys, and values, then applies linear transformations on them. Outputs of all the heads are concatenated and fed into a final dense layer that produces final predictions.
## GPT-2
GPT-2 model was proposed by OpenAI in February 2019 and achieved great success in zero-shot learning, completion, and dialogue generation tasks. It contains 12 layers of transformer blocks, each consisting of multi-head attention, feedforward networks, and residual connections. While it doesn't beat humans in every task, it shows impressive progress in some areas like semantic similarity and named entity recognition. Currently, it has become one of the most advanced models in NLP and serves as a benchmark against which other models are evaluated.

## Sequence-to-Sequence Model
### Encoder
The encoder module converts the input sequence into fixed length vector representation called context vector. Context vector captures important features of the input sequence, which helps the decoder to generate meaningful output efficiently. Here's how it works:

1. Embedding Layer: The first layer of the encoder creates a fixed-size embedding for each element in the vocabulary, based on pre-trained embeddings. 

2. Positional Encoding: To capture the position information of each element in the sequence, positional encoding is added. In this method, sine and cosine functions of different frequencies are used to encode the relative or absolute position of each element in the sequence. 

3. Multi-Head Attention Layers: Multiple heads are created within the same layer, allowing the network to selectively attend to different parts of the input sequence. Each head receives a copy of the encoded sequence, but only certain elements get combined together according to their weights. By doing so, each head learns to pay more attention to specific parts of the sequence while ignoring others. 

4. Feed Forward Network: Another key component of the encoder is a feed forward neural network (FFN). This FFN processes the encoded sequence further before being sent to the decoder. 

### Decoder
The decoder module generates the target sequence one word/character at a time. It starts with the start-of-sentence symbol and then iteratively predicts the next character/word based on previously generated characters/words. The decoder uses two separate subnetworks - one for predicting the next word/character given the entire decoded sequence up to that point, and the other for predicting the current word/character given just the last few generated characters/words. 

During training, the cross entropy loss is calculated between the predicted probability distributions and true labels. Greedy Decoding selects the highest probability label at each step without considering any future effects. 

During inference, beam search technique is used to find the best possible outputs from the decoder. Beam search maintains a list of k candidate hypotheses at each step, and chooses the top k ones based on their log likelihood score. The chosen hypothesis becomes the new input for the decoder, and the cycle continues until the stop-symbol appears or maximum number of steps is reached. 

## Transformers
Transformers consist of multiple stacks of identical layers. Each stack consists of three components - multi-head attention, add & norm, and feedforward network. In the beginning, the input sequence is processed through a standard embedding layer, followed by positional encodings and maskings. Afterwards, multiple identical layers are repeated, each performing a combination of attention, normalization, and feedforward operations. 

Attention is computed using query-key-value pairs obtained from the input sequence. Key, value, and query matrices are derived from the input sequence after applying weight matrices, bias, and dropout regularization. Queries come from the previous output, keys and values come from the input sequence itself. Attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the query and key matrices, then scaled by sqrt(dimension_of_query), softmaxed, and finally multiplied with the value matrix. Attention output is produced by summing up the resultant attention vectors from all the heads. Addition and normalization are performed to ensure that gradients flow smoothly across the layers and to prevent vanishing gradients. Finally, the resulting vector is fed into a feedforward network comprising of two linear layers, dropout regularization, activation functions, and residual connections.

Therefore, transformers enable efficient parallelization of computation during inference, handle long sequences well, and attain excellent performance on complex natural language processing tasks like machine translation and question answering.

## GPT-2
GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model introduced by OpenAI in March 2019. It is trained on WebText corpus containing billions of web pages and corresponding passages, covering a wide range of topics and writing styles. GPT-2 uses deep learning techniques, including attention mechanisms, gradient clipping, and dropouts, to achieve strong generalization ability even on small amounts of data. GPT-2 uses byte-pair-encoding (BPE) to tokenize and segment input sequences into subword tokens, which significantly reduces the size of the vocabulary and improves computational efficiency. The main difference between BERT and GPT-2 is that BERT is designed for NLP tasks requiring significant labeled data, while GPT-2 is designed for more general tasks and does not require extensive fine-tuning or pretraining. The input sequences are encoded using fixed-sized representations obtained by passing them through several transformer layers, similar to the encoder in the seq2seq model.

GPT-2 model can perform various types of NLP tasks, such as text classification, language modelling, and summarisation, through a single unified framework. It outperforms existing approaches on various benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art results in many tasks. However, due to its high computational complexity, it may not be suitable for very small devices or limited internet access. Additionally, the generality and flexibility of the model make it less effective than specialized models tailored towards individual tasks, making it a good choice as a benchmark.
