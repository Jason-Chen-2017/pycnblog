# 1.背景介绍


BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language model pre-trained using deep learning algorithms and large amounts of unlabelled data to learn the representations of natural language text. The embeddings generated by BERT can be used as input features for various natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, named entity recognition, etc. 

Sentence similarity refers to determining how similar two sentences are based on their meaning or intentions in context. Sentences that express the same idea or concept have high semantic similarity; while those with different meanings have low similarity. Research has shown that machine learning models can achieve good results in sentence similarity detection tasks by using representations learned by neural networks trained on large corpora of labeled examples. These methods include cosine similarity between the word embedding vectors of the two sentences being compared, as well as fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models like BERT or RoBERTa for specific use cases. However, these approaches still require manual feature engineering and may not always give satisfactory results due to factors such as noise and imbalance in training data. Therefore, there is a need for more efficient techniques that automatically extract meaningful features from raw text without relying on handcrafted features or complex pre-processing steps. 

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate an approach for calculating the similarity score between two sentences using BERT embeddings. We will first describe the key concepts behind BERT and then explain how to calculate sentence similarity scores using pre-trained BERT weights. Finally, we will discuss some limitations of current methods and suggest improvements that can make it even better.

The proposed method involves generating dense vector representations of each sentence using a pre-trained BERT model and applying a standard similarity measure such as cosine similarity or dot product distance to compare them. To ensure that the resulting similarity score reflects the degree of semantic similarity between the two sentences, we also incorporate auxiliary information related to syntax and semantics. For example, when comparing two sentences involving words related to factual statements, we might want to emphasize the importance of exact matches over partial ones because they carry higher significance than ambiguous ones. Similarly, if one sentence introduces a new idea or makes predictions about future events, while the other discusses past occurrences, we might consider adding extra weight to the similarity score in that direction to draw attention to potentially relevant details.

Overall, our goal is to develop a system that can efficiently generate useful features for automated sentence similarity detection without relying too heavily on human supervision or fine-tuning of expensive pre-trained models. By leveraging powerful neural network technologies, BERT embeddings and automatic feature extraction techniques, we hope to enable machines to quickly and accurately identify and understand the underlying meaning and intention of texts.
# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
## BERT Model Architecture:
The core architecture of BERT is an encoder-decoder transformer that consists of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and interleaved residual connections. Each layer processes a set of masked tokens through its own multi-head attention mechanism, which generates local representations of the tokens that capture both syntactic and semantic dependencies within the sentence.

To combine all these individual token representations into a single sentence representation, another layer performs a cross-attention operation between the outputs of each layer, enabling the model to focus on salient aspects of the entire sentence rather than individual tokens. This allows the model to capture the overall structure and relationships between tokens and improve the accuracy of sentence classification tasks such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and document clustering. Additionally, the dropout regularization technique helps prevent overfitting and helps stabilize the learning process during training time.



## Masked Language Modeling:
Masked language modeling is a training objective for language models where random spans of text are replaced with special symbols such as [MASK] or [RANDOM] and the model must predict the original values of the masked positions based only on the remaining context. It forces the model to learn robust representations of natural language despite being limited by small amounts of training data and provides a way to evaluate the quality of language modeling. 

BERT uses a variant of masked language modeling called "next sentence prediction". In this task, the model is given two sequences of text, separated by a special separator token. One sequence describes what is currently happening and the other describes what was said earlier but continues now. Based on this information, the model must determine whether the two sequences belong together or should be considered independent pieces of text. This type of pre-training can help improve downstream NLP tasks by encouraging the model to learn more generalizable representations across contexts and minimizing the impact of noisy labels.

## Pre-Trained Embeddings:
Pre-trained embeddings are sets of word embeddings that are trained on large datasets of text to capture patterns and common usage. They can be applied to many natural language processing tasks including sentiment analysis, question answering, named entity recognition, and text classification. When combined with fine-tuned classifiers, these embeddings provide a significant boost in performance over traditional methods, especially for smaller scale NLP problems.

BERT provides several pre-trained models, each optimized for a specific task and dataset. Each model is composed of an encoder and decoder component, along with an additional language model head that is trained on a separate corpus. The pre-trained weights can be fine-tuned on any natural language understanding task to produce accurate predictions on new data. There are four versions of BERT available – base, large, multilingual, and cased. We will be using the 'base' version for this tutorial.
