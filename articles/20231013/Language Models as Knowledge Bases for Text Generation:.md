# 1.背景介绍


Natural language processing (NLP) has become an essential tool in the modern world. One of its most important applications is text generation, which helps to create new texts based on existing texts or a prompt. The primary goal of text generation systems is to produce high-quality output that captures the essence of the input without being too repetitive or verbose. This requires advanced techniques such as long-term memory models, which have been developed over years by using large corpora of pre-processed data. However, training these deep neural networks can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and difficult to scale up. 

To address this problem, researchers proposed various knowledge bases for text generation tasks. These include statistical machine translation models, topic modeling algorithms, and graph-based representations. In this work, we focus on recent advances in the field of natural language understanding through the lens of linguistic theory and study how they relate to each other. We identify three main themes behind the success of these methods: knowledge representation, probabilistic inference, and transfer learning. We also provide an overview of some open challenges in this area and suggest future directions for research.

In summary, this review aims to guide the reader from an AI/ML perspective to understand what knowledge bases are, why they matter, and how they could be leveraged for text generation tasks. It covers four main topics - background, core concepts and relationships between them, algorithmic details with mathematical formulas, code implementation, and potential challenges and outlook. Overall, our objective is to provide insights into current developments in this field so that more effective models and tools may emerge in the near future.

## Knowledge Representation
The central idea behind knowledge representation is to represent complex information in a structured way that allows it to be easily accessed and manipulated by machines. To achieve this task, we use various techniques like semantic analysis, ontologies, and databases to model the world around us in a logical manner. Knowledge graphs help to capture multiple sources of information about entities and their relations. They allow us to store and organize vast amounts of structured data, enabling us to answer sophisticated queries in real-time. 

Some popular knowledge representation technologies include vector spaces, factbases, knowledge graphs, logic programs, and Markov random fields. All these technologies involve representing knowledge in different ways depending on the underlying requirements. For instance, vector spaces are used for clustering, classification, and similarity detection while factbases are suitable for working with sparse data. Ontology-driven approaches use formal languages to define concepts, relationships, and rules that govern the world. Logic programming is ideal for handling complex reasoning tasks while Markov random fields are commonly used for sentiment analysis.

## Probabilistic Inference
Probabilistic inference refers to the process of computing conditional probabilities given observed evidence or data. Given a set of observations X, inferences are made based on probability distributions. There are several approaches towards probabilistic inference including Bayesian inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo, hidden markov models, and expectation maximization. Each approach uses specific optimization procedures to estimate the parameters of the distribution.

Bayesian inference involves making prior beliefs about the state of the system and then updating those beliefs based on the available evidence. The likelihood function provides the probabilities of observing the data under the assumed model. The posterior distribution is computed as the product of the likelihood and the prior, giving us an updated view of the world after taking into account the observations.

Markov chain Monte Carlo involves simulating the evolution of a stochastic system, typically a Markov chain, by iteratively sampling from its states based on transition probabilities and accepting or rejecting samples according to their relative likelihoods. Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and the No-U-Turn sampler are examples of adaptive MCMC samplers.

Hidden Markov models are models where the sequence of observed events is not directly visible to the observer but instead influenced by latent variables that evolve over time. The key assumption here is that the observations only depend on the current value of the latent variable and not any earlier values. Baum-Welch algorithm is one example of an EM algorithm for HMMs.

Expectation maximization is a widely used technique for maximum-likelihood estimation of parameter vectors of probability distributions. It involves repeatedly optimizing the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameters until convergence. Variational inference is another powerful family of techniques that combine ideas from variational calculus and Bayes' rule. VAE and BERT are two prominent applications of VI in NLP.

## Transfer Learning
Transfer learning refers to the process of transferring learned features across related domains or tasks. This makes it possible to leverage expertise gained in solving one domain to solve similar problems in another domain. Typical applications include sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, both of which require extensive labeled datasets in order to train accurate models. Pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa offer significant improvements in performance compared to traditional approaches due to the availability of massive amounts of unlabeled text data. Similarly, convolutional neural networks trained on ImageNet are able to perform image classification tasks on many downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning.

This section will present detailed explanations of the three main themes of the article - knowledge representation, probabilistic inference, and transfer learning. We start by introducing all the necessary terminologies before moving on to explain the different types of knowledge representation. Then, we discuss the different types of probabilistic inference techniques and finally cover transfer learning strategies in detail.


### Knowledge Representation
One common definition of knowledge representation is "the creation of structured representations of knowledge". Despite its ambiguity, this definition fits well with the purpose of this theme. Knowledge representation involves capturing complex information in a structured way that enables it to be easily accessed and manipulated by machines. It can range from storing data in tables and documents to creating abstracted models of the world. Popular knowledge representation technologies include database schemas, RDF triples, ontologies, and entity-relation diagrams. Here's a brief summary of the importance of each type of knowledge representation technology: 

1. Database schema - Tables are a simple yet effective way to represent relational data. They enable efficient querying and manipulation of data stored in structured format.

2. RDF triples - Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standardized method for representing knowledge in triplets. RDF triples consist of subject, predicate, and object nodes that describe the relationship between resources. 

3. Ontologies - An ontology defines the classes, properties, and relationships that make up a particular domain of discourse. Ontologies are represented using specialized modeling languages like OWL or RDFS.

4. Entity-Relation Diagrams (ERD) - ERDs visualize the interconnectedness of entities and their relationships. They are useful for visualizing complex relationships and ensuring data consistency. ERDiagrams are often used to generate SQL table designs. 

All these techniques aim to capture structured representations of knowledge that can be easily processed by machines. However, there exist various limitations of these technologies that limit their effectiveness in certain scenarios. For instance, RDF triples cannot handle incomplete or uncertain data, while entity-relation diagrams do not always accurately reflect the nature of reality. Hence, it becomes critical to choose the right representation strategy based on the context of the problem at hand. 



### Probabilistic Inference
Probabilistic inference is a fundamental concept in statistics and machine learning that involves computations involving uncertainty and randomness. We use probabilistic inference techniques to build intelligent systems that make predictions, decisions, and recommendations based on the available evidence. Understanding the basics of probabilistic inference will help you gain a better understanding of the role of these techniques in building practical and effective systems. 

#### Terminology
Before we dive deeper into the technical details of probabilistic inference, let’s first clarify some basic terminologies that we need to know. Let’s call the initial state x₀, the action taken a₁, the resulting state x₁, and the next observation z₁ a sample trajectory generated by the system. 

- State - Represents the condition of the system at a point in time. States are usually described using a fixed-dimensional space known as the state space. 

- Action - Represents the change in the state caused by applying an agent. Actions are usually represented as vectors that map the old state xᵢ to the new state xⱼ. 

- Transition Model - Describes the probability distribution of the next state xⱼ given the current state xᵢ and the action performed a. Mathematically, P(xⱼ|xᵢ,a)=Pr[xᵢ,a→xⱼ] 

- Observation Model - Describes the probability distribution of the next observation zⱼ given the current state xⱼ. Mathemtically, P(zⱼ|xⱼ)=Pr[xⱼ,zⱼ] 

- Belief / Posterior Distribution - Estimated by applying Bayes Rule, Pr[xⱼ|zⱼ]=Pr[zⱼ|xⱼ]P(xⱼ)/Pr[zⱼ]. Note that the denominator term represents the marginal probability of observing the entire sequence of observations Z=Z₁…⋯Zₖ. By default, the decision-maker takes actions that maximize the expected utility under the predicted posteriors. 

- Utility Function - Determines the degree of reward obtained by performing an action. 

Now, let’s go back to the sample trajectory generated above: 

- Sample Trajectory : x₀ -> a₁ -> x₁ -> o₁ -> x₂ -> a₂ -> x₃... 

Given the initial state x₀, we can compute the probability distribution of the entire sequence x₁...xₙ as follows: 

- P(x₁,...,xₙ) = Pr[x₁]*Pr[x₂|x₁]*Pr[x₃|x₁,x₂]*...*Pr[xn−1|x₁,...,xn−2] * Pr[zn|x₁,...,xn−1] 

Note that each Pr[] expression represents the joint probability of the corresponding state and observation pair occurring together. Therefore, the total number of such joint probability expressions equals the size of the cartesian product of the state and observation spaces multiplied by the length of the sequence n. Thus, it is computationally expensive to evaluate the joint probability of a complete sequence. 

Therefore, probabilistic inference techniques attempt to approximate the true probability distribution using simpler and tractable models. Commonly used approximations include filtering, smoothing, and particle filtering. Filtering estimates the joint distribution of the entire sequence by evaluating the conditional probabilities of each state and observation pair independently and sequentially. Smoothing addresses the issue of divergence by combining the estimated probabilities from all past time steps to obtain a smooth distribution over future states. Particle filtering is a variant of filtering that explores a discrete set of particles rather than relying on exact evaluation.

The choice of the appropriate approximation method depends on the complexity and dimensionality of the state and observation spaces, the computational resources available, and the accuracy required in predicting the outcomes. In general, probabilistic inference techniques can greatly improve the robustness and scalability of AI/ML systems, especially when dealing with sequential decision-making tasks.
