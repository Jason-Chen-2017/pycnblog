DevOps (Development and Operations) refers to the collaboration between development and IT operations professionals to improve quality of software delivery, increase efficiency, reduce costs and time-to-market, automate processes, and provide continuous feedback loops with customers. In this article we will discuss about using containers in DevOps projects and why it is a great alternative for cloud native computing model. We will also provide details on how Docker can be used as a container runtime environment and briefly explore the role of containers in DevOps workflows. Finally, we will conclude by highlighting some of the advantages and disadvantages of using containers in DevOps projects. 

This article assumes that readers are familiar with both basic concepts of DevOps and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

## 2.1 DevOps
DevOps stands for Development and Operations combined together, which means it combines skills from different areas involved in software development, including engineering, testing, and deployment. The primary goal of DevOps is to build a collaborative and empathetic culture where developers work closely with operations teams throughout the software lifecycle.

In simple terms, the DevOps approach involves aligning business objectives with technology strategies, optimizing productivity, and ensuring successful outcomes while automating technical infrastructure. Within the context of software development, DevOps ensures that organizations have a robust process for delivering new features or improvements to existing ones. This includes establishing a consistent methodology for developing, testing, deploying, and monitoring applications to ensure efficient and effective production environments.

To achieve these goals, DevOps tools and practices include Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), automation, configuration management, testing frameworks, and security best practices. These enable organizations to release more frequently with higher confidence that their code works correctly.

Containers are often mentioned when discussing DevOps but they are not always used directly within the scope of CI/CD pipelines. Instead, they are typically included alongside other components such as platforms, orchestration engines, and cloud providers. Containerization helps developers to package their application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit called an image. Images can then be deployed across any platform without worrying about dependency issues because everything needed has already been packaged inside the image.

By utilizing containers, organizations can deploy applications quickly and easily across multiple platforms without needing to install complex software dependencies or worry about interdependencies between applications. Additionally, containers offer an isolated execution environment that makes them secure and resistant to vulnerabilities like those found in virtual machines. They also help save significant amounts of resources compared to traditional virtualization models since each container runs on top of a lightweight host operating system instead of emulating entire hardware systems.

Finally, one of the main benefits of adopting containers in DevOps projects is the ability to dynamically scale applications based on demand and workload. Developers can run individual instances of an application on specific servers or clusters depending on traffic levels or availability requirements. By leveraging container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes, organizations can automatically manage scalability, high availability, and resource allocation for container-based applications.

Overall, containers provide several key benefits for DevOps projects, including increased agility, simplified deployment processes, reduced operational complexity, improved security posture, and cost savings over traditional virtualization approaches. However, implementing containerization may require additional planning and effort during early stages of a project, especially if it needs to integrate with existing infrastructure and tool chains. Therefore, the use of containers should be considered carefully before being fully adopted in every organization.

## 3.1 Introduction
As stated earlier, devops deals with various aspects of software development involving development, testing, and deployment. One aspect of devops that requires special attention is the integration of containers into the pipeline. It is known that many organizations today do not solely rely on VMs, but rather use a combination of VM and container technologies. Here we will understand what are the pros and cons of using containers in the devops workflow? Also, we will look at ways to implement containerization efficiently in our devops environment. 

Before starting the implementation let us first understand few basic terminologies related to containers.

1. **Container Image**: A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, libraries, settings, and dependencies. 
2. **Container Runtime Environment**: A container runtime environment is responsible for running containers: pulling images from registries, launching containers, networking, and storage.
3. **Container Network Interface**: A container network interface connects containers to shared networks allowing them to communicate with each other.
4. **Container Orchestrator**: A container orchestrator is responsible for managing the life cycle of containers from start to finish. There are numerous options available such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, Azure Batch, Google Cloud Run and so on.

Now lets dive deep into the docker basics, so that we can better comprehend the concept of containers.

## 3.2 Docker Basics
Docker is an open-source containerization platform created by Docker Inc. Its primary purpose is to simplify and accelerate the building, shipping, and running of applications through providing a way to create lightweight, portable, self-contained environments. Docker provides a set of tools for creating, distributing, and running containers.

A container consists of a read-only template with metadata defining the creation parameters of the environment for a process. When you run a container, Docker creates a new instance of the specified image, applies the metadata changes requested, and starts executing the process defined in the image. The resulting container contains everything necessary to run the application, including code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and even user-defined settings. Containers share underlying host OS resources making them lightweight and portable.

There are two types of images - base images and child images. Base images contain only the minimum required files for a particular application to function whereas child images inherit from a parent image and add additional functionality or configuration layers. To build your own custom images, you need to define the steps required to execute the application and store them in a Dockerfile. Docker uses this file to construct an image and create a container.

A container runtime environment is responsible for running containers. Docker provides the following key capabilities as part of its container runtime environment:

1. Image Management: Docker engine manages images locally on disk or in remote repositories. You can search, pull, push, and delete images hosted on Docker Hub or any other registry.

2. Container Creation & Deployment: Docker engine allows you to create, start, stop, and restart containers using preconfigured templates. You can configure ports, volumes, and other properties for each container. You can link containers together to form multi-container applications.

3. Networking Between Containers: Docker engine supports multiple networking drivers such as Bridge, Overlay, and Macvlan. You can connect containers to the same bridge network, overlay network, or a swarm of hosts for higher availability and communication.

4. Storage Management: Docker engine integrates seamlessly with a variety of volume plugins to provide persistent data storage solutions for containers. You can create named volumes, bind mounts, or tmpfs volumes to persist data outside the container filesystem.

Now comes the interesting point! What does containerization mean for devops? Well, containerization represents a shift from the classic development and deployment workflow to a hybrid model that incorporates containerization and microservices architecture patterns. The fundamental objective behind the introduction of containerization was to enable application portability across different environments, improving flexibility and speed of development cycles. But with the advent of containerization, there arises a requirement of centralized control and management of containers which further complicates the devops landscape.

Here's a short list of factors to consider when using containers in the devops workflow:

1. Composability: Microservices architectures encourages decentralized design of services, thus enabling the development and testing of smaller units independently. Containers allow the composition of small service units to make up large applications.

2. Elasticity: Containers offer elasticity out-of-the-box meaning that you don't need to allocate physical or virtual machines beforehand. They can easily scale up or down based on the workload at hand.

3. Scaling: Increases in the number of containers can result in increases in performance due to improved resource utilization. This enables faster provisioning, deployment, and scaling times.

4. Portability: Since containers are highly portable, developers can work on their local machine, test in a sandbox environment, and deploy to production using identical artifacts.

5. Cost Saving: Containers enable the economical and flexible usage of resources reducing wastage and maintenance efforts. As fewer resources are required, businesses can afford to invest more in development and operational activities.

However, as pointed earlier, implementing containerization may require additional planning and effort during early stages of a project, especially if it needs to integrate with existing infrastructure and tool chains. Below are the steps to follow to migrate towards a hybrid model of containerization and microservices:

Step 1: Understand the ecosystem
-------------------------

The first step in migrating towards a hybrid model of containerization and microservices is understanding the current state of the ecosystem. Identify the current container strategy, application portfolio, and overall devops ecosystem. Collect data around resource utilization, performance, errors, downtime, and latency to identify bottlenecks and challenges faced.

Step 2: Plan migration
---------------------

Plan the migration phase carefully. Conduct a prioritization exercise amongst stakeholders, application owners, development teams, and operations teams to determine the order and timing of migrations. Ensure alignment and communication across various teams to avoid any delays. Establish clear expectations and track progress through metrics such as throughput, response time, error rate, uptime, and impact on revenue.

Step 3: Architecture refinement
-------------------------------

Refine the architecture by breaking down monolithic applications into smaller, independent services. Use microservices architecture pattern to address common challenges faced by enterprise-scale apps. Develop a detailed plan for refactoring and optimization of the application portfolio.

Step 4: Migrate legacy apps
---------------------------

Identify critical legacy applications and develop a plan to migrate them to a modern architecture using containerization. Align development and operations teams to ensure a smooth transition. Address backward compatibility concerns and upgrade plans accordingly. Test the migrated applications thoroughly to minimize risks and ensure maximum success.

Step 5: Optimize and monitor
------------------------------

Evaluate the effectiveness of the migration against KPIs such as end-user experience, support ticket resolution, customer satisfaction, and productivity. Continuously monitor and analyze trends, usage patterns, and bottleneck analysis reports to optimize application performance, stability, reliability, and scalability.

Conclusion
----------

Containerization offers significant benefits to the devops community but it is important to adopt a holistic approach that involves strategic planning, architecture refinement, and continuous improvement. This paper highlights the importance of containers in the devops workflow and presents a roadmap for implementing it successfully.
