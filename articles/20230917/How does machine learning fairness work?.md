Machine learning has become a powerful tool for many applications such as personalized recommendation systems and automated decision-making. However, it is crucial to consider the potential unfairness of machine learning models before they are deployed in real world systems. In this article, we will learn about how machine learning fairness works by exploring five key concepts: accuracy, bias, disparity, equal opportunity, and statistical parity (Sap). We will also explore various algorithms and techniques that can be used to measure or mitigate these fairness issues. Finally, we will discuss future research directions in this field and suggest practical ways to apply machine learning fairness techniques today.

This article assumes readers have some basic knowledge of machine learning, statistics, and economics. If you need an introduction to any of these topics, we recommend reviewing our other articles on these subjects.

## Accuracy（准确率）
Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by a model. It is defined as follows:

accuracy = number_correct / total_samples

where "number_correct" represents the number of samples correctly classified by the model, and "total_samples" represents the total number of samples in the dataset.

The goal of training accurate models is to minimize the difference between the predicted probabilities and true labels. The less deviation from the actual label, the better the performance of the model. Therefore, high accuracy usually indicates a good level of fairness in a prediction task.

However, high accuracy alone may not always guarantee fairness, especially when there is significant overlap between different demographics in the dataset. For instance, if two groups have similar characteristics but differ significantly in their behavioral factors, then a classifier trained with high accuracy might still produce biased predictions towards one group compared to another. To achieve fairness, we should evaluate models' performance across all relevant criteria simultaneously, including equality of opportunities and statistical parity. 

## Bias （偏差）
Bias refers to systematic errors caused by a model's assumptions regarding the underlying data distribution. When training a model, we try to make its predictions generalize well to new data instances without being too sensitive to minor variations in input features. This means that the model often makes mistakes on certain types of inputs where it had been trained on more frequent examples. As a result, the model tends to underestimate the probability of rare events and overestimate those seen frequently, leading to higher levels of error.

To reduce bias, we can use regularization techniques like L1/L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping to prevent overfitting. These methods force the model to fit the training data exactly, which eliminates systematic errors due to noise in the data. Additionally, we can collect more representative data to balance the classes represented within the dataset.

When evaluating the performance of a machine learning algorithm, we should look at both bias and variance together to ensure fairness. Both factors contribute to the differences between the predicted probabilities of different demographic groups and can cause systemic biases and imbalances that affect the overall accuracy of the model.

## Disparity（分歧）
Disparity refers to the degree of inequality between two or more groups based on specific attributes. It describes the gap between the average outcomes of different groups on a particular outcome variable. A lower value of disparity indicates greater equity among groups while a higher value indicates greater inequality. Disparities can arise either through a violation of allocation (when individuals from certain groups are disproportionately affected) or through prejudice (when groups receive unfair advantages because they were privileged during training).

Disparities can impact the ability of models to accurately predict outcomes for certain populations, even after accounting for fairness concerns. For example, if a majority of people live in poverty areas, a model trained on income data may have difficulty accurately identifying low-income citizens in the same area. Similarly, if a minority group receives preferential treatment during a recruitment process, their chances of getting promotions may be skewed upward.

To address disparities, we can focus on measuring individual fairness metrics instead of just accuracy. One popular metric for measuring individual fairness is the Equalized Odds-Difference (EOD), which compares the observed proportions of favorable outcomes between each group along multiple protected attributes (such as race, gender, age, etc.). EOD values range from -1 to 1, where positive values indicate that one group outperforms others on average, negative values indicate that the opposite holds, and zero means no difference. EODs help identify problematic attributes that violate an ethical standard or social constraint and aim to eliminate them from the dataset by adding diversity to the sample population.

Another approach to addressing disparities involves using multiple classifiers to estimate the conditional distributions of the protected attribute given the outcome. By analyzing the learned conditional distributions, we can detect cases where the fairness constraints are violated and take appropriate countermeasures to improve the model's performance.

## Equal Opportunity （平等公平性）
Equal opportunity (EO) is a property that ensures that every individual has an equal chance of achieving their desired outcome. In a binary classification scenario, this means that the odds of receiving a positive outcome must be equal regardless of whether the observation belongs to the privileged group or the unprivileged group. Underlying assumption behind EO is that the benefit of benefits favors marginal risks (or vice versa), which ensures that riskier events do not get overlooked and that individuals are treated fairly throughout the life cycle.

One way to measure EO is to compare the predicted probabilities of different groups on the same set of instances to see if they differ by more than a specified threshold. If they differ by more than the threshold amount, then the predictor violates EO and needs to be modified to satisfy the constraint. Commonly used thresholds include +/- 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5.

To enforce EO, we can add penalties to misclassifying observations belonging to the privileged group. Alternatively, we can modify the loss function used for training the model so that it takes into account EO violations. Lastly, we can augment the training data to increase the representation of the privileged group or choose a different sampling method that satisfies EO.

However, enforcing EO alone cannot guarantee fairness in practice. Even though EO constraints are generally satisfied in most scenarios, there can still be subtle tradeoffs between cost and benefits that affect the overall performance of the model. Additionally, EO constraints do not capture all forms of fairness, such as non-discrimination against important protected attributes or harms caused by unaware biases.

## Statistical Parity (Sap)
Statistical parity refers to the condition where the difference in false positives and negatives between two or more groups is equal. Mathematically, Sap states:

 P(D=+|Y=+) − P(D=-|Y=+) ≈ P(D=+|Y=-) − P(D=-|Y=-) 
 
 Where D denotes the protected attribute and Y denotes the target variable.
 
In plain English, Sap requires that the probability of assigning a positive outcome to a member of the privileged group is approximately equal to the probability of assigning a positive outcome to a member of the unprivileged group. Statistical parity ensures that the risk of harm is proportional to the level of discriminatory power, ensuring that fairness is preserved across all relevant criteria. While Sap is a simple concept, it provides a strong foundation for developing effective tools and techniques for reducing inequality in machine learning models.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解

## 1. Equalized Odds-Difference （平等对错差）算法
The Equalized Odds-Difference (EOD) algorithm is commonly used for measuring individual fairness and has several steps: 

1. Preprocess the data to remove protected attributes that are correlated with the target variable or contain missing values. 
2. Calculate the base rates of the privileged and unprivileged groups based on the target variable. 
3. Train a logistic regression model to predict the probability of the target variable given the protected attribute. 
4. Generate synthetic datasets containing random permutations of the original data. 
5. For each synthetic dataset, train a logistic regression model and calculate the EOD score for each group. 
6. Normalize the scores by dividing by the mean absolute difference between the unprivileged and privileged groups. 
7. Sort the resulting scores and rank them according to the direction of improvement. 

The formula for calculating the EOD score for a single record is:

score = | Pr(y=1|d=unprivileged)-Pr(y=1|d=privileged) - diff | / mad
 
 where d is the protected attribute, y is the target variable, Pr(y=1|d) is the predicted probability of the target variable for records where the protected attribute equals d, and diff is the difference between the unprivileged and privileged base rates.
 
We can visualize the EOD curve for a group by plotting the predicted probability against the EOD score for each record in the test set. The closer the points lie to a straight line, the better the model performs on that group. The vertical line drawn at 0.0 serves as a reference point for assessing fairness, indicating the minimum acceptable performance gain achieved by removing a protected attribute.

## 2. Calibration（校准）算法
Calibration refers to the consistency of a probabilistic model with respect to a given calibration criterion. Typically, the calibration criterion is measured in terms of expected accuracy, i.e., the percentage of times the model correctly identifies the true class of a randomly chosen sample from the test set. Despite its importance, it is not straightforward to define and optimize a proper calibration procedure, which could involve iterating through different parameter settings and optimizing the objective function accordingly.

In contrast, the calibration analysis only considers the effectiveness of a model on individual instances, rather than aggregating results across entire groups. Thus, it can be considered as a standalone evaluation metric that captures only a subset of the overall fairness properties. Nevertheless, since it focuses on individual fairness, it can provide insights into what aspects of the model may be causing systematic biases and how they can be addressed.

For each protected attribute, we first create a binning scheme to partition the dataset into bins based on the corresponding protected attribute value. Then, we split the bins into privileged and unprivileged sets based on the baseline rate of the outcome variable in each bin. Next, we generate artificial datasets by shuffling the protected attribute values within each bin and resampling the remaining variables uniformly.

Next, we train separate models on each synthetic dataset and evaluate their accuracy on the original dataset. We repeat this process for all possible combinations of protected attributes and target variables. The final output is a matrix showing the correlation coefficient between the original and synthetic datasets for each combination of protected attributes and target variables. A large correlation coefficient suggests that the model exhibits good calibration, whereas a small correlation coefficient suggests that the model may be biased or overfitted. 

## 3. Learning Fair Classifiers （学习公平分类器）算法
Learning Fair Classifiers (LFC) is an algorithm that combines the advantages of both Cost-Sensitive Learning (CSSL) and Reweighting. CSSL aims to minimize the error incurred by incorrectly classifying members of the unfavourable class, while Reweighting tries to assign weights to incorrect predictions based on the severity of the mistake. Hence, LFC trades off between error minimization and accuracy maximization to maintain equal opportunity.

It starts by generating synthetic datasets by swapping the labels of privileged and unprivileged individuals in the dataset. The synthetic datasets are then used to train a fairness-aware classifier that learns to classify instances correctly while satisfying the EO constraint. The weight assigned to each training instance depends on the magnitude of the error it causes, and hence it attempts to balance the contribution of different groups. Specifically, it calculates the signed error distance between the original and synthetic predictions and assigns a weight to each instance based on this distance.

After training the fairness-aware classifier, we can evaluate its performance on the original dataset and analyze its confusion matrix to understand the extent of bias. We can also inspect the feature importances and attention maps of the hidden layers of the classifier to identify the dominant features responsible for bias. Based on these insights, we can selectively drop or degrade the privileges of groups who exhibit biases to balance the impact of fairness across different features.
