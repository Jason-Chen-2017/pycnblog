Technology has come a long way since the dawn of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter in the early 2000s. With access to billions of users' personal information, they have become an essential part of our lives. However, security breaches affecting social media platforms frequently occur. People are becoming more aware of these threats and taking precautionary measures to protect their accounts from being hacked. This article will provide insights into how to identify if your social media account is compromised, what type of attacks can happen, and why it's important for us to protect ourselves against cyber-attacks on social media platforms.

## 2.1 Social Media Platforms and Social Engineering Attacks

Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., are growing rapidly and revolutionizing many aspects of our daily life. They offer amazing features that enable people to connect with each other through sharing photos, videos, text messages, likes, comments, and profiles. These platforms also allow developers to create their own applications using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provided by platform owners. The volume of data stored on these platforms makes them highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to stay vigilant about potential cyber-attacks and take necessary precautions to keep their accounts safe.

A cyber-attack or a computer crime occurs when someone attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network, either intentionally or unintentionally. Cyber-criminals use various techniques to attack social media platforms. There are several types of social engineering attacks, some of which include:

1. Phishing emails - fake websites that look like legitimate ones used to collect sensitive information such as passwords and credit card details. A phishing email contains links to malicious websites or attachments that attempt to steal financial or personal information from the recipient. Attackers use this technique to gather information like usernames and passwords of victims who might not even be aware of their existence. 

2. Smishing attacks - scam emails sent to valid recipients pretending to be from known organizations or companies. Smishing attacks exploit human behavior patterns and emotions to persuade people into providing confidential information. For example, one attacker uses the impersonation of well-known celebrities to spread rumors about stolen bank accounts, medical records, or credit cards. 

3. Spamming attacks - sending irrelevant or unwanted content via social media channels, including advertisements, junk mail, chain letters, and promotions. These spam messages contain viruses, malware, and other exploits that infect devices and steal sensitive information. Spammers regularly post inappropriate ads and invite unregistered visitors to download illicit software.

In addition to these common social engineering attacks, there are also specific types of cyber-attacks against social media platforms such as:

1. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks - launched by attackers who try to overload servers with too much traffic and make them unavailable to authorized users. DDoS attacks target multiple websites simultaneously to cause a disruption in service, resulting in website outages.

2. SQL injection attacks - manipulate queries made by web applications to retrieve or modify sensitive data, such as user names and passwords. Attackers inject harmful code directly into application databases, making it possible for attackers to bypass authentication systems or execute malicious commands.

3. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks - inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, allowing attackers to hijack sessions and execute arbitrary code. XSS attacks can lead to identity theft, data theft, or financial losses due to loss of privacy or security.

All these cyber-attacks have significant consequences on social media platforms. Vulnerabilities in user-generated content, infrastructure, and algorithms contribute to increasing the risk of cyber-attacks on these platforms. In recent years, we have witnessed increased frequency and intensity of cyber-attacks targeting social media platforms. Consequently, it is crucial for individuals to remain vigilant and continuously monitor their online activities for any suspicious activity that could indicate a breach of security.

## 2.2 Account Security Best Practices

It is critical for individuals to follow best practices while managing their social media accounts. Below are some recommended steps to ensure better account security:

1. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) - MFA involves adding an additional layer of security to your login credentials by requiring two separate factors before granting access to an account. This feature ensures that only those who truly possess both factors can log in, preventing unauthorized access and transactions.

2. Limit access permissions - limiting access permissions limits the number of people who can access your profile, thus reducing the chances of others gaining unauthorized access. This step ensures that your profile stays secure even after attackers obtain unauthorized access to your device.

3. Enable two-step verification - enabling two-step verification adds another layer of protection to your account by prompting you to enter a password generated by an authenticating app on your phone or tablet instead of just entering your plain text password. This helps to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.

4. Regularly update your profile and personal information - keeping your social media profile up-to-date with current information, education, job history, and interests help to maintain a high level of trustworthiness amongst your connections. By updating your profile regularly, you can minimize the risk of unauthorized access or fraudulent transactions.

5. Avoid using free services and apps - using free services and apps increases the chance of unauthorized access and may leave your personal information at risk. It is essential to use paid subscription plans for all your social media accounts.

6. Keep backups of your account - making periodic backups of your social media accounts is a good practice to recover lost data in case your device gets corrupted, stolen, or lost. Periodic backup saves time and effort in recovering your account should something go wrong.

7. Verify trusted sources - verifying trusted sources gives you peace of mind that your social media accounts are secure and maintained properly. Trusted sources include verified friends, family members, and co-workers. You can also search for certified reviews of social media platforms to confirm their quality and safety.

By following these best practices, you can improve your overall account security on social media platforms and avoid unnecessary risks associated with cyber-attacks.
