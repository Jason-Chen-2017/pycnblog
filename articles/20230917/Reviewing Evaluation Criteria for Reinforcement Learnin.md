Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular approach to dialogue systems as it provides an automatic way of optimizing the user's experience and maximizing the dialog system's ability to engage with users in natural language conversations. However, there are several challenges involved in designing and evaluating RL-based dialogue systems. To address these challenges, we have developed several evaluation criteria that can be used to compare different RL-based dialogue systems. In this article, we will review these evaluation criteria and propose ways to measure their effectiveness when applied to performance comparison of different RL-based dialogue systems. We also discuss potential improvements that can be made to evaluate them further or integrate them into other evaluation strategies. Finally, we provide some examples on how to apply these evaluation criteria to perform various types of analysis such as algorithmic bias detection, statistical significance testing, and causal inference analyses.

In summary, this article presents an overview of the most commonly used evaluation criteria for comparing RL-based dialogue systems along with detailed explanations on how they can be evaluated using metrics like perplexity, diversity, naturalness, coherence, novelty, engagingness, and stability. It also proposes suggestions on improving the existing criteria by integrating more complex measures that capture aspects beyond the traditional evaluation tasks and developing new ones focused on specific domains or use cases. Finally, we present some real-world examples on applying these evaluation criteria to detect algorithmic bias, estimate statistical significance, and analyze causality between system components. 

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
Before discussing details about the evaluation criteria, let us first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to reinforcement learning based dialogue systems.

## Reinforcement Learning 
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique that learns from interaction with its environment to improve its action selection strategy over time. The main idea behind reinforcement learning is to learn a mapping function between states (the current situation at any given point) and actions (the available options at each state), where rewards (feedback indicating the outcome of taking a particular action) serve as positive reinforcement and punishments (negative feedback) serve as negative reinforcement. Reinforcement learning involves solving problems through trial-and-error, which makes it ideal for problems with delayed feedback loops, continuous decision spaces, and uncertain environments.

A typical formulation of reinforcement learning problem is: Given a sequence of observations (state), the agent chooses an action, and receives a reward signal corresponding to the chosen action. At each step, the agent takes an action and receives a reward and moves to the next state. The goal of the agent is to maximize cumulative future reward. Thus, the process continues until the episode ends (i.e., all possible outcomes have been explored).

## Dialogue System
Dialogue systems are computer programs designed to converse with humans in natural language. They receive inputs from the user, generate outputs (responses) in text format, and display them to the user. Typically, dialogue systems involve natural language understanding (NLU), speech recognition/generation, and text-to-speech synthesis engines. When trained, they learn how to interact with human users, generating appropriate responses and prompts based on input queries.

The key challenges associated with building dialogue systems include data quality, knowledge representation, computational efficiency, and complexity. With the advancement of NLP techniques, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), many researchers have proposed methods to tackle these challenges. DNN-based dialogue systems usually utilize rule-based programming (RBP) or deep learning techniques to extract relevant information from conversation histories, then translate it into structured forms suitable for downstream processing. Examples of RBP systems include pattern matching algorithms and expert systems; while those based on DNNs include recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer models. 

Recently, reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing intelligent dialogue systems due to its ability to learn directly from interactions with the users. Researchers have proposed several approaches to leverage reinforcement learning frameworks for building dialogue systems, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and imitation learning. GANs rely on training two competing agents - one generator network that generates fake conversations while another discriminator network evaluates the authenticity of generated conversations - against each other during training. Imitation learning focuses on training a policy model to imitate the behavior of a demonstrator, who provides expert human demonstrations of desired behaviors. Both approaches enable dialogue systems to automatically adapt to user preferences and context changes, making them robust and capable of handling diverse scenarios and personas.


## Agent
An agent refers to the entity that interacts with the user and produces the response using reinforcement learning techniques. Depending on the implementation, an agent may consist of multiple modules or subsystems working together to accomplish a task. Some common agent components include a dialogue manager, an intent interpreter, a domain classifier, and a policy optimizer. These components work collaboratively to interpret the user's utterances and select appropriate responses, guide the conversation towards the correct topic, identify the intended purpose of the conversation, and optimize the search space for selecting the best response.

In terms of dialogue systems, an agent typically consists of three main parts: the dialogue management module, the NLG component, and the policy optimization module. The dialogue management module includes mechanisms to handle user requests, manage multi-turn conversations, and ensure proper coherency across turns. The NLG component translates the selected actions into natural-sounding sentences, leveraging pre-trained neural language models for better accuracy. Finally, the policy optimization module updates the underlying policy network parameters to learn optimal policies for achieving high reward over long periods of time.

## Environment
The environment represents the world in which the dialogue agent operates and acts in. This could range from simple simulated settings like a virtual assistant to real-world scenarios like chatbots operating within a physical setting such as a hotel booking website. An important aspect of the environment is the set of factors that influence the agent's decision-making process, such as the availability of resources, the structure of the conversation history, and the temporal dynamics of the conversation. The environment should reflect the characteristics of the user population, i.e., age, gender, education level, cultural background, etc., so that the agent can tailor its responses accordingly.

# 3. Core Algorithms & Operations
Now that we know what reinforcement learning and dialogue systems are, we can proceed to examine the core algorithms and operations involved in developing reinforcement learning-based dialogue systems. We begin by reviewing the key algorithms used in modern reinforcement learning-based dialogue systems.

## Policy Gradient Methods
Policy gradient methods are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that use stochastic gradient descent to update the weights of the underlying policy network to maximize expected returns. One of the major advantages of policy gradients lies in their ability to converge much faster than value-based methods and sample efficient exploration strategies. In general, policy gradient methods involve computing the gradient of the objective function with respect to the policy parameter vector, and updating the parameter values using a gradient ascent method. The policy parameter vectors define the distribution of actions taken by the agent at each state of the environment, and thus affect both the exploration behavior of the agent and the success rate of the learned policy. 

One of the most popular policy gradient algorithms is REINFORCE, which was proposed by Williams et al. in 1992. REINFORCE estimates the gradient of the log probability of the action taken under the current policy $\pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t)$ multiplied by the immediate reward received $r_{t+1}$ at the next timestep. The gradient estimator is computed recursively using the discounted sum of rewards starting from the final state of the episode up to the beginning. Since the gradient calculation requires sampling at every iteration, REINFORCE is computationally expensive. Other recent policy gradient algorithms like PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), A2C (Advantage Actor Critic), and DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients) aim to reduce the computational cost of REINFORCE by utilizing tricks such as importance weighting and advantage estimation.

## Natural Language Generation (NLG) Components
Natural language generation (NLG) is the process of converting high-level intentional actions into natural-sounding sentences. NLG components can play an essential role in enabling reinforcement learning-based dialogue systems to produce engaging and credible responses. There are several natural language generation techniques that can be employed in reinforcement learning-based dialogue systems, including seq2seq models, hierarchical models, and template-based models. While seq2seq models encode the entire sequence of words in a fixed-length vector, hierarchical models split the utterance into smaller units (such as phrases or fragments), and train separate models for each unit. Template-based models treat the output as a constraint on the input, allowing the model to focus on the necessary details rather than repeating the whole message. Despite their varying levels of abstraction, NLG components remain critical for ensuring that the agent produces convincing and informative responses.

## Behaviour Cloning vs Imitation Learning
Behaviour cloning is a supervised learning technique that involves feeding labeled training samples to the agent, which predicts the correct action sequences corresponding to the provided observations. Traditionally, behaviour cloning is used for small-scale tasks with easy-to-obtain training datasets, but recently, research has shown that imitation learning is able to achieve good results even in complex environments without explicit access to the underlying dataset of expert demonstrations. 

Imitation learning relies on training an agent to imitate the behavior of a demonstrator, who provides expert human demonstrations of desired behaviors. Instead of trying to solve complex tasks from scratch, the agent learns to replicate the demonstrator's actions in a safe and efficient manner. Although imitation learning is generally less sample-efficient compared to reinforcement learning, it is effective in certain situations where collecting large amounts of demonstrations would be prohibitively expensive.

Both imitation learning and behaviour cloning are central components in reinforcement learning-based dialogue systems, but they operate differently depending on the scenario and the size of the training dataset. In some cases, imitation learning alone suffices, while in others, explicitly combining the two approaches may result in improved performance. Nevertheless, it is crucial to carefully balance these techniques according to the capabilities of the agent, the size of the training dataset, and the nature of the task at hand.

# 4. Evaluation Criteria
After defining some basic concepts and identifying the key components of reinforcement learning-based dialogue systems, we can move onto specifying the evaluation criteria for assessing the performance of dialogue systems. Here are five widely used evaluation criteria:

1. Perplexity
2. Diversity
3. Naturalness
4. Coherence
5. Novelty + Engagingness

We now briefly describe these evaluation criteria below. Let us assume that our dialogue agent interacts with a single user in a simulated environment. 

 ## Perplexity
Perplexity is a measurement of how well a probabilistic model predicts the likelihood of a sentence or phrase given the observed evidence. More specifically, it captures how closely the predicted probabilities match the actual frequencies of the observed events. Intuitively, lower perplexity indicates higher confidence in the predictions.

To compute perplexity, we need to assign discrete probabilities to each possible word or phrase that might follow the prompt. Then, we can compute the cross-entropy loss between the assigned probabilities and the actual frequency counts in the corpus. Cross-entropy loss measures the difference between the predicted and true distributions, and can be calculated as follows:

$$H(p, q) = \sum_{x} p(x) \log q(x)$$

where $p$ is the target distribution (assumed to be uniform), $q$ is the predicted distribution, and $x$ is a symbol drawn from the vocabulary (word or phrase). We want to minimize the cross-entropy loss, so we take the negative logarithm of the cross-entropy. The resulting score represents the average number of bits required to describe the observation, and hence corresponds to the inverse of perplexity. For example, if the cross-entropy is 2 bits per observation, then the perplexity is equal to 4 (2^2).

However, since calculating perplexity requires assigning probabilities to each possible word or phrase that might follow the prompt, it is not always practical or accurate for evaluating dialogue systems. Furthermore, it does not consider the impact of unseen contexts or variations in style or tone. As a result, we recommend relying on alternative metrics for measuring the overall performance of dialogue systems, especially when deploying them in production.

 ## Diversity
Diversity is defined as the degree to which the generated responses cover a wide range of topics, sentiments, and perspectives. Intuitively, diverse responses make it easier for the user to find the answer they are looking for, leading to enhanced satisfaction and engagement. Diversity can be measured using various metrics such as entropy, KL-divergence, and intrinsic and extrinsic evaluators.

Entropy is a metric that quantifies the randomness or variability of the distribution of words or tokens in a given piece of text. Higher entropy indicates greater variation in the distribution. However, it cannot discriminate between semantically similar sentences with low entropy because they share the same lexical content. Therefore, we recommend relying on other evaluation criteria to disambiguate between distinctive features of high-entropy responses.

KL-divergence is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions. Specifically, it calculates the divergence between the predicted distribution $\hat{P}_{\theta}(.|s')$ and the ground truth distribution $P_{data}(.|s')$, assuming that the agent knows the true distribution $P_{data}(.|s')$. KL-divergence is often used as a proxy for measuring the similarity between two texts or embeddings. However, it does not account for the length of the sequences, which affects the relative contribution of shorter sentences to the total divergence.

Intrinsic evaluators and extrinsic evaluators are popular methods used to evaluate dialogue systems. Intrinsic evaluators attempt to capture aspects of the dialogue system itself, such as its internal consistency, factual accuracy, fluency, coherence, cohesiveness, and trustworthiness. Extrinsic evaluators use external sources of information to evaluate the dialogue system's performance, such as surveys, questionnaires, and test suites.

Given that these evaluation criteria do not capture all aspects of dialogue systems' performance, it is crucial to combine them with additional evaluation metrics and objectives, such as tradeoffs among different criteria and desirable properties.

 ## Naturalness
Naturalness refers to the readability, flow, and grammaticality of the generated responses. Intuitively, fluent and engaging responses enhance user satisfaction and engagement. Standard benchmarks for evaluating naturalness include the automatic evaluation of COMET metrics, LIWC dictionaries, and linguistic acceptability tests. However, these metrics are limited by their dependence on formal grammar rules and pragmatic principles, which may not accurately represent the nuances and social cues of language use. Therefore, we recommend using simpler manual evaluation criteria that only require judging whether the responses sound natural, readable, and engaging.

 ## Coherence
Coherence refers to the logical and syntactic relationships between the statements made by the system and the user. Intuitively, coherent and meaningful responses help users navigate complex topics effectively and efficiently. Standard benchmark corpora such as WebQuestions or CBT (Commitment Bank of Text) are commonly used to evaluate coherence. However, these benchmarks focus mainly on conceptually unrelated questions, and do not sufficiently probe the expressivity and sophistication of natural language generation models.

Therefore, we propose an extended version of the BERTScore metric that allows for fine-grained analysis of the quality of individual sentences. Using BERTScore, we can determine the similarity between pairs of generated responses and highlight any cases of unintended misalignment or incoherence. Additionally, we can rank the generated responses based on their salience or informativeness to gauge their importance to the user.

 ## Novelty + Engagingness
Novelty refers to the uniqueness of the generated responses. Intuitively, unique and original responses encourage engagement and retain interest. Standard benchmark datasets such as Ubuntu Corpus or Reddit dataset are commonly used to evaluate novelty. However, these datasets lack a rich source of high-quality conversations, limiting their utility.

Instead, we propose an ensemble of two evaluation criteria - engagingness and uniqueness - that jointly evaluate the variety and quality of the generated responses. Engagingness measures the likeliness of the response to elicit a strong emotional reaction from the user, while uniqueness measures the likelihood of the response being unexpected and uncommon. By aggregating the scores from these two criteria, we can identify the most engaging and interesting responses.

Overall, we believe that careful consideration of the right evaluation criteria is essential for developing reliable and successful dialogue systems. By using a combination of traditional and novel evaluation criteria, we can capture different facets of user satisfaction and engagement, giving rise to personalized and dynamic experiences.
