Anomaly detection is a crucial task in data mining and machine learning that aims to identify the abnormal or rare events from normal patterns of behavior. In this tutorial, we will discuss how principal component analysis (PCA) can be used for anomaly detection by identifying outliers in a dataset. We will also explain the steps involved in implementing PCA for anomaly detection and present some real world applications of it. This article assumes readers are familiar with basic concepts such as linear algebra, multivariate statistics, probability distributions, and machine learning algorithms. 

Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques. It helps us understand the relationships between variables in high dimensional datasets. By transforming our original feature space into a new space where each variable is uncorrelated, we can identify patterns that are more meaningful for prediction purposes. In order to detect anomalies using PCA, we need to first define what constitutes an anomaly. Here, we assume that an anomaly occurs when a sample deviates significantly away from the overall distribution of the dataset.

2. Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection refers to identification of abnormal patterns in data that do not conform to expected behaviors. There are several types of anomalies such as deviation from norm, failure, error, or intrusion attempts. When faced with these challenges, anomaly detection methods help organizations to gain valuable insights about their system operations, improve customer experiences, reduce costs and improve reliability. For example, credit card companies use anomaly detection techniques to identify transactions that have been hacked or other suspicious activities, while retail businesses use them to monitor inventory levels, detect fraudulent sales, and prevent cyberattacks.

The key challenge in anomaly detection is determining what defines “abnormal.” While there are many different ways to approach this problem, most commonly, anomaly detection uses statistical measures such as z-scores and decision trees. Z-scores measure the number of standard deviations an observation is away from the mean, and if it falls outside a certain threshold value, it might indicate an anomaly. Decision trees are powerful classification models that build binary trees based on features of observations and labels assigned to those observations. If an observation does not fall within the decision boundary of the tree, it could potentially be considered abnormal. However, building accurate anomaly detection models requires expertise in both statistics and machine learning.

3. PCA for Anomaly Detection
PCA stands for principal components analysis. In its simplest form, PCA involves finding the directions along which the maximum amount of variance (or information) can be captured and projecting the entire dataset onto those axes. By doing so, we can capture important features of the data without including irrelevant ones. 

To implement PCA for anomaly detection, we follow the below algorithmic steps:
1. Normalize the input data by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation.
2. Compute the covariance matrix of the normalized dataset.
3. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
4. Sort the eigenvectors based on their corresponding eigenvalues, and select k eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues to form the principal components. 
5. Use the selected principal components to project the dataset onto a lower dimensional subspace.
6. Identify any samples that lie further than a specified distance from the center of the projected dataset. These may represent anomalous data points.

After performing these steps, we should be able to identify abnormal patterns in the dataset that would otherwise go undetected.

4. Mathematical Background
Before delving into the details of PCA for anomaly detection, let’s take a look at the mathematical background required to understand it better. 

1. Mean and Variance
Mean and variance are two important descriptive statistics that describe a set of random variables. The mean is simply the average value of a set of numbers, whereas the variance represents how far a set of numbers tends to spread around its mean value. Formally, given a set of random variables $X_1,\ldots, X_n$, we define their mean $\mu$ as follows:

$$\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i $$

The variance $\sigma^2$ quantifies how much a set of numbers changes around its mean value. Given a collection of n numbers $x_1,\ldots, x_n$, we calculate the variance as follows:

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\mu)^2 $$

Note that the larger the variance, the more spread out the values are around the mean.

2. Covariance Matrix
Covariance matrix is another way to represent the relationship between multiple random variables. Consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$. The covariance between them is defined as the degree to which they tend to move together. That is, if $X$ increases by $a$ units, then $Y$ typically increases by a proportionally smaller amount $\alpha$:

$$Cov(X, Y)=\frac{\operatorname E[(X-\operatorname E[X])(Y-\operatorname E[Y])]} {\operatorname Var(X)\operatorname Var(Y)}=\alpha Cov(X, X)+\beta Cov(Y, Y)$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coefficients representing the direction of change. The covariance matrix gives us a more comprehensive picture of the correlation between multiple random variables, giving us insight into the strength and nature of their interdependence.


Now that we know about mean and variance, and covariances, let's dive deeper into the core concept behind PCA for anomaly detection.
