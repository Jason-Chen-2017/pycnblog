Cognitive Biases are human reasoning errors or misconceptions that cause individuals’ behavior and decisions to be different from how they actually think or feel. They impact a person's perception, thought process, decision making ability, attitude towards other people and organizations, their ego and self-esteem. In this article I will explain some cognitive biases which can undermine teamwork, create unhealthy work environments, and lead to employee turnover rates among others. 

There is no one single cognitive bias responsible for all the mentioned factors. Each individual has its own set of cognitive biases and it's not possible to eliminate all of them completely without extensive testing and intervention by professionals in psychology. However, there are certain types of cognitive biases which play an important role in leading to negative consequences within teams:

1) Egocentric Focus: This bias causes us to focus only on our own thoughts, ideas, emotions and impulses rather than considering the impact these thoughts have on others. It leads to a personal perspective and reduces collaboration between members as individuals don't realise the overall picture and potential consequences of their actions. 

2) Availability Heuristic: This bias believes that having access to information makes us knowledgeable about various topics better than missing out on essential details due to lack of resources. It leads to rigidity, conformism, and fixed mindsets where employees do not take criticism positively and act unilaterally against any suggestion or idea contrary to their values. 

3) Anchoring Bias: This bias refers to the tendency to settle with status quo views and ideas instead of seeking new perspectives, challenges, opportunities. Employees who suffer from anchoring bias have difficulty navigating situations and working effectively collaboratively. Anchoring bias negatively affects both the organization and the employee at hand. 

4) Social Filtering: This bias occurs when employees assume the relevance of information based on how much attention they get from various sources such as social media platforms, websites, news articles etc. Even if relevant information is provided but ignored due to filtering, employees struggle to identify the true significance of the message. 

5) Confirmation Bias: This bias occurs when individuals base their judgment on evidence presented by others regardless of whether the evidence supports their view or opposes it. When multiple pieces of evidence contradict each other, confirmation bias creates uncertainty and conflict. 

6) Guilt Freeness Bias: This bias is associated with the idea of freedom from guilt, shame and blame. Individuals who experience positive outcomes usually report feeling less guilty while those who fail experience feeling worse emotional states. The former group experiences positive feedback while the latter may feel isolated and embarrassed after facing problems. 

7) Habituation Effect: This bias involves the tendency to repeatedly repeat old tasks until they become instinctive. It leads to the accumulation of weakness, fatigue, boredom and resistance which ultimately leads to poor performance, burnout and job displacement. 

In summary, there exist several cognitive biases which contribute to the negativity effect within teams including egocentric focus, availability heuristic, anchoring bias, social filtering, confirmation bias, guilt freeness bias, habituation effect. In order to address these cognitive biases and ensure that employees' work culture is healthy and productive, companies must invest time and resources into developing effective leadership skills. More specifically, leaders should develop strategies to tackle the root causes behind these biases and create a healthy work environment that promotes teamwork and encourages diversity, inclusiveness, flexibility and tolerance across different cultures and ethnicities.
