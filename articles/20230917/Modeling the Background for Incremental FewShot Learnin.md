Few-shot learning (FSL) has received significant attention in recent years due to its widespread application in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this article, we focus on incremental few-shot learning, which refers to a type of FSL where a pre-trained model is first fine-tuned with newly labeled data without retraining the entire model from scratch, while maintaining the old knowledge representation at all times. This enables models to learn incrementally by gradually adapting their representations towards new concepts. However, how to effectively incorporate background knowledge into incremental few-shot learning remains an open question. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective way to incorporate background knowledge into incremental few-shot learning: modeling the background distribution using clustering algorithms. We then show that using our proposed approach can significantly improve performance over several baselines and datasets when compared to conventional methods. Our experimental results suggest that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and scalability.

In this work, we assume that there are two types of background knowledge available:
- One related to the target concept space (i.e., what classes should be included in each episode).
- Another related to the feature representation space (i.e., what features should be used for meta-learning).

We further assume that these two types of background knowledge can be represented by different clustering algorithms or even neural networks. Specifically, given the class labels and/or features, one could use unsupervised clustering algorithms such as K-means, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, etc. to generate the corresponding clustering assignments. Alternatively, one could also train a deep neural network based on these inputs to directly predict the cluster assignment of each example. Then, we can take advantage of this information during training by only updating the weights associated with rare categories or features that are highly dissimilar from those seen during training. 

This paper demonstrates that modeling the background distribution using clustering algorithms can significantly improve performance over traditional methods when it comes to incremental few-shot learning. Moreover, since we do not need to explicitly learn the structure of the background distribution, our method does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting problem, which makes it very practical and efficient for real-world applications. Finally, we hope that this research will inspire future researchers who aim to develop more advanced ways of modeling the background distribution for better few-shot learning.

Existing works on incremental few-shot learning typically rely heavily on pre-trained base models, which often do not have good adaptation capability for continuously evolving domains and tasks. As a result, they either require expensive domain adaptation processes or cannot maintain accurate and coherent understanding of the underlying complex relationships between classes and instances. Despite this drawback, most existing works still fall short when dealing with large scale datasets and limited computational resources. Therefore, there is a clear need for better solutions. 

One common strategy in literature is to employ distillation techniques to transfer knowledge from a larger supervised model trained on a diverse set of tasks to the incremental few-shot learner. While promising, distillation mainly focuses on transferring soft skills learned in large-scale supervision, but fails to fully capture the hard constraints embedded within the task setting itself. Besides, it may not generalize well to different settings or situations. On the other hand, some works implicitly enforce some prior knowledge through regularization terms or external losses, but they fail to fully explore the diversity of input distributions. To address these limitations, many recent papers propose novel methods to design specialized layers or modules that can flexibly model both the low-level visual appearance and high-level semantic meaning of images. However, these methods typically impose fixed structures upon the model architecture and lack flexibility in capturing multiple facets of background knowledge.  

Another direction in literature is to leverage multi-modal representations learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically RGB images and textual descriptions, as additional modality signals that could help the model efficiently learn abstract representations from a small amount of labelled examples. Although promising, these methods still struggle to bridge the gap between visual imagery and linguistic connotation, as well as embrace the uncertainty caused by imperfect supervision. Nevertheless, addressing these issues requires deeper insights into the mechanisms that underlie human perception and reasoning.

Our contribution lies in proposing a simple yet effective way to incorporate background knowledge into incremental few-shot learning, namely, modeling the background distribution using clustering algorithms. Using this approach, we can alleviate the issue of exploding number of parameters encountered in standard CNN-based models, while retaining their ability to capture powerful visual and semantic features. Moreover, we show that our proposed method achieves comparable or even slightly improved performance over several baseline models and datasets, suggesting its effectiveness. By being able to exploit the richness of background knowledge rather than relying solely on explicit input annotations, our method can enable models to learn robust and informative representations, enabling them to perform significantly better on challenging few-shot learning problems.
