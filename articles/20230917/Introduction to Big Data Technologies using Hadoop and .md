# 1.简介
  

Hadoop is one of the most popular big data technologies used by businesses around the world for processing and analyzing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is a managed service that makes it easy to run Apache Hadoop clusters in the cloud without having to manage complex infrastructure like hardware, software, or virtualization. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Hadoop and AWS EMR to process, analyze, and store massive amounts of structured and unstructured data at scale. We will also learn how these tools can help us gain valuable insights from our data, improve decision-making processes, and streamline business operations. 

In this article, we will discuss various aspects of working with Hadoop and AWS EMR including setup and configuration, core concepts such as HDFS, YARN, map reduce, Hive, Pig, Spark, Impala, and Zeppelin, integrating different data sources such as RDBMS, NoSQL databases, object storage systems, and streaming data sources, and dealing with high availability, scalability, and security concerns while running analytics on big data. By the end of the article, you should be comfortable setting up your own Hadoop cluster on AWS EMR, running distributed map-reduce jobs, accessing and querying data stored in HDFS, analyzing and visualizing data through Hive/Impala/Pig, and building real-time applications using Apache Kafka and Storm on top of Hadoop.  

# 2.背景介绍
## Hadoop
Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that provides a way to store, distribute and process large datasets across multiple nodes in a distributed computing environment. It was originally developed at Apache Software Foundation and later donated to the Apache Foundation. 

HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System and is designed to store large files across multiple nodes in a cluster. The basic idea behind HDFS is to split a file into blocks, copy those blocks to several machines in the cluster, and allow the clients to read and write the file as if it were a single entity. HDFS uses a master-slave architecture where there is a single namenode which manages the filesystem metadata and coordinates all other nodes in the cluster, and each node acts as a slave and stores a subset of the total data. This ensures fault tolerance and high availability, making HDFS ideal for storing large datasets over long periods of time.   

YARN stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator and is responsible for allocating resources to individual containers based on their priority and constraints. It maintains information about available resources, track resource usage, schedules tasks within containers, and handles failures in containers due to insufficient resources.    

Map Reduce is the primary computation engine of Hadoop and allows parallel processing of large datasets by splitting them into smaller chunks called "tasks". Each task operates on a subset of the input dataset and produces intermediate output. These outputs are then aggregated to produce final results. Map Reduce has been widely used in industry for processing large datasets, especially log data.

Hive is a SQL-like language that provides an abstraction layer on top of HDFS enabling users to query and manipulate data stored in HDFS in a relational manner. Hive uses a declarative language called HiveQL (Hive Query Language) for writing queries against data stored in HDFS. Unlike traditional database management systems, which require predefined schemas before any data can be added, Hive does not enforce schema consistency throughout the system. Instead, it relies on a type system similar to Java to handle variations in data types. 

Pig is another programming model built on top of Map Reduce that enables users to define data transformations via scripting languages instead of hardcoding them in programs. It also supports functions, variables, conditional statements, loops, and user defined functions (UDFs). While some of its features overlap with SQL, they offer more flexibility when dealing with large datasets.

Spark is another big data processing engine that offers high performance and scalability, along with APIs for Python, Scala, Java, and R. Spark's key feature is its ability to perform fast iterative algorithms on large datasets using in-memory caching and processing. Spark is particularly useful for machine learning and graph analysis applications.

Impala is yet another SQL-like language that runs directly on top of HDFS rather than being wrapped inside a container like Hive or Pig. Its main focus is speed and ease of use, but lacks many of the advanced features found in Hive and Pig. However, since it doesn't have a dedicated master node, it tends to achieve higher throughput rates compared to Pig and Hive.

Zeppelin is an interactive notebook tool built on top of HDFS, Hive, and Spark that simplifies data exploration and visualization workflows. Users can author notes consisting of paragraphs of text interleaved with code snippets that are executed sequentially and dynamically updated in real-time.


The above figure shows the various components of Hadoop ecosystem:

1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):** HDFS is the underlying storage system that allows Hadoop to store large datasets across multiple servers.
2. **Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN):** YARN manages compute resources in Hadoop clusters by allocating resources to individual containers based on their priority and constraints.
3. **Map Reduce:** Map Reduce is a distributed computing paradigm used to process large datasets in parallel across multiple nodes.
4. **Hive:** Hive is a SQL-like language that provides an abstraction layer on top of HDFS enabling users to query and manipulate data stored in HDFS in a relational manner.
5. **Pig:** Pig is a programming model built on top of Map Reduce that enables users to define data transformations via scripting languages instead of hardcoding them in programs.
6. **Spark:** Spark is another big data processing engine that offers high performance and scalability, along with APIs for Python, Scala, Java, and R.
7. **Impala:** Impala is yet another SQL-like language that runs directly on top of HDFS rather than being wrapped inside a container like Hive or Pig.
