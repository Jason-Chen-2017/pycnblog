Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for data reduction and visualization purposes. It helps us find the underlying structure of our data by transforming it into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components or directions. In this guide, we will learn how PCA works step-by-step using R programming language. We also cover common applications of PCA such as exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, image compression, and pattern recognition.

By the end of this article, you should be familiar with basic concepts and techniques related to PCA including eigenvectors, eigenvalues, covariance matrix, correlation matrix, loading scores, proportion of variance explained, and more. You should also have an understanding of how to implement PCA in R and perform various tasks like data exploration, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. With these skills, you can start applying PCA techniques on your own datasets and help identify patterns and insights hidden within them.


To begin, let's refresh some basic mathematical concepts and definitions that are involved in PCA:

1. Eigenvector and Eigenvalue
   - An eigenvector of a square matrix A is a nonzero vector x that satisfies the equation Ax = lambda*x, where lambda is a scalar value known as the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector x. 
   - The eigenvector with the highest magnitude determines the direction along which the largest amount of variation occurs in the dataset. 
   - Eigenvalues represent the relative importance or contribution of each variable to the overall variation in the dataset. 
   
2. Covariance Matrix
    - The covariance matrix C(X) measures the joint variability between all pairs of variables in the dataset X. It is calculated as follows:
    
          $$C(X) = \frac{1}{n}XX^T$$
          
        Where n is the number of observations (samples), and X is the matrix containing the observed values of the variables.
        
    - To calculate the correlation coefficients instead of covariances, we divide each element of the covariance matrix by its standard deviation. This gives us a correlation matrix R:
    
          $$R = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(X_i)}\sqrt{\text{Var}(X_j)}}\sigma_{ij}$$

        Where $\sigma_{ij}$ denotes the covariance between variables $X_i$ and $X_j$.
        
    
Now let's get started!<|im_sep|>
# 2.数据准备阶段

We will use the iris flower dataset from R library `datasets` to illustrate the basics of PCA. Before we proceed, make sure you have installed the following packages if they're not already available: 

```r
install.packages("datasets")
library(datasets)
```

## Load Dataset

Let's load the Iris dataset and store it in a dataframe object named "iris":

```r
data(iris)
head(iris) # preview first few rows of data

iris <- as.matrix(iris[, 1:4]) # select only first four columns
```

## Check Missing Values

If there are any missing values present in the data, we need to handle those before performing PCA. One way to do so is to remove any rows or columns with missing values:

```r
library(caret)
library(imputeTS)

# Remove missing values
iris <- na.omit(iris) 
```

Alternatively, we could impute the missing values using mean or median of existing values. Here's one example using median imputation:

```r
library(impute)
medianImputation <- medianImputer(iris)
iris_imputed <- apply(medianImputation@newData, 2, scale)
```

Either way, after handling missing values, we should check again to ensure no NAs exist:

```r
sum(is.na(iris)) # should return zero if no NA exists
```

## Standardize Data

The next thing we need to do is to standardize the data. This ensures that each variable has zero mean and unit variance, thus allowing for easier comparison between different variables. Here's how to do that using the `scale()` function:

```r
scaled_iris <- scale(iris)
```

# 3.PCA算法
## Step 1: Compute the sample covariance matrix ($\Sigma$)
  
The sample covariance matrix ($\Sigma$) quantifies the degree of relationship between every pair of variables in the dataset. Mathematically, it is defined as:
  
  $$\Sigma = \frac{1}{n-1}\left(\frac{1}{m}X^TX\right)$$

  where m is the number of features (variables) in the dataset and X is the matrix containing the centered observations (subtracted from their respective means). 
 
Note that we subtract the mean from the centering step because the mean may cause inflation of the variances across the dimensions. In other words, without taking into account the means, high variance would lead to large eigenvalues, which may result in incorrect interpretations about the underlying relationships between the variables.  
 
Here's how to compute the sample covariance matrix in R:

   ```r
   cov_mat <- cov(scaled_iris)
   diag(cov_mat) # returns the diagonal elements (variance) of the covariance matrix
   ```
   
  ## Step 2: Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix
  
  Once we obtain the sample covariance matrix, we can solve for its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Specifically, we want to solve for the vectors v and λ that satisfy the equation:
  
  $$Av = \lambda v$$
  
  where A is the sample covariance matrix and v is an eigenvector. The eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue corresponds to the direction along which the maximum change in the dataset is observed. 
  
  Here's how to extract the eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the covariance matrix using the `eigen()` function in R:
  
  ```r
  eigen_vals <- sort(eigen(cov_mat)$values, decreasing=TRUE)[1:k] # k is the number of dimensions we want to reduce to
  eigen_vecs <- eigen(cov_mat)$vectors[, order(eigen(cov_mat)$values, decreasing=TRUE)[1:k]]
  ```
  
  Note that `eigen_vecs` contains the right singular vectors, while `eigen_vals` contains the corresponding singular values. The inverse of the eigenvector matrix represents the rotation matrix required to rotate the original dataset onto the new basis formed by the eigenvectors. Finally, we can project the rotated dataset back onto the original space using the dot product:
  
  $$X' = V \Sigma^{-1/2}U^{'}X$$
  
  where X' is the rotated data, U is the eigenvector matrix, Σ is the diagonal matrix containing the square root of the eigenvalues, and X is the original data.
