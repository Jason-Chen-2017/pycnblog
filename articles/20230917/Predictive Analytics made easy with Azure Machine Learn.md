# 1.简介
  

Predictive analytics is one of the most important tools for data analysts and data scientists to gain insights from their datasets. Traditionally, predictive analytics have been performed using programming languages such as SAS, R or Python. However, this approach requires a strong understanding of programming, data manipulation, statistics, and mathematical modeling techniques, which can be challenging in many organizations where these skills are not commonly taught. 

Azure Machine Learning Studio provides an interactive environment that allows data analysts and data scientists to build machine learning models without any prior coding experience. It offers pre-built modules that can easily connect to different data sources, perform common machine learning tasks such as clustering, classification, regression, and forecasting, and output predictions that can be used by other applications. This article will demonstrate how to use Azure Machine Learning Studio to create predictive models quickly and efficiently. The goal is to provide beginners and experts alike with hands-on guidance on how to use this powerful tool effectively to solve complex problems related to predictive analytics.

## 2.1 Data Science and Predictive Analytics
Data science refers to the process of extracting knowledge or insights from raw data through statistical analysis, visualization, and automated decision making processes. A well-designed predictive model captures patterns within the input data and makes accurate predictions about future outcomes based on new inputs. Data analysts need to carefully consider both the goals and constraints of each project before selecting the right algorithm and model to achieve desired results. When working with large datasets, it's essential to identify patterns, relationships, and trends that may reveal valuable information for decision-making purposes.

## 2.2 Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
There are several types of machine learning algorithms: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data that includes correct outputs for certain inputs. Unsupervised learning analyzes unlabeled data, looking for patterns or clusters hidden in the data. Reinforcement learning uses feedback to improve its actions over time, similar to how animals learn to balance and adapt to changing environments. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one depends on the nature of your problem and the size of your dataset. For example, if you want to classify images into categories like "car", "dog", and "cat," you might choose a supervised learning algorithm like logistic regression because it needs labeled data. On the other hand, if you don't have labels but do want to find meaningful clusters in customer behavior data, you might try an unsupervised learning algorithm like k-means clustering.

In general, there are three main steps involved in building a predictive model using machine learning: 

1. Data preprocessing - cleaning and organizing the data so that it can be fed into the algorithm.
2. Feature selection - identifying relevant features that contribute to prediction accuracy.
3. Model selection - determining what type of algorithm to use and hyperparameters to tune.

Some popular machine learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks. All of them work by minimizing a loss function that measures the error between predicted values and actual values. Different variations of these algorithms exist with varying levels of complexity and performance, depending on the specific requirements of your problem.

## 2.3 Terminology
Here are some key terms you should familiarize yourself with when working with predictive analytics and Azure Machine Learning Studio:
### Dataset
A collection of data points that describes a particular phenomenon being studied. In predictive analytics, the dataset usually consists of multiple variables that describe a set of observations or instances. Each variable typically takes on a range of possible values or states, while each observation represents an individual entity (e.g., a person, place, transaction) or case study. Some examples of typical datasets include sales transactions, customer behavior, weather data, healthcare records, and financial records.

### Label
The outcome variable or dependent variable that we want to predict. In traditional statistics terminology, the label corresponds to the y-value or the DV. Typically, the label is binary (e.g., yes/no, true/false) or categorical (e.g., high/medium/low). If the label is continuous (e.g., age, income, price), then we use regression instead of classification. We also sometimes refer to the label as the target variable or class variable.

### Features
The independent variables or predictor variables that influence the outcome variable. These are often described by descriptive statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) or correlation coefficients. In predictive analytics, the features determine the characteristics of the data that contribute to prediction accuracy. They must also be selected carefully to avoid bias or errors caused by irrelevant factors.

### Splitting the dataset
Training the model means finding the best fit parameters that minimize the loss function given the training data. To prevent overfitting, we split our dataset into two parts: a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set serves as a verification tool after the model is trained. By comparing the predicted outcomes for test cases versus the actual outcomes, we can evaluate the model's accuracy and see how well it works on previously unseen data.

### Overfitting vs Underfitting
When fitting a model too closely to the training data, we say it suffers from overfitting. This happens when the model learns the idiosyncrasies of the training data rather than capturing the underlying pattern. Conversely, underfitting occurs when the model doesn't capture the overall structure of the data and performs poorly even on the training data. Therefore, it's crucial to monitor the performance of the model on both the training and testing sets and adjust accordingly until the model is satisfactory.
