# 2. Background introduction
The LLP is a classic reinforcement learning problem in which an agent must make it to space after lifting off from Earth on a simulated moon or martian surface. In order to succeed, the agent needs to learn to take actions that maximize its reward function. There are different types of rewards available in this problem such as sparse rewards at specific intervals during flight, continuous rewards based on the distance traveled, damage dealt, fuel consumed etc., depending upon the scenario being modeled. Each action taken by the agent in response to the environment changes the dynamics of the system, leading to new observations, and thus new states. The goal of the agent is to find a policy that maximizes its long-term expected reward given the current state of the world. 

Traditionally, reinforcement learning has been applied successfully to many complex tasks but remains one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to its high variance and non-stationarity in the underlying environments. For instance, human players of Atari games often achieve expert level playing skills despite playing against the same AI repeatedly. Similarly, RL models trained on supervised learning have shown promising performance in some complex control problems. However, none of these approaches have proven themselves competitive until now, largely because they cannot model the rich dynamics present in the real world accurately enough.

Deep reinforcement learning is emerging as a promising approach towards solving complex control problems by combining multiple layers of artificial neural networks with a technique called replay memory. This technique enables the agent to collect experience from interacting with the environment and later train its policy using those experiences. As opposed to other approaches that build separate models for each decision point, deep RL exploits the hierarchical structure of the task and learns complex policies by stacking multiple layers of neural networks that capture higher-level features from input data. In addition, it uses techniques like regularization and exploration to improve its ability to generalize and explore unexplored parts of the environment. Despite its advantages, deep RL still faces challenges when facing a wide range of real-world problems, especially in domains where full observability and strong interactivity between the agent and the environment are crucial.

Recent progress in deep reinforcement learning techniques has led to significant improvements in both sample efficiency and final policy performance. Some of the recent developments include DQN, A2C, PPO, DDPG, TRPO, and AlphaGo Zero, all of which have demonstrated impressive results in various domains, including Atari games, board games, and Go. However, there are still many open research questions regarding the optimal design and architecture of deep reinforcement learning systems for real-world applications.
