Industrialization is one of the key challenges facing mankind today. Modern manufacturing technologies have made significant improvements in productivity over the years. They are based on three pillars - automation, improved processes and new technology. However, as manufacturing becomes increasingly automated, it has become harder for workers to identify and apply creative solutions or find problem-solving skills themselves. This leads to job displacement and employee turnover, which impacts the overall competitiveness of organizations. To address this issue, researchers and technologists have proposed several solutions such as talent recruitment platforms, mentorship programs and skill development courses. However, these solutions only work if employees are willing to accept additional responsibilities outside their core job functions. One way to achieve this is through embracing industrialism as an alternative solution.

The term "industrialization" refers to the transformation of traditional industry structures into modern forms. In contrast to the use of natural resources and human labor as primary sources of energy for industries in the past, industrialization involves massive amounts of renewable energy sources like solar power and wind power. This has allowed large scale energy companies like BP, Shell, Coca Cola, GE and Coal India to enter the market and provide reliable and affordable energy services to consumers. Today's industrialized society still uses conventional practices such as land-based plantation systems for most industries but relies heavily on electricity generation to meet the demand. Manufacturing is no longer primarily a manual task. Instead, machines are used to automate various aspects of the production process.

One example of industrialized production is the introduction of steam engines. Steam engines operate by heating water vapor and using that heat to create turbine-driven combustion reaction chambers. As steam engines became cheaper, they led to a wave of new businesses such as petroleum refining plants, automobile parts manufacturers and aviation components suppliers. However, machine tools also helped improve the efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing process. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller subtasks and automating them using robotics and computer software, machines can reduce errors and increase productivity. With rapid advancements in science and technology, there is an exponential growth in the number of industries currently undergoing industrialization. These industries range from agriculture to electronics and food service. 

In summary, industrialization is the movement of modern humans and machines from non-productive to highly productive states. New technologies and innovations have allowed us to transform our lives and our planet into what we call "the information age". Companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, along with governments around the world, are leading the global industrial revolution. The future of jobs will depend on how well individuals adapt to this new reality. Educational institutions must invest in continuing education programs that foster industrialism and critical thinking abilities so that workers can thrive in the information age. In addition, employers should recognize the importance of continuous professional development for all staff members, including technical specialists, project managers, and leaders. Governments must take action to protect workers' rights and ensure that industrialized regions remain free of exploitation and pollution. Overcoming these obstacles requires a commitment from everyone involved - politicians, business executives, scientists, engineers and students alike.
