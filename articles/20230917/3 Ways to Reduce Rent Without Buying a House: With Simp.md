Renting a house is expensive and can be time-consuming and inconvenient for tenants. As such, it's not uncommon to hear advice from landlords about rental income streams that they can offer in exchange for selling their properties. These include special discounts on the rent fee, reduced rents on vacancies, seasonal rent increases or leases with shorter term terms than usual. However, these options often come at a higher cost, which makes them less effective compared to other means of reducing rent without residing in the property. In this article, we'll look into three different ways to reduce rent without buying a house using simple interest or discounted cash flows as alternatives. 

The first method involves calculating and paying off an initial amount every month towards the down payment, which serves as the security deposit. The remaining balance after the down payment represents the total rent minus any insurance premiums paid by the tenant. This allows the tenant to afford rent payments over time without having to repeatedly purchase new units until the down payment is fully paid off.

The second method involves setting up a mortgage account where the loan principal pays back each year according to fixed monthly repayments based on the current market rate. If there are no changes in the market rate due to inflation or devaluation, then the repayment schedule remains consistent throughout the lifetime of the mortgage. During periods when inflation or devaluation causes variations in the market rates, the monthly repayments adjust accordingly. By investing only one-time capital in the mortgage rather than continually redeeming mortgage notes, this method can provide a significant reduction in rent costs without increasing the risk of default or foreclosure. Additionally, since the repayment schedule doesn't depend on inflation or devaluation, it may be more suitable for families who value their home long-term.

Finally, the third method involves creating a cash flow stream with both rent and utilities included. Then, using financial modelling tools like Net Present Value (NPV), Value At Risk (VaR), and Expected Shortfall (ES), we can analyze the risks associated with different scenarios and choose the best option for our needs. 

In summary, regardless of whether you're looking to save money or avoid unnecessary expenses, taking advantage of financing solutions like mortgages, simplified rent budgets, or even economies of scale can help you save money while still enjoying your rental experience. Consider all available options before committing to a specific plan and take care to protect your assets and carefully monitor financial wellbeing during times of crisis. Do yourself a favor and consider sharing some of your insights with others!

# 2.Concepts and Terminology
## Down Payment
A down payment is the minimum amount required to secure ownership of a home. It usually includes mortgage insurance, title insurance, maintenance and repair costs, taxes, and stamp duty. When applying for a mortgage, most lenders require at least $25,000 in down payment to cover various legal fees and penalties. The down payment helps ensure that the borrower has adequate funding for the full purchase price, including any potential tax consequences. 

After making the down payment, the remaining balance represents the total rent minus any insurance premiums paid by the tenant. The down payment acts as a safety net for the tenant so that they don't have to continuously borrow against their credit card balance. Instead, they can make small rent payments over time until they've completely paid off the down payment. The down payment ensures that the tenant remains comfortable in the property while also allowing them to afford rent at a comfortable level.

## Mortgage Account
A mortgage account is a type of savings account that investors use to store their money while waiting for a mortgage loan to be paid off. In essence, a mortgage account functions much like a personal loan—it provides an opportunity to borrow money at a lower interest rate than traditional loans, but with fewer restrictions. Investors typically keep their mortgage accounts open for a period of five years or more, although some institutions allow accounts to be held longer if needed.

When an investor opens a mortgage account, they must specify what kind of mortgage they want to take out, how much they want to borrow, and for how long they will need the money. After filling out the application, the bank review the details and contact the lender to start the process of obtaining the mortgage. Once the loan is secured, the lender agrees to periodically make repayments based on predetermined schedules and the investor's monthly contributions. Since the repayment schedule never changes, the investor knows exactly how much they will earn and can make better investment decisions.

By keeping track of the loan balances and changing the monthly contributions based on inflation or devaluation, the mortgage account effectively addresses the challenges faced by those trying to grow their businesses through short-term capital gains. Overall, the benefits of investing in a mortgage account far outweigh the potential risks involved in the event of a default or liquidation.

## Mortgage Repayment Schedule 
The mortgage repayment schedule refers to the regular payments made by the lender to the investor on a regular basis. While many mortgage agreements state a pre-determined number and frequency of repayments per year, the actual repayment schedule varies depending on factors such as the market conditions and whether the borrower qualifies for early repayment credits.

For example, if the borrower earns little additional income beyond the original mortgage payment, the lender may decide to increase the repayment frequency to ease burdens on the borrower’s credit history. Alternatively, if the market falls significantly, the borrower may receive a reduced interest rate, reducing their payment obligations to meet the minimum payment requirement. All of this information is provided by the lender upon signing the mortgage contract and can change several times throughout the course of the mortgage.

In order to maintain the integrity of the mortgage agreement, the investor should always follow the scheduled repayment schedule set by the lender. If any delays occur, the investor should seek assistance from a qualified professional to identify and resolve the issue. Equally important, the investor should understand that late payments can negatively impact the equity and value of his portfolio. Therefore, he should act with caution when planning for future purchases.

## Financial Modelling Tools
Financial modelling tools are used to estimate the possible outcomes of different scenarios under different assumptions. They provide valuable insight into the effects of varying economic events, such as inflation, market crashes, and macroeconomic shocks, on a range of financial metrics, including the risk of financial distress, expected return, and probabilistic forecasts.

Some common financial modelling tools include Net Present Value (NPV), Value At Risk (VaR), and Expected Shortfall (ES). NPV calculates the present value of an entire project based on the present values of its constituent parts, accounting for both cash flows and accrued interests. VaR stands for Value at Risk and measures the maximum loss that could occur given a specified probability of occurrence within a certain time frame. ES measures the worst case scenario where losses exceed the expected profitability, representing the maximum loss in the event of a natural disaster or a sudden decrease in demand.

To apply these tools, the analyst needs to input data related to the project's financials and predictive factors such as inflation, volatility, uncertainty, and growth. Based on the results, the analyst can determine the optimal choice between different financial models, such as fixed mortgage repayments or low-cost high-yield bonds.
