TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) or Decision Matrix method is a multi-criteria decision analysis method that compares each alternative against all other alternatives and ranks them based on how well they meet the criteria. In this paper we will focus on its application in Business Analytics industry. 

The TOPSIS technique was introduced as an AI language model for efficient ranking of decision making process. The concept of TOPSIS has been applied in various domains such as medicine, marketing, finance, engineering and more recently healthcare sector. It can also be used for project planning, sales promotion, product selection, resource allocation and inventory management among others.

In the field of businesses, TOPSIS plays a crucial role in ranking different products, services, companies, projects etc., according to their performance metrics like revenue, profit, customer satisfaction, quality etc. We can use TOPSIS to analyze customer feedbacks, identify top performers from different segments, rank the best performing options during market research and make better strategic decisions accordingly. 


# 2. Basic Concepts/Terms

1. Objective function:
A measure representing the tradeoff between two conflicting goals. In TOPSIS, it represents the degree of importance given to one criterion over another when comparing two solutions. The objective function value ranges from −infinity to +infinity. 

2. Alternatives:
The set of items to which comparison is being made using objectives. In TOPSIS, these are called “alternatives” or “objects”. There could be multiple alternatives depending upon the problem statement. Each alternative should have a numeric score or weight assigned to each criterion under consideration.

3. Criteria: 
Factors affecting the alternatives’ performance. These represent the attributes we want our system to consider while making decisions. Each criterion has a unique impact on the overall performance measurement, thereby leading to different ranking outcomes. 

4. Pareto Frontier:
The subset of solutions that dominate or outperform every other solution. In TOPSIS, it shows us where all the non-dominated solutions lie along the decision space. A solution is said to be non-dominated if none of its attributes are better than those of any other solution within the same front. Hence, if a solution lies at the extreme corner of the pareto frontier, then it cannot be improved further without compromising some attribute values of the dominated solutions. 

5. Performance Measurement: 
A quantitative measure of the effectiveness of the chosen alternative. This determines whether one alternative meets the criteria better than the other. For example, if the goal is to maximize profits, we would compare the performance of alternatives based on their gross profit margin. If the metric is not easily measurable, it can be converted into a quantitative measure through statistical techniques like z-score normalization, min-max scaling or standardization.  


# 3. Core Algorithm and Operation Steps

We need to follow the following steps to implement TOPSIS technique:

1. Define the criteria weights: Assign weights equal to 1 to each criterion in proportion to its significance in terms of the decision variable. For example, assign higher weights to criteria that are highly critical in achieving the highest level of success. 

2. Calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix: Compute the ratio of each alternative's value to the ideal alternative, multiplied by the corresponding criterion weight. Normalize the resulting values across the entire decision matrix so that the range is from zero to one.

3. Determine the ideal alternative: Find the alternative whose expected performance is closest to the maximum possible performance, i.e., the alternative with the lowest total weighted normalized performance difference to all other alternatives.

4. Compare alternatives: Rank the alternatives according to their relative closeness to the ideal alternative. First, calculate the distance of each alternative from the ideal alternative, which can be done by subtracting the weighted normalized performance of the alternative from the weighted normalized performance of the ideal alternative. Second, normalize the distances across the entire decision matrix. Third, sort the alternatives based on their normalized distance from the ideal alternative.

5. Implement trade-offs: Modify the decision matrix by considering the trade-offs between different criteria instead of strictly adhering to single criterion optimization. Apply appropriate penalties or discounts to poorly performing alternatives, increasing their importance in subsequent iterations. 

The final step is to apply necessary pruning procedures to remove unwanted or suboptimal solutions, leaving only the optimal ones remaining. The optimality can be measured using several measures like fitness, efficiency, and feasibility. 

To summarize, the core algorithm works as follows: first, we define the criteria weights; second, we compute the weighted normalized decision matrix, where each cell contains the ratio of the alternative's value to the ideal alternative, multiplied by the corresponding criterion weight; third, we determine the ideal alternative, and finally, we compare the alternatives based on their relative closeness to the ideal alternative, after applying necessary pruning procedures to eliminate unwanted or suboptimal solutions.
