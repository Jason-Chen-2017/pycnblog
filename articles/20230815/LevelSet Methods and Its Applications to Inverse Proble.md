Level-set methods are a class of numerical methods for solving partial differential equations that solve problems with smooth solutions on some region within an underlying domain. They have gained increasing attention in recent years because they can efficiently find solutions to inverse problems arising in various fields such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, biology, and geophysics. 

Inverse problems refer to those problems where one is interested in finding unknown quantities that satisfy certain constraints or relationships while trying to approximate known information about the system being solved. The level set method is widely used to solve inverse problems involving diffusion equations, which occur naturally in many applications such as computational finance, oil and gas exploration, weather forecasting, epidemiology, traffic flow optimization, etc. In this article, we will briefly introduce level-set methods and their application to inverse problems in finance. We start by reviewing basic concepts related to level sets and then explain how they work for approximating solutions of diffusion equation based inverse problems. Finally, we provide some examples to illustrate the usage of level-set methods in finance.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
## 2.1 Finite Element Method
Finite elements are a collection of polynomial functions that share common nodes and form a mesh over an underlying domain. These polynomials are often chosen so that each function satisfies continuity conditions across boundaries between different regions of the domain. A finite element analysis involves defining the geometry of the domain, selecting the degrees of freedom at the mesh points, applying boundary conditions, integrating the material properties along the boundaries to obtain element stiffness matrices, and finally solving linear systems corresponding to the element forces obtained from the given boundary conditions and displacements of the DOFs. The resulting field or quantity of interest is typically represented as a series of nodal values determined by evaluating the FE solution at specific locations within the domain.

In three dimensions, a standard line integral formula called the divergence theorem gives us the expression for computing the spatial derivative of a scalar field $\phi$ across a surface $S$:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla \cdot \phi = \int_A \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}\ dA 
\end{equation}
where $n$ denotes the outward unit normal vector to the surface $S$. This formula applies even if the surface itself has curvature or non-planar topology. 

We use the finite element method to numerically approximate the solution of diffusion equations in two dimensions. Specifically, let $f(x,y)$ represent the source term, $\nu(\xi,\eta)=\nu$ be the diffusivity function, and $\Omega=(0,l)\times(0,w)$ be the rectangular domain with boundaries at $(0,0)$,$(l,0)$,$(l,w)$,$(0,w)$. We assume that the source term does not depend explicitly on time, and hence we only consider stationary solutions of the PDE. Let $u=\phi+\beta$, where $\phi(x,y)$ represents the concentration of some species, and $\beta(x,y)$ is a small parameter that ensures positivity of the solution. Then, the diffusion equation reads:

$$\begin{aligned}
	-\Delta u &= f\\ 
	& \quad \text{(Convection)} \\  
	u(x,y) &\geq 0 & \quad \text{(Boundary condition)}  
\end{aligned}$$

Here, $\Delta$ refers to the Laplace operator acting on the space of continuous functions. If we discretize the domain into a grid of elements with vertices $(x_i, y_j), i=1,2,...,N+1$, $j=1,2,...,M+1$, and $K_{ij}$ be the stiffness matrix associated with the $i$-th node and $j$-th element, respectively, then we have:

$$\begin{aligned}
	-\sum_{i,j} K_{ij}\left[\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}(x_i,y_j)+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}(x_i,y_j)\right] &= \frac{\partial}{\partial t} f + \sum_{k} N_k f_k \\ 
	u_{ij} &= u(x_i,y_j) \\ 
	u_{ij} &= \sum_{kl} N_{ik} u_{kl}\\ 
	N_{ij}=|\hat{r}_i \cdot \hat{r}_j|^{p/2} &\quad \forall k=1,2 \\ 
	\alpha_{ij} &= |\hat{r}_{ij}|^{p/2}, \quad r_{ij} := \left\{x_i-x_j,y_i-y_j\right\} \\ 
	L_{ijkl} &= \frac{\alpha_{il} \alpha_{jk}}{4\pi\varepsilon}\left[1-\cos\theta_{ij}\right], \quad \theta_{ij} = \arccos\left(\frac{|u_i - u_j|}{2||u_i|+||u_j||}\right)\\ 
	K_{ij} &= L_{ijkl} M_{kl}, \quad M_{kl} = \frac{1}{h_k h_l}\left(\begin{matrix}-1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{matrix}\right)^2
\end{aligned}$$

where $t$ denotes time, $u_k$ denotes the value of the $k$-th component of the solution at the $i$-th node, $N_k$ is a test function defined on the boundary of the domain, and $f_k$ is the value of the force applied to the right side of the domain. Here, $p$ is the order of accuracy of approximation, and $h_k$ is the distance between the $i$-th node and any point on the boundary $N_k$. For simplicity, we assume $p=1$ and take $\alpha_{ij}=1$ throughout. Note that we also need to apply Dirichlet boundary conditions when solving the linear system corresponding to the FE solution.

Now, we move on to the development of algorithms for solving the above system using finite element method. The most commonly used algorithm for solving the diffusion equation is the Gauss-Seidel iterative scheme, which alternates between the assembly of stiffness matrices and computation of the load vector until convergence is achieved. At each iteration, we compute the new value of the solution by interpolating the previous solution from the neighboring grid points. It is important to note that the choice of the interpolation function depends on the degree of approximation and the characteristics of the problem being solved. Several choices are possible, including piecewise constant, second-order bilinear, and higher-order quadratic functions. However, the optimal choice should be made based on the local geometry of the domain and the desired accuracy of the solution.

One of the key features of the level-set method is its ability to adaptively control the size of the subdomains containing high gradients and to focus the search process on these areas for efficient solution discovery. To achieve this, we define an appropriate energy functional that measures the amount of information needed to determine whether a subdomain contains a minimum or maximum of the solution. Common choices include the Hausdorff distance, the absolute difference, and the square of the absolute difference. Depending on the nature of the problem, we may also choose to limit the area of searching to a smaller subset of the entire domain or employ a multi-resolution approach that coarsens the solution gradually according to the progressive decrease in the resolution required to find the solution accurately enough.

Another important feature of level-set methods is their robustness to noise and oscillations present in real-world data. One way to handle these issues is to regularize the objective function during the optimization process to suppress spurious local minima or maxima caused by noisy measurements or unstable dynamics. Another approach is to employ adaptive sampling strategies that identify regions of interest and randomly sample them multiple times before starting the optimization procedure. By doing so, the level set method can avoid getting stuck in low-quality regions and escape local minima or saddle points closer to the global optimum.



# 3. Mathematical Formulation and Operation Steps of Level-Set Methods in Finance
## 3.1 Introduction of Diffusion Equation Based Inverse Problem
To begin with, we need to recall the definition of the diffusion equation and its solution. Given a variable $c(x,t)$ satisfying the following PDE,

$$\begin{cases}
	\dfrac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \mu \dfrac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2} + \nu \dfrac{\partial^2 c}{\partial y^2} \\ 
	c(x,t=0) = I(x) &\text{ (initial condition)} \\ 
	c(x,t>0) &\leq C(x) &\text{ (boundary condition)}\end{cases}$$

with $\mu$, $\nu$ constants representing the diffusivities in the $x$ and $y$ directions, $I(x)$ represents the initial distribution of the variable $c$, and $C(x)$ represents the upper bound constraint on the variable $c$ on the exterior of the domain. The left hand side describes the temporal evolution of the variable, whereas the right hand side captures the physical interactions between the variable and its surroundings. The solution to the diffusion equation is usually obtained by integration of the left-hand side over the spatial domain, subject to the boundary and initial conditions. The general solution of the diffusion equation is characterized by the macroscopic behavior of the density $c$ and follows the Sod shock wave propagation model:

$$\begin{aligned}
	c(x,t) &= R(t)(1-e^{-R(t)}) e^{\nu \frac{\sqrt{t/\mu}}{2} (D_x(x)+D_y(x))} \\ 
	D_x(x) &= \int_0^x dx' \dfrac{u(x')}{\sqrt{u(x')}+1} \\ 
	D_y(x) &= \int_0^\infty dy'\ dfrac{u(y'+\exp(-\lambda)|x-y'|)}{\sqrt{u(y'+\exp(-\lambda)|x-y'|)^2+1}}, \quad \lambda>0, |x|>a \\ 
	R(t) &= \frac{1}{\kappa_\rho t} \log \left[\frac{\kappa_{\epsilon} - \kappa_{\rho} t}{\kappa_{\rho}}\right]^{-1} \\ 
	u(x) &= \max\{0,ax-x\}\quad \text{ (Heaviside step function)}\end{aligned}$$

where $R(t)$ is the growth rate of the population, $\kappa_{\rho}$, $\kappa_{\epsilon}$ are parameters that control the strength of population fluctuation and carry capacity, respectively, and $a$ is a scaling factor that determines the location of the inflection point of the logarithmic growth curve near the origin. Solving the diffusion equation provides a mean-field theory that provides an understanding of the structure and dynamics of the system under investigation. However, in many scenarios, especially in finance, there are multiple factors influencing the behavior of the stock prices, which makes traditional ODE models inadequate for describing the exact dynamics of the market variables. Therefore, various inverse problems related to the stock price movement have been proposed recently.

Therefore, in the next section, we will describe the level-set method for approximating the solution of the diffusion equation based inverse problem in finance.
