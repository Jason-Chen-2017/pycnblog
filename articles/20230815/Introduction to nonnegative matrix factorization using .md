Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. It allows us to extract meaningful features from complex datasets such as images or videos by combining them into a smaller number of components that can be interpreted as concepts or categories. NMF has many applications including:

1. Data compression: With the help of NMF we can compress large volumes of unstructured data into a smaller set of variables while preserving most of its structure. This leads to significant savings in storage space and computational resources. 

2. Image and Video Analysis: We can use NMF to decompose complex visual stimuli into semantically meaningful patterns that capture important aspects of the content. This helps researchers and practitioners gain insights into the content and identify underlying themes, events, and structures within the visual stimuli.

3. Gene Expression Data Analysis: In bioinformatics, we often have high-dimensional gene expression matrices where each row represents a different sample and each column represents a different gene. Nonnegative matrix factorization provides a way to reduce this complexity and discover interpretable patterns that are associated with various cell types and diseases.

In recent years, there has been a surge in interest in applying neural networks to image analysis tasks due to their ability to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately. The increasing availability of labeled datasets, the growing field of computer vision, and the advent of efficient deep learning libraries make it essential for anyone working in these fields to develop expertise in both machine learning and computer vision. Deep Learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Autoencoders can achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain tasks in Computer Vision. Despite this progress, implementing NMF algorithms using deep learning remains challenging as they require specialized tools, advanced mathematics, and careful design choices that may not be readily apparent when starting out. 

To bridge this gap, I propose an approach called “Deep NMF” that combines ideas from deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction to apply NMF to complex multidimensional signals such as images and videos. Specifically, I will describe how to implement Deep NMF using PyTorch library and explain key decisions involved in building the model. Finally, I demonstrate the effectiveness of Deep NMF on two real world examples — Compressing color images using NMF and Analyzing facial expressions using RNNs built over video frames.  

This article assumes readers have some background knowledge of linear algebra, probability theory, deep learning, and Python programming language. If you do not have any experience in any of these topics, please take your time to familiarize yourself with these concepts before proceeding further. It also requires readers to have basic understanding of image processing and computer graphics principles to get a better grasp on the motivations behind Deep NMF. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before moving ahead with our discussion, let’s define some useful terms used throughout the article. These include:

* **Nonnegative**: Mathematically, nonnegative means that all elements of a vector are greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, all coefficients of the mathematical equation must belong to the positive reals. In practice, nonnegativity constraint ensures that the output of the NMF algorithm does not contain negative values which could potentially violate assumptions made during optimization.

* **Matrix Decomposition**: A matrix decomposition refers to the separation of a larger matrix into several submatrices of lower rank. Here, the input matrix $X$ is split into three submatrices - $W$, $\hat{H}$, and $Y$. The dimensions of these submatrices depend upon the choice of $k$ and the specific implementation of the algorithm. Commonly used methods for matrix decomposition are SVD, CUR, and EVD. In this paper, we focus on using the nonnegative matrix factorization method to perform matrix decomposition.

* **Factorization**: A factorization refers to the breaking down of one object or variable into simpler factors or components. For example, if we want to represent a human being as a combination of height, weight, age, education level etc., then this representation can be considered a factorization of the human being into its constituent parts. Similarly, a matrix can be factored into its constituent singular vectors and eigenvalues. 

* **Latent Variables**: Latent variables refer to hidden factors present in a dataset but not directly observed. They serve as auxiliary information needed for performing tasks such as clustering or classification. Latent variables play a crucial role in solving numerous problems in various areas of science and technology. The discovery of latent variables is an active area of research in machine learning. In this paper, we use latent variables to model user preferences based on historical ratings given by users to items in movie rating systems.

* **Tensor**: A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions. A scalar quantity represented by a tensor would be denoted as $(\mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times n_2 \times... \times n_d})_{i_1 i_2... i_d}$. Tensors allow us to manipulate and analyze complex multi-dimensional data at multiple scales. Tensors are commonly encountered in natural sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Examples include electric potential tensors, electromagnetic field tensors, and magnetic resonance imaging tensors.

* **Visualization**: Visualization refers to the transformation of raw data into graphical form for easy interpretation and understanding. Visualizing large dimensional data sets requires special attention since humans cannot perceive more than three dimensions effectively. However, modern data generation technologies such as Big Data lead to the emergence of novel ways of analyzing, understanding, and visualizing big data. The goal of this section is to give a brief introduction to the topic of data visualization.
