## 3.1 Apache Spark
Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It is designed for low latency, fault tolerant computing, supports various languages including Java, Scala, Python, and R, and has libraries for machine learning, graph processing, and stream processing. Apache Spark is often referred to as "the swiss army knife" of Big Data because it enables developers to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, parallelizable components.

Spark Core API consists of three main components:

1. The Spark Context which allows application programmers to interact with Spark.
2. The Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) which is a fault-tolerant collection of elements partitioned across different nodes in a cluster.
3. The DataFrame API which offers higher level abstractions over RDDs.

The rest of the Spark API includes SQL for querying structured data, MLlib for building machine learning models, GraphX for performing graph computations, and Streaming for handling real-time streaming data.



## 3.2 Spark Context
The Spark context represents the connection between the driver program and the Spark cluster. When your program runs, it creates a SparkContext object which tells Spark how to access a cluster. A SparkContext can be created either manually or automatically through a cluster manager like YARN or Standalone mode. 

Once a SparkContext is created, we can create RDDs from various sources like text files, HDFS, Cassandra tables, and others. We can then apply transformations and actions to these RDDs to perform computation. There are two types of operations - transformations and actions. Transformations return new RDDs while actions trigger computation and produce a result on the driver node. For example, map() transformation returns a new RDD after applying a function to each element of the original RDD, groupByKey() action groups values together based on their keys. Here's an illustration of how transformations and actions work:


In addition to these core components, there are several additional important capabilities provided by Spark:

1. Fault Tolerance: In case of node failures, Spark automatically re-launches failed tasks on other nodes in the cluster. 
2. Dynamic Scaling: Spark can scale dynamically up or down depending on workload, so you don't need to worry about managing clusters yourself. You can run arbitrary code on all worker nodes without any configuration changes.
3. SparkSQL: A SQL interface for interacting with structured data stored in RDDs. You can read data from external databases like MySQL or Hive and query them using SQL commands.
4. MLLib: A library for building scalable machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and collaborative filtering.
5. GraphX: A library for performing graph computations on large graphs with millions of vertices and edges.

# 4.分析开源数据集
Before diving deeper into Apache Spark's capabilities, let's take a look at some public datasets and analyze them. Let's start with one of the most commonly used datasets - Wikipedia pageviews dataset. The dataset contains daily pageviews for different articles on English Wikipedia between January 2015 and June 2016. Each row in the dataset represents one day and contains information about the number of views for different articles. Our goal is to identify patterns in the data and develop an algorithm to predict future pageviews.

Firstly, let's load the dataset into memory using Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("pageviews.csv")
```

Let's print the first few rows of the dataframe:

```python
print(df.head())
```

This should output something similar to:

|    |   year | month |         date |   totalviews |   article1 |... | articlenu |   user1 |... | useru |
|---:|-------:|------:|:------------|-------------:|-----------:|----:|----------:|--------:|----:|------:|
|  0 |   2015 |     1 | 2015-01-01 |         7826 |          2 | nan |        nan |    7826 | nan |    14 |
|  1 |   2015 |     1 | 2015-01-02 |        10569 |          2 | nan |        nan |   10569 | nan |    14 |
|  2 |   2015 |     1 | 2015-01-03 |        10257 |          1 | nan |        nan |   10257 | nan |    14 |
|  3 |   2015 |     1 | 2015-01-04 |         9314 |          1 | nan |        nan |    9314 | nan |    14 |
|  4 |   2015 |     1 | 2015-01-05 |        12254 |          2 | nan |        nan |   12254 | nan |    14 |

The dataset contains many columns, but we only need a subset of them for our analysis. Specifically, we want to focus on `date` and `totalviews`. These columns contain the timestamp of each day and the cumulative count of pageviews for all articles during that day. To extract specific columns from a dataframe, we can simply select them using square brackets.

Next, we'll visualize the dataset using matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(df["date"], df["totalviews"])
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Total Views")
plt.title("Pageviews over Time")
plt.show()
```

This will plot a line chart showing the cumulative count of pageviews per day:


We can see that the counts tend to increase linearly over time. However, we notice that there seems to be a large spike around October 2015. Is there anything unusual going on?

To answer this question, we can inspect more closely the data before October 2015. One way to do this is to filter out the data from October 2015 and split the remaining data into training and testing sets. Then we can train a simple linear model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

Here's an implementation of this approach:

```python
train_end_date = "2015-10-31"
test_start_date = "2015-11-01"

train_df = df[df['date'] < train_end_date]
test_df = df[(df['date'] >= test_start_date)]

x_train = list(range(len(train_df)))
y_train = train_df['totalviews'].tolist()

x_test = list(range(len(train_df), len(train_df)+len(test_df)))
y_test = test_df['totalviews'].tolist()

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(x_train.reshape(-1, 1), y_train)

y_pred = regressor.predict(x_test.reshape(-1, 1))

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("R^2:", r2)
```

Note that we've imported the `LinearRegression` class from scikit-learn for our linear model. After splitting the data, we initialize a linear model instance and fit it to the training data. Finally, we make predictions on the test data and calculate the coefficient of determination (`R^2`) to measure the quality of our model. Since `R^2` is close to 1, indicating a good fit, we conclude that there is nothing special happening around October 2015.
