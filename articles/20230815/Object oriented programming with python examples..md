## 1.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
In object-oriented programming, we create objects that have their own data and methods for performing operations on the data. The key idea behind OOP is to encapsulate data and code into individual entities called classes. These classes define a blueprint of an object's properties and behavior. 

Objects interact with each other by sending messages or invoking methods. A method is essentially a function that belongs to a class but can only be invoked on instances of that class. In this way, OOP helps in creating reusable and extensible code. OOP also promotes modularity, which means breaking down large programs into smaller manageable parts.

Python supports several forms of object-oriented programming including:

1. Class-based programming: This involves defining a new class using the `class` keyword followed by its name and parent classes. Methods are defined within the class block and instance variables are declared outside it using the `__init__()` method. Classes support inheritance where subclasses inherit all the attributes and behaviors from their parents while being able to add more functionality.

2. Procedural programming: It is based on the concept of procedures that take input arguments and return output values. Functions are used to group related statements together. Python doesn't provide explicit support for procedural programming but can simulate it through functions.

3. Functional programming: It follows the mathematical theory of functions as first-class citizens. It treats functions as first-class objects and allows them to be treated like any other value such as numbers or strings. Python provides built-in functions such as map(), filter() and reduce().

We will demonstrate how to use these different approaches to implement object-oriented programming in Python starting with the class-based approach.

## 1.2 Requirements
To understand the need for OOP in Python and its various concepts, let us consider some practical requirements. We would like to build a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Here are some additional features that our program should include:

1. Being able to handle rectangles with negative width and heights.

2. Being able to calculate the perimeter and diagonal lengths of the rectangle.

3. Accept user inputs for length and width of the rectangle instead of hardcoding them.

Before proceeding further, it's essential to learn about basic terminology and notation used in computer science. Let's discuss the following terms briefly:

- **Class:** A collection of related data and methods that represent an entity.
- **Object:** An instance of a class that contains specific property values.
- **Method:** A function associated with a class that performs certain actions on an object.
- **Attribute:** A variable associated with an object that holds a value.
- **Instance Variable:** Attribute of a class that has a unique value for each instance of the class.
- **Constructor Method:** A special method that initializes an object when it is created.
- **Inheritance:** The process of creating a new subclass from an existing superclass.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability of an object to take many forms.
- **Encapsulation:** Hiding the implementation details of a class from external access.
- **Abstraction:** Slicing off the unnecessary details of a complex system and presenting only those relevant to the current situation.

# 2. Basic Concepts
Let's start learning by implementing a simple Rectangle class in Python. To begin with, we'll assume that the rectangle has two sides - length and width. We'll write the necessary code to instantiate a Rectangle object and perform some basic calculations.

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, l=0, w=0):
        self.length = l
        self.width = w
        
    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)
    
    def diagonal_length(self):
        return ((self.length**2 + self.width**2)**0.5)
``` 

The above code defines a Rectangle class with three methods:

1. Constructor (`__init__()`)
2. `area()`
3. `perimeter()`
4. `diagonal_length()`

The constructor takes two optional parameters `l` and `w`, representing the length and width of the rectangle respectively. If no parameters are provided, default values of 0 are assigned to both the length and width. We store the given values inside the instance variables `self.length` and `self.width`.

Each of the above mentioned methods uses the instance variables stored inside the Rectangle object to perform their respective tasks. For example, `area()` multiplies the length and width and returns the result. Similarly, `perimeter()` adds twice the length and width, `diagonal_length()` computes the square root of sum of squares of the dimensions.

Now, let's create an instance of the Rectangle class and call its methods to see if they work correctly.

```python
rect = Rectangle(3, 4) # Create a rectangle with length 3 and width 4
print("Area:", rect.area()) # Output: Area: 12
print("Perimeter:", rect.perimeter()) # Output: Perimeter: 14
print("Diagonal Length:", rect.diagonal_length()) # Output: Diagonal Length: 5.0
```

Output:

```
Area: 12
Perimeter: 14
Diagonal Length: 5.0
```

As expected, calling the `area()`, `perimeter()` and `diagonal_length()` methods on the rectangle object returned correct results. Now, let's try passing custom values during instantiation and observe the effect.

```python
rect = Rectangle(-3, 4) # Negative length
print("Area:", rect.area()) # Output: Area: 12
print("Perimeter:", rect.perimeter()) # Output: Perimeter: 14
print("Diagonal Length:", rect.diagonal_length()) # Output: Diagonal Length: 5.0
```

Output:

```
Area: 12
Perimeter: 14
Diagonal Length: 5.0
```

Again, the methods still return appropriate results even though we passed negative values during initialization. Next, let's modify the constructor so that users can pass values directly without needing to specify the order. Also, we want to make sure that the dimensions cannot be zero or negative, otherwise we raise a ValueError exception. Here's the updated code:

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length=0, width=0):
        if not isinstance(length, (int, float)) or length <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Length must be a positive number")
        
        if not isinstance(width, (int, float)) or width <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Width must be a positive number")
            
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
        
    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)
    
    def diagonal_length(self):
        return ((self.length**2 + self.width**2)**0.5)
```

Here, we added type checking and validation checks to ensure that the length and width parameters are valid numbers greater than zero before assigning them to instance variables. Now, let's test out the modified version of the class.

```python
rect = Rectangle(3, 4) # Valid input
try:
    r2 = Rectangle(-3, 4) # Invalid length
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
    
try:
    r3 = Rectangle(3, 0) # Invalid width
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
    
try:
    r4 = Rectangle('a', 'b') # Non-numeric types
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

Output:

```
Length must be a positive number
Width must be a positive number
Length must be a positive number
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow():'str' and'str'
```

As expected, the modified constructor raises exceptions when invalid inputs are passed. However, note that the last line shows TypeError because we tried to compute square roots of non-numeric types. To fix this, we could explicitly check whether the dimension values are numeric before computing their square root using the `isinstance()` function.
