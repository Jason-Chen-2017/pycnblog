# 1.简介
  

Lasso regression is a popular method for feature selection and regularization. It is used to impose sparsity on the coefficients of the model and can lead to more interpretable models with reduced overfitting. In this article, we will discuss how to use statsmodels library in Python to perform Lasso regression and understand its working principles. We also explain why Lasso regression should be used when compared to other types of regression techniques like ordinary least squares (OLS) or ridge regression. Finally, we demonstrate how to evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as R-squared and adjusted R-squared. 

In summary, the main points of discussion include:

1. What is Lasso regression? How does it differ from OLS and Ridge regression?
2. When and where do we apply Lasso regression? Can it be applied to both classification and regression problems?
3. An introduction to Lasso regression using Statsmodels library in Python
4. Different ways to evaluate the performance of Lasso regression including R-squared and Adjusted R-squared.

The goal of this article is to provide practical insights into Lasso regression by explaining the mathematical foundation behind the algorithm along with detailed step-by-step explanations of applying the technique using Python libraries such as statsmodels. This article can serve as an excellent starting point for data scientists who are new to Lasso regression or want to deepen their understanding.

# 2.Basic concepts and terminology
Before discussing about Lasso regression, let's first cover some basic concepts and terminology related to linear regression that will help us better understand it. 

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used type of statistical analysis for predicting a quantitative response variable based on one or multiple predictor variables. The idea behind linear regression is to find the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable, which helps to estimate the value of the dependent variable for given values of the independent variables. Linear regression estimates the slope and intercept parameters of the best fit line through the data points, which minimize the sum of squared errors between actual and predicted values. A straight line passing through any two data points has the minimum total error among all possible lines. 

Predictor variables can have different scales and units of measurement, so there may be issues associated with comparison across different features. One common approach to address these issues is normalization, where each input variable is scaled to have zero mean and unit variance before applying the linear regression formula. Another approach is standardization, where each input variable is centered around zero and has a standard deviation of 1. Standardization ensures that all the features contribute equally towards the regression coefficient estimation. However, standardization might not always give meaningful results depending on the distribution of the data.

Residuals are the difference between observed values and predicted values generated by the linear regression equation. Residual plots are useful tools for identifying patterns in the residuals and checking whether they are normally distributed. Outliers can significantly affect the performance of linear regression models and need to be identified and handled accordingly. Other common terms used in linear regression include:

1. Dependent Variable: the quantity whose behavior we would like to measure or predict.
2. Independent Variables: the factors influencing the dependent variable. 
3. Coefficients: the estimated values of the regression coefficients that determine the strength and direction of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. These coefficients can be interpreted as the impact of each factor on the outcome variable.
4. Errors/Disturbances: random noise present in the observations that cause deviations from the expected pattern. They are usually modeled as i.i.d Gaussian random variables. 

# 3.Algorithm Principles and Operation Steps
Now that we know what Lasso regression is and what kinds of terms and concepts are involved, we can proceed to explore its mathematical formulation and implementation details using Python libraries. Lasso regression is implemented using coordinate descent optimization algorithms, which involves minimizing the cost function by iteratively adjusting the coefficient values until convergence. It uses a penalty term called "lasso" to shrink the magnitudes of the coefficients towards zero, thus encouraging sparsity in the model. Mathematical representation of Lasso regression is as follows:

$$\min_{b_j}\left\{ \frac{1}{2n} || y - X b||^2 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^p |b_j|\right\}$$

where $X$ represents the design matrix containing the predictor variables and their corresponding coefficients, $y$ represents the response variable, $\beta$ represents the vector of coefficients, and $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter that controls the degree of sparsity in the final model. The above objective function is minimized by updating the coefficients successively until convergence is achieved.

Let's now break down the steps involved in solving the above problem:

1. Define the design matrix $X$, predictor variables $x_1,\ldots, x_p$ and responses variable $y$.
2. Initialize the vector of coefficients $\beta$ with zeros.
3. Set the value of alpha as a positive constant.
4. Repeat the following steps until convergence is achieved:
     * Compute the gradient of the cost function $J(\beta)$ wrt $\beta$ using the partial derivative of the loss function at $\beta$.
     * Update the coefficients $\beta$ by subtracting the product of learning rate ($\eta$) and the gradient of the cost function times the learning rate $\eta J(\beta)$.
     * Apply a threshold constraint on the absolute values of the coefficients to enforce sparsity.
    
Once we have obtained the optimal set of coefficients, we can interpret them as the impact of each predictor variable on the response variable. Higher values indicate higher importance of that predictor variable while lower values indicate relatively less influence. Alternatively, we can compare the magnitudes of the coefficients with zero to identify the relevant features in the model.

# 4.Python Implementation
Now that we have discussed the fundamental principles behind Lasso regression, let's move onto implementing it using Python packages such as Statsmodels. We will start by installing Statsmodels if it is not already installed on your system. You can install it using pip command:

```python
pip install statsmodels
```

After installation is complete, you can import the required modules and load the dataset into memory. Here is an example code snippet to load the iris dataset and split it into training and testing sets:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the iris dataset 
iris = load_iris()

# Convert the loaded dataset into a Pandas dataframe
data = pd.DataFrame(iris['data'], columns=iris['feature_names'])
target = pd.Series(iris['target'], name='species')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    data, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Next, we will create the design matrix and define the estimator object for Lasso regression. By default, Statsmodels LassoCV class performs cross-validation to select the optimal value of alpha parameter during the fitting process. Once the Lasso regression estimator object is created, we can call the `fit()` method on it to obtain the optimal set of coefficients:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Create the design matrix
design_matrix = sm.add_constant(X_train)

# Create an instance of LassoCV estimator with alpha set to automatically choose the best alpha value
lr = sm.LassoCV(cv=5)

# Fit the model to the training data
lr.fit(design_matrix, y_train)
```

We can print out the optimal alpha value chosen by the cv algorithm during the fitting process:

```python
print("Optimal Alpha Value:", lr.alpha_)
```

To get the coefficient values for each predictor variable, we can access the `coef_` attribute of the estimator object:

```python
for idx, col in enumerate(X_train.columns):
    coef = lr.coef_[idx]
    print("{}: {:.3f}".format(col, coef))
```

This gives us a list of coefficients for each predictor variable, sorted by increasing order of their impact on the response variable. To make predictions on new unseen data, we can simply multiply the design matrix with the coefficient vector to get the predicted values:

```python
new_data = [[5.9, 3., 4.2, 1.5], [7.5, 3.8, 6.0, 2.2]]
predicted_values = lr.predict(sm.add_constant(new_data))
print("Predicted Values:", predicted_values)
```

# 5.Evaluation Metrics
After obtaining the predicted values, we can evaluate the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Squared score. RMSE measures the average distance between predicted and actual values, MAE calculates the average magnitude of the error, and R-Squared is a commonly used metric to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model. Statistical software packages such as R, SAS, and SPSS offer built-in functions to calculate these metrics directly from the predicted and actual values. If needed, we can write custom functions to compute these metrics using NumPy and SciPy libraries.

For calculating RMSE, we first need to generate the predicted values for the testing set using the same design matrix that was used for training the model. Then, we can square the differences between predicted and actual values and take their mean and then take the square root to get the RMSE:

```python
# Generate predicted values for the testing set using the trained model
design_matrix = sm.add_constant(X_test)
predicted_values = lr.predict(design_matrix)

# Calculate RMSE
rmse = np.sqrt(((predicted_values - y_test)**2).mean())
print("Root Mean Squared Error:", rmse)
```

Similarly, we can use other metrics such as MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and Adjusted R-Squared score to evaluate the performance of Lasso regression.
