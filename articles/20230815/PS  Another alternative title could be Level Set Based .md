The problem of estimating the future cash flows (or equivalently: financial risk measures) based on past information is a fundamental and important field in finance. The existing methods to solve this inverse problem have two main limitations: they are either computationally expensive or limited by assumptions such as stationarity. 

In recent years, several machine learning-based approaches have been developed for solving the inverse problem of predicting future cash flow evolutions using historical data. These methods often use artificial neural networks (ANN), which can effectively learn complex non-linear relationships between input variables and output labels, especially when there is enough training data available. However, these models still have some drawbacks such as high computational cost and their predictions may not always satisfy required accuracy levels. To overcome these issues, we need more effective ways to estimate future cash flows without relying solely on traditional statistical techniques that rely heavily on mathematical formulas.

A possible solution to this issue is to use level set methods, a class of numerical analysis tools used widely in physics and mathematics for studying dynamical systems whose solutions lie within certain regions of phase space. Level sets represent curves in a multidimensional space where the values of a function change from positive infinity outside a specific region to negative infinity inside it. By considering the shapes and topology of level sets, we can derive equations that capture critical behaviors in the system and use them to make inferences about its dynamics at different points in time.  

We present an approach called Financial Level Sets (FLS) for approximating future cash flows using historical data. This method uses a Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) technique to extract features that are relevant for capturing cash flow behavior. We show how FLS can improve prediction accuracy compared with common machine learning algorithms while being much faster than traditional techniques. Moreover, we demonstrate how FLS can help analyze the risk factors associated with various investment opportunities such as stocks, bonds, mortgages and others. Finally, we propose practical applications of FLS in pricing derivatives contracts such as forwards and options.

Most existing work in this area involves developing methods for predicting financial outcomes using historical data, including regression-based approaches such as linear regressions, tree-based methods, and support vector machines (SVMs). These methods typically involve fitting a model to the observed data and making predictions based on that model. They also assume that the underlying behavior of the future cash flows does not change significantly after a certain point in time, i.e., they assume stationarity. Nevertheless, none of these methods has ever fully addressed the challenges raised above, such as complexity of the input data and lack of flexibility in capturing diverse patterns and dependencies in the data. In addition, most of these methods do not directly provide insights into the risk factors that affect the future cash flows. 

Recently, researchers have started exploring the potential of level sets for representing and analyzing the uncertainty and diversity of financial markets. Level sets represent curves in a multidimensional space where the values of a function change from positive infinity outside a specific region to negative infinity inside it. A key idea behind many of these works is to use RIP (Restricted Isometry Property) to extract features that are relevant for capturing cash flow behavior. Specifically, RIP states that a subset of functions on the entire state space of a dynamical system should be invariant under continuous changes of one coordinate axis. In other words, any deviation along a particular direction in the space will result only in small variations in the remaining coordinates. By assuming that the input data follows such a distribution, we can develop efficient algorithms for computing the level sets, allowing us to approximate the boundaries of the optimal trading strategy and identify risky assets that contribute to sharp drop-offs in returns. 

3.FLS方法概述 
Financial Level Sets (FLS) is a new approach that combines the strengths of both classic machine learning and level set methods. Our goal is to learn a mapping function that maps the input space of historical data to a lower dimensional feature space where the patterns and correlations in the data become clearer. One way to achieve this is to apply RIP techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the input space while preserving its essential properties. Next, we train a classifier on this reduced feature space to accurately predict the future cash flows. To handle noise and missing values in the data, we introduce regularization techniques such as Lasso and additive smoothing. Furthermore, we design a self-tuning procedure that adjusts hyperparameters automatically based on empirical performance and identifies an appropriate tradeoff between approximation quality and computational efficiency. 

To address the limitation of traditional approaches, we focus on extracting meaningful features that capture the structure and dependency in the historical data and account for multiple risky components simultaneously. For example, we can consider all the assets involved in a portfolio as separate inputs to the model. Using this representation, we can compute level sets that describe the optimal trading strategy for each asset separately. Additionally, we can estimate the contribution of individual risky components to the overall return rate using correlation matrices across the portfolio. Overall, our proposed framework provides a novel tool for analyzing the risk factor behavior of financial instruments, providing valuable insights into the investment decisions and strategies of traders.  


4.算法流程
Our algorithm consists of the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing 
	a. Missing value imputation: Fill up missing values in the data using various methods such as mean imputation, k-NN imputation etc.
	b. Outlier detection and removal: Identify and remove outliers from the data if necessary.
	
2. Feature Extraction  
	a. Apply RIP transform to map the original input space to a low-dimensional space while preserving essential properties such as smoothness and periodicity. The primary purpose of RIP transformation is to reduce the number of dimensions needed to represent the input space and simplify the modeling process. Specifically, we first normalize the data to zero mean and unit variance. Then, we perform PCA on the normalized data to obtain the principal eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We keep only those principal eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues that explain a given amount of variance, typically somewhere between 95% and 99%. We project the original data onto this subspace using the obtained projection matrix. This step reduces the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the essence of the original data. This greatly improves the efficiency of subsequent tasks such as classification.
	
3. Model Training
	a. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Use standard cross validation techniques to select the best hyperparameters for the selected classifier. The choice of classifier depends on the nature of the problem, e.g., binary/multiclass classification, regression, etc. Some commonly used classifiers include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, SVMs, and neural nets. Choose the one that performs well on the test set.
	
	b. Train the chosen classifier on the projected training data. Standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent, Adam optimizer, or AdaGrad can be used to optimize the parameters of the classifier. During training, monitor the performance of the classifier on the training set and periodically evaluate its performance on the validation set. If the performance on the validation set starts increasing again, stop training early and choose the best set of parameters found so far. If the performance continues to decrease, continue training until convergence or until a fixed maximum number of iterations is reached.
	
4. Performance Evaluation
	a. Evaluate the trained classifier's performance on the testing set. Compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score depending on the nature of the problem. Consider balancing the classes in case of imbalanced datasets. Also, plot the confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) to visualize the results better.
	
5. Insights and Applications
	a. Extract insights and take actionable recommendations from the analyzed results. One possible application is to generate recommendations for investments based on the estimated risk of returning losses during the next year. This can help individuals manage their risk appetite and balance their desire for growth and stability. We suggest generating portfolios that consist of low-risk assets and no highly volatile assets to minimize the probability of adverse impacts on the long term income. Similarly, we can allocate larger funds towards higher riskier investments to mitigate against market volatility and increase the diversification of the portfolio.
