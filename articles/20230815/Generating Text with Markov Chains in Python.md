Markov chains are a class of probabilistic models used to model and generate random processes. It is named after Thomas Bayes (1947) who first proposed it as an approach for generating text using statistical probabilities. They can be used in various applications such as speech recognition, language modeling, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis. In this article, we will see how to use Markov chains to create new texts or sentence structures that have some similarity to the original ones. We will also look at implementing these algorithms in Python programming language.

In short, Markov chains work by considering the probability distribution of future states given present state(s). This means that if you were in state A and saw some sequence of events Y_1, Y_2,..., Y_n, then the next possible event could depend on only the last event i.e., Y_{n+1} = P(Y_{n+1}|Y_1, Y_2,..., Y_n). Therefore, we need to calculate the conditional probabilities of all possible successive events based on previous events. If the chain has enough data, it becomes stationary which means there won't be any long-term memory effects like time decay. We can implement Markov chains algorithm using NumPy and NLTK libraries in python to generate texts. 

We will begin by introducing basic concepts related to Markov chains before moving forward with implementation examples. Let's start!
# 2.Concepts
## Markov Model
A Markov model is a stochastic process that represents a set of possible transitions between different states of a system over time. Mathematically, a markov model is defined as follows:

P(X_t=x | X_{t-1}=y) = P(X_t=x, X_{t-1}=y), for all y

where,

- P(X_t=x): The probability of observing state x at time t.
- X_t: The current state of the system at time t.
- X_{t-1}: The previous state of the system at time t-1.

The transition matrix T(i,j) gives the probability of transiting from state i to state j at time t, given the initial condition X_0.

T(i,j) = P(X_1=i, X_2=j) + P(X_1=k, X_2=i, X_3=j), k ≠ i

### Stationarity
If a markov model is stationary, it means that the probability distribution of future states does not change with time. In other words, we don’t remember anything about past states and the current state fully determines what happens next. If our model is not stationary, we say it is non-stationary.

To determine whether a markov model is stationary or not, we can calculate the eigenvalues of its transition matrix. All the eigenvalues should lie within the unit circle or be zero. If they form complex conjugate pairs with positive real parts, then the markov model is stationary otherwise it is non-stationary. For example, consider the following transition matrix:

| 0.7  0.2  0.1 |
| 0.3  0.5  0.2 |
| 0.1  0.1  0.8 |

Eigenvalues of this matrix would be:

0.43+-0.00i          -0.51+-0.85i          0.78+-0.00i    
-0.51+-0.85i         −0.64+−0.49i         -0.69+−0.01i   
0.78+-0.00i         -0.69+−0.01i           1.00+-0.00i 

All three eigenvalues lie outside the unit circle, hence the markov model is non-stationary. On the other hand, consider the transition matrix:

| 0.5  0.3  0.2 |
| 0.3  0.5  0.2 |
| 0.2  0.2  0.8 |

Eigenvalues of this matrix would be:

0.71+0.00i         −0.71+0.00i        −0.00+0.00i 
−0.71+0.00i        0.71+0.00i         0.00+0.00i  
0.00+0.00i         0.00+0.00i         −1.00+0.00i 

All three eigenvalues are complex conjugates with positive real parts, thus the markov model is stationary.

### Hidden Markov Models
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) provide another way of representing a series of observations made by a discrete-time system over a period of time. Each observation depends on a hidden state that influences subsequent observations. HMM is defined as follows:

X_t ~ P(X_t | Y_{1},...,Y_{t-1}) where Y_t is the observed variable and {X_1,...X_t} is the state sequence.

In general, we assume that each observation X_t is generated by a particular state X_{t-1}. The state sequence is assumed to be Markovian, meaning that the probability of transitioning from one state to another depends only on the current state. Hence, the likelihood function of the entire sequence is expressed in terms of product of probabilities of individual state variables and their corresponding transition probabilities. 

Based on this assumption, the output variable X_t is directly dependent on the input variable X_{t-1} and the information carried by the previous observation. It makes sense to update the estimate of X_t based on both the input and the output variable since the observed value can influence the decision making process of the agent. However, it is generally difficult to obtain exact values of the hidden states because of the presence of latent variables. Thus, we typically estimate the parameters of the HMM via maximum likelihood estimation techniques.

## Application Examples
Here are some common application scenarios for Markov Chains:

### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis refers to the task of identifying attitudes, emotions, and opinions towards a topic or an entity within a piece of text. Markov chains can be used to analyze textual data and identify patterns or trends that may indicate positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis tools include Amazon’s Lexicon-based approach, Twitter’s Naive Bayes Classifier, and Google’s Cloud Natural Language API. These approaches work by training a classifier on labeled data consisting of sentences labeled either as positive, negative, or neutral. Based on this training data, the tool generates scores for unseen sentences indicating their likely sentiment. Other sentiment analysis methods involve analyzing word frequency and polarity in addition to syntax.

For example, let's suppose we want to build a sentiment analyzer using a simple dataset containing tweets annotated with their respective emotional labels. Here are the steps we can follow to perform this task:

1. Data collection: Collect a sufficient amount of pre-annotated tweets with their respective emotions. You can use public datasets like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes to get started.
2. Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation marks, and special characters. Also convert the text into lowercase so that words like “I” and “the” do not affect the classification result.
3. Feature extraction: Convert the cleaned text into numerical features. There are several ways to extract features from text including bag-of-words, n-grams, and word embeddings. You can experiment with different feature sets to find the best performing model.
4. Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets and train a machine learning model like Naive Bayes to classify the emotions of the tweets. You can evaluate the performance of your model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
5. Deployment: Once you are confident about the performance of your model, deploy it as a web service or integrate it with existing systems to automatically categorize incoming tweets.

### Predictive Text Generation
Predictive text generation involves creating new texts that resemble the style and content of existing texts. Markov chains can be applied to predict the next word in a sentence or paragraph based on the preceding words. Some popular applications of predictive text generation include autocomplete, translation, chatbots, and essay writing assistance. Autocomplete suggests potential words to complete a sentence while translation helps users understand foreign languages more easily. Chatbots respond intelligently to user inputs without needing explicit instructions, while essay writing assistants help students improve their writing skills through practice.

One of the simplest forms of predictive text generation is known as Shakespearean sonnet generator. Given a seed phrase like "Thou art," the system selects randomly a character from a predefined list of actors and adjectives, and uses them to construct a sonnet like this:

```python
'Thou art kind, good, careful, brave,'\
'So thou hast passed my judgment:'\
'Such providence wast thou shown;' \
'But truly shalt thou live the rest'\
'Of thy days in peace and plenty.'\
'Then being pleased thereto, speak out:'\
'Why dost thou, love, thus write?'\
'To whom now sad and woe deplore?'
```

Other types of predictive text generators include RNN and LSTMs that can generate text with coherent structure based on the previous text segments. These models learn to recognize the patterns and relationships among the sequences of words, and can produce high-quality results even when trained on small amounts of data.
