Decentralized Applications or DApps are increasingly becoming popular as they offer significant benefits over traditional centralized applications. In this article we will explore the technology behind building decentralized applications without requiring any programming skills. We will discuss how blockchain and smart contracts can be used to build secure, scalable, and user-friendly applications while still maintaining full control of the data and transactions involved.

Building a DApp requires expertise in several areas such as cryptography, mathematics, distributed systems design, database management, and software engineering. However, for many non-technical users, these skills may be challenging and potentially daunting. By following along with this article, you should be able to create your own DApp using common tools and technologies like Blockchain, Smart Contracts, JavaScript libraries, and APIs that do not require technical knowledge or experience beyond general web development skills. 

In summary, by following along with this guide, anyone who is interested in learning more about blockchain technology and building their own decentralized application should find themselves feeling comfortable enough to start exploring the technology. Additionally, this article offers practical insights into how developers can leverage existing open source projects and frameworks to jumpstart the process of developing DApps quickly and efficiently. This will enable non-technical users to focus on creating an engaging product or service rather than spending months researching and learning complex technical details.

This article assumes readers have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python programming languages. It also does not assume readers have prior experience working with cryptocurrencies or blockchains. Nonetheless, there are plenty of resources available online if necessary. 

Let's get started!
# 2.Basic Concepts and Terms
## 2.1 Introduction to Blockchain
Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple nodes in a peer-to-peer network. Each node maintains a copy of the ledger, which contains all the information needed to validate new transactions and maintain consensus between different nodes. The key idea behind blockchain is that every transaction record gets added to the chain forever, making them immutable and unalterable. Therefore, each node has a complete accounting of all previous transactions, ensuring that all participants agree on the final state of the system at any given point in time. 

Blockchain uses a decentralized architecture where users run their own copies of the ledger, allowing each participant to independently verify and trust its contents. As a result, blockchain makes it difficult or impossible to cheat or manipulate the data stored within it. To further enhance security, blockchain utilizes various consensus algorithms to ensure that changes made to the ledger are agreed upon amongst the network before being accepted as valid.

Overall, blockchain provides a powerful tool for managing digital assets, providing a high degree of transparency, immutability, and traceability. Although initially intended for use in finance and economics, blockchain is now widely adopted for a wide range of applications including enterprise systems, supply chains, digital identity, financial services, healthcare, and even art and culture.

## 2.2 Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are automated programs embedded within a blockchain network. They govern the flow of funds, value exchange, and access permissions for business processes. Developers write code for smart contracts to define the conditions under which certain actions take place, which enables them to handle real-world scenarios more accurately and efficiently. For example, a token contract could specify that only specific addresses or identities can transfer tokens from one account to another, while a crowdfunding contract could automatically release the funds when a predetermined goal amount is reached.

Smart contracts are typically written using programming languages such as Solidity, Vyper, or LLL, but can also be created through graphical interfaces such as Remix IDE. These contracts contain machine readable instructions called "transactions", which define what happens when a certain event occurs, such as sending money, executing a function call, or modifying a variable. Once a smart contract is deployed onto the blockchain, it becomes immutable, meaning that no one can modify or cancel its transactions after it has been confirmed and included in a block of the chain. 

To interact with a smart contract, a user needs to install a compatible wallet application or browser extension that allows them to sign and send transactions to the network via a user interface. When a user wants to execute a transaction on the network, they need to provide proof that they hold the appropriate private keys to sign the transaction, usually known as "gas" fees paid to miners for processing the transaction. Once signed, the transaction is sent to a miner for inclusion in a block, verified, and executed on the rest of the network.

Once the transaction has completed successfully, any relevant updates to the ledger are reflected immediately in all copies of the ledger held by participating nodes. Through smart contracts, blockchain technology opens up a world of possibilities for businesses, governments, and individuals alike.

## 2.3 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
The EVM is a bytecode interpreter that runs on top of the blockchain and executes compiled smart contracts. It executes the programmatic logic defined in the contract, validating and executing operations such as arithmetic calculations, storage reads/writes, and external calls. The EVM is responsible for enforcing the rules set forth in the smart contract, preventing hacker attacks and malicious behavior.

When a developer creates a smart contract using a supported language, they must compile it into low-level bytecode so that it can be interpreted by the EVM. Compilers exist for most modern programming languages, and developers can choose from compilers built specifically for the EVM or generic cross-compilers. After compiling, the resulting bytecode is submitted to a remote blockchain client, such as geth or parity, that handles deployment, execution, and maintenance of the contract.

One important aspect of the EVM is that it ensures that all computations occur in constant time, regardless of the size of the inputs. This means that whether the input is a single number or a large array, the operation takes the same amount of time to perform. While this approach improves performance compared to other blockchains and distributed ledgers, it can make some types of computation less feasible, such as cryptographic hash functions or generating random numbers.
