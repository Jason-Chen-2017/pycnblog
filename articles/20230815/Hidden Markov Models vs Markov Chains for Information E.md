# 1.简介
  

Information extraction is the process of identifying and extracting relevant information from textual data such as news articles, web pages, social media messages etc. It is an essential aspect of natural language processing (NLP) and has applications in various fields including search engines, knowledge management, document analysis, spam filtering, sentiment analysis etc. The goal of information extraction is to extract structured information from unstructured or semi-structured text data by automatically detecting and classifying key phrases, entities, concepts, relationships, and other relevant terms. There are two popular methods used for information extraction - rule-based systems and machine learning based approaches like HMMs (hidden Markov models) and CRFs (conditional random fields). However, there exists no clear distinction between these two techniques. In this article, we will compare and contrast HMMs with traditional Markov chains approach for information extraction tasks using a practical example involving entity recognition on Twitter data. We will discuss how both techniques work under the hood and also explore their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of each technique on different datasets.
# 2.核心概念及术语说明
Before diving into the technical details of our comparison, let’s briefly review some commonly used terms and concepts related to information extraction:

1. **Entity** : A named object that refers to something within a sentence or paragraph. For instance, “apple” is an entity while "New York" is not one. Entities can be person names, organization names, places, products, events, and so on. An entity may have multiple mentions in a given text but all refer to the same real world entity.

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** : This task involves labelling individual words or spans of text as belonging to certain categories, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, currencies, etc. NER is typically performed using supervised or unsupervised algorithms depending upon the nature of the dataset.

3. **Tokenization** : This step involves splitting a raw text string into smaller meaningful units called tokens. Tokens could be individual words, sentences, paragraphs, sub-phrases, chunks or n-grams. Tokenization helps in converting the input text into a format which can be easily processed by further steps in the NLP pipeline.

4. **Part-of-speech tagging** : This step assigns a part of speech tag to every word in the tokenized text. Part-of-speech tags indicate whether a word belongs to verb, adjective, noun, pronoun, adverb, conjunction, interjection, preposition, article, prefix, suffix, abbreviation, or any other category known to human linguists. Tagging enables us to identify the grammatical roles of each token.

5. **Dependency parsing** : This step analyses the syntactic dependencies among tokens in the parsed text. Dependency parsing is particularly useful in capturing complex relationships between verbs, nouns, and modifiers in a sentence. It helps in identifying the main subject, direct objects, indirect objects, and passive voice in a sentence.

6. **Corpus** : A collection of documents or texts that share a common theme or topic. Corpora come in varying formats like text files, XML/HTML files, databases, CSV/TSV files, etc. Some widely used corpora include the Penn Treebank, WSJ (Wall Street Journal), IMDb, Yelp reviews, Amazon product reviews, etc.

Now that we understand the basic terminology, let's move on to discussing about hidden Markov models and Markov chains.

## 3.1 Markov Chain Model
The Markov chain model is a simple probabilistic model for generating sequences of random variables. Let's say we want to generate a sequence of states $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$ where each state $X_i$ depends only on the previous state $X_{i-1}$. The probability distribution over the next state at time $t+1$ is determined by observing the current state $X_t$, i.e.,
$$P(X_{t+1} = x | X_t = y) = P(X_{t+1}=x|X_t=y)$$
where $y$ is the previous state at time $t$. Note that the transition probabilities do not depend on time $t$. If we know the initial state $X_1$, then we can use the above equation to compute the conditional probability distributions over all possible future states starting from $X_1$. These distributions define the Markov chain model. 

For example, consider a weather prediction problem. At each hour, we observe the temperature and rainfall conditions from the past few hours. Based on these observations, we predict what the temperature will be in the next hour. Given enough history information, the weather forecasting system can accurately predict the future weather patterns.

One major advantage of the Markov chain model is its simplicity and ease of implementation. Once we have defined the transition probabilities, it becomes straightforward to simulate new sequences of states based on these probabilities. Furthermore, the Markov property ensures that the future states generated by the model have similar properties compared to those that were observed earlier in the sequence. Therefore, the predictions made by the model remain accurate even if the past information changes significantly.

However, despite its popularity, the Markov chain model suffers from several limitations when applied to more complex problems like sequential decision making and modeling temporal dynamics. To address these issues, we need to relax the Markov assumption and capture more complex structure in the sequence.

## 3.2 Hidden Markov Model
In the field of statistical natural language processing, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is a generalization of the Markov chain model that allows the presence of latent states and modelled transitions between them. Unlike the Markov chain model, the presence of latent states makes the HMM less deterministic, enabling inference over unknown states during the generation phase. Also, HMMs can model complex structures in the input data because they allow for multiple emission and transition probabilities per pair of hidden and observable states.

In practice, we represent the joint probability of the observed sequence $\mathbf{O}=\left\{o_{1}, o_{2}, \ldots, o_{T}\right\}$ and latent variable sequence $\mathbf{\lambda}=\left\{\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \ldots, \lambda_{T}\right\}$, with $o_{t}$ denoting the observation at time $t$ and $\lambda_{t}$ denoting the corresponding hidden state at time $t$, by specifying three probability distributions: 

1. Initial state distribution $p(\lambda_{1})$: specifies the probability of the first hidden state at time $1$. 

2. Transition matrix $A$: specifies the conditional probability of moving from the $j$-th hidden state to the $i$-th hidden state at time $t$, given the state at time $(t-1)$, i.e., 
   $$A[i, j] = p(\lambda_{t}=i | \lambda_{t-1}=j)$$
   
3. Emission matrix $B$: specifies the probability of emitting the $k$-th observation symbol at time $t$ given the hidden state at time $t$, i.e.,
   $$B[k, i] = p(o_{t}=k|\lambda_{t}=i)$$

Given the initial state distribution $p(\lambda_{1})$ and transition matrix $A$, we can compute the most likely sequence of latent states $\hat{\mathbf{\lambda}}=\left\{\hat{\lambda}_{1}, \hat{\lambda}_{2}, \ldots, \hat{\lambda}_{T}\right\}$ that generates the observed sequence $\mathbf{O}$. Here, $\hat{\lambda}_t$ represents the maximum likelihood estimate of the corresponding hidden state at time $t$. Thus, we can compute the probability of the observed sequence given the estimated latent sequence by multiplying the probabilities of each element in the observation sequence according to their respective emission probabilities specified by $B$.

To perform inference in HMMs, we use forward backward algorithm. The forward pass computes the total log probability of the observed sequence, while the backward pass estimates the backward probability of each hidden state in the sequence. By combining these probabilities, we can calculate the marginal probability of each hidden state and infer the most likely sequence of latent states that generates the observed sequence.

Advantages of HMMs over Markov chains:

1. Better modelling of complex structures in the input data: HMMs enable efficient representation of non-linear interactions between hidden states and inputs, leading to better accuracy in modeling complex behavior.

2. Capturing longer-term dependencies: HMMs can capture long-range dependencies between hidden states and inputs due to the existence of state durations.

3. Smoothness constraint: HMMs impose smoothness constraints on the output distribution to prevent overfitting and improve generalizability.

4. Viterbi decoding: HMMs provide an optimal path through the hidden state space rather than simply taking the single most likely state at each timestep.

Disadvantages of HMMs over Markov chains:

1. Computational complexity: HMMs require higher computational resources and scales exponentially with the number of states and observations.

2. Latent variable interpretation: Understanding the underlying causal mechanisms behind latent states requires further study of the structure of the learned parameters.

3. Training complexity: HMM training algorithms require careful parameter initialization and convergence monitoring to avoid local minima and slow convergence to global optimum.

## 3.3 Comparison Between HMMs and Markov Chains for Information Extraction
Suppose we have a set of annotated tweets containing a mix of named entities and non-entities (noisy text). Our objective is to build a classifier that automatically identifies named entities present in the tweet without explicitly defining rules or heuristics. Here are the specific requirements for building a HMM-based entity recognizer:

1. Input: Observed sequence: a list of lowercased words representing the content of the tweet; Latent variable sequence: a list of labels indicating either O (not an entity) or B-entityType (beginning of an entity of type entityType); Output: Probability distribution over the entire list of labels indicating the probability of each label at each position in the sequence.

2. Model architecture: Use HMM with at least two layers of hidden states. The first layer should contain labeled bi-gram states (labeled with the types of named entities) and the second layer should consist of unlabeled uni-gram states (representing all other types of tokens). Each state should have a fixed number of possible symbols (such as letters, digits, punctuation marks, etc.). Each transition between two adjacent states should involve passing context vectors computed based on features such as POS tags, dependency parse trees, and character n-grams. The emission probabilities for each state should be based on empirical frequencies or dictionaries trained on a large corpus of text. Alternatively, you could use LSTM or GRU neural networks instead of handcrafted feature functions.

3. Inference algorithm: Forward-backward algorithm should be used for inference. The forward algorithm computes the forward probability of each state in the sequence, while the backward algorithm computes the backward probability of each state in the sequence. The viterbi algorithm can be used to find the most likely sequence of labels given the observed sequence. You could also try beam search or constrained max-likelihood optimization techniques to speed up inference.

4. Evaluation metric: Precision, recall, F1 score should be used to measure the performance of the model. Specifically, the precision of a tag indicates the fraction of predicted tags assigned to the correct label, whereas the recall measures the fraction of true positive instances identified correctly. The F1 score combines precision and recall to give a harmonic mean of the quality of the classification results. Other metrics such as BLEU score or edit distance might also be appropriate depending on your application.
