Natural language processing (NLP) is a critical technology that helps machines understand and interpret human speech, text, emails, social media posts, and other natural language data. It involves various computational techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and statistical analysis to extract valuable insights from large volumes of unstructured text or speech. The goal of this primer is to provide an overview of neural network models used for Natural Language Processing (NLP), including the basic concepts behind these models, algorithms involved, their mathematical representations, code examples, and future directions. 

In recent years, with advances in big data technologies, machine learning has revolutionized many fields such as image recognition, recommender systems, and natural language processing (NLP). In addition, new approaches like transformer networks have shown impressive performance on a variety of natural language tasks beyond English-language ones. Therefore, understanding how neural networks work can help developers create more robust and accurate NLP applications.

This article assumes readers are familiar with fundamental computer science concepts and programming languages like Python, Java, C++, etc. Additionally, familiarity with vector calculus, matrix operations, and probability theory will be helpful but not essential. We also assume some prior knowledge about neural networks and machine learning. However, if you need a refresher course, we recommend Stanford’s CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition by <NAME> and <NAME>. This course covers a range of topics related to deep learning, including neural networks, optimization, and applied deep learning. Other introductory courses include Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization at Coursera, which cover key areas including linear algebra, multivariable calculus, differential equations, probability, and deep learning fundamentals.

To give an idea of the depth and complexity of NLP, consider the following three challenges faced by modern NLP solutions:

1. Understanding textual context and meaning: How do computers understand what someone says, whether they agree, disagree, or argue? 

2. Understanding intentionality and reasoning: How can machines make sense of complex sentences and events while reasoning from first principles, rather than relying on heuristics or rules of thumb?

3. Generating engaging and fluent content: As AI-powered chatbots become increasingly sophisticated and capable of understanding user intentions and responses, how can they generate engaging, meaningful and informative content without being boring or repetitive?

Each challenge requires different models and architectures to address them, and it may require specialized expertise to develop effective solutions. Within this primer, we will cover the foundational models and algorithms underlying today’s state-of-the-art NLP techniques, providing a high-level overview of each model and its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the limitations and potential pitfalls associated with using it for specific tasks. By the end of this primer, you should feel comfortable designing and implementing your own NLP solutions using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, and begin exploring the interdisciplinary research area of NLP. 

By the way, “primer” in Latin means a preliminary manual or booklet before printing. Similarly, we might use the term “preliminary article” instead of “primer”. But since NLP is still relatively new and evolving, we decided to stick to the standard term. Hopefully, this guidebook will serve as a useful resource for anyone working on NLP projects or curious about this field.

# 2.1 Introduction 
## 2.1.1 History 
The history of Natural Language Processing dates back over two decades, from the beginnings of linguistic and artificial intelligence (AI) research until today. 

Aristotle's Analytical Psychology provides us with a brief history of linguistics, which was introduced in Ancient Greece around 500 BC. Alongside psychology, mathematics, philosophy, and medicine, linguists helped shape our thought processes and approach to language. They also had a vital role in building communication tools and interpreting the messages people conveyed through written words. 

But even though linguists were crucial for bringing order and structure to the world, humans did not yet fully grasp the symbolic nature of human language. Over time, philosophers developed ideas and methods to encode information into symbols, enabling machines to process them effectively. These insights led to the development of theoretical and practical formalisms called grammars. 

However, human language has evolved significantly since then. Today, there exist many varieties of languages, ranging from dialects spoken by groups of people throughout the world, to specialized languages used within certain domains such as finance, education, and healthcare. Each of these languages possesses unique characteristics that make them challenging for machines to comprehend. In fact, one of the most significant problems facing NLP today is that it is highly dependent on domain and task-specific resources, making it difficult to build general purpose models that can handle multiple tasks with little training data. 

Around 1950, the IBM company founded Roger Stonebraker and his team designed a system known as System 1, which provided support for natural language understanding and generation for customer service agents. Although initially successful, System 1 was limited to processing short queries or single sentences, and its accuracy decreased rapidly as new features were added to the product. Eventually, IBM pivoted to developing more advanced NLP products, which eventually became the basis for major advancements in natural language processing over the next few decades. 

Over the past four decades, research in NLP has mainly focused on modeling individual cognitive processes such as lexical access, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and dialogue management. Researchers have made significant advances in several subfields such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, coreference resolution, and question answering, all with widespread impact across industry, academia, and government. Most recently, with the rise of deep learning techniques such as neural networks and transformers, researchers have been able to push the boundaries of previous approaches by leveraging large amounts of unstructured data and improving accuracy over time.  

Overall, the history of NLP spans over five centuries and continues to evolve alongside the digital transformation of information and commerce. The field remains an active area of research and innovation, and new techniques are constantly emerging, leading to improved results and faster progress in understanding human speech, text, and other natural language data.
