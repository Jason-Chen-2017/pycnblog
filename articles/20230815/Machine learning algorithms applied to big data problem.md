# 2. Basic concepts and terminology
# 2.1 Introduction
**What is machine learning?** 

Machine learning (ML) refers to the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience without being explicitly programmed. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. ML uses statistical methods to teach computers to recognize patterns in data and then use those patterns to predict future outcomes or trends. 

The goal of any machine learning project is to create an AI system that can perform tasks with high accuracy by analyzing new data inputs. However, it's not always easy to determine whether a system has achieved this level of accuracy until we test it on real-world scenarios where it might fail. We need to monitor and measure its performance over time so that we can identify areas for improvement and optimize our systems accordingly.

In general terms, there are four main categories of machine learning:

1. Supervised learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm learns to map input variables to output variables based on example input-output pairs. For instance, if you want your system to classify images into different types of animals, you would feed it examples of dogs and cats along with their corresponding labels ("dog" and "cat") and let it learn how to map these inputs to outputs. The most commonly used supervised learning techniques include classification, regression, and clustering. 

2. Unsupervised learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm does not have labeled training data. Instead, it identifies patterns and structures in the data without any prescribed targets or rules. One common technique is cluster analysis, which groups similar data points together into clusters. Another approach is dimensionality reduction, where the algorithm reduces the number of dimensions in the data while still retaining important information. 

3. Reinforcement learning: In reinforcement learning, the algorithm takes actions in an environment and receives feedback about its performance. It learns by trial and error by taking actions that maximize expected rewards. This involves designing environments that reward specific behaviors such as completing a task or avoiding a penalty. 

4. Deep learning: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that relies heavily on neural networks. Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected layers of nodes (or neurons) that process input data and produce output results. They are trained using backpropagation, which adjusts weights between the nodes based on their errors and the desired output. Over time, deep learning models can approximate complex functions by chaining multiple layers of nodes.

**Why should I care about machine learning?**

You may wonder why anyone would want to use machine learning instead of just building software programs by hand? Well, one reason is because machines can perform many repetitive tasks more quickly than humans. With large amounts of data, automated decision-making processes like machine learning can help businesses automate business decisions and increase productivity. Additionally, the ability to analyze and interpret large amounts of data can lead to significant insights that can be used to make strategic business decisions. Overall, machine learning enables organizations to gain valuable insights from massive datasets that can revolutionize industries and transform businesses.

# 2.2 Terminology
Here are some basic definitions and acronyms related to machine learning:

**Dataset**: A collection of examples that are used to train or test a model. Examples could consist of images, text documents, or numerical values.

**Feature**: An individual measurable property or characteristic of an example, e.g., the pixel values in an image, the words in a document, or the age of a person. Features describe what makes up an example, and they are usually represented as vectors or matrices.

**Labels**: Ground truth values associated with each example, i.e., the correct output for the example. These could be categorical values or continuous values depending on the problem. Labels are often left out of the dataset during training to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

**Training set**: A subset of the dataset used to fit the model parameters.

**Test set**: A subset of the dataset used to evaluate the performance of the learned model.

**Hyperparameters**: Parameters that control the behavior of the model at training time, such as the maximum depth of the decision tree or the learning rate for gradient descent optimization. Hyperparameters are chosen beforehand and remain constant throughout training.

**Algorithm**: The mathematical formulas used to solve machine learning problems.

**Model parameters**: Variables that define the behavior of the model once it has been trained. They are learned through training on the training set.

**Overfitting**: Occurs when the model fits too closely to the training data and doesn't generalize well to new data. To prevent overfitting, we can split the dataset into training and validation sets and use hyperparameter tuning techniques to select optimal values for the model parameters.

**Underfitting**: Occurs when the model cannot capture enough features of the data to make accurate predictions. This happens especially when the training data is simple or highly non-linear. Underfitting can be solved by adding additional complexity or bias regularization to the model architecture or reducing the size of the training set.

**Bias**: Error caused by the simplifying assumptions made by the model, such as assuming linearity or zero mean in linear regression. Bias can be reduced by choosing a better model or collecting more representative training data.

**Variance**: Error introduced by model variability due to small changes in the training data. Variance can be reduced by choosing a simpler model or increasing the size of the training set.

**Precision**: Measure of how precise the model's predictions are compared to the actual value. Precision is affected by false positives and false negatives.

**Recall**: Measure of how complete the model's recall is, meaning how many relevant items are found among all retrieved items. Recall is affected by false negatives.

**F1 score**: Harmonic average of precision and recall. Higher F1 scores indicate better model performance.
