随着互联网的飞速发展，移动互联网应用快速崛起。每年都有数以万计的新应用发布上线，通过丰富多样的功能和满足用户不同需求的应用体验,为消费者提供了更好的购物、娱乐、生活服务体验。随着智能手机的普及，越来越多的人使用手机进行日常生活的各项事务。例如，使用手机拍照上传相册，进行即时通讯，购物消费等，这些功能和能力成为社会的必备品。当互联网产品需要处理海量的数据时，如何保证其在移动端的实时响应速度，是提升用户体验，改善用户体验的一个重要方面。本文主要介绍阿里妈妈移动端实时性优化架构演进的架构设计与方案实现。
# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 Real-time Computing
Real-time computing is a subfield of computer science that involves the development and deployment of software systems capable of providing immediate or near-real-time response to input events. In other words, it aims at achieving low latency in processing inputs such as sensor readings from mobile devices, voice commands received over the internet, etc. The goal is to provide interactive and responsive applications with real-time performance requirements within certain constraints like power consumption, memory usage, network bandwidth, etc. It requires efficient algorithms and data structures for handling high volumes of data quickly while minimizing interference between tasks. Examples include speech recognition, object detection, autonomous driving, surveillance, intrusion detection system, medical imaging analysis, etc.
## 2.2 Message Queue (MQ)
A message queue is a type of software component used to store and deliver messages across distributed applications or between programs running on the same machine. MQs typically support various delivery modes including point-to-point, publish/subscribe, competing consumers, etc., depending on the application requirements. MQs are commonly used in enterprise messaging middleware platforms like Apache ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, IBM WebSphere MQ, etc. They help applications communicate asynchronously by allowing one component to send a message and another component to receive and process the message when available. MQs can be considered an essential part of any real-time computing architecture since they enable applications to exchange information without being blocked waiting for responses or results.
## 2.3 Backend System Architecture
The backend system architecture consists of multiple components that work together to achieve desired functionality. These components may involve databases, caching servers, webservers, load balancers, API gateways, authentication services, logging frameworks, monitoring tools, etc. All these components make up the infrastructure needed to host and run the mobile app and its related features, which constitute the core of the mobile app ecosystem.

In the context of real-time computing, some key principles apply:

1. Scalability - As more users and content are added to the platform, the infrastructure needs to scale accordingly to ensure continuous service availability.

2. Resiliency - Failure scenarios must be anticipated and addressed to ensure continued operation in case of hardware or software failures.

3. Availability - The system should continue functioning even if individual components fail or degrade due to external factors, such as natural disasters, climate changes, or government policies.

4. Performance - Applications need to respond fast enough to satisfy user demands, but not too fast so as to interfere with other activities happening concurrently.

5. Security - Mobile apps contain sensitive information such as user credentials, health records, financial transactions, etc., which need to be protected against unauthorized access.

6. User Experience - To create great user experiences, both internal and external stakeholders need to collaborate closely with developers, designers, and product owners.

Based on these principles, we can define the following overall system architecture for real-time computing:


This architecture has several important components that play a crucial role in ensuring real-time performance:

1. Message Queues: A message queue acts as a buffer layer between different components of the system. It enables asynchronous communication among the different parts of the system. Different types of queues exist, each with their own characteristics and use cases. For example, Kafka provides fault-tolerant storage and message ordering, whereas Amazon SQS allows you to perform standard queuing operations easily.

2. Caching Servers: Caching servers act as short-term stores for frequently accessed data. They reduce the overhead of database queries and improve the responsiveness of the system. Redis, Memcached, and other cache technologies are popular choices.

3. Data Stores: Databases are essential for storing and retrieving all kinds of information. They have different scaling capabilities and offer redundancy and high availability options. Options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, and others.

4. Load Balancers: A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the system to handle peak loads or overload situations. They keep track of healthy instances and route requests only to them. Nginx, HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancer, etc. are common solutions.

5. Event Processing Services: Event processing services consume event data generated by different sources and processes them in real time. They act as triggers for downstream actions or notifications. For example, Kafka Streams, KSQL, Flink SQL, etc. are some of the popular stream processing engines.

6. Job Scheduler: Job schedulers trigger periodic jobs to update cached data, generate reports, or clean up stale resources. They allow you to manage batch jobs efficiently. Some examples include Quartz, Airflow, and Jenkins.

7. Service Discovery: Service discovery helps locate microservices and dynamically adjust the routing rules based on current topology and health status. Consul, Etcd, ZooKeeper, etc. are some of the popular open source projects.

8. Distributed Tracing Framework: Distributed tracing frameworks collect trace logs from different services and visualize them in real-time to identify bottlenecks, errors, and performance issues. Jaeger, Zipkin, AppDynamics APM, New Relic APM, etc. are some popular open source projects.

Overall, this architecture ensures scalable, resilient, secure, and reliable real-time computing infrastructure for mobile app ecosystems.
