# 1.简介
  

Image augmentation (IA) refers to the process of generating new training samples by applying small transformations to existing ones. It is a common practice used in computer vision and deep learning tasks as it helps reduce overfitting and improves generalization ability of models. IA techniques are essential to deal with issues such as small data size, lack of representative sample distribution, or unbalanced data distribution among classes. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of different image augmentation techniques available for use with deep learning models in PyTorch, their implementations and potential benefits. 

This article assumes that readers have a basic understanding of deep learning and PyTorch programming libraries. It also provides practical guidelines on how to implement and apply these methods using code examples.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before discussing image augmentation, we need to cover some basic concepts and terminology related to images. Let’s start with digital images. Digital images typically consist of pixels arranged in rows and columns where each pixel represents a particular color value (e.g., red, green, blue). Each pixel has its own unique location within the grid, which corresponds to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate values. We can think of a grayscale image as having only one channel (i.e., shades of grey), while an RGB image has three channels corresponding to red, green, and blue colors respectively. There are several ways to represent color information in digital images: intensity values, luminance values, chrominance values, hue/saturation values etc. In this article, we will mainly focus on color images represented using intensity and luminance values called GrayScale and Luminance Images respectively. These types of images typically have two dimensions representing height and width, and a single channel containing brightness values ranging from 0 to 255. Similarly, other color spaces like HSL, CMYK etc. can be converted into Gray Scale or Luminance format. A gray scale image is usually displayed on a black and white background, whereas a luminance image is usually displayed on a light or dark background depending on the gamma correction applied during rendering. 


Image rotation, scaling, flipping, cropping, shearing, adjusting contrast, brightness, blurring etc. are commonly referred to as transform operations and they involve changing the aspect ratio, position, and orientation of the image. Transformation operations can be performed directly on pixel level or on higher level features such as objects or parts of objects. For instance, if an object in an image is being rotated, all the pixels belonging to the object remain aligned according to the specified transformation operation. This means that when performing augmentation operations like random crop or horizontal flip, there could be multiple instances of the same object present in the cropped output even though the input was not modified by any physical changes. To avoid this issue, more complex techniques involving geometric mapping, masking, perspective warping or deformation should be considered. However, most of the popular transform operations used for deep learning tasks do not require such high-level processing and hence can be applied easily at pixel level. 


Now let's move onto image augmentation techniques. Different augmentation techniques can be classified based on whether they operate on pixel level or feature level. Feature-based approaches include color jittering, cutout, RandomErasing, autoaugment, mixup, CutMix, FMix, etc. They manipulate the underlying features of the image instead of individual pixels and may result in visual artifacts due to the transformation. On the other hand, pixel-based augmentations act directly on the pixel values of the images without modifying the underlying structure of the image itself. Some popular pixel-based augmentation techniques include brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, saturation adjustment, gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, JPEG compression, speckle noise, elastic deformations, motion blurring, spatter distortion, fogging effects, pixel dropouts, and image inpaintings. Some of them can help improve model performance and robustness against adversarial attacks, but others can cause noticeable artifacts and distortions that interfere with downstream tasks such as segmentation or detection. Therefore, it is important to carefully select the appropriate set of image augmentation techniques based on the type of task and nature of the dataset.
