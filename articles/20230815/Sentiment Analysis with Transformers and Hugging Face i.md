Sentiment analysis is one of the most important tasks in natural language processing (NLP) that involves analyzing textual data to identify the attitude or opinion towards a topic, product or service. There are several methods for sentiment analysis such as rule-based systems, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models based on neural networks. In this article we will use a transformer model called BERT to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews from IMDb dataset using PyTorch library in Python. We will also demonstrate how to fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on custom datasets for better performance. 

## Why do we need Sentiment Analysis?
Today's modern society has become increasingly conversational and social. People communicate with each other through online platforms like Facebook Messenger, Twitter, etc., which makes it easy to express their feelings towards different topics. On social media websites, people often share opinions about products, services, brands, and events by simply posting them without any prior judgment. To gain insights into these opinions, companies have started investing in sentiment analysis tools that help them understand what customers value and seek, thereby enabling them to make better business decisions. Additionally, businesses can use sentiment analysis techniques to improve customer satisfaction, enhance brand perception, market research, and sales efforts. Finally, governments and institutions can analyze public opinion and detect issues affecting citizens' safety, health, and wellbeing, thus making sure they act in accordance with their mandates and policies. Therefore, understanding human sentiment is crucial for all organizations today.

## What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis refers to the process of identifying and extracting subjective information, specifically attitudes and emotions, expressed in natural language text. It helps to determine whether the author's viewpoint is positive, negative, neutral, mixed, or irrelevant to the content being analyzed. The goal is to extract relevant features from unstructured text and derive insightful signals that can be used to make predictions, automate decision-making processes, and improve customer engagement.

The main components of sentiment analysis include: 

1. Lexicon/Dictionary-based approach - This involves classifying words or phrases according to a predefined set of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral, etc.). For example, "I am happy" can be labeled as positive while "I am sad" can be labeled as negative.

2. Rule-based system approach - This relies on rules and patterns extracted from linguistic literature, culture, and experience. These rules typically rely on verb conjugation, intonation, tone of voice, and emphasis to assign polarity scores to sentences. For instance, if a sentence includes certain words such as "amazing," "excellent," or "terrible," then its polarity score could be increased.

3. Machine Learning Approach - Most popular method used today for sentiment analysis. This involves training a supervised machine learning algorithm to learn from annotated data consisting of both text samples and corresponding labels indicating their respective sentiment values (e.g., positive, negative). Popular libraries like NLTK, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras provide support for implementing ML algorithms for sentiment analysis tasks.

4. Deep Learning Approach - This uses advanced neural network architectures that work on complex features learned from large amounts of unlabeled text data. These models are capable of capturing contextual relationships between words and inferencing on new inputs based on those relationships. Examples of state-of-the-art deep learning models for sentiment analysis include BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet.

5. Complexity and Accuracy of Sentiment Analysis Systems - The accuracy and complexity of sentiment analysis systems increases significantly over time. As the size of available corpus grows larger and more diverse, existing methods break down and require more sophisticated models and strategies to achieve high accuracy. The sheer volume of unstructured text data created every day challenges researchers to design robust and effective solutions for sentiment analysis.

## Understanding BERT and Hugging Face Library
Before starting our journey to perform sentiment analysis using transformers and hugging face library in python, let us first understand what is transformers and why do we need them?. 

Transformers are deep learning models that were introduced in July 2017 by Google Research team. They offer a simple yet powerful way of performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. These models use attention mechanism and self-attention layers to capture contextual dependencies between words in an input sequence. Transformers outperform traditional NLP models because they can handle long sequences efficiently and adapt dynamically to the input at test time. In addition, they are highly parallelizable and scalable allowing them to train on large-scale corpora and handle multiple languages easily. But, why did Google Research team build transformers instead of reinventing the wheel? The answer lies in advances in deep learning theory made possible by transformers. 

In recent years, various advancements in deep learning have led to significant improvements in many fields including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP), among others. In particular, transformer models have shown impressive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, including language modeling, machine translation, question answering, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and dialog systems. One key advantage of transformers over recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their ability to exploit the sequential nature of natural language data. While RNNs are known for their poor performance when applied to sequential data, CNNs excel at capturing local structures due to their linearity property. However, transformer models have shown excellent performance on all these tasks, even surpassing the best non-transformer approaches. Hence, transformers have been rapidly adopted as the dominant architecture for natural language processing.

Hugging Face is a company dedicated to building open source software for AI. It offers a collection of pretrained transformer models and provides support for developing and deploying NLP applications quickly and cost effectively. Hugging Face has developed several transformer-based models including BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and ALBERT. Each model can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation, question answering, and summarization. With Hugging Face, anyone can access state-of-the-art NLP models and start developing their own applications instantly. Thus, transformers and hugging face library have become critical technologies in the field of NLP.

Now that you know what transformers and hugging face library are, let's dive deeper into sentiment analysis using transformers and hugging face library in python.
