# 1.简介
  

Matrix completion and recommendation systems are two of the most popular problems in modern data science. Both types of tasks aim to predict missing entries or fill in a partially observed matrix with relevant information that can be used for various applications such as collaborative filtering, recommender systems, etc. In this survey paper, we will discuss about several learning methods for both these types of systems, which have been widely applied in recent years due to their effectiveness and efficiency. We will cover not only traditional machine learning algorithms but also deep learning based approaches. 

In summary, our article will explore different families of models: latent factor models (e.g., SVD++, NMF), neural networks, convolutional neural networks, hybrid models combining different learning paradigms like tree-based ensemble and rule-based models. Additionally, we will focus more specifically on how to handle large datasets efficiently by using stochastic gradient descent optimization techniques. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for researchers interested in applying state-of-the-art learning methods to solve these complex problems and advance the field of artificial intelligence. 

# 2.背景介绍
Matrix completion refers to the task of filling in incomplete or missing values in a matrix while maintaining its underlying structure. This problem is often encountered in many real-world scenarios where data are collected from multiple sources, some of them may contain missing values. Popular examples include collaborative filtering, recommender systems, bioinformatics and medical imaging analysis. Recommendation systems are attracting increasing attention because they offer personalized recommendations and help users find items that interest them. Collaborative filtering involves analyzing past behavior of users and suggesting products or services that might be interesting to them. However, these systems usually rely on explicit ratings or preferences provided by users, making it difficult to recommend new items or services without prior knowledge of user preferences.

Matrix completion has wide applications in industry including recommender systems, bioinformatics, scientific computing, and economics. There are numerous research efforts being made to address these problems and develop efficient algorithms to solve them. However, there is a need for better understanding of the existing approaches and effective solutions for handling large datasets in practice. With the ever-increasing amount of data generated every day, finding appropriate ways of dealing with sparse and noisy datasets becomes crucial. Therefore, this survey aims to highlight current research directions in addressing these challenging problems. Moreover, we hope this survey paper will serve as an introduction to the rapidly evolving area of matrix completion and recommendation systems, providing valuable insights into the latest advances and potential future trends.

# 3.基本概念术语说明
We first define commonly used terms and concepts used in matrix completion and recommendation systems. The following table lists some important terminology associated with matrix completion and recommendation systems:

Terminology | Definition
-----------|-----------
Matrix     | A rectangular array of numerical values representing entities and their corresponding attributes/features. It may contain missing values denoted as zeros or NaNs. For example, a movie rating matrix contains the number of times each person rated each movie.
Entity     | An item or object represented in a matrix, typically identified by rows and columns indices. For instance, if we represent movies by rows and actors by columns, then "Toy Story" would correspond to row index 1 and column index 7.
Attribute   | An aspect of an entity that contributes to its value. For instance, genre, age, duration, etc. are common attributes of a movie entity. Attributes appear along the columns of a matrix.
Nonzero    | Entries in a matrix that do not equal zero. Often called "observed".
Zero       | Entries in a matrix that equal zero. Often called "missing".
Latent      | Qualifier indicating that an attribute does not actually exist in reality but is instead inferred through observations. Latent factors refer to variables that capture hidden structures in a dataset.
User        | A person who interacts with the system and provides ratings for items. Examples include customers of a website, patients in a healthcare service, or readers in a book review site. Users form the rows of a matrix.
Item         | Something recommended to a user, such as a product, webpage, or book. Items form the columns of a matrix.
Rating       | A numeric score assigned to an item by a user. Ratings are often continuous values between one and five.
Feedback     | User feedback on whether an item was helpful or not, expressed as either positive (+) or negative (-). Feedback can be used to train a recommendation algorithm or evaluate its performance.
Ground truth | The actual ratings given by human evaluators when evaluating the results of a recommendation system. Ground truth can be used to compare the performance of different recommendation algorithms.
