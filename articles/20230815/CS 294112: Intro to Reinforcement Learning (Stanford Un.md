Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most active and fast-growing areas in artificial intelligence research. It has been used for robotics, gaming, finance, healthcare, and many other fields such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, etc. The goal of RL is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes long-term rewards while minimizing the costs or regret.

RL is a challenging problem because it involves both prediction and control. Prediction refers to understanding what happens in the future based on observations from the environment. Control, on the other hand, involves selecting actions that lead to desired outcomes by incorporating uncertainty into the decision making process. 

In this course, we will introduce fundamental concepts, algorithms, and techniques for designing and implementing deep reinforcement learning systems. We will discuss topics like model-free vs. model-based methods, exploration versus exploitation, temporal differences, policy gradients, Q-learning, deep Q-networks, actor-critic networks, etc. This course also includes hands-on programming assignments where you can apply your learned knowledge to build real-world applications in various domains like robotics, games, finance, etc. By completing these assignments, you will be able to understand how to design effective reinforcement learning systems and use them to solve complex problems. 

By the end of this course, you should have a good understanding of the core ideas and principles behind modern reinforcement learning and be ready to start building advanced AI systems using cutting-edge techniques in industry and academia. 





These courses cover a wide range of topics related to reinforcement learning, including game playing, machine learning, and optimization. Students taking these courses gain practical skills that include programming, algorithmic thinking, and working with large datasets. They may find them useful as supplementary materials to better understand the material covered in this introductory course.

Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about reinforcement learning, whether they are starting out or already familiar with it.

Before diving deeper into the main contents of the course, let's first review some important terms and concepts commonly used in RL. 

## Markov Decision Process (MDP)
An MDP represents the dynamics of a Markov chain. Each state s has a set of possible actions A(s), which deterministically transition the agent from the current state to another state s'. Given an action a, there is a probability distribution over next states P(s'|s,a), called the transition function or dynamics. Additionally, each state s has a reward function R(s), which specifies the reward obtained after reaching the state s. The MDP defines the complete joint behavior of the system, including all relevant variables such as state, action, reward, etc. An MDP is usually represented as Sigma X A -> P(X' | X, A), R(X).

## Reward hypothesis
The basic idea behind the reward hypothesis is that all goals or objectives in reinforcement learning can be formalized as maximization of expected rewards, rather than incremental improvements alone. The key observation is that agents take individual actions that maximize their expected return, given the present situation and information available about the future. This viewpoint leads to a powerful concept known as the value function, which assigns a scalar value to each state, representing its estimated utility. The value function can be used to evaluate the worth of arbitrary policies or behaviors, and thus to select actions according to their expected reward instead of just their immediate reward. The reward hypothesis implies that even when the task becomes impossible to achieve without reward feedback, human beings still do it through trial and error and subjective evaluation.

## Value iteration and Bellman equations
Value iteration is an iterative method to compute the optimal value function V^*(s) for a fixed policy π in an MDP. At each iteration t, we update the estimate of V^*(s) based on the updated values calculated at the previous iteration t-1. The calculation proceeds by computing the right-hand side of the Bellman equation for each state s. At time step t=0, we initialize the value functions to zero and assume that the initial state distribution is uniformly distributed among all states. Then, we repeat the following two steps until convergence:

1. Update the values of non-terminal states using the Bellman equation:

   V^(t+1)(s) = R(s) + Σa[δ_t+1 + γV^(t+1)(s')]
   
   where δ_t is the discount factor, typically close to 1 but less than 1, and V^(t+1)(s') is the maximum value of the next state under the same policy π. 
   
2. Improve the policy by choosing the action that maximizes the expected return for each state:

   π^(t+1)(.|s) ≝ argmax_a[R(s,a) + γE_{s'}π^(t)(.|s')]
   
   Here E_{s'}π^(t)(.|s') denotes the expected value of the next state s' given the current state s and the current policy π at time step t. We can further simplify the expression by observing that π^(t)(.|s') is only affected by π^(t)(.|s), so we can reuse the result at previous time step t-1 for the next iteration. 

Bellman equations provide a theoretical basis for solving the MDP. However, in practice, the choice between value iteration and policy iteration is often context dependent and requires careful tuning of hyperparameters. Moreover, computing exact solutions to the Bellman equations is computationally expensive, especially for large state spaces. Therefore, we often resort to approximate solution methods such as linear programming, dynamic programming, and neural network-based approximation methods.

## Exploration and Exploitation
In traditional supervised learning, we try to minimize the difference between our predicted outputs and true labels during training. This approach is called empirical risk minimization (ERM). In contrast, in RL, we want to balance exploring new states and exploiting the knowledge acquired from prior experiences. The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation determines how responsive the agent is to new situations. 

### Exploration
Exploration means trying out different actions to see if we can improve our estimates of the value function. One way to explore new states is to randomly sample actions from a probabilistic policy. Another way is to follow a prescribed behavior policy guided by exploration noise added to the action probabilities. For example, the epsilon-greedy strategy adds small random noise to the probability distribution to encourage exploration.

### Exploitation
Exploitation means acting optimally given the current knowledge, assuming that the best action always leads to higher rewards. There are several ways to exploit knowledge: 

1. Optimal Policy Iteration: Start with an arbitrary initialization of the value function and policy, then repeatedly perform policy improvement iterations until convergence. At each iteration, we update the value function based on the updated values calculated at the previous iteration, and choose the action that maximizes the expected return for each state using the updated value function and the current policy. Eventually, we converge to a near-optimal policy that balances exploration and exploitation depending on the nature of the environment. 

2. Softmax policy: Instead of choosing the action that gives us the highest probability under the current policy, we assign low probabilities to suboptimal actions and smooth them out by applying temperature scaling. With a high temperature, softmax behaves much like greedy exploration; with a low temperature, softmax approaches the global optimum. 

3. Upper confidence bound (UCB) policy: UCB selects the action with the highest upper confidence bound (exploitability plus a bonus term that takes into account our uncertainty about the best action). We estimate the uncertainty of each action using a posterior distribution derived from samples generated by the behavior policy. Intuitively, the more confident we are about an action, the more likely we are to select it.

We can combine exploration and exploitation by combining the strength of the behavior policy with the guidance from the estimation errors of the value function to generate novel actions. As a rule of thumb, the greater the entropy of the policy, the lower the intrinsic motivation to explore, whereas a high-variance behavior policy can lead to uncontrolled exploration due to variance reduction across similar states.
