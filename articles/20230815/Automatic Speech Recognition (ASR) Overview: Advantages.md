Automatic speech recognition (ASR), also known as automatic language identification or natural language understanding (NLU), is the task of converting human speech into text by an AI system that can understand and produce written language. It is widely used in various domains such as conversational systems, personal assistants, customer service applications, search engines, mobile apps, media content platforms etc. In this article we will explore how ASR works, its main advantages, challenges and potential use cases. 

The development of artificial intelligence has made significant progress towards making machines speak like humans and understand natural language. Despite these advances, there are still many challenges associated with building robust and accurate speech recognition systems. This article discusses some of the key concepts involved in ASR, explains the basic algorithms behind it, presents a step-by-step process for performing ASR and demonstrates examples using Python programming language. The article ends with a discussion on future trends and potential uses of ASR technology. We hope that this overview article provides a comprehensive framework for newcomers to get started with ASR technology and helps them understand the essential concepts and principles underpinning this field. 

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
## 2.1 Speech Recognition System Architecture
An ASR system consists of four main components - speech recording devices, voice activity detection, feature extraction, and classifier/decoder. These components work together to convert audio signals recorded from the microphone into corresponding words spoken in real time. Let’s take a look at each component individually.

1. **Speech Recording Device** : A device that captures sound waves through a microphone. Microphones typically have multiple channels that capture individual sounds or frequencies independently. Common types of microphones include electret recordings, acoustic echo cancellers, and active noise cancellation microphones.

2. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** : VAD processes the captured audio signal to detect whether a person is speaking. There are several techniques available for VAD including peak detection threshold, energy-based models, Hidden Markov Models and deep neural networks. Peak detection based approach involves identifying locations where the amplitude of the signal exceeds a certain threshold value, which indicates the start or end of speech segments. Energy-based approaches involve calculating the energy of the signal throughout time and detecting regions with varying levels of energy. HMM and DNN models require training data and may not perform well in all scenarios due to their high computational complexity. 

3. **Feature Extraction** : Feature extraction refers to the process of transforming raw audio into a set of features that can be fed into machine learning algorithms. Popular feature extraction methods include Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), filter bank analysis, and waveform subband representations. MFCCs represent the frequency characteristics of the signal by mapping the power spectrum of the signal across different frequency bands to coefficients. Filter bank analysis computes a weighted sum of filter banks of different sizes over the signal to extract local descriptors. Subband representation involves breaking down the frequency band of the signal into subbands and computing features separately for each subband.

4. **Classifier/Decoder** : The final stage of the ASR system converts the extracted features into text by applying classification or decoding algorithm. Classifiers usually consist of decision trees or linear regression models trained on labeled dataset of speech samples and utterance labels. Decoders usually involve statistical language models such as n-grams or HMMs that estimate the probability of the next word given the sequence of previous words. Some commonly used classifiers and decoders include Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (DNN), n-gram models, and hidden markov models.

## 2.2 Types of Speech Recognition Systems
### 2.2.1 Keyword Spotting
Keyword spotting is the simplest type of ASR system. It scans an input stream of audio data for predefined keywords or phrases, and outputs the identified keyword when it is detected in the input audio. For example, if the user wants Alexa to respond only when she hears “Alexa”, her assistant would listen continuously to the microphone until it encounters the keyword "Alexa". Once triggered, the assistant would immediately output the recognized keyword, say "Alexa", without waiting for further input. As simple as keyword spotting may seem, it suffers from a number of drawbacks including low accuracy, limited vocabulary size, and sensitivity to background noise. Additionally, the model requires constant update of the keyword list whenever new words become popular.

### 2.2.2 Continuous Speech Recognition
Continuous speech recognition is another class of ASR systems that continues to recognize the user's speech even after they stop speaking. Continuous speech recognition systems utilize deep learning techniques to automatically learn patterns in the speaker's speech and build grammars and rule sets that enable recognizing what the user is saying. An example of such a system is Google Assistant or Amazon Echo. On the other hand, continuous speech recognition requires more computational resources than traditional keyword spotters, and hence, it may not always be suitable for embedded applications or resource-constrained environments.

### 2.2.3 Language Identification and Transcription
Language identification and transcription are closely related tasks that involve both automated processing of speech and the determination of the source language. Traditionally, most language identification systems employed rule-based approaches based on linguistic cues such as phonemes, syllables, and stress patterns. With the advent of large scale datasets, recent research has focused on developing models that exploit these linguistic cues effectively. One such technique is deep neural network-based sequence modeling, where an LSTM-RNN architecture is trained to predict the likelihood of each possible token in the target language conditional on the previously generated tokens. Another important aspect of language identification is the need to accurately handle noisy and incomplete speech.

Finally, language transcription involves taking the output of an ASR system and reassembling it into a meaningful sentence or phrase. One common method for language translation is to align the phonological and semantic structure between two languages while preserving the pronunciation variations. However, this may not always be sufficient since different languages may use different conventions and tone of voice. To address this challenge, advanced machine learning techniques may leverage external resources such as dictionaries, terminologies, and translations corpora.
