Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding of digital images and videos. It involves the following techniques: image acquisition, processing, analysis, modeling, and representation. 

The goal of computer vision is to understand the content of images or video frames in terms of its structure, motion, lighting, color, shape, and texture. In order to achieve this goal, a variety of algorithms have been developed, ranging from simple pattern recognition methods like edge detection to advanced machine learning approaches based on deep neural networks. 

In this book, we will cover several key topics related to computer vision, including image acquisition, image filtering, segmentation, object detection, facial recognition, stereo vision, and panorama imaging. We will also discuss common challenges and limitations when working with these technologies, as well as potential applications for each technique. Finally, we will conclude by discussing emerging trends and future directions for research in computer vision. 

This book is intended for anyone interested in developing cutting-edge technology or applying it to real-world problems. It covers foundational concepts and principles as well as state-of-the-art research results, making it useful for both newcomers and experts alike who want to learn more about computer vision.

# 2. 基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the core topics of this book, let’s first clarify some basic terminology and notation. 

1. Image: An image is a two-dimensional array of pixel values representing the intensities of the brightness in various wavelengths of light passing through an area of the scene. Images usually come in different formats, such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, etc.

2. Color space: A color space represents the way colors are represented in terms of combinations of primary colors—red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, black, white, etc. Different color spaces may be used depending on the characteristics of the input data or the desired output format. Common color spaces include RGB (Red Green Blue), HSV (Hue Saturation Value), YCbCr (Luma Chrominance), CMYK (Cyan Magenta Yellow Black), XYZ (CIE 1931 XYZ), and Lab (CIELAB).

3. Camera: A camera is a device that captures and records images by illuminating the scene using lenses, projectors, mirrors, etc. Cameras typically produce images at a certain resolution and frame rate, known as the sensor size and framerate respectively. There are many types of cameras, including DSLR (digital single lens reflex), CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor), LCD (light-emitting diode), OLED (organic LED), etc.

4. Pixel: A pixel is the smallest meaningful element in an image, consisting of a combination of intensity values in all three color channels red, green, and blue. A typical image has thousands to millions of pixels arranged in a grid-like pattern. 

5. Exposure time: The amount of time that the shutter opens while capturing an image, measured in seconds. Long exposure times allow for greater depth of field, whereas short exposure times create less blurry images. 

6. Focus stack: A focus stack is an ordered set of multiple overlapping images captured with different focuses and exposure settings to obtain a focused composite image.

7. Optical flow: Optical flow describes the movement of objects in scenes between consecutive frames. Techniques such as Lucas-Kanade algorithm and Horn-Schunck algorithm are commonly used to estimate optical flow vectors. 

8. Region of interest (ROI): A region of interest is a subsection of an image within which a particular operation needs to be performed. ROIs are often used during image processing tasks such as feature extraction or classification, where only part of the entire image is relevant. 

9. Depth map: A depth map is a grayscale image showing the distance from the camera to the corresponding pixel in the original image, scaled according to some predefined unit of measurement, such as millimeters or meters.

10. Histogram: A histogram shows the distribution of pixel intensities in an image along one dimension, such as intensity versus frequency or hue versus frequency.

11. Blurring: Blurring is the process of removing spatial noise from an image, resulting in a blurred version of the original image. Several blurring techniques exist, including Gaussian smoothing, bilateral filtering, median filtering, and non-local means. 

12. Noise reduction: Noise reduction refers to techniques that reduce the level of random variations in an image without significantly degrading the image details. Typical noise reduction techniques include Gaussian filtering, mean shift, Wiener filter, total variation denoising, and TV-L1 regularization. 

13. Image pyramid: An image pyramid is a multi-resolution approach to represent an image at multiple scales. Each successive scale of the pyramid is half the width and height of the previous one, until eventually reaching a small enough size. The final layer of the pyramid contains the lowest-resolution image, while subsequent layers contain increasingly higher-resolution versions of the same image. 

14. Texture descriptor: A texture descriptor is a compact and efficient way of characterizing the appearance of an image. Typically, texture descriptors rely on statistical measures, such as variance, entropy, and correlation coefficients, to describe the visual features present in the image. 

15. Deep learning: Deep learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that leverages large sets of training examples to automatically extract complex patterns from raw data. Neural networks are composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that take inputs, transform them through activation functions, and generate outputs. 

16. Convolutional neural network (CNN): A CNN is a type of neural network architecture designed specifically for image recognition tasks. It consists of alternating convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers for classification or regression. 

17. Recurrent neural network (RNN): An RNN is a class of neural network architectures that are particularly well suited for sequential prediction tasks, such as language models or speech recognition. It consists of repeated iterations over the input sequence, maintaining a hidden state vector that encodes information from previously seen elements of the sequence.

18. GAN: A GAN is a type of generative adversarial model that learns to simulate the joint distribution of the input and output variables. The generator learns to map random samples back to the input domain, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between generated and true samples. 

19. Supervised learning: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a teacher provides the correct answers or labels for training data, and the algorithm learns to identify patterns in the data to minimize errors. Examples of supervised learning tasks include image classification, object detection, and speech recognition. 

20. Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm identifies patterns in the data without being provided any explicit labels. Examples of unsupervised learning tasks include clustering, anomaly detection, and density estimation.
