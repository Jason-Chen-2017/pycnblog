Text classification is a common NLP task in which we need to assign labels or categories to text data based on its content and contextual features. This article will explain how to implement Text Classification using TensorFlow 2.0 framework with Python code. We are going to follow below seven steps for implementing this task:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Tokenization
3. Embedding Layer
4. Model Building
5. Training the model
6. Evaluation of the model
7. Prediction on new data
Let's dive into each step one by one. Firstly, let’s understand what is Text Classification?
## What is Text Classification?
The term "text classification" refers to assigning a category label or class to a given piece of text according to its semantic meaning or content. It has several applications including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, spam detection, product categorization, etc. The main aim of this task is to classify documents or sentences into predefined classes/categories that can be used later for various downstream tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation, recommendation systems, etc. In order to solve this problem, we need to represent the input text data in a way that it captures relevant features about its semantics and structure. These features can include words, phrases, n-grams, patterns, and more. Once these features have been extracted, we use them to train a machine learning algorithm to learn patterns from the training dataset and then apply those learned patterns to predict the corresponding output (category) for an unseen test document. 

To implement Text Classification, we need to perform following steps:

1. Load the Dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Extract Features
4. Build the Model
5. Train the Model
6. Evaluate the Model
7. Make Predictions on New Data
Each of the above mentioned steps has specific requirements like formatting of the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, preprocessing techniques to remove noise and redundancy from the data, feature extraction methods to extract meaningful features from the preprocessed text data, different types of models and hyperparameters that need to be tuned for achieving best results, evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of our trained model, and finally, making predictions on new text data. Let's discuss each of these steps in detail. Before that, let me give you brief overview of some important concepts related to text classification.
# 2.1 Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before proceeding further, I would like to clarify some basic concepts and terminologies that we might encounter while working on text classification problems.

**Dataset:** A collection of labeled examples where each example consists of a set of text inputs paired with their respective target outputs or labels. There are several datasets available for text classification such as IMDB movie review dataset, Reuters news dataset, Amazon reviews dataset, Yelp review dataset etc., and each of them contains multiple classes of text along with their associated label(s). Depending on the size and complexity of the dataset, different approaches could be taken for handling this challenge. Some popular strategies for dealing with large datasets include sampling, oversampling, undersampling, cross validation, and batch processing.

**Preprocessing:** A series of operations applied to clean, normalize, transform, or enhance the raw text data before feeding it to the model. This includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, punctuation removal, case folding, and other text cleaning processes. The goal of preprocessing is to reduce the noise and redundancy present in the text data and capture only the significant features required for text classification.

**Feature Extraction:** Process of converting the preprocessed text data into numerical representations suitable for training a Machine Learning algorithm. Common feature extraction methods include Bag of Words, Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF), Hashing Vectorizer, CountVectorizer, N-gram, Character Level, and Subword Level Encoding Methods.

**Model Selection:** Choosing the right type of model for solving text classification problem depends on the nature and size of the dataset. Some popular models for text classification include Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Hyperparameters are parameters whose values cannot be estimated from the data itself but rather they must be chosen by a human. They affect the behavior of a model during training process and directly influence the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the final model. Different hyperparameters such as learning rate, regularization strength, number of layers, dropout rates, optimizer choices, activation functions, etc. should be carefully tuned for optimizing the performance of the model on the given dataset.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Measures used to assess the performance of a text classification model. Some commonly used metrics for evaluating text classification models are Accuracy Score, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross Entropy Loss, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, Hamming Loss, etc.

Now that we have a clear understanding of the basics, let's move onto the actual implementation part.
