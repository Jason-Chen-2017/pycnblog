Therapy is an important component in the healthcare industry that aims to provide patients with a meaningful and effective way to communicate and interact with their medical professionals. Therefore, conversational agents are essential components in therapeutic dialogue systems that can generate highly personalized messages or interact with users based on different needs and preferences. While there have been several works focusing on optimizing resource utilization of such systems, most of them focused either on improving response time or reducing power consumption while maintaining accuracy. However, little attention has been paid towards optimizing both resource efficiency and usability. In this paper, we aim to optimize resource utilization by considering user's input modality, session length, computational complexity, and memory usage. We propose three techniques to reduce system latency, energy consumption, and increase task completion rate: (i) frame skipping, (ii) context aggregation, and (iii) batch processing. By combining these techniques, our optimized conversational agent framework reduces overall latency, saves energy, and increases task completion rate without compromising accuracy. Our evaluation results show that the proposed methods significantly improve performance metrics compared to baseline models. Overall, our work provides a solid foundation for future research in optimizing resource utilization of conversational agents for therapeutic dialogues.

3.研究背景及意义
In today’s world, human beings rely heavily on chatbots to get things done and connect with others online. With the rise of digital assistants like Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, or Cortana, chatbot platforms have become increasingly popular among consumers. The popularity of chatbots has also led to various use cases such as customer support, sales and marketing, appointment scheduling, restaurant reservations, job search, travel booking, etc. These services make up a significant portion of e-commerce transactions. 

However, therapeutic conversations require more complex interactions between patients and healthcare providers, requiring additional features such as visual presentation, multimodal interaction, and flexible information sharing. Moreover, therapists prefer to spend less time waiting for responses or interacting with other people. Hence, developing conversational agents with enhanced abilities to handle these types of scenarios requires a fundamental shift in design principles, specifically in terms of resource optimization. 

The goal of this project is to develop an optimized conversational agent framework for handling the challenges of real-time dialogue management in therapeutic scenarios. Specifically, we aim to address the following problems:

1. Latency: Conversational agents should respond within milliseconds so that the patient does not feel slowed down. To achieve low latency, we need to ensure optimal resource allocation across multiple modules including cognitive reasoning, knowledge base lookup, and machine learning model inference.

2. Power Consumption: Many devices are now powered solely by batteries which limits their lifetime. To save battery life, we need to minimize CPU and memory usage and find efficient ways of processing large volumes of data. 

3. Usability: Patient-doctor communication requires ease of navigation and naturalness in speech synthesis, prosody, and tone of voice. To improve the conversation experience, we need to incorporate a variety of feedback mechanisms into the conversation, providing options that reflect the desired level of engagement.

4. Task Completion Rate: Therapy sessions involve tasks ranging from assessments to physical examinations, surgeries, diagnosis procedures, and psychological treatments. To maintain task focus and motivation, the conversation needs to prompt only relevant information and offer clear next steps.

5. Scalability: As the number of patients grows over time, it becomes essential to scale the conversational agent architecture efficiently and effectively. The current architecture relies on central servers, message queueing infrastructure, and database storage, each of which leads to scalability issues.

To meet the above requirements, we propose three technical solutions - frame skipping, context aggregation, and batch processing - that combine to reduce system latency, save energy, and enhance task completion rate, respectively. Finally, we evaluate our approach using standard benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimentation.
