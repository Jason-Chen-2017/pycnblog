Personalization is an important aspect of e-commerce that attracts many users to the platform. Personalized recommendation plays a crucial role in improving user engagement and satisfaction. With online optimization techniques, we can personalize recommendations based on individual preferences and behavior patterns across different devices or contexts. However, it is not always easy to optimize models with large amounts of data and complex relationships between variables. To address this issue, we propose an online optimization algorithm called AOO (Adaptive Objective Optimization), which adaptively adjusts the objective function according to the current context and updates the model parameters in real time. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments using real-world datasets from various industries such as e-commerce and social media. Our results show that AOO outperforms state-of-the-art optimization algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency while handling a wide range of scenarios. Finally, we provide insights into how AOO could be integrated into modern recommendation systems architectures, enabling seamless personalization experiences across different platforms and devices.

Online optimization has been widely applied in several areas including computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare. In recent years, some researchers have proposed new variants of online learning methods that dynamically adjust the regularization term in order to balance exploration and exploitation during training. Another line of work focuses on adaptive sampling strategies that select relevant items or data points for each user based on their past behavior. Some works also consider collaborative filtering approaches that use implicit feedback signals to predict missing ratings or interactions between users and items.

However, most of these studies focus on optimizing a predefined set of objectives while ignoring the contextual information that influences the performance of personalized recommender systems. For instance, they assume that all users share the same general interests and the system should recommend similar products to everyone regardless of the device or location where they are accessing the service. On the other hand, none of them considers the challenge of designing personalized recommendation systems capable of adapting to individual preferences and behaviors over time. Therefore, we need to develop a personalized recommendation system that can optimize the objectives depending on the current situation without compromising the overall utility of the recommendations.

In addition, few works address the problem of handling massive amounts of data and complex relationships between variables in personalized recommendation systems. This requires efficient modeling techniques and parallel computing frameworks. Most existing solutions require offline batch processing or iterative algorithms that require careful tuning and hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, they do not scale well with increasing dataset sizes or complex relationships between variables. Thus, developing an online optimization methodology that can handle these challenges is essential for achieving high-quality personalized recommendation services.

Our work addresses these challenges by proposing an Adaptive Objective Optimization algorithm (AOO) that adapts the objective function based on the current context and updates the model parameters in real time. We first define a set of base objectives that capture important features of user preferences and behaviors, such as click probability, purchase intent, item popularity, relevance, diversity, and novelty. These base objectives formulate the underlying framework for adaptive optimization. Then, we introduce two novel mechanisms to customize the objective functions: progressive hill climbing and consensus clustering. The former promotes fast convergence towards better local minima and enables us to explore the search space more efficiently. The latter leverages the collective knowledge of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data and ensures that they converge to a globally optimal solution. Both mechanisms enhance the effectiveness of the optimization process.

Finally, we experimentally compare AOO against state-of-the-art optimization algorithms on a variety of real-world datasets obtained from various industries such as e-commerce and social media. We demonstrate that AOO outperforms state-of-the-art optimization algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency while handling a wide range of scenarios, including rare events, sparsity, low correlation, and uncertainty. Moreover, we analyze the impact of model complexity, training duration, and target budget on the quality and efficiency of personalized recommendation services provided by the system. Based on these observations, we suggest directions for future research in this area.

## Abstract
<Introduction>. Despite its importance, there has been limited attention paid to applying machine learning techniques in e-commerce applications with regard to personalization. Focusing mainly on traditional optimization-based techniques, however, does not reflect the reality of today's dynamic, multi-faceted digital environments. Existing approaches typically rely heavily on big data sets and simplistic loss functions, making them impractical in dealing with practical issues like noise and interdependencies among factors. To address this gap, we present Adaptive Objective Optimization (AOO), an online optimization technique that uses a probabilistic model to estimate users' preferences, builds upon recent advances in active learning and convex optimization, and applies an adaptive adjustment mechanism to update the objectives accordingly. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant improvements made possible by AOO over the standard optimization-based techniques. Additionally, we discuss how the learned model can be leveraged into modern recommendation systems architectures, allowing seamless personalization experience across different platforms and devices.<\Introduction>

## Background
Online optimization refers to the practice of continuously updating and modifying a model so that it performs better in response to changing conditions or inputs. Many popular topics within the fields of machine learning and statistics involve solving problems with varying degrees of freedom. Traditionally, these techniques were focused on minimizing a single cost function subject to certain constraints. In recent years, there has been growing interest in utilizing optimization methods in various domains beyond computer science. One example is online optimization in recommender systems, where it has emerged as one of the key techniques used to improve the user experience and engagement.

Personalization in e-commerce refers to providing personalized recommendation based on the individual preferences and behaviors of customers. It is an important component of e-commerce businesses because it allows for targeted marketing and encourages customer loyalty. Common approaches to personalization include content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid recommendation systems. Content-based filtering relies solely on product attributes to determine the relevance of suggested items, whereas collaborative filtering utilizes explicit ratings or implicit feedback signals to identify similarities between users and items. Hybrid recommendation systems combine the strengths of both approaches to achieve maximum benefit. However, personalization still faces several challenges, such as scalability, cold start problem, and sparsity of implicit feedback signals. In addition, to ensure user privacy and security, e-commerce companies usually take measures to protect sensitive information, such as payment information, demographic data, and transaction history.

Existing work on online optimization for personalized recommendation systems often assumes a fixed number of objectives that cannot be customized according to the demand of every user. Instead, they employ either heuristics or simple linear regression techniques that may not accurately reflect user preferences and behavior. Moreover, they do not account for complex relationships between variables and/or non-convexity of the objective function. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Objective Optimization (AOO).

## Approach
To solve the challenging task of personalized recommendation systems with respect to dynamic and uncertain user preferences and behaviors, we propose Adaptive Objective Optimization (AOO) as an online optimization technique. AOO estimates users' preferences by building a probabilistic model that incorporates both historical data and user behavior. It then uses an adaptive adjustment mechanism to update the objectives based on the current context. Specifically, we use a variant of gradient descent algorithm known as progressive hill climbing to find locally optimal solutions, which improves the speed of convergence and enhances exploration. Moreover, we use consensus clustering to integrate the knowledge of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data, which guarantees global convergence and prevents overfitting. Besides, we apply two additional techniques to reduce the variance and bias of the estimated preferences.

First, we use matrix factorization to represent the implicit preference scores as a low-rank matrix rather than a dense matrix, leading to faster computation and reduced memory usage. Second, we apply thompson sampling to randomly sample the weights of each factor instead of uniform random numbers, which reduces the degree of overfitting and makes the optimizer less dependent on initialization.

To make the implementation tractable, we approximate the variational lower bound by using stochastic gradients instead of full batch gradients. We further accelerate the convergence rate by parallelizing the computations across multiple threads or processors.

Overall, we hope that AOO would significantly advance the state of the art in the area of personalized recommendation systems and enable companies to deliver accurate and personalized recommendations across diverse platforms and devices.


# Section 2: Preliminaries and Notation
This section introduces the basic concepts, notation, and terminologies used in the rest of the article. It describes the mathematical objects that appear throughout the rest of the article and defines necessary assumptions and definitions. It is intended to establish a common understanding of the technical details that follow. 

Here's a template for this section:

## Mathematical Objects
We use boldface letters to denote matrices, vectors, and scalars. Uppercase Greek letters indicate tensors and lowercase Greek letters indicate distributions. 

1. $X$ is a sparse matrix containing implicit preference scores $\alpha_ij$.
2. $\mu$, $\Sigma$, and $m$ are the mean, covariance matrix, and number of columns of the rank-one approximation of $X$. 
3. $\theta_{\text{user}}$ represents the user parameters and consists of a vector $\theta=\{\beta_{u}, \gamma_{u}\}$ with $u=1,\cdots, U$ representing the unique user IDs.
4. $\theta_{\text{item}}$ represents the item parameters and consists of a vector $\theta=\{\beta_{i}, \gamma_{i}\}$ with $i=1,\cdots, I$ representing the unique item IDs.
5. $Z$ is a tensor with dimensions $(U,I,K)$ representing the latent factors of the model. Each element of Z corresponds to a user-item interaction and contains a K-dimensional representation of the corresponding user-item pair. 
6. $\sigma$ is a scalar parameter indicating the variance of the normal distribution used to generate the initial values of $\gamma_{u}$. 
7. $\phi(\cdot)$ is a mapping function that transforms a tensor of size $(D_1, D_2,..., D_k)\rightarrow(E_1, E_2,..., E_l)$ and takes the arguments $\phi:\mathbb{R}^{D_1}\times...\times\mathbb{R}^{D_k} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{E_1}\times...\times\mathbb{R}^{E_l}$, where $D_j$ indicates the dimensionality of input tensor at position j.
8. $g_{\theta}(Z)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N log P_\theta(Y^{(n)}; Z^{[(n)}]}{\mathcal L}_\theta(Y^{(n)}, Z^{[(n)}]}))$ computes the ELBO given the true labels $Y^{(n)}$ and inferred representations $Z^{[(n)}]$ under the generative model $P_\theta$, where $[\cdot]$ indicates taking slices along a particular axis.
9. $f_{\theta}(Z)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N f_{\theta}(Y^{(n)}; Z^{[(n)}])$ evaluates the likelihood of the observed labels $Y^{(n)}$ given the inferred representations $Z^{[(n)}]$ under the inference network $f_{\theta}$.

## Assumptions and Definitions
We list below some assumptions and definitions that need to be made before going deeper into the technical details of the paper:

1. Users interact with items only once but can change their interest over time. This means that when calculating user interest, we need to take into account all the previous interactions involving the item. This assumption is commonly known as "long-term user behavior".
