# 1.简介
  


In this book, you will learn about the fundamental concepts of computation and algorithms in a purely functional programming style. You'll understand how to write functions that compute values based on inputs, store state information, manipulate data structures, and handle errors without any side effects or mutable global variables. In addition, you'll be introduced to important mathematical topics such as recursion and graph theory, which are used in algorithm design and analysis. By the end of this book, you should have a good understanding of core computational ideas and how they apply to software development. 

# 2.What is Computation?

Computation refers to the process of translating input into output using algorithms. It's an essential part of computing today because it enables us to automate tasks that were previously done manually. But what do we mean by "computing"? We can think of computation as follows:

1. Input: The input to a computer program is usually some kind of data. This could be text, images, videos, sound files, etc. 

2. Processing: Once the input has been provided, the program performs various operations on the data to produce results. These operations might include sorting, searching, transforming, analyzing, generating reports, playing music, or communicating with other devices over networks. 

3. Output: Finally, the computed result is presented back to the user in the form of text, graphics, audio, video, etc. Users interact with these outputs by interacting with the program itself or by sending commands via a keyboard or mouse. 

Thus, computation is all about taking input, processing it through instructions, and producing output for users to see and use. And since computers don't possess visual or auditory senses, our human brains must interpret the output ourselves if we want to make meaningful decisions based on the information provided by the computer. 

Therefore, computation involves a combination of hardware (i.e., CPU), operating system (OS), programs/software, and data. Along with the physical limitations imposed by electronics, digitalization also creates new challenges for developers who need to manage large amounts of data efficiently and effectively while adhering to ethical principles. 

# 3.What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules used to solve a specific problem or perform a specific task. An algorithm typically takes some input data, processes it according to its specifications, and produces some desired output. However, unlike regular programs, algorithms are designed to work independently from one another and may involve multiple iterations to obtain the desired result. They may require long periods of time to execute, making them particularly useful in situations where efficiency matters, such as simulations or cryptography. 

Algorithms are defined by their inputs, outputs, and steps, along with constraints on the resources required to run them. Additionally, algorithms often incorporate conditional statements, loops, and branching logic to achieve complex behaviors and improve performance. Together, algorithms define a set of procedures that can be implemented using different programming languages. 

# 4.The Core Concepts

This chapter introduces several core concepts related to computation and algorithms, including high-level abstractions, low-level details, and parallelism.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of representing complex systems by simplifying them into more abstract representations. For example, when working with complex natural phenomena, scientists often simplify them into abstract models called physical laws. Similarly, when writing code, engineers sometimes create higher-level abstractions by combining simpler components. Abstraction helps us reason about complex systems at a much higher level than would otherwise be possible.

For instance, let's consider a simple example. Suppose you're building a car. One way to represent the car's behavior would be to break it down into smaller parts, such as fuel injection, braking, acceleration, and gear shifting. Another approach would be to represent the car's behavior as a single system that responds dynamically to changes in its environment. Both approaches are valid ways of thinking, but the second approach is usually simpler to implement.

Similarly, in mathematics, abstraction allows us to focus on patterns rather than individual numbers or equations. For example, suppose we're interested in solving a system of differential equations that describes the motion of a pendulum. We can represent the equation in terms of generalized coordinates $(q_1, q_2)$ instead of specifying exact values of $l$, $\theta$, $\dot{l}$, and $\dot{\theta}$. Abstraction makes it easier to identify underlying structure and meaning in problems, which can save us time and effort in the long run.

## Low-Level Details

Low-level details refer to the implementation of algorithms. Specifically, low-level details include hardware architectures, instruction sets, memory management techniques, synchronization primitives, and I/O protocols. When implementing an algorithm, we need to ensure that each piece works correctly and efficiently, regardless of whether it was developed using modern programming languages like Python or C++.

Hardware architecture refers to the organization and layout of components inside a computer. Modern CPUs come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from microcontrollers to supercomputers. Each type of processor has its own unique characteristics, such as clock speed, size, number of cores, and cache memory. Operating system controls access to system resources and allocates processing power to applications running on top of it. Memory management techniques determine how applications allocate and release memory during execution. Synchronization primitives allow threads to safely share resources and coordinate their activities. I/O protocols specify how software communicates with peripherals such as printers, speakers, and monitors.

Instruction sets specify the basic operations available to the CPU. Different processors may support different instruction sets depending on their capabilities. Instruction sets typically consist of basic arithmetic, logical, comparison, bit manipulation, control flow, and data movement instructions.

Memory management includes allocating and releasing memory space, managing caches, and tracking usage statistics. To optimize memory usage, compilers and runtime environments may use heuristics and algorithms to selectively discard unused memory, move frequently accessed data to faster storage media, and reclaim memory space once it becomes unused.

Synchronization primitives enable threads to communicate and synchronize their activities. Mutexes and semaphores are two common types of synchronization primitives. Mutexes prevent multiple threads from accessing shared data simultaneously, while semaphores allow threads to signal waiting threads that some condition has been met. Other synchronization mechanisms such as barriers, monitors, and readers-writer locks provide additional flexibility and features.

I/O protocols specify how software communicates with external devices. Examples include serial communication (UART, SPI, I²C), network communication (TCP/IP), and graphical interfaces (X Window System).

Overall, low-level details help ensure that our computations are efficient and accurate even under heavy load and irregular conditions. Without proper planning and care, we risk wasting valuable time and resources optimizing code that doesn't actually contribute to our goals.

## Parallelism

Parallelism refers to the ability of a computer to operate concurrently on multiple tasks simultaneously. While traditional programs execute serially, parallel programs take advantage of multiprocessors and multiple threads to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Asynchronous parallelism enables tasks to complete out-of-order, improving overall throughput. Parallelization can significantly reduce execution times and improve resource utilization, especially in cases where multiple cores or processors are present.

Traditional sequential programs can easily saturate a single core or processor. With parallelization, however, we can spread the workload across multiple processors or cores. Traditionally, parallelization has focused on multicore machines, but increasing levels of concurrency have recently been realized with accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Even small clusters of commodity servers offer significant potential for parallelism, enabling distributed computing and big data analytics.

To take full advantage of parallelism, we need to identify opportunities for parallelism within our algorithms and then optimize those sections accordingly. There are three main sources of parallelism:

1. Data Parallelism: Where independent calculations are performed on multiple pieces of data simultaneously. Popular examples include matrix multiplication, image processing, and neural network training.

2. Task Parallelism: Where tasks are assigned to multiple threads or processors for simultaneous execution. Popular examples include web crawling, computational geometry, and machine learning.

3. Distributed Computing: Where computations are distributed among multiple nodes in a cluster or cloud computing infrastructure. Popular technologies include Hadoop, Spark, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
