# 1.简介
  

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been the driving force behind the rapid development of artificial intelligence and robotics in recent years. In this article, we will briefly introduce deep Q-network (DQN), a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that applies neural networks to solve problems through trial-and-error using experience replay and target network updating. We will then show how DQN can be used for various real world tasks such as playing Atari games or controlling robotic arms. Finally, we will discuss potential improvements and challenges ahead in applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms in complex real-world environments.

In this article, we assume readers have some familiarity with AI/ML terminology and basic RL concepts like state space, action space, agent decision making process, and reward function. If you are not familiar with these terms and ideas, it may still be possible to understand the main points but please do not hesitate to ask questions if needed.

# 2. Basic Concepts
## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) refers to an area of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions based on feedback from its environment. The goal of the agent is to learn how to achieve the highest long-term reward by taking actions in an uncertain environment. 

The agent interacts with its environment via observations and takes actions in response. It receives rewards after performing actions, which provide guidance on how well the agent performed. As the agent observes more states and achieves higher rewards, it becomes better at selecting optimal actions over time.

In RL, there are two types of agents:

1. **Model-based**: These agents build their own internal models of the environment and use them to select actions. They require a large amount of training data and may struggle to generalize to new situations.
2. **Model-free**: These agents do not rely on explicit modeling of the environment, instead they use trial-and-error methods to explore the environment and discover new information. Model-free approaches are much less prone to bias and allow for faster exploration of the environment.

## Markov Decision Process (MDP)
A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined as a tuple $$(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$$, where:

- $S$ is a set of states ($\mathcal{S}$).
- $A$ is a set of actions ($\mathcal{A}$).
- $P$ is a transition probability matrix $\text{P}_{s'\rightarrow s}\big[a_i\big]$ that specifies the conditional probability distribution of transitioning to state $s'$ given action $a_i$, i.e., $$p(s'|s,a)\doteq \text{P}_{s'\rightarrow s}\big[a_i\big]$$
- $R$ is a reward function $r:\big\{s, a\big\} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, specifying the expected immediate reward when executing action $a$ in state $s$.
- $\gamma$ is a discount factor $\in [0,1]$ that measures the importance of future rewards relative to current ones. With $\gamma=0$, the agent only cares about the immediate reward; as $\gamma$ increases, the agent values future rewards more highly.

The MDP defines the problem setting of the agent interacting with the environment, including initial conditions, available actions, and transitions between states. Actions directly influence the next state, while the outcome of each transition depends on both the previous state and action taken. Rewards serve as additional feedback for the agent on how well it performed during its interaction with the environment. By adjusting the probabilities and rewards according to past experiences, the agent gradually learns to exploit knowledge gained from its interactions with the environment. This is why reinforcement learning algorithms work best in Markovian environments, i.e., those where the dynamics depend solely on the present state and action.

## Q-learning
Q-learning is one of the most commonly used model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. It works by iteratively selecting actions based on a learned estimate of the quality of each action based on the agent's past behavior. An estimated value function $Q$ is maintained for each state-action pair $(s, a)$, representing the expected return when executing action $a$ in state $s$. The estimate is updated incrementally based on the observed rewards received after taking each action.

Q-learning updates the estimated value function by following the Bellman equation:

$$
Q(s,a) \leftarrow (1-\alpha)\cdot Q(s,a)+\alpha\cdot r+\gamma\cdot \max_{a'} Q(s',a')
$$

where $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter that controls the rate of update, $r$ is the reward obtained by taking action $a$ in state $s$, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. The max operation computes the maximum value of the next state-action pairs, weighted by the estimated action values.

At each iteration, the algorithm chooses an action by sampling from the softmax policy $$\pi_\theta(a|s)=\frac{\exp(\hat{Q}_\theta(s,a))}{\sum_{\tilde{a}} \exp(\hat{Q}_\theta(s,\tilde{a}))}$$, where $\hat{Q}_\theta(s,a)$ is the estimated action value calculated by our network. Softmax policies ensure that all actions have equal chance of being selected, even if some actions have significantly lower estimated value than others. The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to handle stochastic environments without requiring a very high-dimensional continuous action space.

There are several variations of Q-learning that differ in how the estimated action values are computed, including double Q-learning, dueling networks, and prioritized replay.

## Deep Q-Networks
Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) combine the strengths of Q-learning with modern deep neural networks. Unlike traditional linear functions approximators, DQNs use multiple hidden layers of different sizes to approximate the action-value function. Each layer receives input from the output of the previous layer, allowing the network to learn non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. Additionally, DQNs use Experience Replay to train the network in batches rather than sequentially, leading to faster convergence and better sample efficiency.

One important feature of DQNs is that they use two separate deep neural networks: one called the “online” network that processes fresh input data and selects actions, and another called the “target” network that serves as a lagging replica of the online network that keeps track of the latest version of the parameters. During training, the loss function compares the Q-values predicted by the online network to the corresponding targets generated by the target network. The weights of the online network are periodically copied over to the target network to keep them synchronized. This helps prevent the divergence of the two networks, which can occur if the online network quickly becomes outdated and starts to lag behind the target network.

Overall, DQNs are widely successful in solving complex control tasks, particularly those involving continuous spaces and sparse rewards. However, they also have drawbacks such as high computation costs and limited sample efficiency. To address these issues, several extensions to DQNs have been proposed, including Dueling Networks, Multi-step Returns, Distributional DQN, Noisy Nets, Prioritized Experience Replay, and Combined Replay Buffers. Some of these techniques combine elements of classical RL theory with deep learning techniques.
