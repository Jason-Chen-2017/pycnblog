## 一、研究背景
近年来，随着人工智能技术的发展，特别是深度学习（Deep Learning）技术的普及，传统机器学习方法在某些任务上已经难以奏效。特别是在游戏领域中，我们往往依赖于强化学习（Reinforcement Learning）算法来提高玩家的游戏体验。因此，研究人员们探索了如何利用强化学习方法来改进游戏玩家的体验，比如提升游戏玩法效果、增加游戏的复杂度、降低新手入门难度等。然而，这种改进方式往往具有高度的复杂性、耗时和不确定性。本文将通过分析游戏中的Agent-environment交互过程、强化学习算法在游戏中的作用、深度强化学习在游戏中的应用，以及评估这些方法对游戏玩家体验的影响进行综述。
## 二、研究对象
本文研究的是深度强化学习在游戏中的应用。其中包括两大类游戏：一类是基于文字的游戏，如经典的”俄罗斯方块“、”贪吃蛇“等；另一类则是基于图像的游戏，如”Minecraft“。由于这两种游戏都有强调快节奏、即时反馈的特性，因此，本文所讨论的深度强化学习在游戏中的应用也主要关注这两类游戏。
## 三、研究目的
研究目的为系统atically analyze the application of deep reinforcement learning in various games and determine their potential benefits to player experience. The research will address four main questions: (1) What is Agent-Environment interaction for games? How does it affect the agent's decision making process and action selection? Does the combination of multiple environments with different dynamics contribute to better performance? (2) What are the fundamental principles of Reinforcement Learning algorithms used in games? Do they have any unique features that can be beneficial for game AI development? (3) How do Deep Q Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and other variants of RL algorithms perform in games? Can we develop improved versions of these algorithms specifically designed for games? And finally, how can we evaluate the effectiveness of these methods on achieving better player experiences in games?

The paper should provide a thorough and comprehensive review of current research topics related to deep reinforcement learning in games, including recent advancements, limitations, and future directions. It must also identify gaps and novel ideas needed to continue expanding the field into new areas such as cooperative multiagent games, intelligent tutoring systems, and interactive simulations. Finally, the paper should draw attention to promising avenues for further research by identifying open challenges and providing guidance for further efforts.

# 2.1 Agent-Environment Interaction
Agent-environment interaction (AEC) refers to the interaction between an artificial agent and its environment. This includes everything from receiving information about the state of the environment through sensory input, to taking actions and sending commands back to the environment. In the case of games, the environment is typically a video display where the agent takes actions by moving and interacting with objects displayed on screen. A key aspect of AEC in games is that the agent’s behavior is influenced not only by the observation of the environment but also by what happens outside of it – i.e., interactions with other players or the rules of the game itself.

In a typical AEC scenario, there is some form of feedback loop between the agent and the environment which allows them to learn optimal policies based on their past experiences. Policies are sets of instructions that specify the mapping from observations to actions taken by the agent within the given context. These policies may involve both discrete choices (such as choosing from one of several possible actions) and continuous control signals (such as specifying desired movements or camera angles).

Therefore, the primary challenge for developing effective game AI systems lies in designing efficient, data-driven mechanisms for modeling complex environments and incorporating domain knowledge while maintaining robustness under uncertainty and adapting to changes over time. One way to achieve this goal is to use Reinforcement Learning (RL), a class of machine learning techniques that allow agents to learn from their interactions with the environment and receive immediate rewards or penalties in response to those actions. In general, RL involves training an agent to select actions that maximize expected reward, using a mathematical framework called “value functions.” However, specific details of how value function optimization works vary depending on the problem being solved.
