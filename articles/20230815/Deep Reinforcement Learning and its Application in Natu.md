# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing (NLP), as a sub-field of artificial intelligence, is one of the most challenging fields due to the complexity of natural languages. One of the most critical tasks for NLP is question answering system which requires understanding users' questions by extracting relevant information from texts. In order to address this task effectively, we need to use advanced deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory units (LSTMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformer models. 

Recently, there has been an emerging trend of using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with NLP applications such as dialogue systems, natural language generation, and text classification. The core idea behind RL is that agents can learn by trial and error while receiving feedback about their actions. These methods have shown great promise in solving complex problems such as robotic control or game playing but they are still not widely adopted in other NLP domains where humans interact with machines more frequently.

In this paper, I will discuss several advances in deep reinforcement learning applied to NLP tasks, including:

1. Conversational agent: I will explain how to design an end-to-end conversational agent that employs a combination of deep Q-learning and reinforcement learning. I will also present some practical examples on how to fine-tune pre-trained BERT model for NLP conversation tasks like chatbots and personal assistants.
2. Text summarization: I will describe state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning approaches for text summarization and show how these approaches can be combined to generate better quality summaries than conventional automatic methods based on heuristics. 
3. Dialogue response generator: I will explain how to train a dialogue response generator using deep reinforcement learning approach called GPT-2, which combines the power of transformer models with policy gradient method for training. Finally, I will demonstrate how to implement the trained model into a web application and deploy it online.
4. Sentiment analysis: I will review different deep sentiment analysis models such as Attention-based LSTM, Transformers, and CNNs, and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Additionally, I will provide insights into how to improve the performance of sentiment analysis models through ensemble learning, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning.
# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology 
Before diving into the details of various deep reinforcement learning algorithms applied to NLP tasks, let’s first understand some basic concepts related to reinforcement learning and its terminology. 

1. Reinforcement learning (RL): Reinforcement learning refers to an area of machine learning concerned with developing agents that take actions in an environment in order to maximize their cumulative reward. It involves two main components: the agent learns by trial and error by interacting with the environment; and the environment provides rewards and punishments to the agent at each step.

The basic algorithm used to solve RL problems is the Markov decision process (MDP). MDP defines a tuple of states S, actions A(s), transition probabilities P(s'|s,a), discount factor gamma, and reward function R(s,a,s'). The goal of the agent is to find the optimal strategy, which means finding the action sequence of maximum expected future reward over all possible states.

2. Policy: A policy is a mapping from state to action. In reinforcement learning, policies determine the action taken by an agent in a given state according to the agent's preferences and knowledge about the environment. The agent's behavior is influenced by its policy. There are two types of policies: exploration policies and exploitation policies. Exploration policies enable the agent to explore new areas of the environment without any prior knowledge, whereas exploitation policies exploit known knowledge to select the best action based on current observations. Some popular exploration strategies include random search, epsilon greedy, and softmax policy. Epsilon greedy selects the greedy action with probability ε and randomly selects an action otherwise. Softmax policy assigns high probability to actions with high expected value, resulting in a stochastic behavior.

3. Value function: The value function V(s) measures the utility or achievable long-term reward when the agent is in state s. The value function estimates the expected return of being in a particular state by taking into account the expected reward and the maximum possible return from the next state. The update rule for the value function is temporal difference (TD) learning, which predicts the value of the next state using the current estimate of the value function and the immediate reward received after taking an action.

4. Q-function: The Q-function takes the form Q(s,a), representing the total reward obtained if the agent takes action a in state s and then stays put until the end of the episode. The Q-function calculates the expected return starting from any state and any action, rather than just looking forward to the next time step. We usually use two separate functions for estimating the values of different actions instead of using a single function because the target policy might only give higher rewards for certain actions depending on the context. The update rule for the Q-function is Sarsa, which updates the value of the current state-action pair based on the observed reward and the predicted future reward under the same action.

5. Time-step t: At time step t, the agent observes the state s, takes action a, receives a reward r, and transitions to the next state s'. At time step t+1, the agent starts again and repeats the process until the end of the episode. This structure forms the basis of sequential decision making problem.

Now that we know what deep reinforcement learning is and the basics of reinforcement learning, let’s get started with our discussion on applying deep reinforcement learning techniques to NLP tasks.
