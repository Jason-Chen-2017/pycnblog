Cluster analysis, also known as unsupervised learning, involves the grouping of similar objects in a dataset into clusters based on some predefined criteria. It helps to discover patterns and insights from large amounts of data that may not otherwise be easily discerned. In general, cluster analysis aims to group observations together into groups (clusters) such that the members within each cluster are similar to each other, while different clusters are distinctive from one another.

Traditionally, there have been several clustering algorithms used over the years, including k-means, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, spectral clustering, and matrix decomposition methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Each algorithm has its own advantages and drawbacks, which can make choosing the most suitable algorithm difficult. 

In this survey article, we will briefly review six commonly used clustering algorithms – K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, Spectral Clustering, PCA-based Matrix Decomposition, and ICA-based Matrix Decomposition – and explain how they work, what their key properties are, and when you should use them. We will also explore some real-world applications where these algorithms can help solve specific problems and answer questions that cannot be answered by simple statistical analyses alone. Finally, we will consider some future challenges and opportunities for advancement in this field. By taking advantage of cutting-edge research techniques and practical solutions, clustering algorithms can now play an increasingly important role in many fields, ranging from finance to healthcare, biology, and industry.

This article does not cover all possible variations and combinations of these algorithms, but rather focuses on selecting appropriate algorithms based on factors such as data size, number of variables, desired outcome, and performance metrics. These algorithms form the backbone of modern machine learning systems and continue to evolve with new developments in both theory and practice. Overall, this article provides an accessible overview of existing clustering algorithms and demonstrates their value and usefulness across various application domains.


# 2.基本概念、术语及定义
Before moving on to more detailed explanations, let’s define some basic terms and concepts related to clustering:

1. Data: The set of objects or instances that need to be grouped into clusters, such as customers, transactions, images, text documents, etc. 

2. Object/Instance: An individual entity being classified into a particular category, e.g., customer ID 101, transaction record XYZ, photograph ABC, blog post PQR.

3. Attribute: Any measurable characteristic or property of an object or instance, such as age, gender, income level, location, interests, etc. Attributes can vary between objects or instances. 

4. Feature: A particular attribute that distinguishes two or more objects or instances, representing a unique feature of those entities. For example, color, shape, texture, orientation, etc. Features are usually numerical values. 

5. Clusters: Subsets of objects or instances that share similar characteristics or features. Clusters are formed according to a predefined similarity metric, typically represented using a distance function.

6. Similarity Measure: A mathematical formula that calculates the degree of similarity between two objects or instances. There are several types of similarity measures, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, cosine similarity, Jaccard index, etc.

7. Centroids: The average position or central tendency of points in a given cluster. They represent the core point(s) or mean center of a cluster. 

8. Outliers: Objects or instances that stand out or deviate significantly from the rest of the cluster(s). They can cause interference or noise in the resulting clusters and can potentially mislead classification models.

K-Means Clustering Algorithm:
The K-Means clustering algorithm belongs to the simplest and popular clustering algorithm. It partitions n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid. The algorithm works iteratively to minimize the sum of squared distances between the centroids and the respective observations until convergence is achieved. Here are the steps involved in implementing K-Means clustering algorithm:
1. Initialize k centroids randomly.
2. Assign each observation to the closest centroid. 
3. Recalculate the centroid of each cluster by computing the mean of all observations assigned to that cluster.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until no further improvement can be made. 

DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm:
The DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm is a powerful clustering algorithm that uses a densification process to identify meaningful clusters. The algorithm starts with a dense area called a Core Point and then recursively expands the areas until reaching a defined neighbor radius. All points inside a certain neighborhood are considered part of a single cluster. If none of these points satisfy a minimum number of neighbors, the area is marked as a border point and becomes a separate cluster. The algorithm continues this process until all points have been assigned to a cluster. Here are the main steps involved in implementing DBSCAN clustering algorithm:
1. Choose a parameter epsilon (ε) and minPts (minimum number of neighbors).
2. Create a seed point p from the dataset and add it to an empty list L. Mark p as visited.
3. Expand L to include all neighboring points of p within ε distance and mark them as visited.
4. If any point q in L is found to be a core point with at least minPts neighbors within ε distance, mark it as a candidate cluster. Add the candidate cluster to the output list. Otherwise, discard the candidate cluster.
5. Remove any previously labeled points from L if they are not reachable from a newly added candidate cluster by following the above described procedure until convergence is reached.

Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm:
The Hierarchical Clustering algorithm forms a hierarchy of clusters by merging pairs of clusters that are most similar to each other based on some distance measure. The agglomerative approach begins with a singletone cluster containing every data point, and repeatedly merges the pair of clusters that minimally increases a chosen linkage criterion, until all data points belong to a single large cluster or no significant improvement can be made. Different types of linkage criterions exist, including Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, Centroid Linkage, Ward’s Method, and Minimum Variance method. Here are the main steps involved in implementing Hierarchical Clustering algorithm:
1. Calculate the distance between each pair of data points using a chosen distance measure.
2. Merge the two clusters that result in the smallest increase in the overall distance measure.
3. Repeat step 2 until all data points belong to a single cluster or the minimum decrease is below a predetermined threshold.

Spectral Clustering Algorithm:
The Spectral Clustering algorithm operates under the assumption that the input data is embedded in a high-dimensional space, such as the Euclidean space. The algorithm first applies a graph embedding technique to convert the data into a weighted graph, and then finds the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the graph laplacian matrix. The top eigenvectors correspond to the dominant directions of variation in the original data, and hence form a basis for constructing the similarity matrix. The similarity matrix is used to partition the data into distinct clusters using a clustering algorithm such as K-Means. Here are the main steps involved in implementing Spectral Clustering algorithm:
1. Construct a weighted adjacency matrix from the input data using a kernel function such as Gaussian or polynomial basis functions.
2. Compute the graph laplacian matrix of the weighted adjacency matrix.
3. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph laplacian matrix.
4. Sort the eigenvectors in descending order of their corresponding eigenvalues.
5. Use the first k eigenvectors to construct a low dimensional representation of the data.
6. Apply a clustering algorithm such as K-Means to segment the data into k clusters.

PCA-Based Matrix Decomposition Algorithm:
The principal component analysis (PCA) is a common dimensionality reduction technique used to extract the underlying structure of a dataset consisting of thousands of variables. The goal of PCA is to find a lower-dimensional representation of the data that retains most of the information contained in the original data, while avoiding redundancy. PCA works by calculating the covariance matrix of the data, finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, sorting the eigenvectors in descending order of their associated eigenvalues, and keeping only the top few eigenvectors to project the data onto a reduced-dimension subspace. Here are the main steps involved in implementing PCA-based Matrix Decomposition algorithm:
1. Calculate the sample mean vector μ of the data.
2. Calculate the scatter matrix Sigma = (X − μ)(X − μ)^T.
3. Find the eigenvectors U of the scatter matrix and sort them in descending order of their corresponding eigenvalues.
4. Keep only the first k eigenvectors and transform the data X into the new coordinate system Y = XU^1. 

ICA-Based Matrix Decomposition Algorithm:
The independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm is very similar to PCA, except that it seeks to model the data as a linear combination of non-Gaussian (independent) components instead of just modeling the variance. ICA assumes that the data is corrupted by noise and that the true sources of the signal can be separated from the noise by mixing. ICA solves this problem by identifying the independent components and separating them from the remaining noise. Here are the main steps involved in implementing ICA-based Matrix Decomposition algorithm:
1. Set up the optimization problem:
   Minimize the negative log likelihood of the observed data x by applying an appropriate penalty term to the mutual information between each source s and each mixture coefficient θi. Let yk=As+ξik and zik = θi * yk + Ni. Then the objective function is 
   J(θ)=∑k∈[K]−log(πk)+(x⊙∏k∈[K]N_yk)+λ−2∑k,l[(θil)(θkl)] 
2. Solve the optimization problem by alternating between fixing the mixing coefficients θi and solving for the sources Ak, and fixing the sources Ak and solving for the mixing coefficients θi. 
3. Extract the independent components from the estimated sources and estimate the noise levels.
