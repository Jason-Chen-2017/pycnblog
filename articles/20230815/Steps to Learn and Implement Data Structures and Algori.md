# 1.简介
  

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the building blocks of computer science. They help in solving complex problems efficiently by organizing data into a way that makes it easy for computers to access and manipulate them. Understanding DSA is crucial as software engineers need to have an understanding of various data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists etc., which will be used in their daily programming activities.
In this article, we will cover the basic concepts of DSA with hands-on implementation examples. We will start with Arrays, Queues, Stacks, Linked Lists, Trees and then proceed towards sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort and Radix Sort. With detailed explanations, we hope you can learn and implement these algorithms effectively using your favorite language.
This article assumes you already know the basics of programming and have some experience in designing and implementing algorithms. However, if you’re a beginner who doesn't have much prior knowledge about data structures or algorithms, I suggest taking up online courses such as Introduction to Computer Science from MIT OpenCourseWare to refresh your knowledge before diving deep into DSA topics.
By the end of this article, you should be comfortable with most common DSA concepts and able to use them to solve practical programming challenges. Do let me know what you think! I would love to hear your feedback on how well this article helped you learn and understand DSA better.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
Let's first discuss some basic concepts related to DSA. This includes arrays, pointers, strings, trees, graphs, hashing functions, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer approach, graph traversal, topological sort, shortest path algorithm, minimum spanning tree algorithms, and many more. 

## Array
An array is a collection of elements of same type placed contiguously in memory starting at a specific address. It has a fixed size and its values can be accessed directly through its index positions. The size of an array can be determined during compile time or runtime based on user input. In general, an array takes less space than a list since all the items are stored in consecutive memory locations. Here's how we can declare and initialize an array in C++:
```cpp
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // initialize array with given values
int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); // get length of array
for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
  cout << "Element at index " << i << ": " << arr[i] << endl;
}
```
To add or remove elements from an existing array, we can reallocate the entire memory block or shift all subsequent elements one position to the left or right depending on our choice. To achieve constant-time complexity for accessing any element of an array, we can use indexing instead of pointers.

## Pointers
A pointer variable stores the memory address of another variable. A NULL pointer represents an invalid memory location, where no valid value is stored. It allows us to indirectly access variables located in different parts of memory. Pointers come in two flavors - regular and dynamically allocated ones. Regular pointers point to statically allocated objects and cannot be deallocated manually while dynamically allocated pointers allocate memory on heap and release it automatically when they go out of scope or deleted explicitly. Here's an example of declaring and manipulating regular and dynamically allocated pointers:

```c++
// Declare two integers and allocate memory for three integers using new operator
int* ptr1 = new int;     // dynamically allocated integer pointed to by ptr1
int x = 10;              // assign value 10 to x
ptr1 = &x;               // store address of x in ptr1


// Declare two char arrays of size 10 each
char* str1 = new char[10];   // dynamically allocated character array of size 10 pointed to by str1
strcpy(str1, "Hello");      // copy string "Hello" to str1
cout << *str1 << endl;       // output 'H'
delete[] str1;             // delete dynamically allocated memory


// Declare an array of size 5 and initialize it
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int* ptr2 = arr;            // create pointer pointing to first element of arr
while (*ptr2!= '\0')        // iterate till null terminator is encountered
    ++ptr2;                   // increment pointer

// Delete dynamically allocated memory
delete[] ptr1;           // delete dynamically allocated integer
```

## String
Strings are a sequence of characters terminated by a special character called null terminator ('\0'). Strings are commonly used to represent text and other human readable information. Unlike arrays, strings cannot be resized after creation, so we need to make sure enough memory is available before creating a string. Here's an example of initializing and printing a string in C++:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   const int SIZE = 100;          // maximum allowed size of string

   char s1[SIZE] = "Welcome!";    // initialize string
   char c1 = '!';                 // set last character to!

   char s2[SIZE + 1];             // reserve extra byte for null terminator
   strcpy_s(s2, SIZE+1, s1);      // copy contents of s1 to s2
   strcat_s(s2, SIZE+1, &c1);     // append last character to s2

   cout << "String 1: " << s1 << endl;
   cout << "String 2: " << s2 << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

## Tree
Tree data structure is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node may contain zero or more child nodes. For instance, a binary search tree is a tree whose nodes maintain the property such that the key of every node is greater than keys of all nodes in its left subtree and smaller than those in its right subtree. In order to traverse a tree recursively, we need to define a base case and recursive case for traversing the left and right subtrees. When there are multiple paths from root to leaf, we call it a multitree. There are several ways to implement a tree data structure including array representation, linked representation, hash table representation, and Trie.

## Graph
Graph data structure consists of vertices connected by edges. These edges can be directed or undirected. Edges can also have weights associated with them representing the cost or distance between two vertices. Graphs are widely used in many applications ranging from social networks, communication networks, computer networks, transportation systems, routing protocols, and artificial intelligence tasks. Common graph algorithms include depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), topological sort, shortest path problem, minimum spanning tree, and PageRank. An adjacency matrix is used to represent a weighted graph in the form of a square matrix, where each entry ij represents the weight of edge connecting vertex i to j. Similarly, an adjacency list is used to represent a weighted graph in the form of an unordered list of pairs or triples containing adjacent vertex and weight.

## Hash Function
Hash function is a mathematical function that converts a given input (message) of fixed size into a fixed-size output. One simple method to compute a hash value is to sum the ASCII codes of all characters in the message modulo some prime number p. This ensures that the resulting hash value falls within the range [0,p-1]. Another method involves applying polynomial rolling hash, which involves multiplying a certain power of a basis polynomial over the message until the result exceeds the target value. The basis polynomial is chosen such that its degree is low compared to the expected number of collisions among messages.

## Recursion
Recursion is a technique used to simplify code and reduce boilerplate by breaking down a larger problem into simpler subproblems. Every recursive solution requires defining a base case and a recursive case. Base cases usually involve the simplest possible inputs that meet the conditions required for the desired result. Recursive cases break down the problem into smaller subproblems that satisfy the base case. By repeatedly calling the same function with slightly modified arguments, we eventually reach a point where the original problem becomes trivial and returns its final answer. Examples of recursive problems include factorial, fibonacci series, merge sort, and quicksort.

## Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems and storing solutions to these subproblems. The optimal solution to a problem depends on the optimal solutions to its subproblems. Dynamic programming uses memoization to avoid redundant computations and improve performance. At each step, we compute only the best solution to the remaining subproblem rather than considering all possible choices. Dynamic programming is mainly used in resource-constrained settings, such as in machine learning and computer graphics, where large amounts of memory and computational resources are limited.

## Greedy Algorithm
Greedy algorithm is an optimization strategy that always selects the locally optimal move, even if it leads to a globally suboptimal solution. It works well for problems that have a unique optimal solution that can be found by making a series of local decisions that do not conflict with each other. Greedy algorithms work well because they often produce good results quickly and reliably, especially in practice. Examples of greedy algorithms include Huffman coding, Prim\'s minimum spanning tree algorithm, Dijkstra\'s single source shortest path algorithm, and Knapsack problem.
