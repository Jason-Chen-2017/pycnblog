## 1. 背景介绍

Data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are essential skills for anyone working with data. They help us understand complex patterns, trends, and relationships within our data sets, enabling us to make informed decisions and communicate findings effectively. In this article, we'll explore the core concepts, algorithms, mathematical models, and practical applications of data visualization and EDA. We'll also provide code examples and recommendations for tools and resources.

Before we begin, it's important to note that data visualization is not just about creating pretty pictures. It's about revealing hidden patterns, discovering new insights, and communicating complex ideas in a simple and intuitive way.

## 2. 核心概念与联系

### 数据可视化的目标

The primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and efficiently while minimizing cognitive load. To achieve this, we use various types of charts, graphs, and maps to represent data in a visually appealing manner. By doing so, we can identify patterns, trends, and outliers that might be difficult to spot otherwise.

### 数据探索的目标

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to discover hidden patterns and relationships within the data set. This involves techniques such as data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to prepare the data for analysis. EDA helps us understand the structure of the data and identify potential areas of interest or concern.
