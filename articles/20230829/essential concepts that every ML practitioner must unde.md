# 1.简介
  
及前言
Machine learning (ML) has been gaining rapid popularity over the past few years due to its potential for solving various complex real-world problems. In this article we will provide a comprehensive guide of key concepts and algorithms needed to understand how it works and apply them effectively in your projects. We'll cover the following topics:

1. Basic terminology such as data, features, labels, and training/testing sets.
2. Types of machine learning models including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
3. The fundamental principles behind backpropagation algorithm used in neural networks.
4. How decision trees work and their role in model building.
5. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and ROC curve. 
6. Common data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, feature scaling, and handling imbalanced datasets.
7. Examples of popular libraries and frameworks used for implementing ML solutions.

This is an extensive list but should be enough to enable you to build effective ML systems capable of making accurate predictions on new or unseen data. By the end of the article, we hope that you'll have learned the essentials required to start your journey into the field. 


# 2.Basic Terminology
Before diving into the details of different types of ML models, let's first go through some basic terms and definitions. These will help us better understand what our data looks like, how to represent it numerically, and identify which variables are most relevant to our prediction task. Let's break down these ideas into smaller subtopics:

1. Data
Data refers to information collected from various sources, such as text, images, audio, video, etc., that is being used to train or test our ML system. It can vary in size, complexity, and format, ranging from structured databases to unstructured data streams. A typical example of structured data would be a database table with columns representing attributes of different objects, while unstructured data could include raw texts, audio clips, social media posts, etc.

2. Features
Features refer to the individual measurable properties or characteristics of our data entities that contribute towards predictive modeling. They can be categorical, numerical, or time-based, depending on the nature of our data. For instance, if our dataset contains information about customers, each customer might have multiple features associated with them, such as age, gender, income level, education level, occupation, location, etc. Each of these features can either be quantitative (i.e., a number) or qualitative (i.e., a label). Examples of categorical features include gender, race, color, and political affiliation. Examples of numerical features include age, income, price, distance travelled, duration of a trip, rating scores, etc. Time-based features include dates, times, durations, etc.

3. Labels
Labels are the target variable(s) whose value we want to predict based on our input data. They can be discrete values, such as categories, or continuous values, such as numbers, ratings, or probabilities. Depending on the type of problem at hand, we may have one or more output labels per input data point. For instance, if we want to classify emails as spam or not spam, there might only be two possible outcomes - true or false. If we want to predict stock prices based on historical patterns, the outcome variable could be a continuous variable ranging from $0 to $100. 

4. Training Set vs Testing Set
A training set is the subset of our data used to train our ML model, while a testing set is reserved for evaluating the performance of our trained model. Typically, 70% of the data is used for training purposes and 30% is kept aside for testing purposes. This ensures that our model is tested using unseen data that it hasn't seen during training. Besides the size of the dataset, other important considerations when splitting the data into training and testing sets include ensuring representative samples, avoiding any biases that might affect the distribution of the data across the classes, and achieving high levels of diversity between both sets. Additionally, we need to ensure that our chosen split doesn't cause any significant overlap between the two sets, which could lead to bias and underestimate the generalization error of our model.
