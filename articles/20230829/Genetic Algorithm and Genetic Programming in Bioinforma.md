# 1.简介
  

Genetic programming (GP) is a metaheuristic technique for solving complex problems by mimicking the process of natural selection. GP uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve programs that perform well on fitness tests. The algorithm works through multiple generations of offspring, each with mutations that modify or replace parts of the program. Over time, the genetic programming system learns to produce better solutions to more complex tasks, similar to how nature evolves organisms over millions of years to solve complex problems. This article provides an overview of genetic programming techniques applied to bioinformatics, focusing mainly on applications involving protein design and manipulation. We will cover basic concepts such as genome representation, problem formulation, evaluation functions, mutation operators, crossover operators, and selective pressure methods. In addition, we will present specific examples and practical tips related to using these techniques in the field of biochemistry and molecular biology. Finally, we will discuss some open issues and future research directions.

## Genome Representation
A DNA sequence is composed of four nucleotides – adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Each base pair can be represented by a numerical value called a code, which corresponds to its ASCII character. For example, the letter 'A' has a binary code of 01000001 while 'U' has a binary code of 01010101. Thus, the complete sequence of DNA can be represented as a string of characters where each character represents one base pair. To represent the entire sequence of nucleotide bases, we call it a genome. Several ways have been proposed to encode the genomes into a compact and efficient manner. One common method is to use linear representations called k-mers, where every substring of length k (k-mer) is assigned a unique index. Another common approach is to use positional codes, which group nucleotides together based on their position within the molecule.
## Gene Expression Problem Formulation
The gene expression problem refers to the task of producing proteins from a set of given genes. The input consists of the following information:
- Genes - a list of codons representing the encoded sequences of proteins.
- Promoters - starting regions of transcription.
- Terminators - end points of transcription.
- Repressors - negative regulators that prevent protein synthesis.
- Ribosome Binding Sites (RBSs) - sites at which translation begins.
To construct a high-quality protein product, the designer should strike a balance between several factors: increasing diversity, maintaining essential features of the target protein, and avoiding interference from other genes. The designer must also ensure that the produced product can bind its intended target site accurately and efficiently. There are two main types of optimization objectives for the gene expression problem: growth and production cost.
### Growth Objective
This objective involves trying to maximize the rate of translation initiation, yielding an accurate and robust product. It is typically measured by monitoring the amount of polypeptide produced per unit cell. If the resulting quantity does not meet the desired level, additional control strategies may need to be implemented.
### Production Cost Objective
Another objective involves minimizing the total number of base pairs required to build the final product. This includes both coding regions and intronic sequences. As the size and complexity of the product increases, so do the requirements for sequence conservation during synthesis and assembly processes. Therefore, reducing the number of nonessential components improves the overall quality of the product.
## Evaluation Function
An important step in the development of a genetic program is defining a suitable evaluation function that evaluates the success of candidate programs in terms of achieving the desired goal. Commonly used evaluation functions include:
- Greedy Function Approximation - this function approximates the performance of the best solution found thus far and assigns higher scores to candidates whose behavior deviates significantly from this approximation. This makes sure that the search converges towards a local optimum.
- Elitism Selection Method - this method selects the best individuals among the current population and maintains them unchanged in the next generation. These individuals are then reinserted into the population before any other new members are generated.
- Tournament Selection Method - this method involves selecting random subsets of individuals and choosing the fittest individual from those subsets as the parent.
- Fitness Sharing Technique - this method allows multiple individuals to compete for the same pool of resources and share rewards if they reach the same point along the fitness curve.
All these evaluation functions provide insights into the characteristics of the optimal solution and guide the search process towards finding better ones. However, they require careful tuning to achieve good results on different problems. Furthermore, some advanced forms of evaluation functions have been developed recently that involve incorporating biological knowledge about the underlying physical mechanisms involved in protein synthesis, making the search process even more effective.
## Mutation Operators
Mutation operators are used to introduce changes or variations in the genetic material without losing the original structure. They work by changing selected portions of the chromosome by randomly replacing them with other values. Two commonly used mutation operators are single point and uniform deletion/insertion operators. Single point mutatation replaces only one bit in the chromosome, whereas uniform delete/insert operation deletes a fixed percentage of bits and inserts new random values instead. Other popular mutation operators include inversion operator, scramble operator, and transposition operator. All of these operators help improve the genetic diversity and maintain the robustness of the genetic program in face of stochasticity and noise introduced during evolution.
## Crossover Operators
Crossover operators combine the genetic material of two parents to create offspring that inherit certain properties from their parents. There are three main crossover operators used in genetic programming: one-point crossover, two-point crossover, and uniform crossover. In one-point crossover, the child inherits half of the segments from one parent and the remaining half from another. In two-point crossover, the child inherits a segment of the first parent between two chosen points and the second parent's corresponding segment. Uniform crossover combines alleles from both parents randomly according to a fixed probability distribution. In summary, all crossover operators contribute to the creation of diverse genetic material and increase the chance of finding a global optima.
## Selective Pressure Methods
Selective pressure is a mechanism that helps guide the search process towards exploring promising areas of the search space. Some methods used in GP include:
- Probabilistic Method - this method chooses a subset of individuals at random and assigns them greater probabilities of being selected than others. This encourages exploration of less explored areas of the search space.
- Steady State Method - this method generates a pressure gradient across the population based on their relative fitnesses and applies this pressure toward improving the most fit members.
- Differential Evolution - this method uses differential variation of allele frequencies between parents to generate offspring. This produces a mix of genetic material obtained from both parents and prevents premature convergence to a local optimum.
All these selective pressure methods aim to promote genetic diversity by selecting individuals that are likely to contain novel solutions compared to others. They also encourage exploration of less explored areas of the search space, leading to better solutions in general. Nevertheless, these methods rely heavily on initial conditions and might not always lead to improved performance.
