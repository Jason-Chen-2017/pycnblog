Simulated annealing (SA) is a popular optimization technique used for solving problems with large search spaces or complex objective functions. The algorithm is based on a physical process known as heat baths, which allow it to escape from local minima and explore more effectively than traditional techniques such as gradient descent. This article aims to provide a quantitative understanding of how simulated annealing works in terms of the physical principles that underpin its operation. In particular, we will be discussing:

1. How temperature affects the exploration of the solution space and how different cooling schedules can influence the convergence rate of SA. 
2. How random initial solutions affect the performance of SA by introducing noise into the system.
3. How the choice of mutation function and acceptance criterion can significantly impact the quality of solutions found by SA.

To achieve this understanding, we will use mathematical tools such as Markov chains and thermodynamics to analyze the behavior of SA at various stages of the algorithm's execution. We will also discuss how these concepts can help us design better algorithms and obtain higher-quality results for specific applications. Our goal is to present a detailed explanation of simulated annealing using clear language and crisp diagrams wherever possible.

## 2.1 物理学相关术语
Before delving into the theory behind Simulated Annealing, let’s first go through some basic physics terminology related to the problem. Here are a few important ones:

**Temperature:** Temperature refers to the degree of heat generated within a material due to thermal energy dissipation and exchange between particles. As the temperature increases, there exists less kinetic energy associated with any given particle, leading to slower movements and increased probability of escaping local minima. The lowest temperature attained during a simulation is called “equilibrium” temperature.


**Heat Bath:** A heat bath is a type of isolated device consisting of a heated container surrounded by cold insulation. When exposed to high temperatures, the molecules inside the container quickly become unfavorable for movement and collapse onto a single point until they reach equilibrium. This property allows simulated annealing to escape from low-energy states and explore high-energy regions efficiently.

**Anneal Schedule:** Cooling schedule determines the rate at which the system cools down from a high temperature to a lower one over time. It is commonly set to linearly decrease the temperature after each iteration or increase exponentially depending on the application scenario.

**Acceptance Probability:** Acceptance probability is defined as the ratio of the current state’s value divided by the proposed new state’s value. If the acceptance probability is greater than a certain threshold, then the proposal is accepted and becomes the next state. Otherwise, it remains unchanged. In other words, if the change in the cost function is very small compared to the current state’s cost, then the chance of accepting the new state is relatively low.

Now that you have a grasp of some fundamental physics concepts, let’s dive deeper into the core mechanics and mathematical properties of the simulated annealing algorithm.

### 2.2.1 概念
Simulated annealing is a metaheuristic optimization method that belongs to the family of stochastic optimization methods. It involves iteratively updating a solution to a problem by simulating the physical interactions between particles in a system and trying out new candidate solutions in hopes of finding better ones. These candidate solutions are determined probabilistically according to their fitness relative to the current best solution, so the name simulated annealing.

The key idea behind simulated annealing is to start with a high temperature and gradually reduce it to a low temperature while exploring the solution space. At each step, the algorithm randomly selects a subset of all possible solutions and proposes them as potential replacements for the current solution. Based on the difference between the cost of the old and new solutions, the algorithm decides whether to accept or reject the proposal. The decision is made probabilistically, and the probability decreases as the temperature drops below zero. By examining multiple solutions simultaneously throughout the course of the search, simulated annealing explores a much larger portion of the solution space before settling on the optimal solution.

Simulated annealing has been shown to work well in practice across a wide range of applications including computer graphics, molecular modeling, vehicle routing, and image processing. However, many technical challenges still remain, including choosing proper cooling schedules and selecting appropriate mutation and acceptance criteria. Nevertheless, simulated annealing is a powerful tool that can solve complex optimization problems with ease.
