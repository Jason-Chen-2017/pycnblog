Patient Safety is a key concern that every healthcare organization struggles with today due to the increasing global population and increasing complexity in healthcare delivery. Patient safety brings many challenges like loss of life or serious injuries which can lead to financial losses, reputation damages, and medical expenses for organizations. In order to improve patient safety, it becomes essential to develop effective methods that could help identify and predict potential harmful behaviors and activities before they occur. Machine learning algorithms have become an essential tool for developing such solutions since they are capable of analyzing large amounts of data from various sources efficiently and accurately. Herein, we propose a new framework called "Combining Patient Safety with AI" to combine machine learning techniques alongside traditional security measures to ensure safe patients interactions with healthcare professionals. We will discuss our approach, design considerations, implementation details, and lessons learned throughout this project.

In summary, we propose a novel methodology for improving patient safety by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into current hospital workflows using data-driven decision making. The proposed system utilizes both natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) models to capture patterns and correlations between patients' daily behaviours and diagnose related issues effectively. Additionally, we also incorporate audit trails generated from hospital systems to enhance accuracy and enable early warning alerts based on suspicious activity or patterns. To overcome the shortcomings of existing solutions, we plan to deploy our framework as part of a centralized platform that will interact with all stakeholders involved in the care of patients to provide seamless and transparent interventions at each stage of their journey towards recovery.

This article serves as a technical paper on how AI and modern technologies can be leveraged to create value-added features in the healthcare ecosystem and reduce the risk of patient harm during interactions with healthcare professionals. By implementing this solution, we aim to address the pressing need for more efficient ways of managing patient safety within hospitals, thereby enabling organizations to deliver better quality healthcare services to patients while ensuring patient's overall well-being. 

## Abstract
This article introduces a novel framework for combining machine learning and traditional security measures for enhancing patient safety in healthcare environments. We present three use cases where this framework has been implemented: anomaly detection for fraudulent behavior detection; compliance monitoring for privacy laws and regulations; and active threat monitoring for emerging threats to human rights. This work provides an overview of the research problem and presents the benefits of using AI technology for patient safety management. It then explains the working principles of the proposed framework and discusses its architecture and implementation details. Finally, we suggest future directions and lessons learned for further development and improvement of this technology. This work will serve as a foundation for establishing a unified framework for integrating AI and security measures to manage patient safety in healthcare settings.

## 2. Background Introduction

Patient Safety is a critical issue that any healthcare institution faces today. Patients often face uncertainties, unexpected events, and unwanted experiences when interacting with doctors and healthcare professionals. For example, if a patient mistakenly visits a toxic environment, or if he/she overdoses, these incidents could cause irreparable harm to individuals and cause a great deal of damage. Therefore, having robust patient safety management tools is crucial in ensuring that patients receive the highest level of care possible. 

However, achieving high levels of patient safety requires holistic approaches that include machine learning, security, and interface design to integrate different aspects of the patient journey. Without accurate and timely information sharing between stakeholders, the resultant lack of coordination can significantly impede the process of preventative medicine and therapy. Moreover, accidental prescribing and under-the-hood activities make up another significant source of risks for patients. As a consequence, recent years have witnessed a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks, and medical devices such as infectometers have demonstrated that even highly advanced machines can fail in dangerous situations. Thus, there is a growing demand for developing safer patient interfaces, improved healthcare infrastructure, and enhanced intervention strategies.

The objective of this project is to leverage advances in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and other relevant fields to develop a complete suite of technologies that can help improve patient safety management across the healthcare landscape. Specifically, we aim to achieve three main goals: 

1. Improve patient safety by identifying and preventing malicious actions through continuous monitoring

2. Enforce patient privacy laws and regulations through automated analysis of individual records and surveillance

3. Provide proactive warning messages via integrated alerting systems based on analysis of patient interaction data

To achieve these goals, we developed a comprehensive framework that combines deep learning with advanced analytics to automate the process of patient diagnosis, collaboration, and communication. Our framework takes advantage of big data repositories including electronic medical record (EMR) databases, radiology reports, physician notes, and hospital sensor data to build predictive models for identifying anomalous events and generating insights that support actionable feedback to patients and providers. These insights can be delivered to patients via mobile apps, voice assistants, chatbots, or personal touchpoints. We have deployed the framework as part of a centralized platform designed to collect and analyze data from multiple sources and generate real-time alerts for each patient.

Overall, this project aims to contribute valuable insight into the concept of patient safety management by integrating cutting-edge technologies into clinical decision-making processes. Moreover, it can serve as a platform for discovering new uses for AI and biomedical sensors that facilitate real-world applications in preventative medicine and healthcare.
