# 1.简介
  

Differential evolution (DE) is a popular population-based optimization algorithm. It belongs to the category of stochastic algorithms which means that it generates new solutions by randomly adjusting the current ones according to some predefined rules or formulae. The core idea behind DE is the assumption that similar solutions tend to be found more frequently than dissimilar ones. By performing random mutations on individuals with high fitness values and combining them with crossover operations, we can generate better solutions with less effort. In this article, I will explain how DE works and show you step-by-step how different mutation and crossover operators work using Python code. We will also cover why DE performs well under various conditions and what are its limitations. Finally, we will look at future directions for further research. Overall, I hope this article helps you understand how DE works and make better decisions when using it for your optimization problems.

In this article, I assume that readers have a basic understanding of machine learning terminology such as objective function, solution vector, fitness value, and training set. If not, please read my previous articles before continuing:



# 2.背景介绍
## What is Differential Evolution (DE)?


Unlike traditional metaheuristics such as hill climbing and gradient descent, DE does not rely on any local search mechanism. Instead, it explores the search space by generating candidate solutions based on their relation to other members of the population. These candidates are then combined through mutation and crossover operations to create offspring solutions, which gradually replace their predecessors in the next generation. This process continues until convergence is reached, i.e., no significant improvement is made after several generations.

The name "differential" comes from the fact that DE involves the use of differentials between pairs of vectors representing individual chromosomes in the population. Differences between these chromosomes lead to variation in the resulting offspring vectors produced during crossover. Similarly, variations within an individual chromosome are caused by mutation operations applied to selected elements. These two types of operations work together to produce diverse offspring solutions that explore the search space effectively.

## Population-Based Metaheuristics

Population-based metaheuristics (PBMH) are classified into two categories depending on whether they are guided or free-floating:

1. Guided PBMH – these methods have a clear goal, usually reaching a minimum or maximum fitness value. They require human intervention to specify the direction of exploration and exploitability constraints may limit the feasible region where solutions can exist. Examples include simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and artificial immune systems.

2. Free-floating PBMH – these methods do not have a predetermined goal, rather, they try to find good solutions without any guidance from outside input. They often optimize locally and exhibit robustness against noise and perturbation. Examples include firefly algorithms, ant colony optimizers, and neural networks.

DE belongs to the former group because it has been shown to perform well in many difficult optimization problems even though it requires a non-convex problem formulation. Its ability to adaptively select variables from multiple objectives makes it particularly useful in complex engineering design applications where multiple conflicting design objectives need to be considered simultaneously.

## Objective Function(目标函数)

A common application area of DE is solving complicated optimization problems that cannot easily be expressed mathematically. For example, it is commonly used to solve the multi-objective optimization problems arising in industrial process design, logistics management, and finance. Here, each decision variable represents an aspect of a system's configuration while there may be multiple trade-offs among those aspects.

The objective function of DE needs to satisfy three requirements:

1. Non-convexity: DE assumes that the objective function is non-convex, i.e., it contains multiple minima or saddle points along the optimal solution path. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the problem is represented accurately enough to avoid getting trapped in local minima.

2. Continuous Output Spaces: While most standard optimization algorithms assume that the output space consists of discrete integer or binary values, DE allows for continuous values as well. However, the performance of DE depends heavily on selecting appropriate crossover and mutation rates to maintain diversity across the population.

3. Differentiable Functionality: As mentioned earlier, DE uses differential changes between pairs of solutions as generated by crossover operations, so it requires access to the functional gradients of the objective function at all design points.

Overall, the choice of objective function and optimization strategy plays an important role in determining the effectiveness of DE in finding optimized solutions to complex problems.

## Fitness Value(适应值)

In DE, the fitness value assigned to each solution is determined by evaluating its objective function on a given dataset. One way to evaluate fitness values is to compute the distance between the predicted and actual outputs of the model on the validation data. Another approach is to use performance metrics such as ROC curve areas, mean squared error, precision, recall, etc. Based on the chosen metric, the lower the fitness score, the better the solution.

Note that although DE can handle both minimization and maximization problems, fitness functions should always return values that are consistent with the nature of the optimization task being performed.

# 3.基本概念术语说明
Before diving deeper into the technical details of DE, let's review the key concepts and terms that are essential for understanding how DE operates. 

## Individual Solution(个体解)
An individual solution refers to one possible arrangement of the decision variables in a search space. Each individual has a unique chromosome encoding the positions of the decision variables. 

## Population(种群)
A population is a collection of individual solutions that comprise the pool of available solutions for a particular optimization problem. Populations typically evolve iteratively by applying selection, reproduction, and mutation operations to generate new solutions from the old ones.

## Selection Operation(选择算子)
Selection is a crucial operation in DE that determines which individuals survive and pass down to the next generation. There are several ways to choose parents for the next generation: roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, ranking selection, and uniform selection. All of these techniques involve assigning weights to individuals based on their fitness scores and choosing parents based on their probabilities.

## Reproduction Operation(繁殖算子)
Reproduction is responsible for producing offspring solutions by combining parent solutions. Two types of reproduction schemes are currently supported in DE: single point crossover and double point crossover. Single point crossover selects a single point along the chromosome length and combines the halves of the two parent chromosomes to produce two new offspring chromosomes. Double point crossover selects two distinct points along the chromosome and combines corresponding regions of the two parent chromosomes to produce two new offspring chromosomes.

## Mutation Operation(突变算子)
Mutation modifies the behavior of individuals by introducing small random changes to their chromosome. The degree of change and type of mutation depend on several parameters including the mutation rate, mutation type, and the size of the mutation space. Mutation operations can either add or remove components from the chromosome or exchange existing components with others to introduce new behaviors.
