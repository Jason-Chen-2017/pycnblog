>Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces and matrices. It provides a powerful tool for solving practical problems in many areas such as computer science, economics, engineering, biology, physics, mathematics, statistics, and finance. In this article, we will explore four linear algebra applications: least squares regression, principal component analysis (PCA), matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. We will start by introducing basic concepts of vectors and matrices, followed by detailed explanations of the algorithms used to solve these problems and their specific mathematical formulas. Finally, we will put all these elements together to build complete projects that apply linear algebra to real-world data sets.

本文基于线性代数的四种应用场景——最小二乘回归、主成分分析（PCA）、矩阵分解和谱聚类，对这些应用进行阐述。首先会简要介绍向量和矩阵的基础知识，然后对于每一种应用都给出详细的解析，包括使用的算法以及对应的数学公式。之后将上面的各个部分综合应用到真实的数据集中构建完整项目。 

# 2. Background Introduction
## Vectors and Matrices 
Vectors are one-dimensional arrays of numbers that represent physical quantities such as position, velocity, force, or acceleration. Each element of a vector represents a different dimension, so they can be thought of as points in a multi-dimensional space where each axis corresponds to a particular coordinate. The length of a vector gives information about its direction and magnitude, while the angle between two vectors tells us how they tend to move towards each other. Mathematically, vectors are represented using boldface capital letters and italic lowercase letters like $\vec{v}$. Examples of vectors include positions, velocities, forces, and accelerations in n-dimensions.

Matrices are two-dimensional arrays of numbers arranged in rows and columns. They provide a way to organize and manipulate large amounts of data. For example, you might have a collection of images as a set of pixels, which can be stored as a matrix with dimensions $n \times m$, where $n$ is the number of rows and $m$ is the number of columns. You could then use various operations on this matrix, including multiplication, addition, and subtraction, to transform it into new representations of the same data. Mathematically, matrices are typically denoted using uppercase letter bold characters like $\mathbf{A}$. An example of a matrix used in machine learning would be the feature matrix, which contains information about individual objects such as pixel values from an image dataset.

In both cases, the basic idea behind linear algebra is simple: combine several vectors or matrices in ways that satisfy certain constraints to produce new ones that capture more complex relationships among the original components. These combined representations are useful because they allow us to make predictions about new observations without having to manually analyze every single observation individually. This approach makes it easy to handle complex systems that involve multiple variables and interactions between them.

## Least Squares Regression
Least squares regression is a classic method used to find the line of best fit through a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. When dealing with higher-dimensional spaces, there are also extensions called multivariate linear regression and polynomial regression. The goal of this algorithm is to determine the coefficients $(a_i)$ and $(b_j)$ that minimize the sum of squared errors $(\epsilon^2)$. Here's how it works:

1. First, we calculate the mean of all input data points $(x_i,y_i)$ over time period $t$:

   $$\bar{x}_t = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_it}{n}$$
   $$\bar{y}_t = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n y_it}{n}$$

2. Next, we subtract the means from each input point to center them around zero:

   $$x'_i(t) = x_i(t) - \bar{x}_t$$
   $$y'_i(t) = y_i(t) - \bar{y}_t$$

3. Then, we estimate the slope ($a$) and intercept ($b$) of the regression line:

   $$\hat{a}(t) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x'_i(t)-\bar{x}_t)(y'_i(t))}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x'_i(t)-\bar{x}_t)^2}$$
   
   $$\hat{b}(t) = \bar{y}_t - \hat{a}(t)\bar{x}_t$$

4. To evaluate the accuracy of our model, we compare the predicted output $\hat{y}_i(t)$ for each input point $i$ at time $t$ with the actual observed value $y_i(t)$. We define the error as follows:

   $$\epsilon_i(t) = |y_i(t) - \hat{y}_i(t)|$$

5. Finally, we take the average of all errors over all input points to get the total sum of square errors:

   $$\epsilon^2(t) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n |\epsilon_i(t)|}{n} = \text{MSE}(t)$$


Once we have found the optimal coefficients $(\hat{a},\hat{b})$ for each time period, we can predict future output values based on new inputs $(x_{\cdot,k}, t_{\cdot,k})$ by substituting them into the equation of the regression line:

$$\hat{y}_{\cdot,k}(t_{\cdot,k+1}) = \hat{a}(t_{\cdot,k+1})\tilde{x}_{\cdot,k} + \hat{b}(t_{\cdot,k+1)}$$

where $\tilde{x}_{\cdot,k}$ is the transformed input vector obtained by subtracting the corresponding mean and scaling by standard deviation. Standardizing the input data helps to avoid issues associated with varying scales across features and reduces the chances of numerical instability when computing dot products or gradients during optimization.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal component analysis (PCA) is another essential technique in statistical analysis that identifies patterns and correlations among multidimensional data. The main idea is to identify directions in high-dimensional data that maximize the variance of the data along each direction. Specifically, PCA first centers the data by removing the overall mean, then finds the covariance matrix between each pair of variables, computes eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, and selects the top-$K$ eigenvectors that correspond to the $K$ largest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors describe the dominant axes of variation in the data and give insight into the underlying structure of the problem. Once the principal components have been identified, we can use them to project the original data onto a lower-dimensional space that captures most of the variability. One common application of PCA is dimensionality reduction, where we seek to preserve the maximum amount of information in the data while reducing the dimensionality of the problem.

To compute PCA, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sample mean of the data:

   $$\mu = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i$$

2. Subtract the mean from each data point to obtain centered data:

   $$z_i = x_i-\mu$$

3. Compute the covariance matrix:

   $$\Sigma = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nz_iz_i^T$$

4. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix:

   $$\lambda_i,\psi_i=\arg\max_{\lambda, \psi} Tr(\lambda\psi^T\Sigma)=Tr(\psi\lambda^T\Sigma)$$

   where $\lambda_i$ is the $i$-th eigenvalue and $\psi_i$ is the corresponding eigenvector.

5. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the top-$K$ eigenvectors:

   $$\psi_{pca,1},\cdots,\psi_{pca,K}=\operatorname{sort}_{\lambda}\left[\psi_1\lambda_1,\cdots,\psi_p\lambda_p\right]$$

   where $\psi_{pca,k}$ is the $k$-th principal component.

6. Project the data onto the selected principal components:

   $$z_{pca,i}=\sum_{k=1}^Kx_{ik}\psi_{pca,k}$$

   where $z_{pca,i}$ is the $i$-th data point after projection onto the principal components.

Note that PCA is often used as part of a larger process known as exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA involves visualizing and analyzing data to gain insights into the relationships and patterns present in the data. By plotting the data points in a scatter plot and coloring them according to some chosen variable, we can see if there appear any clear clusters or groupings that suggest possible relationships or correlation structures. If there is not much covariation within groups, EDA may also suggest whether PCA may be effective at separating out the different groups. However, it is important to note that PCA is only one potential approach to visualize high-dimensional data; there are many others that work well for different types of datasets.

## Matrix Factorization
Matrix factorization is a popular technique for decomposing a dense matrix into two low-rank factors that approximate it well. In general terms, matrix factorization tries to find a low-rank approximation of a given matrix by finding latent factors that explain as much of the original matrix's entries as possible, but with fewer dimensions than the original matrix itself. There are many variations on this theme, depending on the nature of the matrix being factored and the desired tradeoff between compression and reconstruction error. Some examples of matrix factorization techniques include SVD decomposition, CUR decomposition, NMF (non-negative matrix factorization), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI). Here's an overview of the steps involved in matrix factorization applied to recommender systems:

1. Normalize the user-item rating matrix to ensure that all ratings are positive:

   $$R = R^\top$$

2. Apply SVD to decompose the normalized rating matrix into three separate matrices:

   $$\mathbf{U} \mathbf{S} \mathbf{V}^\top = R$$

    * $\mathbf{U}$: Contains left singular vectors that span the row space of $R$. 
    * $\mathbf{S}$: Diagonal matrix containing the singular values of $R$.
    * $\mathbf{V}$: Contains right singular vectors that span the column space of $R$. 

3. Choose a threshold level $\tau$ and remove any singular values below this threshold:

   $$S_{new} = \mathrm{diag}(\sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2, \ldots, \sigma_{\tau+1}^2)$$

4. Use the reduced singular value matrix and truncated left and right singular vectors to reconstruct the original rating matrix:

   $$\hat{R}= \mathbf{U} S_{new} \mathbf{V}^\top$$

5. Regularize the reconstructed matrix to improve the quality of the recommendation engine's recommendations:

   $$\hat{R}_{reg} = (\mathbf{U} S_{new} \mathbf{V}^\top+\beta I)^{-1}$$

    where $\beta$ is a regularization parameter that controls the degree of sparsity in the resulting matrix.

One advantage of using matrix factorization methods for recommender systems is that they do not rely on explicit user/item attributes or metadata, making them easier to deploy and scalable. Moreover, matrix factorization models can often learn non-linear relationships in the data, allowing them to better capture the characteristics of different users' preferences and items' properties. However, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity and require careful choice of hyperparameters for good performance. Nonetheless, modern approaches such as deep neural networks and collaborative filtering can achieve competitive results even with simpler approaches like SVD or pLSI, thanks to their ability to automatically extract relevant features from the raw data.

## Spectral Clustering
Spectral clustering is another unsupervised machine learning algorithm that discovers communities in a graph structure by partitioning the vertices into distinct groups based on their connections. Unlike traditional clustering methods that operate on point clouds or distance measures between data points, spectral clustering uses similarity instead of distances to cluster data points. The key idea behind spectral clustering is to interpret the relationship between data points as a graph, and then use eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix to find clusters. The Laplacian matrix of a graph is defined as the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees minus the adjacency matrix, and it encodes the connectivity and weights of edges between nodes. Eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix can reveal structural patterns and cluster assignments of the data points, which allows for novel and efficient solutions to problems related to network analysis.

Here's how spectral clustering works:

1. Create a similarity matrix $\mathbf{A}$ by applying a kernel function to measure the similarity between pairs of data points. Popular options include Gaussian kernels, heat kernel functions, and fuzzy c-means clustering.
2. Construct the laplacian matrix $\mathbf{L}$ of the similarity matrix $\mathbf{A}$, which encodes the strength and direction of links between vertices:

   $$\mathbf{L} = D^{-1/2}\mathbf{A}D^{-1/2}$$

    where $D$ is the diagonal matrix of node degrees.

3. Decompose the laplacian matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues:

   $$\mathbf{L} \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{E}\mathbf{Y}$$

   Where $\mathbf{Y}$ is a matrix of eigenvectors and $\mathbf{E}$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.
4. Select the k smallest eigenvalues from $\mathbf{E}$ to determine the number of clusters, where k is the desired number of clusters. 
5. Partition the data points into k clusters based on their assigned cluster labels in $\mathbf{Y}$.
6. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid in its assigned cluster using a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

Spectral clustering has many advantages compared to traditional clustering methods such as K-Means. First, it does not assume a predefined number of clusters and can find appropriate numbers of clusters using a flexible range of parameters. Second, it directly handles the geometry of the data by taking into account edge connectivity and geometric structures inherent in graphs. Third, it is capable of capturing nonlinear relationships between data points, which is particularly helpful in complex domains such as social media, text analytics, and molecular biology. Overall, however, spectral clustering requires a significant amount of domain expertise and is limited by the assumptions made by the kernel function used to construct the similarity matrix, although recent developments in deep learning have led to breakthroughs in addressing these challenges.
