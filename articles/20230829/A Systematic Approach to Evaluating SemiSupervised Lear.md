Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning technique that combines labeled and unlabeled data for better predictive performance than traditional supervised learning techniques alone. This article outlines an approach to systematically evaluate SSL algorithms by comparing their performances on various datasets, tasks, and evaluation metrics. The main contribution of this work is the development of a comprehensive benchmarking framework, called SEMLAB (Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Benchmark), which includes standardized experiments and comparisons across diverse SSL algorithms, datasets, and evaluation metrics. 

In this paper we focus on two types of SSL algorithms: classifier chains (CC) and label propagation (LP). We use three criteria to compare these SSL algorithms: accuracy, runtime, and fairness. Accuracy measures how well the model can classify new samples correctly from both labeled and unlabeled data. Runtime measures the time required to train and inference using each algorithm. Fairness measures whether the predicted labels are representative of the true labels in terms of demographic parity, statistical parity, or equal opportunity. These criteria aim to capture different aspects of model behavior and identify areas where one algorithm may be more suitable than another.


We start with background introduction followed by basic concepts, terminologies and general ideas related to SSL. Then we move towards classification algorithms like CC and LP and describe them in detail alongside comparison of their accuracy, runtime and fairness. Next, we look at specific evaluation metrics used for evaluating models such as AUC ROC curve, cross-entropy loss, and equal opportunity difference between predictions. Finally, we discuss limitations of existing benchmarks and propose an improved benchmarking framework based on real world applications. 

# 2.Background Introduction
Semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising research direction that combines labeled and unlabeled data for better predictive performance than traditional supervised learning techniques. It allows machines to learn from only part of available training data while still achieving good results on a certain task. There are many SSL algorithms that have been proposed including Label Propagation, Probabilistic Graphical Model, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). However, there is no systematic benchmarking framework that evaluates all the SSL algorithms on multiple datasets and tasks under various evaluation metrics. To address this need, several papers have proposed semi-supervised machine learning benchmarks that measure the performance of SSL algorithms on various datasets and tasks. However, most of these benchmarks focus on single algorithms and ignore important factors such as diversity, scalability, and interoperability among SSL algorithms. 


Our work aims to develop a comprehensive benchmarking framework, called SEMLAB, that covers various SSL algorithms, datasets, and evaluation metrics and provides a unified platform for measuring their performance over a range of scenarios. In order to do so, we first define some key concepts related to SSL and provide definitions of the essential components involved in SSL learning process. Additionally, we propose a set of standardized experiments and evaluation metrics that can be applied to any dataset and SSL algorithm to compare its performances across different settings.


Overall, our goal is to build a robust and reliable evaluation methodology for SSL algorithms by conducting extensive experimental evaluations and comparisons across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our benchmark will help researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders make informed decisions when choosing and fine-tuning SSL algorithms for practical applications.

# 3.Basic Concepts, Terminologies and Ideas Related to SSL
## 3.1 Types of SSL Algorithms
There are two commonly known types of SSL algorithms: Classifier Chains (CC) and Label Propagation (LP). 

### 3.1.1 Classifier Chains
Classifier Chains (CC) are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where each node represents an attribute/feature in the input data, and each edge represents a transformation performed on those attributes. In other words, the output of one node becomes the input of the next node. The idea behind classifier chains is to take advantage of correlations within the input features by chaining together multiple nodes that extract relevant information from the same source before passing it to the final prediction layer. Unlike regular neural networks, which typically consist of a linear sequence of layers, classifiers chains allow non-linear relationships between inputs to be learned.


The figure below shows an example of a classifier chain algorithm for classifying images into categories such as animals, vehicles, etc. Each image is represented as a feature vector that consists of pixel values extracted from the image. The algorithm involves applying transformations such as convolutional filters, pooling operations, and activation functions on the pixels to obtain meaningful representations. Once the transformed representations are obtained, they are fed through the classifier chain graph to produce a probability distribution over the target classes.



One issue with classifier chains is that they require careful design and hyperparameter tuning to achieve good performance. They are also sensitive to initialization and the choice of optimizer, especially if the number of parameters is large. Moreover, there is limited support for multi-class problems since the DAG structure does not allow direct connections between the outputs of different classes. On the other hand, LP algorithms offer a simpler yet effective approach for semi-supervised learning problems due to their ability to propagate labels from neighboring nodes.

### 3.1.2 Label Propagation
Label Propagation (LP) was introduced by <NAME> et al. in 2003. Its core idea is to propagate the label of a node to its neighbors in the graph until convergence, thus allowing us to estimate the missing label of an instance without access to the original label of the neighbors. This approach uses message passing mechanisms to spread the labels around the network and iteratively update the labels until convergence. LP is a simple but powerful algorithm that works well even when the topology of the graph is highly complex. Despite being simple, LP is surprisingly accurate in practice for a wide variety of problems, including structured prediction problems such as collaborative filtering and link prediction.


The figure below shows an example of a label propagation algorithm for clustering social media users based on their posts. Here, each user is represented as a vertex in the graph, and edges represent interactions between users. During each iteration of the algorithm, messages are passed from the vertices to their neighbors, which are updated according to the received messages and the desired confidence level. After convergence, each user has assigned a cluster label indicating which group they belong to. Note that this example assumes a binary classification problem where each post belongs either to one group or the other. For multi-label classification, additional steps would be needed to handle the overlap between groups. 



Despite its simplicity, LP requires careful parameter selection to avoid getting stuck in local minima and overfitting. Moreover, it cannot directly handle multi-class problems since the algorithm relies on the assumption that labels should be propagated independently. Nonetheless, LP offers a flexible and efficient way to incorporate unstructured data sources into ML pipelines, making it a popular choice for analyzing complex social phenomena such as online communities.

## 3.2 Components of an SSL Network
An SSL network consists of four main components - Labeled Data, Unlabeled Data, Parameters, and Prediction Layer.

### 3.2.1 Labeled Data
Labeled data refers to the training data that contains both labeled and unlabeled instances. The labeled instances are used during the training phase to learn the relationship between the features and the corresponding targets. These examples contain clear explanatory information about the target variable, while the unlabeled ones don’t have enough information about the target. As a result, the algorithm must rely heavily on the unlabeled data for knowledge transfer. While labeled data plays a crucial role in the initial stages of learning, its importance decreases as more and more unlabeled data gets annotated. Therefore, it makes sense to consider reducing the amount of labeled data whenever possible.

### 3.2.2 Unlabeled Data
Unlabeled data refers to the remaining pool of data after removing the labeled examples. In other words, the unlabeled data are usually very sparse and unlabelled. Since semi-supervised learning is all about leveraging the unlabeled data, it is crucial to ensure that the unlabeled data collected is diverse and representative of the entire population. Different approaches exist to collect unlabeled data such as active learning and self-training. Active learning involves selecting a subset of the unlabeled data that the algorithm thinks might be informative for training the model. Self-training involves generating synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of the labeled and unlabeled data. Both methods come with their own tradeoffs such as sample efficiency and privacy concerns.

### 3.2.3 Parameters
Parameters refer to the weights and biases associated with each node in the network. When an SSL algorithm is trained on a particular dataset, the parameters determine what features contribute most significantly to the decision boundary. Often times, the parameters are initialized randomly and then optimized using stochastic gradient descent.

### 3.2.4 Prediction Layer
Prediction layer refers to the last layer of the network that produces the final output. For regression tasks, the prediction layer simply computes the mean squared error between the actual value and the predicted value. For classification tasks, the prediction layer assigns probabilities to each class based on the softmax function.

## 3.3 Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation metrics are tools used to quantify the performance of SSL algorithms. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, PR curve, cross entropy loss, and equal opportunity difference. Let's go through each metric in detail.

### 3.3.1 Accuracy
Accuracy is one of the simplest metrics used for evaluating classification tasks. It calculates the percentage of correct predictions made by the model. It takes into account both the correct classifications and incorrect classifications. Higher the accuracy score, higher the degree of trustworthiness of the model. However, accuracy can mislead if the test set contains a significant proportion of ambiguous or unknown cases. To avoid false positives, one option is to set a threshold on the output of the model above which the predictions are considered positive, i.e., high confidence. Another option is to employ area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve as a proxy for accuracy.

### 3.3.2 Precision and Recall
Precision and recall are complementary metrics that are used to evaluate classification tasks. Precision measures the fraction of true positive predictions amongst the total positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the fraction of true positive predictions amongst the total actual positive cases present in the dataset. A high precision indicates that the model returns accurate results, however, low recall means that it fails to detect some negative cases. One common solution to balance precision and recall is to combine them into a weighted average.

### 3.3.3 F1 Score
F1 score is an extension of the precision-recall metric that combines both scores into a single score. It balances both metrics by taking harmonic mean of their values. An ideal F1 score is 1, whereas lower scores indicate poorer performance.

### 3.3.4 ROC Curve
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot that illustrates the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity measures the rate of detection of positive cases while specificity measures the rate of rejecting negatives cases. The curve is plotted against the inverse of the False Positive Rate (FPR), where the FPR is defined as the probability of having a negative case incorrectly identified as positive. A perfect ROC curve has a slope of 1 and y intercept of 0. The area under the curve (AUC) gives an indication of the quality of the classifier.

### 3.3.5 PR Curve
Precision-Recall (PR) curve is similar to the ROC curve except that it plots precision versus recall instead of sensitivity versus 1-specificity. Precision is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives, while recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. The PR curve helps analyze the tradeoff between precision and recall as the model thresholds change. The area under the PR curve (AP) gives an overall picture of the classifier performance.

### 3.3.6 Cross Entropy Loss
Cross entropy loss is used for regression tasks to calculate the distance between the predicted and actual values. It is commonly used in deep learning for multiclass classification and binary classification problems. The formula for calculating cross entropy loss is given below:

$$\large{L_{CE}=-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[y_i\log(p_i)+(1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)]}$$

where $N$ is the number of training examples, $y_i$ is the ground truth label for the $i$-th example, and $p_i$ is the predicted probability for the $i$-th example. A low value of CE loss indicates a better fit between the predicted and actual distributions.

### 3.3.7 Equal Opportunity Difference
Equal opportunity difference is a metric used for evaluating fairness in binary classification problems. It measures the absolute difference between the percentages of positive outcomes for privileged and unprivileged groups. Equality of opportunity ensures that individuals receive comparable opportunities regardless of their protected status. One measure of equality of opportunity is Statistical Parity. Statistical parity requires that the differences in false positive rates between the two groups are the same, meaning that the disparity in the risk of a mistake made by the default classifier for different demographics is the same across the two groups. Another measure of equality of opportunity is Demographic Parity, which requires that the false positive rates for different demographics are the same.

When we apply SSL algorithms on medical diagnoses, we care equally about everyone because we want to prevent any potential bias caused by imbalance in the data. In contrast, when dealing with advertisement targeting, we care particularly about people who are likely to click on ads based on demographic information such as age, gender, race, and income. According to our analysis, current SSL algorithms lack the capability to achieve fairness in clinical diagnosis, leading to potential issues such as healthcare costs and patient safety. By developing advanced SSL algorithms with the necessary fairness constraints, we can revolutionize healthcare and save lives.
