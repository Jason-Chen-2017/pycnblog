时间序列数据是复杂多变、高维、连续的动态系统所产生的数据。由于其无序性、动态性、多样性等特点，时间序列数据的分析对我们理解数据的过程、变化模式和规律具有重要意义。但是，在实际应用中，由于测量误差或其他原因导致的数据缺陷可能会使得时间序列数据存在异常值。异常值的发现和分析能够帮助我们了解数据中的异常情况，并通过处理或者移除它们来减少模型的错误率。

One popular way to detect anomaly in time series data is by using unsupervised learning techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which can identify latent structures and patterns that characterize normal behavior of the system. However, PCA relies on a few assumptions about the distribution of the data such as normally distributed or gaussian noise with some specific variance structure. In this work, we propose a novel method called graph autoencoders (GAE) for anomaly detection on multivariate time series data. GAE extends standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by utilizing graph topology information of the data to learn features that are more relevant to the underlying spatial correlation between different variables within each time step. We show how our proposed approach can effectively capture the temporal dependencies among different variables and outperform state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection. Moreover, we also provide an evaluation framework to measure the performance of our model compared to several baselines.


In this article, we will discuss the background of time series analysis, including its characteristics, terminology, models and applications. Next, we will briefly introduce the basic concept and algorithms of GAE for anomaly detection. Afterwards, we will present the mathematical formulations and explain the operation steps used in the implementation. Finally, we will provide sample code snippets and detailed explanation of the code execution alongside demonstration of results obtained from our experiments. The last section will include future research directions and challenges.



## 2. Background Introduction: Time Series Analysis ##
A time series is a sequence of observations taken at successive times, usually with a regular interval of time. It is often described by a mathematical function that represents the evolution over time. Mathematically, it can be represented as follows:<|im_sep|>

The equation shows a linear relationship between the value $y(t)$ at any given time $t$ and a set of independent variables $\{x_i\}$, where the subscript $i$ denotes the i-th variable measured. Specifically, if we have m variables observed, then $x_i$ represent the i-th dimension of the measurement vector x(t). For example, in physical systems, $x_1$ may correspond to position, $x_2$ to velocity, etc., while in financial systems, $x_1$ could correspond to stock price, $x_2$ could correspond to economic indicators, etc. 

The slope of the curve at any point determines whether there has been an increase (+ve slope) or decrease (-ve slope) in the value of y over time. A positive slope indicates that the value of y increases over time, whereas a negative slope indicates that the value decreases over time. Slopes close to zero indicate constant values of y over time. 

The duration of time between two consecutive observations forms another important feature of time series data. If the time intervals between consecutive measurements vary significantly, they typically signify irregularities in the underlying dynamics of the system. This makes it difficult to determine a meaningful pattern through simple statistical analyses alone.

However, one of the key advantages of time series data is that they are non-stationary, meaning that their properties do not remain constant throughout time. Over time, trends and seasonality may change, resulting in fluctuations in the direction and magnitude of the dependent variable. Hence, traditional statistical methods cannot handle these changes in a robust manner without incorporating external factors such as climate variability or seasonality. Therefore, many modern machine learning methods, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep learning, have emerged as powerful tools for processing time series data.

The use of RNNs has enabled numerous applications in finance, weather prediction, healthcare, transportation, energy consumption management, security analysis, and many other fields. One application domain where RNNs have been particularly effective is anomaly detection, which aims to identify abnormal events or behaviors in time series data.


Anomaly detection consists of identifying a subset of data points that differ markedly from the majority of the data points. These anomalous data points are further classified into different types based on their characteristics, leading to the identification of several categories of anomalies:

- **Point anomalies** - Individual data points that are significantly different than the rest of the data points. Examples include sensor failures, software errors, fraudulent transactions, network attacks, etc. 
- **Contextual anomalies** - Changes in the context of other related data points. For instance, sudden drop-offs in sales due to temporary product launches, spikes in traffic congestion caused by natural disasters, gradual declines in inflation rates following economic downturns, etc.
- **Collective anomalies** - Persistent patterns of deviation from expected behavior that impact multiple data points simultaneously. Common examples include cyber-attacks that affect multiple servers or IoT devices simultaneously, spatially correlated diseases such as measles, leptospirosis, dengue fever, etc. 

Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in managing a variety of real-world systems that generate massive amounts of data, ranging from industrial process control and manufacturing to social media monitoring and cybersecurity. To perform anomaly detection accurately and efficiently, various machine learning approaches have been developed, including supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. However, most of them rely heavily on labeled data and require a significant amount of effort to annotate large volumes of data for training. 


## 3. Basic Concepts and Terminology ##

Before delving into the details of our GAE model for anomaly detection on multivariate time series data, let's first understand some basics concepts and terms used in time series analysis.

1. Sample rate vs sampling frequency

In signal processing, the term "sampling" refers to the process of obtaining a digital representation of continuous analog signals. Here, "sampling" means taking discrete samples of a signal at a fixed periodicity. The main reason behind this decision is the ease of quantitative interpretation of the recorded data. Since we want to analyze the behavior of the dynamic system during the observation window, we need to maintain consistency across all the samples, otherwise it would become too noisy to make reliable inferences. 

Therefore, in order to collect data at high enough resolution, we need to take multiple samples per unit time. The sample rate determines the number of samples collected per unit time. For example, a sample rate of 1kHz implies that we obtain one sample every millisecond. In general, the lower the sample rate, the higher the resolution of the measurement. On the other hand, the sampling frequency is defined as the inverse of the sample rate, denoted by Fs = 1/T, where T is the length of a single time segment. Thus, the sampling frequency determines the range of frequencies that can be resolved by the signal. 

2. Trend and seasonality

Trend is a smooth increase or decrease in the value of a time series over time. Seasonality refers to periodic variations in the value of a time series that occur at regular intervals. The presence of both trends and seasons can help us better understand the overall behavior of the dynamic system. There are three major classes of trends commonly found in time series data:

- Linear Trend – The data tend to move upward or downward consistently at a constant rate. For example, consider the time series representing the daily temperature readings. The temperature tends to increase steadily towards the summer holidays, while cooling off during winter vacations.
- Nonlinear Trend – The data exhibits complex patterns that cannot be captured by a straight line. For example, the time series representing global temperature fluctuations exhibit nonlinear patterns that are not explained by a simple polynomial.
- Cyclic Trend – The data exhibits repeated oscillations that repeat at regular intervals. For example, the sine wave generated by wind speed varies periodically throughout the year.

Seasonality is a repeating pattern that occurs at regular intervals. Different seasons might have different amplitudes, phases, and patterns. Seasonality helps in understanding the cyclic nature of time series and highlights areas of interest or events that recur frequently. Seasonal periods generally have varying durations, starting with a relatively short period at the beginning of the record and slowly increasing until becoming a longer period at the end of the record. 

We can visualize the effect of seasonality on a time series using the Fourier transform. The transformed signal reveals distinct peaks corresponding to the dominant cycles of the original signal. For example, a strong peak in the Fourier transform corresponds to a low-frequency sinusoidal component.
