Sentiment analysis is an important natural language processing task that involves classifying the sentiment of a text into positive, negative or neutral categories based on its semantics and context. In this work, we focus on evaluating pre-trained models such as GloVe and ELMo using multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and cosine similarity. To evaluate these pre-trained representations, we use four benchmark datasets with different levels of human annotated data availability. We also propose a framework to compare them based on their performance across all the above evaluation metrics. Additionally, we show how contextual word embeddings can benefit sentiment analysis by highlighting semantically related words. 

We hope our paper will inspire further research efforts in understanding and applying pre-trained contextual word embeddings in sentiment analysis tasks. Our approach provides a good starting point for researchers to explore other evaluation metrics beyond traditional classification accuracy while providing insights into the benefits and limitations of the pre-trained representations used in sentiment analysis.

In conclusion, we have proposed a novel framework to evaluate pre-trained contextual word representations for sentiment analysis. The main contribution is the comparison of representation quality across various evaluation metrics and the selection of appropriate benchmarks for evaluating them. We demonstrated that contextual embeddings can significantly improve sentiment analysis performance even when only trained on limited labeled data. However, they may not be suitable for every application scenario due to their ability to capture domain specific information or generalize well to unseen texts. Future work should involve more empirical evaluations of pre-trained embeddings in realistic scenarios such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and question answering. Moreover, it would be helpful to study whether there exist meaningful differences between pre-trained embedding styles and architectures in terms of their effectiveness in different domains. This could help identify which types of text require specialized embeddings versus generic ones. Overall, our work sheds light on the potential of pre-trained contextual word embeddings for sentiment analysis and suggests directions for future research. 

2.背景介绍
Contextual word representations (CWR) are widely adopted in natural language processing (NLP) applications, where they provide state-of-the-art performance over conventional methods such as bag-of-words model or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These CWR models learn distributed representations of words and phrases from large corpora and enable efficient encoding of both syntactic and semantic information about text. Most CWR models rely on two key techniques: compositionality and context modeling. Compositionality captures the meaning of complex words through their constituent parts and enables better disentanglement of meaning compared to monolithic vectors. Context modeling leverages linguistic and external factors such as surrounding sentences, previous and subsequent contexts, and coreferences to encode the sequence and temporal aspect of text. While recent advances in CWR models have led to significant improvements in many NLP tasks, their implications in sentiment analysis remain underexplored. In this work, we explore several promising pre-trained CWR models for sentiment analysis, namely GloVe and ELMo, and investigate their impact on downstream sentiment classification tasks.

3.基本概念术语说明
Sentiment analysis refers to the process of identifying the underlying emotional tone and intended impact of a piece of written text towards a reader. It is often applied to social media platforms, online reviews, product feedbacks, customer service conversations, or any other source of textual input. There are several ways to define sentiment, ranging from categorical labels like “positive” vs “negative”, to continuous scores between -1 to +1. Here, we use binary labels for simplicity – either positive or negative. Another fundamental concept in sentiment analysis is polarity shift, which means the distinction between strong positive/negative sentiments and weak positivity/negativity. For example, the phrase "I am happy" has strong positive sentiment but weak negativity. Polarities may change quickly depending on the context and situation. Therefore, sentiment analysis requires careful handling of linguistic nuances and emotions expressed through subtle cues.

4.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
GloVe and ELMo are two popular pre-trained CWR models that come close to achieving state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks such as machine translation, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis. Both of these models represent each token in a sentence as a dense vector of fixed size, called a word vector, and then concatenate them together to form a sentence vector. GloVe uses global cooccurrence statistics to train the word vectors while ELMo additionally takes into account the local cooccurrence patterns within the context window. Both models achieve high performance on most sentiment analysis benchmarks despite being relatively lightweight and simple to implement. Below we present the basic algorithm steps followed by each of these models:

**GloVe:** Given a corpus of documents $D$, we first tokenize each document into a set of tokens $\{t_i\}$ where each token corresponds to a unique word type. We then count the frequency of each pair $(w_i, w_j)$ of adjacent words in the corpus, where $w_i$ is a center word and $w_j$ is one of its neighboring words. Specifically, we compute the probability mass function of $P(w_{ij}|w_i)$ where $w_{ij}$ denotes the occurrence of the pair $(w_j, w_i)$ given $w_i$. Using this probabilistic model, we estimate the conditional distribution of $w_{ij}$ given $w_i$ and build the co-occurrence matrix $X \in R^{|V|x|V|}$. Finally, we apply stochastic gradient descent to minimize the objective function defined as follows:
$$\mathcal{L}(W)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i, j=1}^{|V|}\left(X_{ij}-u_{i}v_{j}\right)^2+\lambda\left(\sum_{i=1}^{|V|}\lVert v_i\rVert^2+\sum_{j=1}^{|V|}\lVert u_j\rVert^2\right),$$

where $W=(v_1, \cdots,v_{|V|},u_1,\cdots,u_{|V|})$ represents the word vectors, $V$ is the vocabulary, and $\lambda$ controls the strength of regularization term. Once training is complete, the learned word vectors can be used for sentiment analysis by projecting each document's token vectors onto the space spanned by the learned word vectors using the formula $z = U^\top x$ where $U$ is the word vector matrix and $x$ is the document vector obtained after concatenating individual token vectors along axis 0. 

The interpretation of the weights learned by GloVe is straightforward. If two words tend to appear frequently in similar contexts, their corresponding word vectors will be closer to each other in the resulting feature space. Similarly, if two pairs of words do not occur very often in the same contexts, their corresponding entries in the co-occurrence matrix X will be close to zero. 

 **ELMo:** ELMo is a bidirectional language model that combines the strengths of traditional LM and deep learning techniques. Instead of representing each token as a single vector, ELMo encodes each token using two separate biLSTM layers to capture the contextual and sequential aspects of the token. The output hidden states of these layers are combined using linear projection layers and elementwise summation to obtain the final sentence vector. Each layer independently processes the input sequence without any interference from the other layers, allowing for deeper reasoning. 

To handle variable length inputs, ELMo uses masking and padding mechanisms that ensure consistent computation lengths throughout the network. Masking replaces masked positions with zeros, ensuring that padded positions do not affect the prediction at later stages. Padding pads shorter sequences with zeros so that all sequences reach the maximum allowed length specified during training. Training of ELMo involves optimizing two auxiliary objectives that jointly train the forward and backward LSTM layers and predict the next word in the sequence simultaneously. The overall objective is the average of three losses computed on the forward, backward, and next-word predictions. These losses correspond to the likelihood of generating each position in the sequence correctly, the likelihood of predicting the correct order of the words in the sequence, and the likelihood of generating the correct next word given the preceding words.  

To interpret the learned word embeddings generated by ELMo, we need to understand what information is captured by each dimension of the learned representations. One intuition is that ELMo models the interactions between words and the surroundings of those words to generate rich and diverse features for sentiment analysis. For instance, the word embeddings associated with the adjectives in a sentence might reflect the associated valence or intensity of the sentiment expressed in the sentence. By contrast, the word embeddings associated with nouns or verbs might reflect properties such as politeness, certainty, or subjectivity. Interpreting the dimensions of ELMo is challenging because it contains both intrinsic and extrinsic information that may not be interpretable directly. Nonetheless, some common approaches include visualizing the learned embeddings using t-SNE visualization or exploring the nearest neighbors of target words to gain insights into their relationship with other words.
