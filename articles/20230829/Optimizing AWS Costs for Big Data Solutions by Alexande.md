2.基本术语及概念
Before diving into specific details about optimizing cloud costs for big data solutions, let’s review some basic concepts and terminology related to AWS:
## AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template that contains an operating system, software, and preconfigured settings which can be launched as an instance on any Amazon EC2 server. AMIs are created by taking a snapshot of an existing instance and then customizing it using configuration management tools like Chef or Puppet. You can create your own custom AMIs or use prebuilt AMIs provided by AWS Marketplace or other partners. These images have predefined configurations and allow you to easily launch new instances with similar hardware specifications.
## Amazon EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) allows users to purchase virtual machines running in the Amazon cloud environment. Users can specify the type, size, and geographic location of each instance they launch. Each instance has its own virtual private cloud (VPC), subnet, and security group, making it ideal for building highly available, scalable applications. With EC2, customers pay per hour based on the total amount of compute capacity consumed within a given time period. There are different types of EC2 instances ranging from general purpose servers to memory optimized instances designed for big data workloads.
## Auto Scaling Group
Auto Scaling groups are a collection of homogeneous EC2 instances that automatically scale out or down based on demand. They can be configured to adjust the number of instances based on either a schedule, metric value, or manually initiated actions. For example, if one of your instances starts misbehaving, Auto Scaling can terminate it and spin up another one to replace it. This helps ensure that your application always has enough capacity to handle fluctuating traffic loads.
## Billing Allocation Tagging
Billing allocation tags are key-value pairs associated with AWS resources that can be used to track resource usage and allocate costs among multiple teams or departments in an enterprise. By applying appropriate billing allocation tags, IT managers can view the total cost breakdown across all accounts, understand how much each department is responsible for, and identify areas for optimization. Tags can be applied at the individual level, group level, or organizational level.
## CloudTrail
CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, and auditing of AWS account activity. It provides a history of API calls made through the console, AWS SDKs, and command line interfaces. It can be used to monitor changes to AWS resources and detect unauthorized activity. CloudTrail logs can be stored in a centralized S3 bucket for long term retention and analysis.
## CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms
CloudWatch is a suite of monitoring tools provided by AWS. CloudWatch can be used to capture operational data including metrics, events, and logs. Metrics are numerical values emitted by AWS resources over specified intervals. Alarms can be set on these metrics to trigger notifications or take action, such as scaling an Auto Scaling group or terminating an instance when certain thresholds are met. CloudWatch Logs integrates with CloudTrail to provide a single pane of glass for analyzing both AWS Management Console and CLI commands executed by authorized users.
## DNS (Domain Name System)
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names like www.example.com into IP addresses like 192.0.2.1. DNS queries typically travel over UDP port 53, but TCP/IP protocol may also be supported depending on the setup of the client. When creating an Amazon EC2 instance, you need to assign a unique DNS name so that other instances in the same VPC can find it using DNS resolution. You can register your domain name with Amazon Route 53, which supports dynamic DNS updates to keep your DNS records current.
## Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a web service that simplifies the process of provisioning and managing storage volumes in the AWS cloud. Customers can create EBS volumes and attach them to EC2 instances to store data persistently. EBS volumes support different performance levels like General Purpose SSD (GP2), Provisioned IOPS (IO1), and Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1). Unlike instance storage, EBS volumes can be attached and detached from running instances without stopping the instance itself. EBS volumes can be encrypted at rest using keys managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
## Elastic File System (EFS)
Elastic File System (EFS) provides a simple, scalable, and reliable file system interface for EC2 instances. It supports a range of throughput modes like bursting and provisioned, making it well suited for production workloads that require fast and frequent read/write operations. EFS can be mounted directly on EC2 instances or accessed via network file systems like NFS or SMB. EFS volumes can be encrypted at rest using keys managed by KMS.
## Elastic Map Reduce (EMR)
Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is a fully managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy for developers to quickly process vast amounts of data across a variety of AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, EBS storage, and S3 buckets. EMR provides a range of options such as Spark, Hive, Flink, Kafka, and Presto, allowing developers to choose the right tool for the job. EMR uses automatic horizontal scaling to manage the number of nodes dynamically based on workload needs, reducing costs compared to traditional on-premises Hadoop deployments.
## Elasticsearch Service
Elasticsearch Service is a hosted Elasticsearch cluster that delivers advanced search capabilities to log and event data stored in AWS. It is powered by open-source Elasticsearch and fully manages the cluster for you, providing fault tolerance, automated backup and restore, and configurable encryption at rest. With Elasticsearch Service, you can build a fully functional log indexing and searching solution within minutes, enabling rapid research and development cycles.
## Glacier Vault
Glacier Vault is a secure place to store your Amazon S3 data durably. Once an object is uploaded, it is initially saved in Glacier until restored to S3, after which it becomes permanently deleted from Glacier. Data retrieval fees are charged based on the amount of data retrieved during a particular month.
## IAM (Identity Access Management)
IAM is a service that enables you to control who accesses what in your AWS account. You can create user identities with different permissions and authorizations to access AWS resources. IAM policies define what actions users can perform and under what conditions. Groups enable you to simplify access management by assigning policies to groups rather than individuals. Finally, roles can be assumed by other entities to delegate temporary permission sets.
## Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are serverless functions that run code in response to events, such as HTTP requests, AWS messages, or timer triggers. They offer low latency and auto scaling, making them ideal for handling streams of data and automation tasks. Lambda functions can be written in Python, Node.js, Java, C#, or Go programming languages and use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to extend their functionality. Lambda functions can be triggered from S3 events, CloudWatch events, or other AWS resources.
## Key Management Service (KMS)
Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service offered by AWS that enables you to encrypt data at rest. You can generate and manage customer master keys (CMKs) that are used to protect data keys, which are used to actually encrypt and decrypt data. KMS also includes support for third party encryption algorithms, allowing you to encrypt your data using AES-GCM, RSA, or HMAC mechanisms.
## Load Balancer
A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances. You can configure a load balancer to distribute traffic based on multiple factors, including source IP address, path, host header, or headers. Load balancers come in two flavors - Application and Network. An Application load balancer routes traffic to web applications, whereas a Network load balancer routes traffic to applications that rely on TCP or UDP protocols. You can also configure HTTPS termination, session stickiness, connection draining, and health checks on a load balancer.
## Monitoring Tools
Monitoring tools include CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and X-Ray, which provide visibility into user activity, API usage, and issues impacting your AWS resources. CloudTrail captures API calls made through the console, AWS SDKs, and command line interfaces, which can be analyzed later to detect suspicious behavior or unauthorized activities. CloudWatch provides metrics and alarms that can be used to monitor your EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, ELB load balancers, and API Gateway endpoints. X-Ray is a distributed tracing service that can be used to debug issues and analyze performance bottlenecks in your microservices architecture.
## Neptune
Neptune is a fully-managed graph database service offered by AWS. It is capable of storing graphs consisting of vertices and edges, and allows for querying those graphs efficiently using Gremlin query language. Neptune is ideal for building knowledge graphs, fraud detection, recommendation engines, and other applications requiring graph structures. Neptune can be deployed as a standalone cluster or together with Amazon Aurora Serverless to reduce infrastructure overhead and costs.
## OpsWorks
OpsWorks is a configuration management service that automates the process of setting up and managing stacks of Amazon EC2 instances. Stacks consist of layers, which contain recipes for installing software packages, configuring AWS resources, and running scripts. OpsWorks also handles patching and backups of EC2 instances, making it easier to maintain consistent configurations across your fleet.
## QuickSight
QuickSight is a business intelligence and visualization platform that allows users to connect to data sources such as S3 buckets, relational databases, and data lakes, and create interactive dashboards and reports. It provides real-time insights by delivering an intuitive experience with built-in analytic capabilities. QuickSight can be integrated with other AWS services such as Athena, EMR, and Elasticsearch to gain deep insight into your data.
## Relational Database Service (RDS)
Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS cloud. RDS provides a range of deployment options such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora, making it possible to meet varying needs and requirements. You can deploy and manage RDS databases using familiar management tools such as the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, or APIs.
## Reserved Instance
A reserved instance is a contract between AWS and you that gives you priority access to selected On-Demand instances for a predetermined period. Reserved instances are billed at a discount compared to On-Demand rates, and they offer significant discounts compared to regular On-Demand prices. Reserved instances can be purchased for any instance type, region, and tenancy, giving you flexibility in choosing the right instance for your workload.
## Simple Storage Service (S3)
Simple Storage Service (S3) is a cloud storage service provided by AWS that offers fast, scalable, and cost-effective data storage. You can upload files to S3 from anywhere around the world, and access them using simple RESTful APIs or SDKs. S3 offers a wide range of storage classes like STANDARD, REDUCED_REDUNDANCY, GLACIER, and INTELLIGENT_TIERING, which provide different tradeoffs between availability, performance, and price. S3 integrates closely with other AWS services such as EC2, EMR, Lambda, and CloudFormation, making it a powerful combination for building large-scale data pipelines, content distribution networks, and real-time analytics solutions.
## Simple Notification Service (S3)
