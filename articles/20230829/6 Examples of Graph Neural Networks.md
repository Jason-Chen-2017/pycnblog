# 1.简介
  

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a popular class of deep learning techniques for processing graph-structured data. In this article, we will review some commonly used GNN models and their applications in the field of natural language processing. 

## 2.基本概念
### 2.1 图（Graph）
A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges. Each node represents an entity such as a person or a concept, while each edge represents a relationship between two entities. The connectivity structure of the graph determines its characteristic properties and provides powerful modeling capabilities. Different types of graphs include social networks, knowledge networks, citation networks, and web graphs. Here's a simple example:


```
    A           B
   / \         |
  C   D        E
   \ /          |
    F           G
    
```

In this example, there are seven nodes (A to G), connected by six edges (AC, AD, AE, BC, BE, BF, CD, CE, CF, DE, DF, DG). This type of network structure can be easily represented using adjacency matrix. 

### 2.2 节点表示（Node representation）
Each node can be represented by various features that capture important characteristics of the corresponding entity. For instance, the name of a person could serve as one feature; the topics discussed in a paper could serve as another feature. When dealing with graphs, it is often beneficial to represent each node by a high-dimensional vector instead of individual scalar features. By doing so, we can better capture the heterogeneous information inherent in the graph. Common approaches to represent nodes include linear embeddings, neural networks, and convolutional layers.

### 2.3 邻居采样（Neighborhood sampling）
When building large graphs, storing all edges directly becomes impractical. Instead, we use neighborhood sampling to randomly select only a small subset of edges from each node during training. One common strategy involves selecting k-hop neighbors for each node uniformly at random, where k represents the number of hops away from the central node. We also need to ensure that our selection procedure does not introduce any biases towards certain directions or subgraphs.

### 2.4 激活函数（Activation function）
An activation function specifies the output shape of each layer of neurons in a neural network model. Common choices include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, softmax, and softplus. To avoid vanishing gradients or numerical instability, we usually apply batch normalization or dropout regularization after each activation function.

### 2.5 Attention mechanisms
Attention mechanisms have been proven to significantly improve the performance of many machine learning tasks. They allow a model to focus on relevant parts of input sequences or graphs, rather than relying solely on global statistics. Traditional attention mechanisms include dot product attention, multi-head attention, and self-attention.

### 2.6 图卷积网络（Graph Convolutional Network, GCN）
The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) was first introduced in [Kipf et al., 2017]. It uses graph convolution operations to aggregate local neighbourhood features into node representations. The basic idea is to propagate messages along edges through a graph, update the node representations based on these messages, and then pool them back to obtain final outputs. There are several variants of GCN, including Chebyshev polynomial approximations and nonlinear transformers.

### 2.7 图注意力网络（Graph Attention Network, GAT）
The Graph Attention Network (GAT) was proposed in [Veličković et al., 2017] and further developed in [Velickovic et al., 2019]. Similar to GCN, GAT propagates messages along edges, updates node representations based on these messages, and finally pools them back to obtain final outputs. However, unlike traditional message passing methods like GCN or SAGE, GAT incorporates attention mechanisms within each node's message-passing process. Specifically, GAT computes different attention coefficients for each neighbor node and applies them to their respective contributions before updating the target node's representation. These attention coefficients effectively act as weights over the incoming edges, giving more importance to informative ones compared to others. GAT has shown promising results across numerous NLP tasks, especially when combined with other non-neural-network-based architectures like transformer models.
