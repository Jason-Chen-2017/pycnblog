# 1.简介
  

Deep learning has revolutionized many fields from medicine to finance and now it’s also being used in sports, entertainment, gaming, image recognition, natural language processing, etc., which have been mostly ignored by traditional machine learning methods. In this article, we will explore the basics of deep learning using Python library called PyTorch, a high-level neural networks framework that provides an easy way to build and train neural networks for computer vision, natural language processing, and more. 

This is a practical tutorial designed for those who are familiar with basic programming concepts like variables, loops, functions, classes, objects, and other fundamental building blocks of programming languages such as Python. We will start our journey into deep learning by creating our first neural network model on the famous Iris dataset. We will also learn about data preprocessing techniques and how they can help us improve accuracy of our models. At the end, we will discuss some common pitfalls and limitations when working with deep learning, including overfitting, underfitting, and hyperparameter tuning. By the end of this article, you should be able to apply what you learned in your own projects with ease.

## Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks (ANN), also known as deep learning models or artificial neural networks, are computational systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. The core idea behind ANNs is based on the concept of neurons, which are interconnected biological cells. Each cell receives input signals, processes them through mathematical formulas, and produces output signals. These output signals can either signalize events or pass on information to other neurons in the network. Based on these outputs, the network makes predictions or classifications about the inputs. ANNs were first proposed in 1943 by Rosenblatt,[1] but their applications went beyond pattern recognition to include tasks such as speech recognition, object detection, and natural language understanding.[2][3][4]

In order to understand how ANNs work, let's consider the following example: Imagine we want to develop a system capable of recognizing handwritten digits (0-9). Our task would be to create a neural network consisting of several layers of connected nodes, where each node represents one digit (0-9). The input layer would receive pixel values representing the written digits, while the hidden layers would process the images and extract relevant features that are then fed to the output layer, which would determine whether the given input belongs to any of the ten possible classes (0-9). Here's a simplified illustration:


As we can see, the connections between the different layers represent the fact that neurons in the same layer communicate with each other within the network. This allows information to flow seamlessly from the input to the output without requiring any complicated calculations. The use of multiple layers helps make the model more complex and effective at solving the problem of recognizing handwritten digits.

We can summarize the main components of a typical ANN as follows:

1. Input Layer: This is where the input samples come into the network. Typically, there are a few hundred dimensions per sample here.

2. Hidden Layers: These are the layers that perform most of the computation. There may be several of these, each with several neurons, responsible for transforming the input data into something meaningful. Some examples could be convolutional layers for image recognition or long short-term memory (LSTM) layers for natural language processing.

3. Output Layer: Finally, the output layer contains the predicted labels or probabilities for each of the possible target classes. For binary classification problems, typically there will be just two units, corresponding to "positive" and "negative," respectively.

Sometimes, instead of having an explicit output layer, ANNs can have implicit output layers if certain criteria are met. For instance, regression models may not have an output layer with a specific number of units because they don't predict probabilities. Instead, they might simply output a continuous value indicating how closely the input matches the expected result. Other types of models, such as autoencoders, may not even need an output layer since the goal is to reconstruct the original input. Overall, the architecture of an ANN depends heavily on the specific problem we're trying to solve.

## Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is a technique for finding the minimum of a function by iteratively moving towards the negative gradient of the function at each step. It works by calculating the slope of the curve of the cost function, i.e., the derivative of the loss function w.r.t. the parameters of the model, and updating the parameters accordingly until convergence. Specifically, at each iteration, the algorithm computes the gradient vector of the cost function with respect to the parameters, updates the parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient, and continues until the change in the objective function becomes small enough or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached. Mathematically, gradient descent is defined as follows:

$$\theta_{i+1} = \theta_i - \alpha \nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{J}(\theta_i)$$

where $\theta$ denotes the set of parameters of the model, $i$ refers to the current epoch or iteration, $\alpha$ is a scalar parameter controlling the size of the steps taken, and $\mathcal{J}$ is the cost function we want to minimize. To find the optimal solution, we usually choose $\alpha$ to be small initially and gradually increase its magnitude during training so that we approach the global optimum as fast as possible. Commonly used variants of gradient descent are stochastic gradient descent (SGD), mini-batch SGD, and batch gradient descent.

## Backpropagation
Backpropagation is an algorithm used in multilayer neural networks to update the weights and biases of the neurons during training. It consists of three stages: feedforward propagation, backward error propagation, and weight and bias update. Feedforward propagation involves computing the output of each neuron in each layer based on the activation function applied to the weighted sum of the inputs coming from the previous layer. Error propagation then takes place by backpropagating the errors computed in the output layer back to the hidden layers using the chain rule of calculus. Weight and bias update adjusts the weights and biases of the neurons according to the calculated gradients and the learning rate. The updated parameters are used in the next forward propagation round to calculate new outputs. The complete algorithm looks like this:

1. Initialize the network's parameters randomly.
2. Propagate the input through the network to compute the output.
3. Compute the error between the actual output and the desired output.
4. Backpropagate the error to each neuron in the network.
5. Update the weights and biases of each neuron in the network using the gradients computed earlier.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until convergence.

## Overfitting and Underfitting
When training a neural network, it's important to avoid both overfitting and underfitting the training data. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and starts fitting noise rather than the underlying patterns, leading to poor performance on previously unseen test data. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple and cannot fit the training data accurately, resulting in severe performance degradation on both training and testing data. One way to address overfitting and underfitting is to use regularization techniques such as dropout and early stopping. Dropout is a method of introducing randomness into the training process by randomly dropping out some neurons in each training iteration. Early stopping stops the training process when the validation loss fails to decrease for a specified number of epochs, preventing overfitting. Another way to handle overfitting is to increase the capacity of the network, reduce the complexity of the model, or add more training data. However, increasing the capacity or complexity of the model can sometimes cause vanishing gradients or other issues that can hinder the optimization process. Therefore, it's essential to monitor the training process and detect signs of overfitting before adding unnecessary complexity to the model.
