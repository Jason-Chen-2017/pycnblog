The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in building and manufacturing are becoming increasingly complex and challenging, with multiple challenges to overcome, including the complexity and heterogeneity of buildings, diversified types of workpieces involved, technical, economic, social, cultural, and environmental factors affecting productivity, safety, and quality, the need for high-precision control systems that can adapt quickly to changing conditions and behaviors, continuous monitoring and evaluation of equipment and processes, etc. Therefore, there is a clear need for an interdisciplinary approach integrating computer science, engineering, business management, and domain experts from various fields such as mechanical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, materials science, biology, psychology, linguistics, information technology, operations research, finance, and healthcare to develop advanced technologies for solving these real-world problems and enabling efficient building and manufacturing operations.

In this article, we will introduce how AI techniques can be applied to building and manufacturing scenarios, covering key concepts, algorithms, implementation details, and future trends and opportunities. The target audience includes professionals who have deep knowledge in building and manufacturing industry but may not have much experience or expertise in AI. This article aims to provide practical insights into AI development for building and manufacturing, and attract more potential members to join the field.

3.问题定义及背景介绍
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the hottest topics in modern society because of its wide range of applications ranging from image recognition, speech processing, decision-making, robotics, natural language understanding, and predictive analytics. However, it is still very limited to a few industries like computers and electronics where hardware resources are abundant. 

Building and manufacturing (BM) industry is no exception. Despite numerous advances in technology and automation, many companies are still facing issues such as low efficiency, poor quality, cost-effectiveness, and maintenance delays due to legacy technology and process failures. To address these critical issues, some companies are developing new products and services by harnessing the power of AI. For example, Siemens Healthineers uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to improve diagnostic accuracy by identifying early signs of disease progression before they arrive at hospital. Similarly, CNET has created FaceApp, a mobile app powered by facial recognition technologies that helps people stay connected while working remotely.

However, the benefits of applying AI technologies to BM are not fully explored yet. In this paper, I will discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with using AI in the building and manufacturing sector. Specifically, I will focus on four major areas: 

1. Complexity of Buildings: As buildings continue to grow, their design, construction, operation, and maintenance becomes more complex and dynamic. Traditionally, conventional methods were used to manage these complexities, which involve extensive manual intervention and time-consuming procedures. With the advent of digitalization, new tools and technologies have emerged that allow for faster and better automated management. These include cloud-based BIM software platforms, virtual reality gaming environments, and self-driving cars. However, these advancements are still far away from replacing the human operator in managing these complexities. Thus, we must continue to invest in traditional approaches to optimize building performance and make it easier for operators to perform day-to-day tasks, even in the face of highly complex situations. 

2. Diverse Types of Workpieces: Different types of workpieces such as steel pipes, timber structures, concrete walls, and automobiles impact the ability of machines to operate efficiently. By analyzing patterns and relationships between different components, machine learning models can identify and classify them accurately. Similarly, optical character recognition (OCR), object detection, and scene recognition algorithms enable machines to extract relevant data from images, videos, and other sources for accurate production planning, scheduling, and dispatching. 

3. Technical, Economic, Social, Cultural, and Environmental Factors Affecting Productivity, Safety, and Quality: Processes, practices, tools, and materials used in a building and manufacturing plant can influence the overall productivity, safety, and quality of the final product. These influences come from several domains such as economy, culture, regulation, and ecology. It is essential to explore ways to leverage these factors through AI techniques. For instance, predictive modeling can help identify bottlenecks in the plant's workflow and suggest improvements. Additionally, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can generate detailed visualizations of the internal flows in the plant and inform effective maintenance strategies. 

4. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation of Equipment and Processes: In order to maintain optimal performance, facilities should be monitored constantly. This requires centralized collection, storage, analysis, and interpretation of sensor readings across multiple sensors deployed throughout the facility. At the same time, process parameters such as flow rates, temperature gradients, pressures, vibrations, and torques should be measured and analyzed to detect and prevent any deviations from the intended operating range. Much like firefighting, advanced anomaly detection algorithms can automatically detect and locate abnormal events, providing critical early warning signals for staff and plants. Moreover, advanced optimization algorithms can automate resource allocation, shift planning, and inventory management to minimize waste and maximize profitability.

To conclude, the use of AI technologies in the BM sector presents both significant challenges and opportunities. The promise of rapid, automated decision-making, improved efficiencies, reduced costs, and enhanced customer satisfaction has never been more urgently needed. Moreover, leveraging diverse data sources and creating end-to-end solutions capable of addressing all the above mentioned challenges requires multi-disciplinary collaboration, involving businesses, engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and others with complementary skills and expertise.
