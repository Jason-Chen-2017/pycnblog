Outlier detection is a crucial problem in data mining where unusual or rare events are detected from the normal ones using machine learning algorithms. In recent years, various ensemble methods have been proposed to improve outlier detection accuracy by combining multiple base models that can detect different types of anomalies. In this article, we will discuss about two popular anomaly detection techniques: isolation forest and one-class support vector machines (OC-SVM), which are widely used for outlier detection tasks. We will also compare these two approaches under different settings such as number of estimators, samples per leaf, and gamma parameter. Finally, we will summarize our findings and provide recommendations on how to choose the best approach based on dataset characteristics and performance metrics. 

Isolation forest is a powerful tool for outlier detection since it combines many decision trees together to form an overall model that captures complex dependencies between variables. It generates a series of tree structures and randomly selects a subset of them during training. During testing time, each instance is assigned to the tree whose corresponding leaf node it falls into. The path from the root to a leaf node uniquely identifies the tree structure responsible for its classification. By aggregating decisions across all trees, isolation forest effectively reduces variance and improves robustness against noisy data. OC-SVM is a newer technique that uses non-linear kernel functions instead of simple linear functions to generate high-dimensional decision boundaries. These non-linear decision boundaries capture complex patterns and relationships among variables better than traditional linear models. However, due to their specific optimization problems, OC-SVM requires careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve good results. Overall, both techniques offer significant advantages over other popular outlier detection techniques such as one-class nearest neighbor (one-class NN) and local outlier factor (LOF). This article aims to provide comprehensive explanations of both models and emphasize the pros and cons of each method while comparing them under different scenarios.

## Isolation Forest
The basic idea behind the isolation forest algorithm is to isolate the outliers by splitting continuous data points into groups based on random partitions. A group of points is called an isolation tree because they share only one split point at each level of the tree, thus establishing a partition boundary separating them from the rest of the data set. To build an isolation forest, several trees are grown independently on different subsets of the data, and the resulting partitions combined using averaging. Each tree has a randomized depth, but when building the final forest, the maximum depth is fixed based on the size of the input data set. At prediction time, new instances are classified according to the average outcome of the trees included in the forest. When the average score for a given instance is less than some threshold, the instance is labeled as an outlier. 

Let's consider an example to understand the working of the algorithm.<|im_sep|> 


## OC-SVM
An OC-SVM consists of a hyperplane that separates the positive examples from negative examples. The goal of the OC-SVM is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes without falling into any errors. Unlike traditional SVMs that use a linear kernel function, the OC-SVM involves non-linear kernel functions such as radial basis function (RBF), polynomial, and sigmoid kernels. Radial basis functions allow the OC-SVM to capture complex relationships among variables, especially those that may be difficult to represent using a linear separation surface. Polynomial and sigmoid kernels allow the OC-SVM to fit more complex decision boundaries that correspond to regions of higher density or heterogeneous densities. Once trained, the OC-SVM can predict the label of new test examples by computing the signed distance between them from the decision boundary. If the sign is positive, the example belongs to the first class; otherwise, it belongs to the second class. 

## Data Preprocessing
Before applying the above two techniques, preprocessing steps such as scaling, normalization, and feature selection must be performed on the input data to reduce the effect of noise and obtain optimal results. Normalization refers to rescaling the data so that each attribute has zero mean and unit standard deviation. Feature selection is done either through correlation analysis or recursive feature elimination. Correlation analysis computes the pairwise correlation coefficients between attributes and removes the redundant or irrelevant features. Recursive feature elimination starts with the entire set of features and recursively tests each feature to see if adding it to the selected list would decrease the cross-validation error rate. Features that do not significantly affect the target variable are removed until the desired number of relevant features is obtained.

## Isolation Forest
### Building the Trees
The isolation forest algorithm works by growing several independent trees on separate subsets of the input data set. Each tree is constructed as follows:

1. Choose a random feature $x$ and a random split value $\tau$.
2. Split the data along the line $x = \tau$, creating two new subsets of data $(X_{\leq\tau}, y_{\leq\tau})$ and $(X_{\gt\tau}, y_{\gt\tau})$.
3. Recursively repeat step 1 and 2 for each remaining feature and split value until there are no more splits that satisfy the minimum sample count requirement or until the maximum tree depth is reached.
4. Train a decision tree on each subset of data created in step 2 using information gain as the criterion for selecting splits.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for a specified number of trees in order to create an ensemble of trees.

The main difference between the original isolation forest algorithm and the one discussed here is the choice of random features and thresholds. Instead of choosing the most important feature and cutting at the median value, the current version chooses a random feature and sets the threshold to a random value within the range of values observed in that feature. This ensures that each tree in the forest gets a unique view of the data, making the ensemble more diverse and resistant to overfitting. Additionally, the addition of regularization parameters like the fraction of outliers allowed and the proportion of features to randomly select further improves the diversity of the ensemble.

### Testing Time
When building an isolation forest, each tree is grown independently on different subsets of the data. Therefore, testing time is very efficient since each tree only needs to classify instances based on its own partitioning scheme. At testing time, each instance is assigned to the tree whose corresponding leaf node it falls into. The path from the root to a leaf node uniquely identifies the tree structure responsible for its classification. By aggregating decisions across all trees, the isolation forest effectively reduces variance and improves robustness against noisy data.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize the isolation forest algorithm, several hyperparameters should be tuned including the following:

1. Number of Estimators ($n_{estimators}$): This controls the number of trees built in the forest. Larger values produce more accurate models but require more computational resources.

2. Maximum Tree Depth ($max\_depth$): This limits the maximum depth of individual trees in the forest. Large values produce more complex models that are likely to overfit to the training data, whereas smaller values give simpler and faster decision boundaries.

3. Minimum Sample Count Per Leaf Node ($min\_samples\_leaf$): This specifies the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. Smaller values produce finer clusters of observations, leading to larger granularity and potentially more complex decision boundaries.

4. Fraction of Outliers Allowed ($contamination$): This controls the ratio of expected number of outliers to actual number of outliers in the data set. Setting this value too low will result in poor generalization performance, whereas setting it too high will result in substantial underestimation of true outlying instances.

### Limitations
One limitation of the isolation forest algorithm is that it does not handle highly imbalanced datasets well, particularly when the number of minority class examples is much lower than the majority class. This means that certain trees in the forest tend to dominate the majority class and suppress the presence of minoritary examples altogether. Another issue is that isolated instances become extremely close to each other, leading to an excessively small number of effective trees being produced in the ensemble. These issues make the isolation forest algorithm susceptible to adverse effects such as overfitting, sensitivity to perturbations, and misclassification errors.

## OC-SVM
### Training Phase
The OC-SVM model learns a binary hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that separates the positive and negative examples. The objective of the OC-SVM algorithm is to maximize the margin between the two classes while ensuring that no errors occur. For this purpose, the algorithm minimizes a trade-off between the width of the decision boundary and the amount of error caused by incorrectly classifying the examples. The margins between the two hyperplanes generated by the OC-SVM depend on the kernel function used to transform the input data into a high-dimensional space. The RBF kernel is commonly used for large-scale data sets and allows the algorithm to capture complex relationships between variables. Other kernel functions include polynomial and sigmoid functions that might work better for sparse and non-linearly distributed data.

During training, the OC-SVM algorithm uses quadratic programming (QP) solver to solve for the best solution of the optimization problem. The QP optimizer finds the weights and bias terms that minimize the weighted hinge loss plus a penalty term related to the complexity of the decision boundary. The weight vector and intercept term define the position and orientation of the hyperplane in the transformed feature space. After training, the OC-SVM can be used to perform inference on new instances by calculating their signed distances from the decision boundary.

### Regularization
In practice, the OC-SVM often performs poorly on real-world datasets due to the noise introduced inherent in real-world data. One way to address this issue is to add a regularization term to the cost function that encourages the model to learn simple decision boundaries while avoiding overfitting. The regularization strength is controlled by the value of the soft margin parameter $\gamma$. If $\gamma$ is small, the model will accept wider decision boundaries, while a large value of $\gamma$ leads to a stricter constraint on the decision boundaries. Adding the regularization term helps the model balance between fitting the training data correctly and preventing overfitting.

Another way to prevent overfitting is to increase the sample size available for training. Since each iteration of gradient descent updates the model parameters based on a mini-batch of examples, increasing the batch size can help to mitigate the potential for slow convergence to saddle points. However, taking large batches also increases the risk of introducing noise and biases into the learned model.

Finally, another option is to tune the hyperparameters of the OC-SVM itself, such as the kernel type, bandwidth parameter, and tolerance levels for stopping criteria. Fine-tuning these parameters can lead to significant improvements in model quality and stability.

### Limitations
There are several limitations to the OC-SVM algorithm. First, the optimization problem becomes very computationally expensive for large datasets, making it impractical to train an OC-SVM on large data sets directly. Second, even though the OC-SVM produces relatively simple decision boundaries, it is still sensitive to the presence of outliers or noisy data. Third, the model parameters are generally difficult to interpret and analyze, making it difficult to diagnose performance bottlenecks or identify underlying factors causing poor performance. Fourth, the OC-SVM may struggle with high dimensionality or non-convex decision boundaries that cause instability or failures in solving the optimization problem. Overall, the OC-SVM offers promising promise for handling high dimensional data sets with non-linear decision boundaries, but it requires expert knowledge and careful parameter tuning to get reliable results in practice.
