Chatbot is a conversational agent that can engage users with relevant information or answer their queries through natural language conversation. It helps to save time and reduce the effort required for customers by enabling them to interact with machines using spoken interactions instead of typing long form responses. In this tutorial we will build a chatbot using open-source libraries like Dialogflow and Rasa. We will cover basic concepts such as intents, entities, contexts, and dialog management using these libraries. Also, we will implement real-world examples on how to integrate NLP models such as spaCy into our chatbot development process. 

In summary, this tutorial provides an overview of building a chatbot with Dialogflow and Rasa. The reader should be able to understand key concepts involved in developing chatbots and integrate various NLP models. He/she would also learn how to deploy the chatbot and integrate it with other platforms such as Facebook Messenger. Additionally, he/she will gain insights into deploying a production ready chatbot system in the cloud platform AWS. This tutorial is intended for developers who are proficient in Python programming languages. Any level of developer background knowledge is expected, but not necessary.

Before moving forward with the article let's define few terms related to chatbots:
* Intent (also called intention): A user goal or desire expressed in words. For example, "Book a flight" or "Get weather report". These intents help chatbots identify what the user wants and route the conversation accordingly.
* Entity: An object or piece of data mentioned in the context of a particular utterance. For instance, booking details include origin city, destination city, date, and number of passengers. Entities enable chatbots to extract important pieces of information from unstructured text data and provide accurate response to the user request.
* Context: Information about the current conversation state maintained by the chatbot. The context is used by the bot to manage conversations more effectively and efficiently. It stores information like the previous conversation turn, current user preferences, and current conversation topic.
* Dialog Management: The mechanism by which the chatbot handles user input, identifies the appropriate action, processes the action, and returns an appropriate response back to the user. It involves understanding user intents, extracting relevant entities, maintaining dialogue states, and generating appropriate outputs based on the user inputs.

Now, let's dive into the tutorial. I hope you enjoy reading! Let me know if there any specific topics or questions you want me to explain further. Thank you very much for your interest!
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving deep into coding, it’s essential to have some basics of Chatbot terminologies and concepts. You can refer below link for the same: https://www.chatbotsmagazine.com/blog/what-is-a-conversational-ai-chatbot/

Let’s start with defining some basics concepts in order to understand what is meant by “Dialog Flow” and “RASA”.

1. DialogFlow
Dialogflow is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing tool built by Google. It enables us to create chatbots with high accuracy and ease without needing to write code. We need to first design the flow of interaction between User and Bot using DialogFlow editor where each conversation is divided into multiple nodes known as “Intents.” 

Each node contains the messages that the Bot can respond to when certain conditions are met during conversation. Here are the steps to use DialogFlow:

Step 1: Create a new agent: In the Dialogflow console, click on “Create Agent”, name your agent and select your preferred location. After creating an agent, go to settings page and enable the Webhook option. Click on Save button.

Step 2: Add Intents: Intents represent the purpose of the conversation. To add an intent, simply type its name under the Intents section on left panel. Each intent needs to contain at least one training phrase to get started. Training phrases are sentences or statements that represent the intention of the user. 

Example of adding an intent named “Greeting”: When the user types Hello or Hi, Bot will automatically recognize it as a greeting intent and start responding to it with predefined message. 

Step 3: Define Entities: If you want to capture additional details from the user input, you can define entity slots under the Entities tab on left panel. Once defined, all values captured during conversation will be stored as entities alongside the original query.

Step 4: Train & Publish: Before testing the chatbot, make sure to train and publish your changes. All changes made till now are saved as draft and can only be published once the model is trained successfully. 

Step 5: Test Your Agent: Finally, test the chatbot by sending sample requests to it via the simulator provided by Dialogflow. Test different scenarios, check whether the response matches expectations and adjust the model as needed.


2. RASA

RASA is an Open Source machine learning framework for building assistants, chatbots, and integrations with third-party services. It has powerful tools for intent classification, entity recognition, handling multi-turn conversations, and providing REST APIs. 

Here are the main components of RASA architecture:

1. Domain: This represents the domain of the assistant/chatbot. It defines the list of intents, actions, and templates. 

2. NLU Model: This component uses machine learning algorithms to classify incoming user messages into predefined intents and detect entities in them. Examples of prebuilt NLU models available within RASA are SpaCy, MITIE, and Duckling. 

3. Core Policy Engine: This is responsible for taking the output generated by the NLU model and selecting an appropriate action to take next. It takes into account the current state of the conversation, the history of past turns, and the availability of relevant information. There are several core policies available within RASA including RulePolicy, MemoizationPolicy, KerasPolicy etc. 

4. Actions Server: This receives the output from the policy engine and performs the corresponding action. The actions server includes pre-defined set of actions that can be triggered based on the detected intent. 

5. API Gateway: This acts as a front end interface to communicate with external applications. It exposes endpoints for both bots and external clients to send messages and receive responses over HTTP protocol. 

Overall, RASA makes it easy to develop intelligent conversational agents without writing complex code. Its simple yet powerful architecture allows users to quickly prototype and scale up their chatbots.
