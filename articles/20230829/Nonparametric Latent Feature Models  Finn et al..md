Latent feature models (LFM) are a popular type of recommendation systems that can capture users’ implicit preferences and item properties by modeling user-item interactions as the sum of latent factors that represent the characteristics of items or the contextual features of users. LFM is different from traditional matrix factorization techniques in that it aims to learn both global and local structure information without any prior knowledge about the underlying generative process. In this paper, we present an efficient nonparametric version of LFM called NMF-LFM which can be applied on sparse data with missing entries using only pairwise comparison information. We prove that our method provides a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods for recommending new items to unseen users in terms of recommendation accuracy, diversity, and coverage. Moreover, we demonstrate how our model works well on real world datasets such as MovieLens and Yahoo! R3 dataset and show its scalability compared to other existing LFM approaches. Finally, we discuss future research directions and challenges associated with NMF-LFM.

In summary, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel nonparametric approach named NMF-LFM which can handle sparse data with missing entries using only pairwise comparison information.
2. Proofs and experiments demonstrating that NMF-LFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for recommending new items to unseen users in terms of recommendation accuracy, diversity, and coverage.
3. Evaluation results showing the efficiency and effectiveness of NMF-LFM on various real world datasets including MovieLens and Yahoo! R3 dataset.
4. Future research directions and challenges related to developing more accurate and efficient nonparametric LFM algorithms for large scale recommender systems.

Overall, the proposed NMF-LFM algorithm has wide applicability and strong theoretical foundation, making it suitable for applications in areas where the sparsity of data makes traditional matrix factorization challenging. This work provides a powerful framework to study latent feature models for recommendation systems that can significantly improve recommendation quality and provide better understanding of users’ behavior patterns across contexts. 

# 2.Basic Concepts
Let $U$ be the set of all users, $I$ be the set of all items, $\theta_u\in \mathbb{R}^k$, $\phi_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^l$ be two sets of parameters representing user preferences and item properties respectively. The utility function for user $u$ when evaluating item $i$ is given by:

$$r_{ui}=\mathbf{\theta}_u^\top \mathbf{\phi}_{i}$$

where $r_{ui}$ represents the rating of user $u$ on item $i$. Given a subset of observed ratings $(r_{ui}, i)$ for some fraction $p$ of pairs $(u,i)\subset U\times I$, let us denote these observations as $\mathcal{D} = \{ r_{ui}, u\in U,\, i\in I, \|r_{ui}\| > 0\}$. Let $\hat{\theta}_u$, $\hat{\phi}_{i}$, and $\tilde{\theta}_u$, $\tilde{\phi}_{i}$ refer to the estimated parameter values after running learning algorithms, and they are defined as follows:


$$\hat{\theta}_u = (\mathbf{M}^\top\mathbf{M})^{-1}\mathbf{M}^\top(\mathbf{y}_u+\lambda_{\theta})\quad \text{(NMF-LFM)}$$

$$\hat{\phi}_{i}=((\mathbf{K}+\lambda_{\phi}\mathbf{I})^{-1}\mathbf{X}_i+\lambda_{\phi}\frac{1}{\|\mathbf{K}\|^2}(\mathbf{K}-\mathbf{I}))\quad \text{(NMF-LFM)}$$

Here, $\mathbf{M}$ is a matrix whose rows are user vectors, $\mathbf{y}_u=[r_{ui}(1),r_{ui}(2),\ldots,r_{ui}(m)]^\top$ is the vector representation of user $u$'s ratings, $\mathbf{K}$ is a matrix whose columns are item vectors, and $\mathbf{X}_i=[r_{ij}(1),r_{ij}(2),\ldots,r_{ij}(n)]^\top$ is the vector representation of item $i$'s ratings. Note that here $\lambda_\theta>0$ and $\lambda_\phi>0$ are regularization constants.

The objective functions for optimizing $\hat{\theta}_u$ and $\hat{\phi}_{i}$ are shown below:

$$\min_{\mathbf{\theta}} J(\mathbf{\theta};\mathbf{y}_u) + \beta\cdot KL(q(\boldsymbol{\theta})||p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|y_u))+\gamma\cdot ||\mathbf{M}-\mathbf{Y}||_F^2 $$

$$\min_{\mathbf{\phi}}\sum_{i\in I}J(\mathbf{\phi}_{i};\mathbf{x}_i)+ \delta\cdot KL(q(\boldsymbol{\phi})||p(\boldsymbol{\phi}|x_i))+\eta\cdot ||\mathbf{K}-\mathbf{X}||_F^2 $$

where $KL(q(\boldsymbol{\theta})||p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|y_u))$ measures the difference between the empirical distribution of user preferences $\mathbf{y}_u$ and the posterior distribution given the training data. Similarly, $KL(q(\boldsymbol{\phi})||p(\boldsymbol{\phi}|x_i))$ measures the difference between the empirical distribution of item properties $\mathbf{x}_i$ and the posterior distribution given the training data. We assume that each entry of $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{K}$ is independently drawn from their respective probability distributions. By fixing the priors and marginal probabilities of the distributions, we obtain closed-form expressions for the above optimization problems.
