Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model on one task or dataset is used as the starting point for another related but different task. In this article, we will learn how to use transfer learning using two popular deep learning models - ResNet and VGG networks in building image classification applications. We'll also discuss about benefits of using these models over traditional CNN architectures such as AlexNet, GoogleNet etc., while showing practical examples and results obtained from our experiments.

We assume that readers have basic knowledge of deep learning concepts like convolutional neural network (CNN), residual connections, pooling layers, fully connected layer, activation functions, dropout regularization etc., and familiar with popular computer vision datasets like ImageNet and CIFAR-10/100. 

In summary, this article covers following topics:

1. Introduction to Transfer Learning
2. The Idea Behind Transfer Learning
3. Principles of Transfer Learning using ResNet & VGG Networks
4. Building an Image Classification Application using Transfer Learning
5. Benefits of Using ResNet & VGB Networks Over Traditional CNN Architectures

# 2. Transfer Learning Introduction
## What is Transfer Learning?
In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has witnessed tremendous advancement in various areas. From supervised learning to unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, there are numerous approaches being taken to develop machines capable of predicting outcomes given inputs. However, building complex deep learning systems can require extensive training data, expensive hardware resources, and time-consuming model development cycles. This problem is compounded further by the fact that most problems encountered in real world applications are very similar to those faced during training phase, making it highly beneficial if we can leverage existing solutions to tackle new tasks faster than building them from scratch.

Transfer learning refers to the process of reusing knowledge learned from a related but different task in order to solve a new task more effectively. It involves taking advantage of a pre-trained model trained on large amounts of labeled data, which has already been optimized for solving many different types of problems, and applying it to a new but related task that requires less labeled data or specialized domain knowledge. For instance, let’s say we want to build an object detection system that detects pedestrians, cars, bikes, trucks, etc. in images captured by surveillance cameras. Instead of collecting and annotating millions of images of each type of vehicle separately, we can reuse the pre-trained weights and learn features that are common across all vehicles so that the object detector can recognize objects even when they don't have any specific labels associated with them. This approach saves us valuable hours spent manually labelling and classifying hundreds of thousands of images every time we need to train a new system. 

Another example could be in natural language processing (NLP). When dealing with textual data, instead of developing a completely separate model for sentiment analysis, we can leverage pre-trained word embeddings and transfer them directly onto a sentiment classification task. This way, we don’t need to start from scratch, save a lot of time and effort, and benefit from the expertise gained through the years of research and development efforts. 

By leveraging pre-trained models, we can significantly reduce the amount of data required to train a deep learning system, increase its accuracy, and potentially speed up the process of developing complex models for real-world applications. These advantages are especially significant for large-scale projects requiring high levels of automation and autonomy.

## Types of Transfer Learning
There are several ways in which we can apply transfer learning to our deep learning models. Here are some commonly used techniques:

1. Feature Extraction Techniques: These methods involve extracting relevant features from the pre-trained model, either removing the last few layers of the network or freezing certain parameters of the network until the later parts of the network are fine-tuned. Common feature extraction techniques include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). 

2. Fine-tuning Techniques: These methods involve fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model or only a portion of the network based on the specific task at hand. Fine-tuning may involve adjusting the learning rate, changing the loss function, adding or removing layers, or modifying the hyperparameters of the optimizer. 

3. Multi-task Learning Techniques: These techniques involve jointly training multiple pre-trained models on multiple tasks simultaneously to achieve better performance. One approach is called multi-task learning, where each model learns a separate set of tasks and their corresponding weights. Another approach is called meta-learning, where a shared model is trained to learn to combine the outputs of multiple different models together in a meta-layer.

4. Domain Adaptation Techniques: These techniques involve transferring the pre-trained model to a new domain without relying on paired labeled data between the original and target domains. Two main strategies for domain adaptation include SSL (semi-supervised learning) and DAAN (domain alignment).
