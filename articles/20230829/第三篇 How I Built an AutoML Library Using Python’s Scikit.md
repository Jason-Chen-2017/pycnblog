# Section 1: Background
As data science has become increasingly important in modern society, there has been a need for better ways to automate tasks that require intensive manual intervention or are repetitive in nature. This led to the rise of AutoML systems, which can perform complex tasks like hyperparameter tuning automatically by analyzing patterns in the dataset, selecting the most effective model architecture, and fine-tuning the parameters according to predefined rules based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. 

However, there have not been many comprehensive resources available on creating AutoML libraries using Python's scikit-learn library. Therefore, I decided to write this article to help those who want to develop their own AutoML library and learn more about the various techniques employed in the process. 


# Section 2: Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before delving into the technical details, let's briefly go through some basic concepts and terminology related to AutoML.


### Data Splitting Strategy 
The first step towards building an AutoML system is splitting the dataset into two parts - a training set and a validation set. The purpose of having a separate validation set is to evaluate the performance of each candidate model before applying it to test data, ensuring that the final model achieves good results even if it was trained on a biased subset of the data. There are different strategies for splitting the dataset depending on the size of the dataset and the desired ratio between training and validation sets. Some popular strategies include: 

1. Holdout Method: This involves dividing the dataset randomly into two subsets - a training set and a validation set. The size of the validation set can be specified manually, while the remaining portion is used for training.
2. K-fold Cross Validation: This method involves partitioning the dataset into k equal-sized subsets. One subset is left out during each iteration, and serves as the validation set for that particular fold. During training, all the other k-1 subsets serve as the training set. 
3. Leave-one-out Cross Validation: This approach involves leaving only one observation out at a time, resulting in a total of k=n iterations. Each observation becomes the validation set once, and the remaining observations constitute the training set. 


### Model Selection Strategy
Once the datasets have been split, the next task is to select the best model(s) for prediction. Two popular methods for model selection are: 

1. Grid Search: This involves iterating over multiple combinations of hyperparameters and evaluating the model corresponding to each combination to identify the best performing model(s). It is commonly used for finding the optimal values of hyperparameters of linear and non-linear models. However, it may take too long for large datasets and/or complex models.
2. Randomized Search: This method uses random sampling instead of brute force search to optimize the hyperparameters. It works well for smaller datasets where grid search may lead to excessive computational cost. 

It is worth mentioning that there are additional techniques for model selection like Bayesian optimization and gradient boosting. However, these methods involve optimizing over a larger space of possible models than just hyperparameters, making them less practical for small-to-medium sized datasets.  


### Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy
Hyperparameters are parameters that influence the behavior of the model but cannot be learned directly from the data. These parameters must be optimized using techniques like grid search, randomized search, or bayesian optimization to obtain accurate predictions on unseen data. Three common techniques for hyperparameter tuning are: 

1. Grid Search: This technique involves trying out all possible combinations of hyperparameters and comparing their performance on the validation set. The best performing model is chosen.
2. Randomized Search: Same as grid search, except that random samples are drawn to choose hyperparameters.
3. Bayesian Optimization: This technique explores the parameter space using probabilistic gradients computed by simulating the objective function. Its main advantage is that it can handle expensive functions that cannot be evaluated efficiently using standard grid or random search. 


### Evaluation Metrics
Finally, after selecting the best model(s), it is essential to measure its performance on the testing set using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, confusion matrix, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-AUC. Good evaluation metrics allow us to quantify the quality of our model and guide further improvements. 


# Section 3: Algorithms and Techniques Used In The Creation Of The AutoML System

Now that we know what AutoML is, we can proceed to look at some specific algorithms and techniques used in the development of AutoML libraries. 


### Feature Engineering 
One of the primary challenges faced by developers working on AutoML systems is feature engineering. Machine learning models work best when they are fed with highly informative features extracted from the input data. Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into useful features that capture meaningful relationships between variables. Some popular techniques for feature engineering include: 

1. Numerical Features: Extracting numerical features like mean, median, mode, variance, skewness, kurtosis, etc.
2. Categorical Features: Converting categorical variables into numeric form using one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding.
3. Text Features: Extracting textual features like bag-of-words or word embeddings.
4. Time Series Features: Identifying patterns in temporal sequences using window functions.

All these techniques contribute to better predictive performance and reduce the dimensionality of the input space. 


### Algorithm Selection 
When building an AutoML system, developers typically try several different algorithm families such as linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking. They then compare the performance of these algorithms on the validation set and choose the best performing ones to train on the entire dataset. Some popular techniques for algorithm selection include: 

1. Ensemble Methods: Combining the outputs of multiple base estimators to improve generalizability.
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): A class of machine learning algorithms that utilizes mini-batches to update weights iteratively.
3. Support Vector Machines (SVMs): A type of supervised learning algorithm for binary classification problems.
4. Decision Trees: A type of supervised learning algorithm for both classification and regression tasks.

Ensemble methods combine multiple models into a single meta-model that performs better than any individual model. SGD and SVMs are known to perform well on high-dimensional sparse data, while decision trees are often faster and simpler compared to deep neural networks. Choosing appropriate models helps ensure that the final model is accurate and robust.   


### Model Architecture Design 
Another critical aspect of building an AutoML system is deciding on the structure of the model architectures. While traditional ML models rely on handcrafted feature engineering and choice of algorithms, AutoML systems seek to automate these steps by identifying relevant patterns in the data and choosing appropriate model structures. Some popular techniques for model architecture design include: 

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): A type of deep learning architecture suited for image recognition tasks.
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): A type of deep learning architecture suited for sequential data processing tasks.
3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: A variant of RNNs designed specifically for sequence modeling tasks.
4. Attention Mechanisms: A mechanism that enables the model to focus on relevant portions of the input data during inference.  

These techniques enable the model to extract features automatically without relying on hand-engineered features, leading to higher accuracy and efficiency.  

Overall, the key challenge for developing an AutoML system is balancing the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff during hyperparameter tuning, and providing users with clear guidelines on how to choose the right model family, feature set, and hyperparameter settings.
