Self Organizing Maps (SOM) is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to identify patterns in data by organizing the units into topographic partitions or regions. SOMs have been widely used for clustering, visualization, pattern recognition, and dimensionality reduction. 

In this article, we will discuss how Self Organizing Maps are used to detect outliers and novelties from data sets. We will also explain the concepts of Kohonen's Learning Rule and Hyperplane Trees, which are crucial components of SOM algorithms. By implementing these methods on real world datasets, we hope to provide practical insights on anomaly detection and novelty detection using machine learning techniques.


## Introduction
Outlier detection is an essential task in many fields such as healthcare, finance, social sciences, and biology. Identifying outliers in large databases plays an important role in deriving valuable insights, identifying rare events or anomalies, improving the accuracy of predictive models, and reducing risk. Despite its importance, there has not been much research dedicated to developing efficient outlier detection techniques for large scale datasets. In recent years, several approaches have emerged to address this problem, including mixture modeling, density-based clustering, and anomaly detection based on statistical measures like z-scores, standard deviation, interquartile range, etc. However, all of these methods suffer from drawbacks related to scalability, low interpretability, and computational complexity. 

One of the most popular outlier detection algorithms today is the Self Organizing Map (SOM). It is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to identify patterns in data by organizing the units into topographic partitions or regions. The main advantage of SOMs over other clustering algorithms is their ability to handle high-dimensional input spaces, as opposed to traditional clustering algorithms that require preprocessing steps beforehand to reduce the number of dimensions. Another significant feature of SOMs is their ability to capture both global structure and local variations within clusters. Additionally, they are easily implemented and trained, making them ideal choices for use in applications where large amounts of training data are available but no labeled examples exist. Finally, SOMs can detect complex relationships between variables without requiring expert knowledge or pre-defined class labels. 


The goal of this article is to discuss how Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) are used to detect outliers and novelties from data sets. We will first review basic concepts of neural networks and SOMs, then present a brief overview of the key ideas behind SOMs' architecture. Specifically, we will introduce Kohonen’s Learning Rule, which drives SOMs to find meaningful representations of the input space, while Hyperplane Trees are another important component of SOMs that enable spatial search and exploration capabilities. Next, we will demonstrate how to implement SOMs for outlier detection using Python. 

We believe that writing technical articles about cutting-edge technologies and new techniques in the field of artificial intelligence and data science is an effective way to spread awareness and educate readers. Our aim is to help increase the overall quality and relevance of technical content created by experts in the field.

## Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the details of SOMs, let us start by reviewing some basic concepts and terminology related to Neural Networks and SOMs. 

### Neural Networks

A neural network is a mathematical model consisting of layers of connected neurons, or nodes. Each node receives inputs, processes them through weights and activation functions, and sends output signals to other nodes in the next layer. The connections between neurons are typically symmetric, which means that the strength of the connection is equal for both directions. Neurons in each layer operate independently, receiving input from the previous layer and sending output to the next layer. Neural networks learn to map inputs to outputs through training. There are two types of neural networks: feedforward neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Feedforward neural networks are common in deep learning tasks, while recurrent neural networks are commonly used for sequence processing tasks like natural language processing.

 ### Self Organizing Maps

Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to identify patterns in data by organizing the units into topographic partitions or regions. SOMs have been used extensively for clustering, visualization, pattern recognition, and dimensionality reduction. They consist of a set of neurons arranged in a regular lattice or grid, called a map, where each unit is associated with a vector representing the input data. During training, the SOM adjusts the positions of the neurons in order to minimize the distance between them and the corresponding input vectors. At inference time, the algorithm assigns a unit to any given input vector depending on the position of the closest neuron. This mechanism allows SOMs to automatically discover abstract features of the input data and generalize well to new instances. Commonly used variants include rectangular grids, hexagonal grids, and binary trees.

### Kohonen's Learning Rule

Kohonen's Learning Rule is one of the core principles underlying the operation of SOMs. The rule states that at each iteration of the training process, each neuron in the map is updated according to the following formula:

Δu(t+1) = u(t) + α * ΔΣ(t)

where u(t) is the current state of the neuron at iteration t, δu(t+1) is the desired change in the state after one update step, α is the learning rate, and ΔΣ(t) is the error signal generated by the difference between the current state and the target value. To calculate ΔΣ(t), we need to compute the error vector E(t):

E(t) = x(t) − w(t)

where x(t) is the current input vector, and w(t) is the weight vector assigned to the neuron. The learning rate determines the speed at which the neuron converges to its optimal location. Typically, values of α vary between 0.1 and 0.5, and more advanced versions of SOMs may employ adaptive learning rules that adjust the learning rate during training based on performance metrics.  

### Hyperplane Trees

Hyperplane Trees (HPTs) are another critical component of SOMs that enable spatial search and exploration capabilities. HPTs represent the input space as a hierarchical tree structure, where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane separating the input space into two disjoint regions, and the leaf nodes correspond to individual points in the input space. The splitting planes are learned automatically during training, and each region corresponds to a specific cluster in the original input space. HPTs support efficient indexing and retrieval operations because they allow searching for similar patterns by navigating down the hierarchy of split planes until the appropriate leaf node containing the query point is reached.
