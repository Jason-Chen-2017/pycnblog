# 1.简介
  


Augmented Reality (AR) technology has become one of the hottest topics in modern technologies recently. AR enables users to see and interact with digital objects that are physically presented in real-world environment. The ability to interact with virtual objects is a crucial feature for many industries such as retail, manufacturing, and healthcare. 

In this article we will build an advanced face tracking system using augmented reality (AR). We have used OpenCV library for image processing and Python programming language for development. This project requires high level understanding of computer vision concepts such as camera calibration, object detection, and machine learning algorithms.

The system tracks the human faces and recognizes their identity based on facial features. In case if it identifies multiple people or finds unusual patterns, it can alert the user by sound or visual cues. Additionally, we have built an application which allows users to interact with the tracked objects. It shows the recognized identity and gives options to take action such as calling someone through chat interface.

By the end of this tutorial you will understand how to build an advanced face tracking system using AR technology, how to recognize individual faces and detect unusual behaviors like multiple faces detected simultaneously. You also know about different types of applications you can create around the face recognition system.

## 2.1 Camera Calibration
Camera calibration is a process of estimating the intrinsic parameters of the camera from its internal characteristics and external conditions. Intrinsic parameters refer to those that define the geometry of the camera itself rather than its optics. These parameters include focal length, principal point, skewness coefficient, etc. After these parameters are estimated, the distortion coefficients are calculated and used to correct for any distortions present in the images captured by the camera. 

In our scenario, we need to estimate the intrinsic parameters of our camera using chessboard images. We use these images to obtain the 3D coordinates of each corner of the chessboard pattern in the camera's field of view. We then calculate the focal length, principal point, and skewness coefficient using these values. This information is stored alongside other camera parameters such as image dimensions, lens position, and camera pose. 

Once the intrinsic parameters are determined, they can be used to perform all subsequent computations related to 3D reconstruction and projection of points into the camera’s frame of reference.


## 2.2 Object Detection 
Object detection refers to identifying and locating specific instances of an object within an image or video sequence. There are several ways to perform object detection including various techniques such as template matching, deep learning, and CNN-based approaches. Our solution uses openCV library for performing object detection. Opencv provides various functions for image segmentation, contour finding, and shape recognition. 

In our scenario, we use Haar Cascade Classifier algorithm to identify faces in frames obtained from the live stream. Once the faces are identified, we use them as input to track them using Kalman filter algorithm.


## 2.3 Facial Feature Recognition

Facial feature recognition involves analyzing and extracting certain facial expressions and features like eyes, nose, mouth, ears, chin, jaw, etc., to gain insights into the person’s emotions and mental state. The extracted features can help to predict future behavior based on previous emotional states.

We use pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network models to extract facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. We train the model using annotated data consisting of faces with labels indicating whether the face belongs to a known person or not. Once trained, the model can classify new faces according to the presence of key facial features.


## 2.4 Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms are used to train and evaluate the performance of models based on historical data. Three common machine learning algorithms used in our solution are:

1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Algorithm
3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Linear regression models are used to estimate the relationship between two variables, while random forest and support vector machines are used to classify unknown data samples into predefined classes. For example, a face detection system could use linear regression to learn the mapping between pixel intensities and face locations. A classification system using SVM could distinguish between individuals based on their facial features such as smile, glasses, teeth whitening.
