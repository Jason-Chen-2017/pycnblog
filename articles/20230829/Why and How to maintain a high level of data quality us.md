Data quality is critical for any business application that involves dealing with real-time or historical data sets. Data quality can impact the accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, reliability, and integrity of your data. In this article, we will learn how to improve data quality by building reliable and consistent data structures using normalized databases and applying appropriate data modeling techniques. We will also demonstrate an example on how to use SQL scripting languages to achieve these objectives. 

In this article, we will cover the following topics:

1. Introduction to Reliable and Consistent Data Structures Using Normalized Databases
2. Proper Use of Data Modeling Techniques in Building Reliable and Consistent Data Structures
3. Example on Maintaining High Level of Data Quality Using SQL Scripts and Data Modeling Best Practices
4. Conclusion

## 2. Basic Concepts & Terms
Before diving into the main content of the article, let’s first define some basic concepts and terms related to data quality. The most commonly used terms include:

* **Data:** A collection of facts, figures, and measurements representing a specific aspect of reality at a particular point in time. Data can be structured (e.g., tables) or unstructured (e.g., documents).
* **Quality:** The degree to which a piece of information meets specified standards, expectations, and criteria. It includes accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, reliability, and integrity.
* **Reliability:** The probability of successful completion or execution over a defined period.
* **Consistency:** The condition of being internally coherent and self-consistent within a given context. Consistency ensures that data is accurate, complete, current, and valid across multiple sources and systems.
* **Integrity:** The property of maintaining accuracy and consistency without deviations from established rules or protocols. Integrity prevents incorrect or incomplete transactions and makes it difficult for malicious users to alter data.
* **Accuracy:** The degree to which data represents the truth. Accuracy is essential for data analysis and decision making purposes.
* **Completeness:** The extent to which all relevant aspects of data are captured. Completeness helps ensure data integrity and provides insights into underlying patterns and trends.
* **Timeliness:** The speed with which data become available for processing. Timeliness ensures that decisions are based on recent and accurate data.
* **Normalization:** A process of organizing database design to reduce redundancy and dependency between data elements. Normalization aims to minimize data anomalies and improve data integrity.
* **Denormalization:** An inverse operation of normalization, where redundant data is eliminated but query performance may suffer due to increased storage consumption.
* **ETL:** Extract, Transform, Load, refers to the process of gathering data from various sources, transforming it into a uniform format, and loading it into a target system. ETL tools help manage large volumes of data by extracting only necessary fields, filtering out duplicates, and performing operations such as aggregation, join, and transformation before loading into the target system.
* **OLAP Cube:** An OLAP cube is a multi-dimensional data structure designed specifically for online analytical processing (OLAP) applications. It consists of dimensions and measures, allowing users to explore multidimensional datasets in a single view. OLAP cubes provide quick access to aggregated data and support sophisticated analytics through complex queries.

## 3. Core Algorithm & Operation Steps
The core algorithm for maintaining high levels of data quality uses normalizing databases to establish relationships amongst different entities, attributes, and relationships. Normalizing databases allows us to eliminate data redundancies and simplify the management of data complexity while ensuring data consistency and integrity. Here are the steps involved in building reliable and consistent data structures using normalized databases:

1. Identify entities: Start by identifying the main entities you want to model in your database, e.g., customers, products, orders, etc. Each entity should have its own table.

2. Create primary keys: For each entity table, select one attribute(s) that uniquely identifies each record. These attributes should serve as the primary key of the corresponding table. Avoid using surrogate keys (i.e., auto-incremented IDs) unless absolutely necessary. Primary keys help prevent duplicate entries and enable efficient querying and joins across multiple tables.

3. Define relationships: Determine the interdependency and dependencies between the entities. This can involve identifying common attributes and linking them together using foreign keys. Foreign keys constrain data values to match those in referenced tables, thereby enforcing referential integrity and providing audit trails.

4. Normalize tables: Organize data into smaller, more focused tables that contain only necessary columns, effectively reducing storage requirements and improving retrieval times. Perform denormalization if necessary to optimize query performance. Ensure that normalized schemas do not violate constraints imposed by data types, lengths, and other factors.

5. Validate data quality: Check data quality periodically to identify errors and inconsistencies. Look for missing, invalid, inconsistent, obsolete, or duplicate records. Implement automated error detection and correction procedures using triggers and stored procedures. Document corrective actions taken to address identified issues.

6. Automate data quality tasks: Develop repeatable processes and procedures to maintain data quality over time. Use scripting languages like SQL and Python to automate repetitive tasks and integrate them into existing workflows and processes. Regularly review logs and reports to monitor data quality and track changes made to the database schema.

7. Test and deploy: Test your data models thoroughly to validate their effectiveness and accuracy. Deploy your new schema updates to production environments when they meet the required testing criteria. Monitor the performance and usage statistics of your database to detect any anomalies or bottlenecks that could affect data quality.
