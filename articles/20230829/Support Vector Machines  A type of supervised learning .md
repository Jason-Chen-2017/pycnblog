# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification problems. SVM models are based on the idea of finding the best possible separator or decision boundary between different classes in feature space by maximizing the margin between the two classes. The resulting hyperplane can then be used to classify new examples into one of these classes.
In this article, we will discuss about support vector machines, its various types like linear svm, non-linear svm, kernel svm, etc., and how it works in detail. We will also cover some basic concepts related to SVM such as margin, hinge loss function, slack variable, and soft margin. Finally, we will demonstrate with an example using Python programming language.

## 2.1 Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a computer program learns from labeled data, i.e., training data with correct outputs (also known as target variables). This task involves analyzing the patterns found in the input features and predicting their output based on those patterns. Once trained, the model can make predictions on unseen data without being explicitly taught how to do so. In other words, it exploits prior knowledge to make accurate predictions. Common applications of supervised learning include image classification, text analysis, and disease diagnosis.

Supervised learning algorithms typically have three main components:

1. **Training set**: The dataset consisting of input vectors along with their corresponding targets. It is used to train the algorithm to learn the underlying structure of the problem and improve accuracy over time.

2. **Learning Algorithm**: The mathematical formulation that maps inputs to outputs. An algorithm takes inputs and produces an output based on certain rules and constraints. These rules depend on the specific implementation of the algorithm. Some common learning algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks.

3. **Prediction Model/Function**: Once the algorithm has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, previously unseen data. Predictions can take several forms including class labels or continuous values depending on whether the problem is a classification or regression task respectively.

In summary, supervised learning involves building a model by feeding it training data, which includes input vectors and their corresponding targets. Then, the algorithm is trained to find patterns and relationships within the data, leading to improved accuracy when making predictions on new, unseen data. Here's an illustration of how supervised learning works:


## 2.2 Support Vector Machines
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful technique used widely in modern machine learning applications. SVM models are used to solve both classification and regression problems, although they are particularly well suited for classification problems. In this section, we'll explore SVM and see what makes them special compared to other supervised learning methods.

### 2.2.1 Introduction
SVM is a type of supervised learning algorithm that constructs a hyperplane in high-dimensional spaces to separate different classes. Intuitively, the goal of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the positive and negative samples while ensuring that there are minimal margins around the separation plane. The optimization objective is defined by two key functions called "hinge loss" and "support vector". Hinge loss measures the difference between the distance between the hyperplane and the closest point in either class and zero. By minimizing this loss function, the SVM algorithm finds the most informative and discriminative features that contribute towards distinguishing the two classes. Support vectors are the points that lie closest to the hyperplane and provide the foundation for building the final decision boundary. In general, more complex datasets tend to result in higher complexity in hyperplanes, but SVM provides a way to simplify the decision boundaries to increase computational efficiency.

Here's an illustration of SVM separating two classes: 


The left figure shows the decision boundary learned by SVM; the right figure shows the misclassified instances. Notice that the SVM correctly identifies all the blue points belonging to class +1 (on the top side), whereas incorrectly assigns red points to class −1 (on the bottom side). Additionally, notice that only the purple line separates the green and yellow regions from each other, indicating that SVM is able to handle nonlinearity automatically.

### 2.2.2 Types of SVMs
There are three types of SVMs based on their assumptions about the data distribution.

1. **Linear SVM**

    In linear SVM, the hypothesis space consists of all possible linear combinations of the input features. This means that SVM assumes that the data can be separated by a single straight line. Mathematically, if x and y are the input features and w is the weight vector, the linear SVM classifier is given by:


    where z = wx + b represents the decision boundary. The term α(w) indicates the signed weights assigned to each sample, which determines the slope of the hyperplane. The larger the absolute value of α(w), the stronger the influence of that particular sample. If α(w) is zero, then the corresponding instance does not contribute much towards the final decision boundary. On the other hand, if α(w) is very large, then the corresponding instance becomes crucial in determining the decision boundary and contributes more to the prediction than others. Linear SVM performs better on linearly separable datasets, i.e., datasets where a straight line can perfectly separate the data into distinct classes. However, its performance decreases rapidly as the dimensionality increases due to curse of dimensionality.
    
2. **Nonlinear SVM**

    In nonlinear SVM, the hypothesis space consists of all possible decision surfaces that are locally linear. Specifically, instead of representing the entire input space with a single hyperplane, SVM uses a kernel trick to transform the input features into a higher dimensional space, allowing the use of non-linear decision boundaries. Specifically, the kernel function φ(x) transforms the original feature space into another feature space where a linear decision surface can be learned. Nonlinear SVM classifiers are often less computationally expensive than linear SVM classifiers because fewer hyperplanes need to be considered. However, nonlinear SVM requires careful selection of the kernel function, as well as parameter tuning to avoid overfitting and achieve good results.
    
    There are many commonly used kernels in practice, including radial basis functions (RBF), polynomial kernels, sigmoid kernels, and the cosine similarity kernel. For RBF kernel, the transformation rule is:


    Polynomial kernel:


    Sigmoid kernel:


    Cosine similarity kernel:


3. **Kernel SVM**

    Kernel SVM is a hybrid approach combining the strengths of linear and non-linear SVMs. It combines the advantages of both approaches by treating the non-linear part of the data using a kernel function before applying a linear SVM. Unlike traditional SVMs, Kernel SVM does not require explicit feature mapping, which simplifies the process of handling complex datasets. Instead, the kernel function implicitly defines a new feature space that captures complex interactions between the input features. The cost function and gradient descent updates remain the same as standard SVM, but under the hood, Kernel SVM implements the kernel trick to map the input features into a higher dimensional space before applying a linear SVM classifier.
