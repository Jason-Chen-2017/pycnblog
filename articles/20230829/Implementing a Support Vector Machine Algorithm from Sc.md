# 1.简介
  

Support vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most popular and effective machine learning algorithms used for classification tasks. In this article we will implement support vector machine algorithm from scratch using numpy library to better understand how it works underneath.

Support vector machines are based on the idea that if there is a hyperplane in high-dimensional space that can separate data into classes effectively, then it should be possible to find such a hyperplane by only considering examples of each class. This is called the "kernel trick" because it allows us to use arbitrary basis functions rather than explicit decision boundaries. SVMs work well with small training sets, outliers, and high dimensional feature spaces.

In this implementation, we will use Gaussian kernel function which converts the input features into higher dimension space where it becomes linearly separable. We will also use binary cross-entropy loss function as our optimization objective. The code is written using python programming language with numpy library for efficient mathematical operations. 

This implementation covers only the basic version of SVM algorithm but it has many more advanced features like kernel parameter tuning, multi-class classification, etc., which may require more complex implementations depending on your needs.

## Hyperplane
A hyperplane is an abstract two-dimensional object that lies flat or curved in a three-dimensional space. It is defined by two equations: $f(x) = c$, where $c$ is some constant value, and $g(x)$, where $g(x)$ represents any non-constant scalar function of $x$. A hyperplane divides the plane into two halfspaces, one containing points whose corresponding values of $g(x)$ have positive sign and another containing negative signs. For example, consider the set of all points $(x_i, y_i)$ such that $0 \leq x_i \leq 1$ and $y_i - x_i^2 > 0$. The equation $y_i - x_i^2 = 0$ defines the line through the origin that passes through the point $(0, 1/2)$; it does not pass through any other points in the set. If we intersect the line with the x-axis at $t$, we get the hyperplane $\{ t : f(x) = tg(x)\}$.

In support vector machines, we want to create a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes of data points. To do so, we choose the center of the margin by taking the midpoint between the lines connecting the closest points of each class. The distance from the hyperplane to both sides of the margin are determined by selecting a minimum distance from the closest points of each class, respectively. This way, the hyperplane attempts to split the feature space into regions where each region contains samples from exactly one class while avoiding false alarms or misses.

## Kernel Functions
Kernel functions transform the original input features into a higher dimension space where it becomes linearly separable. There are various types of kernel functions including polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), sigmoidal, and cosine kernels. In this implementation, we will use the RBF kernel which is commonly used. The RBF kernel is given by:

$$K(x_i, x_j)=\exp(-\gamma||x_i-x_j||^2)$$

where $\gamma$ is a hyperparameter that controls the width of the kernel. As $\gamma$ increases, the kernel becomes more peaked and the decision boundary becomes less smooth. On the other hand, when $\gamma$ decreases, the decision boundary becomes smoother and wider, which makes the model less prone to overfitting.

## Loss Function
The loss function measures the discrepancy between the predicted output and actual output of the model. In this implementation, we will use the binary cross entropy loss function which is often used for binary classification problems. The binary cross entropy loss function is given by:

$$L(\hat{y}, y)=-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n[y_i\log{\hat{y}_i}+(1-y_i)\log{(1-\hat{y}_i)}]$$

where $\hat{y}$ is the predicted probability of the label being equal to 1 and $y$ is the true label. When $\hat{y}_i$ approaches 1, the cost associated with predicting the wrong label decreases quickly, whereas when $\hat{y}_i$ approaches 0, the cost remains large even after getting closer to the correct prediction. Thus, minimizing the total cost gives a good balance between accuracy and complexity of the model.

## 3.1 Data Preprocessing
We first need to preprocess the data by normalizing the features and splitting them into training and testing sets. We normalize the features by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation. We then split the dataset into training and test sets with a ratio of 70:30% or 0.7:0.3.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris # Load Iris dataset
import numpy as np

# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()

# Extract features and labels
X = iris['data']
y = (iris['target']==0).astype(int)

# Normalize features
mean = X.mean(axis=0)
std = X.std(axis=0)
X = (X - mean)/std

# Split into train and test sets
train_size = int(0.7*len(X))
test_size = len(X)-train_size
X_train, y_train = X[:train_size], y[:train_size]
X_test, y_test = X[train_size:], y[train_size:]
```

## 3.2 Training Phase
### Step 1: Initialize Model Parameters
We initialize the weights and bias term of the model using random values. Here, the number of features equals the number of columns in the input matrix `X`.

```python
weights = np.random.rand(X.shape[1])
bias = np.random.rand()
```

### Step 2: Calculate Kernel Matrix
To calculate the similarity between pairs of input vectors, we calculate their dot product and apply the exponential function with a gamma parameter. We repeat this step for every pair of input vectors to form a symmetric kernel matrix K.

```python
def rbf_kernel(x, y):
    return np.exp(-np.linalg.norm(x-y)**2/(2*(gamma**2)))
    
K = np.zeros((X.shape[0], X.shape[0]))
for i in range(X.shape[0]):
    for j in range(X.shape[0]):
        K[i][j] = rbf_kernel(X[i], X[j]) + eps # Add epsilon to avoid division by zero error
        
print("K:", K)
```

### Step 3: Optimize Weights using Gradient Descent
We minimize the cost function J (binary cross entropy loss plus L2 regularization term) using gradient descent. At each iteration, we update the parameters theta according to the following formula:

$$\theta=\theta-\alpha\nabla_{\theta}J(\theta)$$

where alpha is the learning rate and nabla represents the partial derivative of the cost function.

```python
learning_rate = 0.01
reg_param = 0.01
eps = 1e-5 # Epsilon to add for numerical stability
iterations = 1000

def compute_loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return (-1/N)*np.sum(np.multiply(y_true, np.log(y_pred+eps))+np.multiply((1-y_true), np.log(1-y_pred+eps))) + reg_param*(np.linalg.norm(weights)**2)
    
def compute_grad(K, X_train, y_train, weights, bias):
    y_pred = np.dot(K, weights)+bias
    errors = y_pred-y_train
    grad_weights = -(1/N)*np.dot(errors, X_train.T)+(2*reg_param*weights)
    grad_bias = -(1/N)*np.sum(errors)+(2*reg_param*bias)
    return [grad_weights, grad_bias]
    
    
weights = np.random.rand(X.shape[1])
bias = np.random.rand()
N = len(X_train)

for iter in range(iterations):
    grad = compute_grad(K, X_train, y_train, weights, bias)
    weights -= learning_rate * grad[0]
    bias -= learning_rate * grad[1]
    
    if iter % 100 == 0:
        print("Iteration:",iter,"Loss:",compute_loss(np.dot(K, weights)+bias, y_train))
        
print("Final weights:", weights)
print("Final bias:", bias)
```

## 3.3 Testing Phase
We use the trained model to make predictions on the test set and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy score.

```python
# Make predictions on test set
y_pred = (np.dot(K, weights)+bias)>0
accuracy = sum([1 for i in range(len(y_pred)) if y_pred[i]==y_test[i]]) / float(len(y_pred))

# Print accuracy score
print("Accuracy Score:", accuracy)
```

We covered the basics of SVM algorithm, preprocessed the data, optimized the weights using gradient descent, made predictions on the test set, and evaluated the performance using accuracy score.
