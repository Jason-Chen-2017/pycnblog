# 1.简介
  

Logistic regression is a widely used statistical method for binary classification problems where the dependent variable has two or more categories. In this post, we will go through logistic regression and understand its working principles with simple examples. We will also cover some key terms and concepts in logistic regression such as likelihood function, decision boundary, cost function, regularization parameter and so on. Finally, we will write code to implement logistic regression using Python programming language.

## 2.1 Binary Classification Problem
In supervised machine learning, binary classification refers to predicting a binary outcome (i.e., true/false) based on input features. The most common type of binary classification problem involves classifying data into two classes - either one category or another depending on certain conditions specified by the feature variables. These types of problems are important because they allow us to make decisions that can impact our businesses or take actions. For example, spam filters classify incoming emails as spam or not spam, credit card fraud detection identifies transactions that have been made from unusual locations, disease diagnosis models determine whether patients have a particular disease or not, etc. A binary classification model typically consists of two components - a set of feature variables X and an output variable Y which takes on only two values (usually represented as 0 or 1). It learns a mapping function between these variables that allows it to accurately classify new instances into their corresponding categories.

## 2.2 Likelihood Function
A typical binary classification problem involves modeling the probability of each instance belonging to the positive class or negative class. Mathematically speaking, we denote the predicted probabilities for both classes as P(Y=1|X), which represents the probability of an instance belonging to the positive class given its feature vector. This probability is estimated using Bayes' rule, which states that the probability of any event can be calculated as the ratio of the conditional probability of the event occurring and the prior probability of the event occuring:

P(event) = P(event|prior) x P(prior) / P(event)

where P(event|prior) is the probability of the event occurring given the prior probability, P(prior) is the probability of the event before we observe any evidence, and P(event) is the total probability of observing the event (either directly or indirectly) given all possible explanatory factors. However, Bayes' rule requires knowing the exact form of the joint distribution of the data, which may not always be available in real-world situations. Instead, we can use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the parameters of the posterior distribution of the model's parameters given the observed data. MLE is based on the principle that if we assume that the observed data follows a certain distribution (such as a Gaussian distribution for continuous data or a binomial distribution for categorical data), then the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters corresponds to the values of the parameters that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data.

The likelihood function is the mathematical expression that gives the probability of the observed data given a specific value of the parameters. Specifically, we want to find the value of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function:

L(θ)=P(y|x;θ)

where θ is a set of model parameters, y is the observation label, and x is the feature vector. To perform maximum likelihood estimation, we need to compute the logarithm of the likelihood function to avoid taking the product of very small numbers due to underflow errors. Intuitively, computing the logarithm helps us avoid multiplying many small numbers together, making it easier to optimize the model parameters using numerical optimization techniques like gradient descent. Moreover, the logarithmic transformation makes it easy to interpret the coefficients of the linear model because they represent the log odds ratios (the natural logarithm of the odds ratio). Hence, we define the log likelihood function as:

log(L(θ))=-∑[y_i log(h_θ(x_i))+(1-y_i) log(1-h_θ(x_i))]

where h_θ(x) is the hypothesis function that maps the feature vector x to the probability of being in the positive class. Note that the numerator and denominator of the above equation do not depend on theta directly. Thus, it suffices to maximize the above equation wrt. theta alone.

However, calculating the derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to theta is not straight forward since h_θ(x) is a non-linear function of theta. Therefore, we need to use approximation methods such as stochastic gradient descent or Newton's method to find the optimal solution.

## 2.3 Decision Boundary
Once we have learned the optimal values of the model parameters, we need to come up with a way to assign a predicted label to new instances. One approach is to draw a decision boundary that separates the two classes effectively. Let's consider the following simplified case where there is just one feature variable x:

Let’s say the hypothesis function for logistic regression is hθ(x)=(1+exp(-θ^Tx))/2

Then the sigmoid function is defined as :

g(z)=1/(1+exp(-z))

We know that z=theta^T*x, so : 

g(theta^T*x)=1/(1+exp(-theta^T*x))

Now let's plot g(theta^T*x) vs theta^T*x to get the decision boundary. Clearly, the decision boundary is at 0, i.e., when theta^T*x=0, hθ(x) becomes 0.5, indicating the most likely prediction. If theta^T*x>0, then the predicted label is 1 and if theta^T*x<0, then the predicted label is 0. When plotted graphically, the decision boundary looks something like this:


Note that we cannot simply calculate theta^T*x in order to obtain a unique decision boundary. We need to choose appropriate values for the other parameters in addition to theta. This is why regularization is often used to prevent overfitting of the training dataset.
