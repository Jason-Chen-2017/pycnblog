Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a natural language processing task that aims to classify the overall sentiment orientation within specific target areas or aspects of text. It can be used in various applications such as customer service, social media monitoring, product review analysis, and market research. In recent years, deep learning models have achieved impressive results on this challenging task by jointly modeling contextual information from different sources, including lexical cues like words, phrases and named entities, syntactic features derived from sentences, and semantic relationships between the aspects and their corresponding sentiments.

However, it remains an open question how best to train such complex models effectively in real-world scenarios where labeled data are scarce and continuously updated over time. This requires careful consideration of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and regularization techniques that balance between generalization ability and computational efficiency while also promoting convergence to the optimal solution. 

In this article, we will summarize current state-of-the-art online learning strategies for ABSA tasks and discuss some key challenges associated with each approach. We will then compare these approaches in terms of performance, scalability, complexity, and interpretability using several datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we will discuss future research directions based on our findings. Overall, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing online learning strategies and identify future research directions that may help address the shortcomings and limitations of today’s systems.  

# 2.关键术语
* **Sentiment**: The emotions and opinions expressed through language, such as positive/negative or happy/sad.
* **Target area**: The part of the text under consideration, which could be a single word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, or entire document.
* **Aspect**: An element or property relevant to the sentiment being expressed, often referred to as opinion holder. For example, "service" would be an aspect in "The food was delicious but the staff was slow." 
* **Labled dataset**: A set of annotated examples used to train machine learning algorithms for classification tasks. Each example consists of a text input (sentences), one or more target areas, one or more aspects related to those target areas, and a binary label indicating whether the sentiment towards the aspect(s) is positive or negative.
* **Unlabled dataset**: A set of unlabeled texts obtained from users or other sources. They must be processed into labled dataset format before training.

# 3.Online Learning Strategies for ABSA Task
## 3.1 Bagging
Bagging stands for Bootstrap Aggregation. It is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees trained on random subsets of the original dataset. Each tree makes predictions independently, combining them through averaging to achieve better predictive accuracy than individual decision trees. However, bagging does not take advantage of complementary information from the overlapping samples provided by bootstrap sampling. To utilize complementary information, Adaptive Boosting methods were proposed later.

**Pros:** Simple to implement; low computation cost.

**Cons:** Unable to leverage complementary information from the overlapping samples. Overfitting risk.

## 3.2 AdaBoost
Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) is another popular algorithm for online learning in ABSA. It starts with a weak classifier, assigns high weights to misclassified instances, and updates the weights of incorrectly classified instances. The next iteration uses weighted training sets to build a stronger classifier. Adaboost has been shown to perform well even when there is little prior knowledge about the underlying patterns in the training data, making it suitable for domains with limited supervision or incomplete annotations. Despite its simplicity, AdaBoost still outperforms traditional offline methods when dealing with imbalanced datasets and multi-class problems.

**Pros:** Flexible and effective in handling both balanced and imbalanced data; able to use complementary information from the overlapping samples.

**Cons:** Difficult to interpret the learned classifiers due to their complex structure. Weak learners tend to overfit early in the process.


## 3.3 Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique that learns policies from interaction with an environment. Policies specify actions to be taken at given states according to certain rules. The goal of reinforcement learning is to maximize cumulative rewards obtained after taking actions in a dynamically changing environment. Traditionally, RL has been applied to sequential decision-making tasks like robotics control and game playing, but has recently seen increasing popularity in a variety of applications across fields ranging from healthcare to finance.

For ABSA, Reinforcement learning can be used to iteratively select aspects to focus on during inference. The agent observes the user's input and selects a subset of aspects to highlight to optimize the sentiment score. The agent receives immediate reward if the sentiment towards the selected aspect(s) improves, and otherwise gets penalized for wasted effort. By encouraging exploration and exploitation during training, Reinforcement learning can improve robustness and effectiveness compared to other online learning methods.

**Pros:** Can handle long-term dependencies and optimizing non-convex objectives; provides insights into the learned classifiers.

**Cons:** Sensitive to initial conditions and hyperparameters; computationally expensive.

## 3.4 Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is a classic optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. When applied to ABSA, gradient descent can be adapted to update the parameters of the model iteratively until the error rate converges to zero. The parameter updating rule involves computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters, and adjusting them by a small amount to minimize the loss function. Despite its simplicity, GD works surprisingly well in practice for many machine learning tasks. In particular, GD can handle large feature spaces, nonlinearity issues, and sparse data, making it particularly useful in application domains with very large amounts of labeled data.

**Pros:** Efficient for large datasets and wide feature spaces; easy to understand and interpret the learned classifiers.

**Cons:** May get stuck in local minima and oscillate around global optimum.

Overall, the above four online learning strategies cover a range of efficient strategies for ABSA task training, but they all share common characteristics: simple implementation, flexible adaptation to different datasets, and powerful statistical properties for leveraging complementary information from the overlapping samples. Moreover, AdaBoost and Reinforcement Learning are specifically designed to handle imbalanced datasets, providing additional benefits beyond traditional offline methods. Future research efforts should evaluate these methods on multiple datasets and transfer learning settings, as well as explore new types of representations for capturing the semantics of textual inputs and adapting them to varying levels of abstraction.
