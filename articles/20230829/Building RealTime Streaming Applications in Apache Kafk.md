# 1.简介
  

Apache Kafka is a popular open-source distributed streaming platform that has become the de facto standard for building real-time data pipelines. It provides fault tolerance, scalability, high throughput, and low latency capabilities to support continuous processing of large volumes of data at scale. In this series of articles, we will cover how to build real-time applications using Python and Scala programming languages on top of Apache Kafka. We assume readers have a basic understanding of Apache Kafka concepts such as topics, partitions, producers, consumers, brokers, and client libraries.
In part one of our journey towards building real-time streaming applications using Apache Kafka, we covered how to install and configure the necessary components (i.e., Zookeeper, Kafka broker, and client library) on your local machine or server. We also discussed best practices when it comes to choosing partition counts, topic replication factor, consumer group sizes, and other related configuration settings. Finally, we demonstrated an example producer application written in Python and consumed messages from the same topic using another Python consumer application.
In this second article, let's continue exploring more advanced features of Apache Kafka by building a simple streaming application that uses stateful stream processing techniques like windowing and watermarking. Specifically, we will implement a version of the classic "Rolling Sum" algorithm using Kafka streams API. Our final goal is to achieve efficient and accurate computation of rolling sums over windows of time within each partition of a Kafka topic.
Before moving forward, make sure you have completed parts I and II of this series so that you are familiar with the core principles of Apache Kafka and its integration with Python and Scala programming languages. If not, please refer back to those articles before proceeding further.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform built on top of the Apache Distributed Log (DL) project. DL is designed to provide strong consistency guarantees for messaging at scale while achieving high performance, durability, and fault tolerance characteristics. It supports a wide range of messaging protocols including TCP, TLS, and SASL. Kafka clients communicate with each other via the Kafka Broker, which maintains metadata about available topics and stores log segments, each of which contains a sequence of records. The Kafka cluster itself consists of multiple nodes known as brokers, which communicate with clients and carry out message storage and retrieval operations based on their subscriptions to topics. Each node can handle multiple clients and topics simultaneously, making it highly scalable and fault tolerant.

We'll focus on two key terms associated with Apache Kafka:
1. Topic: A Kafka topic is a category of events or messages stored on the Kafka cluster. Topics are similar to databases tables, but they offer several advantages such as ordered messaging, guaranteed delivery, replayability, and flexible schema design. Topics are divided into smaller partitions, called partitions, which allow for horizontal scaling of event processing.

2. Partition: A partition is an ordered sequence of messages that belongs to a specific topic. When a new message arrives, it is appended to the end of a partition, ensuring sequential order across all messages in a partition. Partitions maintain strict ordering and boundaries between messages to ensure consistent reads and writes even during failure scenarios. By default, Kafka creates a partition for every topic with a configurable number of partitions. However, you may need to adjust these defaults depending on your workload and distribution patterns.

## Kafka Streams API
Kafka Streams is an extension of Apache Kafka that provides stream processing capabilities. It allows developers to write applications that consume and process data from Kafka topics, transform them incrementally through complex computations, and produce the results to new Kafka topics or send them directly to external systems such as database systems, file systems, or REST APIs. The Kafka Streams API works on the concept of streams, which are sequences of objects that flow through the system. Stream processors perform transformations on input streams, generating output streams that are then processed by additional processors until finally being pushed downstream to consumers. This approach separates concerns between data producers, data processors, and data consumers, allowing for easy maintenance, scaling, and parallelization of the entire pipeline.

Some of the important terminology associated with Kafka Streams include:
1. KStream: An abstraction that represents a continuous stream of data from a single Kafka topic. KStreams provide a high level DSL (Domain Specific Language) that makes it easy to define complex stream transformations. They can be either keyed or unkeyed. Unkeyed KStreams correspond to traditional message queues, whereas keyed KStreams represent partitioned indexes over collections of values with the same key.

2. KTable: Similar to a relational table, a Kafka Table is a distributed representation of a collection of key-value pairs. Unlike a KStream, a KTable does not preserve the order of incoming messages. Instead, it aggregates updates based on a user defined aggregation function applied to previous values of the same key. Keyed Tables are useful for maintaining materialized views of data indexed by keys, enabling joins between KStreams and KTables and performing aggregations efficiently.

3. Windowing: Windows are a technique used to segment a stream of data into smaller, discrete intervals of time. Different types of windows exist, such as tumbling windows that are based on fixed duration intervals, sliding windows that slide along with the incoming data, session windows that group messages based on activity periods, and global windows that span multiple partitions. Kafka Streams automatically manages windows and handles offsets tracking per partition, providing fault tolerance and efficiency in computing windowed aggregates.


# 3. Rolling Sum Example
## Introduction
Let’s take a look at implementing the classic “rolling sum” algorithm using the Kafka Streams API. This algorithm computes the sum of recent elements within a specified time frame, known as a window. Let’s say we have a stream of numbers generated periodically at some rate (let's call it r), and we want to compute the rolling sum of these numbers within a given time frame of size w. Here's what we would do step by step:

1. Define a Kafka topic named "numbers". Create the topic manually using the kafka-topics command line tool. 

2. Start the Kafka console producer app to publish random integers to the "numbers" topic at rate r. Use the following Java code snippet as a starting point:

   ```java
   public class RandomNumberProducer {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
           String bootstrapServers = "localhost:9092";
           String topicName = "numbers";
           Properties properties = new Properties();
           properties.setProperty(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);
           Producer<Long, Integer> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(properties, LongSerializer.class, IntegerSerializer.class);
           
           int count = 1;
           long delayMillis = (long)(Math.random() * 1000);
           Thread.sleep(delayMillis); // introduce random delay to avoid burstiness
           while (true) {
               int num = new Random().nextInt(100);
               System.out.println("Producing message #" + count++ + ": " + num);
               producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(topicName, null, System.currentTimeMillis(), num));
               
               delayMillis = (long)(Math.random() * 1000);
               Thread.sleep(delayMillis); // introduce random delay to avoid burstiness
           }
       
       }
   }
   ```
   
   This program publishes integer numbers randomly to the "numbers" topic at rate r with slight random delays introduced to avoid sudden bursts of messages. Save this code to a separate file called "RandomNumberProducer.java". Note that we're using the Kafka Java Client library here to interact with the Kafka cluster.

3. Next, start the Kafka console consumer app to read the published messages from the "numbers" topic and print their total sum. Use the following Java code snippet as a starting point:

   ```java
   public class TotalSumConsumer {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           String bootstrapServers = "localhost:9092";
           String topicName = "numbers";
           Properties properties = new Properties();
           properties.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);
           Consumer<Long, Integer> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(properties, LongDeserializer.class, IntegerDeserializer.class);
           consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList(topicName));
           Map<Integer, Integer> windowCounts = new HashMap<>();
           while (true) {
               ConsumerRecords<Long, Integer> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
               for (ConsumerRecord<Long, Integer> record : records) {
                   int value = record.value();
                   if (!windowCounts.containsKey(record.partition())) {
                       windowCounts.put(record.partition(), value);
                   } else {
                       windowCounts.put(record.partition(), windowCounts.get(record.partition()) + value);
                   }
                   
                   int partitionCount = getTotalWindowCount(records.count());
                   double average = getAverageOfWindow(windowCounts.get(record.partition()), partitionCount);
                   System.out.printf("%d\t%f\n", record.timestamp(), average);
               }
           }
       
       }
   
       private static int getTotalWindowCount(int messageCount) {
           return 10; // assuming constant rate of generation
       }
       
       private static double getAverageOfWindow(int currentCount, int windowSize) {
           return ((double)currentCount / windowSize);
       }
    }
   ```

   This program subscribes to the "numbers" topic and prints out the timestamp of each received message along with the average sum of the last 10 messages seen for each partition. For simplicity, we're hardcoding the assumption that there exists a constant rate of generation of numbers, which means that we know exactly how many messages to keep track of in each window. Save this code to a separate file called "TotalSumConsumer.java". Note that we're again using the Kafka Java Client library here to interact with the Kafka cluster.

4. Now we need to integrate the Kafka Streams API into our workflow. First, add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
      <artifactId>kafka-streams</artifactId>
      <version>${kafka.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
    
    Replace ${kafka.version} with the latest stable release version of Kafka.
    
5. Modify the RandomNumberProducer and TotalSumConsumer classes to use the Kafka Streams API instead of the vanilla Java Clients. Here's an updated implementation of the RandomNumberProducer class:

   ```java
   import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes;
   import org.apache.kafka.streams.*;
   import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.*;
   
   public class RandomNumberProducer {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String bootstrapServers = "localhost:9092";
           String topicName = "numbers";
           StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
           
           KStream<Void, Integer> inputStream = builder.<Void, Integer>stream(topicName)
                  .mapValues(value -> value)
                  .peek((key, value) -> System.out.println("Producing message: " + value))
                  .selectKey((key, value) -> Serdes.serdeFrom(null).serializer().serialize("", 0));
           
           inputStream.to(Serdes.Long(), Serdes.Integer(), "output");
           
           Properties config = new Properties();
           config.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "random-number-producer");
           config.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);
           
           KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), config);
           streams.cleanUp();
           streams.start();
           
           try {
               Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE);
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
           
           streams.close();
       }
   }
   ```
   
   Here, we've replaced the original logic of publishing messages using the Kafka Java Client library with a Kafka Streams topology consisting of a single stream that maps input values to themselves, peeks at the result to log messages, selects a dummy key (since the Kafka Streams API requires non-null keys), and forwards the resulting output to a new topic named "output".
   
   We've also added code to clean up and close the KafkaStreams instance properly. Finally, we're updating the bootstrap servers and creating a StreamsConfig object to specify our application ID and Kafka cluster details.
   
6. Next, update the TotalSumConsumer class to consume messages from the newly produced "output" topic and compute the rolling sum using the Kafka Streams API. Here's an updated implementation of the TotalSumConsumer class:

   ```java
   import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes;
   import org.apache.kafka.streams.*;
   import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.*;
   
   public class TotalSumConsumer {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String bootstrapServers = "localhost:9092";
           String inputTopicName = "numbers";
           String outputTopicName = "output";
           StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
           
           GlobalKTable<Long, Integer> rollingSumTable = 
                   builder.globalTable(outputTopicName,
                           Materialized.<Long, Integer, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>>as("rolling-sum")
                              .withKeySerde(Serdes.Long())
                              .withValueSerde(Serdes.Integer()));
           
           KStream<Long, Integer> outputStream = builder.stream(inputTopicName)
                  .groupByKey()
                  .aggregate(() -> 0,
                            (aggKey, newValue, aggValue) -> newValue + aggValue,
                            Materialized.<Long, Integer, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>>as("windowed-counts")
                               .withKeySerde(Serdes.Long())
                               .withValueSerde(Serdes.Integer()))
                  .join(rollingSumTable,
                         JoinWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(1)),
                         Joined.with(Serdes.Long(), Serdes.Integer(), Serdes.Integer()))
                  .map((key, tuple) -> new KeyValue<>(key, Math.max(tuple.v2(), 0)))
                  .selectKey((key, value) -> Serdes.serdeFrom(null).serializer().serialize("", 0));
           
           outputStream.to(Serdes.Long(), Serdes.Integer(), "sums");
           
           Properties config = new Properties();
           config.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "total-sum-consumer");
           config.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);
           
           KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), config);
           streams.cleanUp();
           streams.start();
           
           try {
               Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE);
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
           
           streams.close();
       }
   }
   ```
   
   Here, we've first defined a global table named "rolling-sum" that reads messages from the "output" topic and computes the rolling sum over a window of size 1 second. We're using the KeyValueStore interface provided by the Kafka Streams API to persist the rolling sum in memory.
   
   Next, we're joining the grouped input stream of numbers with the "rolling-sum" table computed above. To do this, we're using the join() operation with a time window of 1 second. We pass in a lambda expression to aggregate the values within each window, adding up the newest element to any existing aggregated value. The joined output is a stream containing tuples of type Tuple3<Long, Integer, Integer>, representing the timestamp, input value, and rolling sum respectively. We only select the third field (the rolling sum) since the rest of the fields are irrelevant to us.
   
   Finally, we convert the resulting stream of tuples to a format compatible with the vanilla Java Client library and forward it to a new topic named "sums". Again, we're cleaning up and closing the KafkaStreams instance properly.

That's it! With these changes, our programs now leverage the power of the Kafka Streams API to perform continuous rolling sum calculations on live data.
