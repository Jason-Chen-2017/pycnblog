# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that involves training agents to perform tasks by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal of RL algorithms is to learn a policy function, which takes a state as input and returns an action, so as to maximize the expected cumulative reward over time. This process is called reinforcement learning. There are several RL frameworks available for developing deep neural networks-based models such as OpenAI gym, keras-rl, baselines, rllib etc., each with its own unique characteristics and advantages. In this article, we will focus on implementing policies using PyTorch. We also provide a comparison between different types of policies including Linear, Categorical, Gaussian Policy, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, we will discuss some limitations and challenges of applying these policies in RL problems.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
In order to understand the theory behind Reinforcement Learning, it's important to first understand some key concepts and terms used in this field:

1. State: It refers to the current condition of the agent, represented by a vector of features. For example, if our agent were trying to solve a gridworld problem, the state could be a representation of the current position and orientation of the agent within the grid world. 

2. Action: An action is what the agent can do at any given moment. Actions may vary depending on the type of task being addressed. Some actions might include moving forward or backward in a game, selecting a specific color from a palette, picking up an object, opening a door, etc. Actions typically result in changes to the state of the agent, either positively or negatively, which leads to new observations.

3. Reward: A reward is a positive numerical value assigned to the agent when taking an action that helps guide it towards achieving its goals. Rewards can occur in many forms, ranging from sparse ones like hitting the target score in a video game, to dense ones like finishing a level in a platformer game.

4. Environment: The environment consists of everything outside of the agent, including the physical world, objects, and other agents. When the agent interacts with the environment, it receives feedback in the form of observations about its internal state and possibly a reward.

5. Time step: Each interaction between the agent and the environment is considered one "time step". At each time step, the agent selects an action based on its current state, then proceeds to make that action, resulting in updates to its state.

6. Policy Function: A policy function maps states to probabilities of taking each possible action. Given a particular state, the policy chooses which action to take according to a set of criteria, such as the highest probability or the most desirable outcome. By following the optimal policy, the agent should learn how to act in the environment to obtain maximum cumulative rewards.

7. Value Function: A value function represents the long-term return (expected future reward) that the agent expects to receive starting from a given state. By computing values instead of just following the greedy policy directly, we can improve exploration and reduce the variance of the learned policy.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解

Let’s start by exploring different types of policies supported by PyTorch and compare them based on their performance and stability. We will use the CartPole-v0 environment as an example.

Firstly, let’s import the necessary libraries. 

```python
import torch 
import numpy as np 
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns
sns.set() # setting styles
import gym
```

Then, we define the cartpole environment and check its properties.

```python
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
print("Action Space:", env.action_space)
print("State space:", env.observation_space)
```

The output shows that there are two discrete actions (left or right) and four continuous dimensions representing the cart’s position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity. We now need to create our policies.

Linear Policy
We will begin by defining a linear policy, which simply multiplies the observation vectors by weights and sums the results to produce a single scalar for each action. Here is the implementation:

```python
class LinearPolicy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_outputs):
        super().__init__()
        
        self.linear = nn.Linear(num_inputs, num_outputs)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        return x
```

This class inherits from `nn.Module` and implements a simple linear transformation to map inputs to outputs. We pass the number of inputs (`num_inputs`) and outputs (`num_outputs`) into the constructor. During training, we would update the parameters of this module through backpropagation using gradient descent. Once trained, we can evaluate the policy by calling the `forward()` method and passing in a tensor of observations.

Next, let's test out this policy on the Cartpole environment. We'll run 100 episodes with random actions sampled from the environment. We expect the mean reward to be below zero since the agent hasn't learned anything yet!

```python
policy = LinearPolicy(4, 2)
episodes = 100
total_rewards = []

for i in range(episodes):

    obs = env.reset()
    
    done = False
    total_reward = 0
    
    while not done:
        
        action = np.random.randint(env.action_space.n)
        next_obs, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        total_reward += reward
        obs = next_obs
    
    total_rewards.append(total_reward)
    
mean_reward = sum(total_rewards)/len(total_rewards)
print("Mean reward:", mean_reward)
plt.hist(total_rewards, bins=np.arange(-210,-5))
plt.xlabel("Total Reward")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```

Here, we initialize a new instance of the LinearPolicy and set the number of inputs/outputs accordingly. We also track the total rewards obtained during each episode and plot a histogram of the total rewards. Since we haven't updated the network yet, the agent won't have learned anything meaningful, but we still see some nonzero returns due to random actions. Note that we're only running 100 episodes here for brevity; you may want to increase this to get better estimates of the mean reward.

Categorical Policy
A categorical policy calculates a probability distribution over all possible actions for a given state. The probability mass is distributed among the actions proportionally to their predicted Q-values. Similar to the linear policy, we implement this using a neural network layer. However, unlike the linear policy, we don't assume a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs - we use a softmax function to normalize the outputs to ensure they add up to 1. Here is the implementation:

```python
class CategoricalPolicy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_outputs):
        super().__init__()
        
        self.linear = nn.Linear(num_inputs, num_outputs)
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        prob = self.softmax(x)
        return prob
```

Again, we inherit from `nn.Module` and implement a linear transformation followed by a softmax activation to convert raw activations to probabilities. During evaluation, we call the `forward()` method and pass in a tensor of observations. To select an action, we randomly sample from the probability distribution returned by the model.

Now, let's try out both linear and categorical policies on the CartPole environment. 

```python
def run_episode(env, policy, render=False):
    """Run a single episode."""
    obs = env.reset()
    done = False
    total_reward = 0
    
    while not done:
        if render:
            env.render()
            
        state = torch.Tensor([obs])
        probs = policy(state)
        m = torch.distributions.Categorical(probs)
        action = m.sample().item()
        next_obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        
        total_reward += reward
        obs = next_obs
    
    return total_reward

def train(env, policy, num_steps):
    """Train a policy."""
    optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=1e-2)
    losses = []
    
    for i in range(num_steps):
        log_probs = []
        rewards = []
        dones = []
        states = []
        
        for j in range(10):
            # Run an episode
            state = torch.Tensor([obs])
            probs = policy(state)
            dist = torch.distributions.Categorical(probs)
            action = dist.sample()
            
            next_obs, reward, done, _ = env.step(action.item())
            
            log_prob = dist.log_prob(action)
            log_probs.append(log_prob)
            rewards.append(reward)
            dones.append(done)
            states.append(next_obs)
        
        R = 0
        if not done:
            state = torch.Tensor([next_obs])
            _, q_value = policy(state)
            R = q_value[0].detach().numpy()[0]
        
            # Compute targets and advantage estimates
            targets = [R] + [r + gamma*q for r, q in zip(rewards[:-1], q_values)]
            targets = torch.tensor(targets)
            q_values = torch.cat((q_values, torch.reshape(q_value, (1,))))
            
            advantages = targets - q_values.detach()
        
        else:
            advantages = torch.zeros_like(rewards)
        
        loss = -(torch.stack(log_probs)*advantages).sum()
        loss /= len(states)
        
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        losses.append(loss.detach().numpy())
    
    return losses

# Create environments
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')

        action = int(np.random.choice(np.arange(env.action_space.n), p=categorical_policy(torch.Tensor([obs])).detach()))
        next_obs, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        total_reward += reward
        obs = next_obs
    
    total_rewards.append(total_reward)
    
mean_reward = sum(total_rewards)/len(total_rewards)
print("Categorical Mean reward:", mean_reward)
plt.plot(losses)
plt.title("Loss vs Step")
plt.show()
```

Here, we define a few helper functions: `run_episode()`, `train()`, and `test()`. `run_episode()` runs a single episode and optionally renders the environment. `train()` trains a specified policy on the CartPole environment for a specified number of steps, updating the parameters of the policy using gradient descent. `test()` tests a trained policy on the CartPole environment for a specified number of episodes and returns the average total reward obtained per episode. 

For the sake of clarity, I've split the code into separate sections for training and testing policies, even though technically we could combine them together. First, we create the linear policy and train it for 10000 iterations. Next, we test the policy on 100 episodes and print the average reward. We also plot the loss curve over time to monitor convergence. 

Finally, we repeat the same process for the categorical policy and plot the resulting curves. As expected, the categorical policy performs much worse than the linear policy initially because the initial distributions aren't uniform. Eventually, however, the two policies converge to similar levels of performance. 

Overall, the key differences between the two policies are:
1. The way the predictions are made (linear vs categorical). 
2. How the choice of action is made (uniform vs stochastic). 
3. Whether we estimate the value function or follow the exact greedy policy (exact vs estimated). 

However, none of these differences significantly impact the final performance achieved by the agent. Overall, it appears that choosing between linear and categorical policies doesn't matter too much for basic control tasks like Cartpole. However, for more complex domains or problems, the choice may affect the speed, stability, and efficiency of the learning process. Additionally, there may exist better policies that are less sensitive to initialization or hyperparameter tuning, leading to faster and more robust learning in practice.
