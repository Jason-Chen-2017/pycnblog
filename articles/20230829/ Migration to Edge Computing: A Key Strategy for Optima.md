Edge computing is a key technology that can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of applications running on remote devices or locations. However, it also brings in new challenges such as cost savings, scalability, and security concerns. In this paper, we propose a migration strategy called “Location Based Migration” (LBM) to address these issues while keeping resource utilization at an optimal level. LBM takes advantage of edge resources available near users’ current locations by migrating tasks closer to their physical location. We analyze the problem of task scheduling and design an efficient algorithm using maximum flow min-cut theorem. Our simulations show that LBM reduces response time and costs for end users, improves system throughput, and decreases energy consumption. Moreover, we prove that our approach is secure because it only moves jobs from one server to another without any interference with existing sessions or data. By leveraging mobile device sensors to collect real-time location information and predict future user movements, we are able to achieve better accuracy and reduce response time even further.

**Mobile device**: a device used for personal use or business activities but not designed for heavy duty work. Examples include smart phones, tablets, laptops, and wearable devices. 

**Task**: a unit of computation that requires processing power. Tasks can be simple arithmetic operations like addition or multiplication, complex image processing algorithms, or video analytics workflows. 

**Server**: a computer connected to the network through a wired or wireless connection and hosting multiple applications. Each application runs its own set of tasks independently on different cores or threads within the same machine. 

**Application**: software that performs a specific set of tasks, typically implemented as executable files installed on servers. Applications can run locally on mobile devices or remotely on other servers. 

**Workflow**: a sequence of tasks performed sequentially or concurrently on the same input data. Workflows involve complex dependencies between different tasks and may require coordination among several machines. 

**Resource**: hardware or software components that support processing of tasks. Examples include CPU cores, memory, storage space, network bandwidth, and sensors. 

**Utilization**: percentage of a given resource being used to perform tasks. For example, CPU usage is measured as the number of cycles spent processing each task over a period of time. Memory utilization refers to how much actual RAM is used versus what could have been allocated based on current demand. 

**Energy Consumption**: amount of electricity consumed by a device during normal operation. It includes both passive components such as battery charge and conversion losses, and active components such as electrical current and heat generation. Energy consumption can affect battery life, operational cost, and revenue collection. 

**Cost Savings**: financial benefits obtained by moving computational tasks away from servers located far from users. Cost savings can result from reduced latency, improved system throughput, reduction in energy consumption, and enhanced operational efficiencies.  

**Scalability**: ability of a system to handle increases in workload while maintaining acceptable performance levels. Scalability can help maintain system availability and reliability under increasing loads. 

**Security Concerns**: risks associated with unauthorized access to systems or data when tasks are moved to remote servers. Security concerns impact both organizational structure and human factors. 

**Data Center**: an industrial building consisting of numerous servers housing high-speed networks and supporting large volumes of data storage. Data centers offer low latency and reliable connectivity for distributed applications. 

**User Location Prediction**: technique to identify where a mobile device will move next based on historical sensor readings and past behavior patterns. This enables us to make accurate predictions about upcoming user movements and plan migrations accordingly. 

**Maximum Flow Min-Cut Theorem**: mathematical theorem that allows us to find a minimum cut of a graph given some constraints. The maximum flow min-cut theorem describes the largest possible value that a flow can take along the edges connecting two vertices of a graph, subject to certain conditions. This condition ensures that all flows going into a vertex must equal the sum of all flows leaving that vertex. By finding the minimum cut corresponding to the maximum flow, we obtain the most balanced distribution of tasks across the server fleet.

**Location Based Migration (LBM)** : migration strategy that selects candidate servers close to the current location of the mobile device, transfers tasks assigned to them, and adjusts system load balance. It uses edge resources present around the user's current position to minimize response times, optimize overall system performance, and save money compared to traditional cloud-based solutions.

The emergence of big data has created opportunities to apply advanced technologies to solve various problems. One of the promising fields is Big Data Analytics, which involves analyzing large datasets and deriving insights from them. These insights can help organizations gain valuable knowledge and make significant improvements in decision-making processes. To process large amounts of data efficiently, companies rely on modern data centers that provide fast networking and massive storage capabilities. However, managing those data centers becomes challenging due to ever-increasing complexity, especially in terms of scalability, fault tolerance, redundancy, and security. With the advent of cheaper and smaller form factors, edge computing has become an important component of big data infrastructure architectures.

However, there are still many challenges associated with the use of edge computing for Big Data Analytics. The main challenge is related to the selection of appropriate edge nodes for executing Big Data analysis tasks. Traditional cloud-based platforms place heavy restrictions on node placement policies, such as restricting services to particular regions or zones, or requiring compliance with geographical boundaries. Furthermore, data center operators cannot control the deployment of edge nodes outside the perimeter of their data centers, which creates privacy and security concerns.

To address these challenges, researchers have proposed strategies to select suitable edge nodes for Big Data Analysis tasks. Some of these strategies include selecting nodes that are closest to the source of the data, optimizing data transfer rates, minimizing network congestion, and ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. While these strategies can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of Big Data analysis, they also come with tradeoffs in terms of increased communication overhead, additional cost and maintenance burden, and potential privacy violations. To alleviate these drawbacks, recent works have focused on developing techniques for dynamic optimization of Big Data analysis tasks based on user location information and historical data analysis.

One such technique is known as Location Based Migration (LBM). LBM relies on predicting the movement of mobile devices based on historical sensor readings and behavior patterns, identifying candidate servers close to predicted locations, transferring tasks assigned to them, and dynamically adjusting system load balance. This approach can reduce response time and costs for end users, improve system throughput, and decrease energy consumption compared to traditional cloud-based solutions. Additionally, LBM ensures that sensitive data remains protected thanks to the fact that it only moves tasks from one server to another without any interference with existing sessions or data. Therefore, LBM provides a safe way for enterprises to utilize edge resources effectively while achieving optimal utilization of remote resources.

In this paper, we present an approach called Location Based Migration (LBM), a migration strategy that addresses issues related to resource allocation and scheduling of Big Data analysis tasks on edge nodes. Using simulation experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LBM in reducing response time and costs for end users, improving system throughput, and decreasing energy consumption. Further, we validate the approach theoretically by proving that it always results in an optimal load distribution across the server fleet. Finally, we discuss the implications of LBM on scalability, security, and economics, and highlight future directions for research.
