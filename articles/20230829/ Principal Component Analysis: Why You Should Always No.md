Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique used in machine learning and data mining. It reduces the dimensions of high-dimensional datasets by transforming them into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components or directions in feature space. The main goal of PCA is to identify patterns and relationships between variables that explain most of the variation in the dataset. In this article, we will explore why it's important for us to always normalize our data before applying PCA, how PCA works under the hood, and some practical tips on using PCA effectively. We'll also learn about PCA's limitations and when it may not be suitable for use cases like clustering or anomaly detection.

## Part I: Introduction to Principal Component Analysis and Normalization 
### What is Principal Component Analysis?
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), also known as Karhunen-Loève Transform, is an essential step in exploratory data analysis (EDA). It involves finding new features that capture most of the information in a large set of existing features. Mathematically, PCA seeks to find the direction(s) that maximize the variance amongst all possible combinations of these features. These directions form what are commonly referred to as principal components. Each principal component captures the maximum amount of variability across all available observations while being independent from one another.

### Why should you normalize your data before using PCA?
Firstly, let's understand the importance of normalization. Imagine you have two variables X and Y with different units (e.g., cm vs. km). If both variables are measured independently but are highly correlated (i.e., they tend to vary together), then any linear model trying to estimate Y based on X might suffer due to multiple comparisons problem. For instance, if there are many points where X = Y, then even a simple linear regression can produce biased estimates because of the correlation structure. 

To avoid such problems, it is crucial to normalize the data so that its distribution does not vary too much across variables. There are several ways to do this, including standardization and min-max scaling. Both methods achieve the same result, which is to center the data around zero and scale it to unit variance. 

Secondly, PCA assumes that the input variables are normally distributed. However, real-world data often has non-normal distributions, especially in sparse regions or outliers. To address this issue, PCA allows us to apply various types of transformations, such as log transformation, square root transformation, and power transformation, before computing the covariance matrix and eigenvalues/eigenvectors. These transforms help to make the assumption of normality less critical and allow the algorithm to handle non-normal data more accurately.

Thirdly, PCA finds the orthogonal directions that maximize the variance within the data, without considering any other relationship. This means that PCA ignores any dependencies or interactions between the original features and the resulting principal components. As a consequence, the principal components themselves may still contain complex interactions and non-linearities, although they may be easier to interpret compared to the original features. Additionally, PCA is sensitive to multicollinearity, which occurs when two or more input variables are highly related to one another. Multicollinearity can lead to inflated variances, making the corresponding principal components hard to interpret or control. Therefore, it’s recommended to remove multicollinearity prior to performing PCA.

Lastly, PCA provides a relatively straightforward way to visualize the relationship between the original features and the principal components. By plotting the values of each observation along the first two principal components, we can easily identify clusters or groupings of similar observations, revealing potential relationships and underlying structures that were hidden by the individual features alone.

Therefore, it’s essential to normalize the data before using PCA to ensure accurate results and improve interpretability. Let’s move on to Part II to learn more about how PCA works under the hood!

## Part II: How PCA Works Under the Hood 
Before diving into how PCA works technically, let's recall the basic steps involved in PCA:

1. Standardize the data
2. Calculate the Covariance Matrix 
3. Compute the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues 
4. Sort the eigenvectors by decreasing order of eigenvalue 
5. Choose k eigenvectors with largest eigenvalues to form k-dimensional subspace 

We will now discuss each of these steps in detail.
