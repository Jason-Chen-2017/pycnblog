Feature selection (FS) is the process of selecting the most relevant features for a predictive modeling task. It helps to reduce overfitting and improve model accuracy by identifying the most important features in the dataset that contribute towards the outcome variable while ignoring irrelevant or redundant features. There are various techniques used for feature selection such as Filter, Wrapper, Embedded methods etc. The Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) method is one of the popular wrapper methods used for FS in machine learning. In this article, we will discuss the basics of feature selection using RFECV, explain its working mechanism, and demonstrate how it can be applied on different datasets to obtain optimal results. 

In summary, RFECV involves two main steps: 

1. Forward selection - Starting with an empty set of features, add each feature that provides the best improvement in terms of a metric (such as cross-validation score).

2. Backward elimination - After obtaining all selected features, remove the least significant feature from the set until no further improvements are obtained through removal. Repeat until the desired number of features is reached.  

The goal of these steps is to identify a subset of features that are both relevant and sufficient to make accurate predictions on a given dataset. By eliminating irrelevant features, RFECV can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance of the model. Additionally, because RFECV uses recursive search, it can also find the best combination of features among many possible subsets. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets that have many features.

This article assumes that the reader has some familiarity with basic concepts of machine learning and data preprocessing. We will not go into depth about these topics but provide links where necessary to enhance the understanding of the article.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before proceeding to understand the working mechanism of RFECV, let's quickly review the key concepts related to feature selection:

1. **Relevance:** Relevance refers to the degree to which a feature contributes to the outcome variable. For example, if a feature has very little impact on the prediction of the outcome variable, then it may not be relevant. Conversely, if a feature does have a significant impact on the outcome variable, then it should be considered relevant.

2. **Redundancy:** Redundancy occurs when multiple features are correlated with each other, leading to collinearity between them. One way to eliminate redundancy is to use PCA (Principal Component Analysis), which reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and removes any unnecessary correlations.

3. **Sparsity:** Sparsity refers to the level of missing values present in a dataset. Missing value imputation methods such as mean/median imputation, mode imputation, and kNN imputation can be used to fill in missing values.

4. **Curse of Dimensionality:** As the size of a dataset increases, the space required to represent it becomes increasingly sparse due to curse of dimensionality. To avoid sparsity, a technique called feature engineering can be employed to create additional features based on existing ones.

5. **Overfitting:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen test data. To avoid overfitting, regularization techniques like L1, L2 regularization, and dropout can be employed to control the complexity of the model.

6. **Correlation:** Correlation refers to the relationship between two variables. When there is high correlation between two variables, their contribution towards the outcome variable might become similar. Hence, reducing correlation between variables can improve model performance.

# 3. Algorithmic Overview
## 3.1 Forward Selection
Forward selection starts with an empty set of features, and adds one feature at a time that provides the best improvement in terms of a metric (such as cross-validation score). At each iteration, the algorithm calculates the improvement in CV score for adding each new feature to the current set, and selects the feature that leads to the highest improvement. The algorithm continues to select more features in this manner until either a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of iterations is reached) or all available features have been added without achieving a significant improvement in CV score. Once the forward selection step is complete, the final set of selected features represents the best subset of relevance.

## 3.2 Recursive Elimination
Once the forward selection step is complete, the backward elimination phase begins. The algorithm works by removing the least relevant feature from the list of selected features at each iteration. At each iteration, the algorithm measures the decrease in CV score caused by removing each remaining feature, and removes the feature that causes the smallest reduction in CV score. If removing a particular feature results in a degradation in CV score only marginally lower than the baseline score, then it is discarded along with those features that were subsequently added during forward selection. This ensures that the final set of selected features contains only truly relevant features. Finally, the algorithm returns the final set of selected features as the optimal subset.
