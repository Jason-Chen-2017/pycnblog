Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. One of the most commonly used kernel functions in SVM is the radial basis function (RBF) kernel which can be thought of as a similarity measure between points that considers their proximity on a hyperplane. In this article, we will learn how to build an SVM classifier using scikit-learn library in Python with cross validation and ROC curves. We will also use various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score and AUC-ROC curve to evaluate our model's performance. 

Before moving forward with building an SVM classifier, let’s understand some important concepts such as what is Support Vector Machine? What is Radial Basis Function Kernel? Why do we use it in support vector machine algorithms? And why should we choose SVM over other popular models like logistic regression or decision trees? Let us try to answer these questions one by one. 

## What Is SVM?
Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. They work by finding the optimal separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes. This hyperplane then separates the data into two regions where each class is represented by a set of hyperplanes. The goal is to find the best possible line/hyperplane that defines the boundary between different classes while ensuring as many training examples as possible are included within the margins. Therefore, SVM is considered a powerful tool for binary classification problems where there are only two target labels. However, they can also be used for multi-class classification tasks when there are more than two output variables. 

In simple terms, an SVM creates a hyperplane in n-dimensional space that separates two classes of data points in the best way possible. It does so by transforming the original feature space into a higher dimensional space where it becomes easier to separate the classes using non-linear transformations. Each observation from the input dataset is assigned to either the positive or negative side of the hyperplane based on its distance from the origin. The observations closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors, because if any of them fall outside of the margin width, they would have no chance of being correctly classified even though they lie on the correct side of the hyperplane.


## How Does SVM Work?
Let’s now look at how SVM works under the hood. The fundamental idea behind SVM is to find the maximum margin separator, i.e., the hyperplane that maximizes the minimum distance between the nearest points to the hyperplane. To achieve this objective, SVM introduces a new parameter called "slack" which allows the points to breach the hyperplane beyond their current separation. Intuitively, slack represents the amount of freedom allowed for the misclassified samples to live inside the margin of the hyperplane without getting excluded due to the hard margin constraint. For example, consider a point x that has been incorrectly classified as belonging to the positive class but lies just outside the margin. By adding the slack parameter, SVM encourages the algorithm to still allow this point to stay within the margin, although it may deviate slightly away from its true label.

The optimization problem in SVM involves selecting the value of the hyperplane that minimizes the error rate, subject to certain constraints. Firstly, we need to define a loss function that measures the deviation of the predicted values from the actual values. Common choices include L1-norm penalty and L2-norm penalty. The key difference between the two is that L1 norm penalizes large weights whereas L2 norm penalizes large gradients. Based on this choice, we minimize a quadratic programming problem to find the optimal hyperplane. The constraints in the optimization problem include bounding the size of the margin, forcing all instances to be located within the boundaries of the feature space, and allowing for errors up to the specified tolerance level. Once the solution is obtained, we can classify unseen test data using the learned hyperplane.

## Which Kernel Should I Use?
Radial basis function (RBF) kernel is commonly used in SVM algorithms. It is defined as:

K(x, y) = exp(-gamma ||x - y||^2),

where gamma is a free parameter that controls the degree of smoothness of the decision surface. If gamma is very small, then the decision surface will not have much flexibility and vice versa. Other commonly used kernels are linear, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels. Linear kernel simply computes the dot product between the input features. Polynomial kernel adds powers of the inputs before taking the dot product. Sigmoid kernel transforms the input into probability distribution and applies logarithmic odds transformation to convert it into likelihood ratio.

Therefore, choosing the right kernel function depends on the structure of your data and whether you want to approximate nonlinear relationships or exploit additional structure in the data. Choosing the wrong kernel function might lead to poor performance or incorrect results.

## When Should I Choose SVM Over Logistic Regression or Decision Trees?
When should we use SVM instead of logistic regression or decision trees? There are several reasons why SVM outperforms both methods:

1. SVM can handle high-dimensional datasets easily, making it ideal for complex data sets where linear classifiers often fail.
2. SVM provides probabilistic outputs, which can be useful for anomaly detection and imbalanced data problems.
3. SVM is robust to noise and outliers, whereas logistic regression and decision trees are less sensitive to these types of variations.
4. SVM can produce sparse solutions, which makes it computationally efficient for large datasets. Also, since SVM uses an optimization technique that guarantees globally optimal solutions, it tends to generalize better than those found by random forests or gradient boosted trees.

So, depending on the specific requirements of your project, you should decide whether SVM is a suitable alternative to logistic regression or decision trees.
