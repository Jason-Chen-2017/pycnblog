The ability of machines to automatically interpret and diagnose medical images is crucial for clinical practice today. With the advancement in technology and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning, there has been significant progress towards automated diagnosis using CT scans. However, it remains a challenge to identify informative biomarkers that are specific to a certain disease or pathology. To address this need, we propose an approach called ‘connecting pathology to AI’ to integrate pathologist expertise with AI algorithms for more accurate interpretation of biological features encoded in CT scans. We use a publicly available dataset consisting of CT scan images annotated with patient-reported outcomes associated with different diseases. By combining information from both domains, our approach can provide a powerful tool for integrating diverse perspectives and knowledge into the diagnostic process. In this work, we present an overview of the proposed method and highlight its strengths and limitations. 

In summary, we propose a novel method for integrating expertise from various disciplines such as medicine, computer science, mathematics, engineering, neuroscience, and linguistics to develop effective algorithms for automated diagnosis of patients based on their CT scans. Our approach uses data annotation from pathologists and machine learning models developed by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Stanford University. The combination of these sources can improve the accuracy of automatic diagnosis while also enabling us to extract new insights about specific features that contribute to disease progression over time. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations involved in applying this approach, including potential risks and benefits to patients and healthcare organizations.

Our key contributions include:

1. Integration of expertise across different fields such as medicine, computer science, and biology leads to better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the abnormalities observed in CT scans. This leads to improved accuracy in the detection of informative biomarkers that are specifically related to a particular disease. 

2. Data from multiple sources enables us to obtain large-scale datasets that contain complex relationships between variables such as image content, demographics, pathological findings, and treatment outcomes. Combining this information with modern machine learning algorithms provides insights into the mechanisms responsible for the abnormality patterns seen in CT scans, leading to a deeper understanding of how the body responds to these changes.

3. The implementation of our system requires advanced technical skills, including training high-performance neural networks and implementing efficient computational methods. However, our proposal offers scalable solutions that could be used widely within the field of medical imaging analysis.

4. Using human experts to annotate and evaluate medical data poses unique challenges in terms of bias, reliability, and trustworthiness. However, our approach seeks to mitigate these concerns through careful design choices and thorough evaluation procedures before deploying any algorithmic systems.

5. Ethical considerations must also be taken into account when applying machine learning approaches to medical imaging data, as errors may result in harm to individuals or societies. Proposed methods should not only focus on improving the accuracy of predictions but also minimize negative consequences for affected individuals. Thus, ensuring proper governance and ethics guidelines are established is essential to ensure safe and responsible use of AI tools in medical imaging analysis.

Pathology: The study of disease processes such as symptoms, signs, and causes using scientific principles and techniques. Pathologists apply the scientific methods to study diseases by examining the cells, tissues, organs, and fluids within the body. They typically perform tests such as serum analyses, cell culture experiments, and specialized x-rays and MRI to reveal abnormalities and diseases.

AI: Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of intelligent behavior in machines. It involves developing software programs that mimic human cognitive abilities and learn from experience to make decisions or predictions. Machine learning is one branch of AI wherein computers learn by example to improve performance on tasks. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes Neural Networks for image recognition and natural language processing. 

Deep Learning Algorithms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). These algorithms are used for analyzing and extracting features from medical images. CNN is mainly used for image classification problems, LSTM is often applied for sequential data like text and speech, RNN helps in capturing temporal dependencies in sequences, and GRU is suitable for applications involving long-term dependencies. 

Biomarker: A quantitative measurement obtained from a sample of tissue or cells that indicates some characteristic or indicator of the disease being studied. Biomarkers usually measure various levels of expression, signal transduction, metabolism, genetics, and physical properties of the target organ or tissue.

## 3.1.Dataset

We have collected two datasets - CHEXPERT and COVIDx, both having large-scale medical imaging data annotated with patient reports of COVID-19 cases alongside demographic information and radiological findings. 

CHEXPERT Dataset contains chest X-ray images taken during routine screening for several diseases ranging from Cardiomegaly to Pneumonia. Each image is labeled with a radiological finding indicating presence or absence of a particular disease (e.g., pneumonia, emphysema, pleural effusion, etc.) according to the American College of Radiology's Disease Definitions and Standards. It consists of 20,164 images and 10 classes. 

COVIDx Dataset includes 480 chest X-ray images representing three common types of COVID-19 infected lungs (Lung Opacity, Lung Lesion, and Pleural Effusion), corresponding to ten normal controls without disease. All images are preprocessed to remove noise, lighting variations, and artifacts, and then segmented into individual lesions for easier model construction. Additionally, annotations include viral pneumonia severity grade score ranges and patient age range groups. It consists of 504 images and four attributes.
