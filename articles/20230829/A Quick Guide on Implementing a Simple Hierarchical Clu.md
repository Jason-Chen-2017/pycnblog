# 1.简介
  

Hierarchical clustering is an important part of data analysis in machine learning and statistics. It involves the construction of hierarchies or clusters of similar objects based on their proximity to each other. This means that elements belonging to different clusters are less likely to be separated from one another than those members of the same cluster.

In this article, we will implement a simple version of hierarchical clustering using Python's scikit-learn library. We'll also cover some basic concepts such as distance measures, linkage criteria, and dendrogram visualization techniques. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before implementing any algorithm, let's understand some basic terms and concepts related to hierarchical clustering:

1. Distance Measure: In order to measure how far apart two objects are, there are various distance metrics that can be used, including Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, etc. For simplicity purposes, we'll use the Euclidean distance metric here. 

2. Linkage Criteria: These determine which objects should be grouped into the same cluster when constructing the hierarchy. The most common linkage criteria include single, complete, average, centroid, and median linkage. Single linkage groups all pairs of items with a minimum similarity value into the same group, while complete linkage does the opposite - it merges every pair of items with maximum similarity values. Average linkage uses the arithmetic mean of the distances between each object's pairwise distances to form a new distance for that node in the tree. Centroid linkage takes the geometric center of all points in each cluster and calculates the euclidean distance between them. Median linkage selects the median point in each cluster and calculates its distance to the other points in the cluster. 

3. Dendrogram Visualization Techniques: Once the hierarchical clustering has been performed, we need to visualize the results in a way that helps us interpret the structure of our dataset. There are several ways to do so, including heatmaps, histograms, and dendrograms. A dendrogram shows the relationship between individual objects and their corresponding clusters at each level of the hierarchy. Each vertical branch represents a merged pair of clusters, where the height of the branches indicates the degree of separation between the clusters.

Now let's move onto the implementation!

## 3.1 Overview
The first step in performing hierarchical clustering is to calculate the distance between each pair of points in our dataset. Here, we will use the standard Euclidean distance metric. After calculating the pairwise distances, we perform the agglomerative clustering process by combining pairs of points according to a predefined criterion. Finally, we construct a dendrogram showing the relationships between the original points and the resulting clusters.

Here is a high-level overview of the steps involved in hierarchical clustering:

1. Calculate Pairwise Distances: Compute the distance between each pair of points in our dataset using the Euclidean distance metric.
2. Initialize Tree: Start building a binary tree (or possibly a k-ary tree) where each leaf node corresponds to a unique point in the dataset. Assign each point to its own separate cluster initially.
3. Iteratively Merge Points: Starting from the bottom of the tree (i.e., the leaves), repeatedly select the two closest points, compute their distance using the pre-computed distances matrix, and combine them according to the specified linkage criterion until all nodes have been combined into larger clusters. Stop when no more possible combinations exist within the current set of clusters.
4. Construct Dendrogram: Create a figure showing the arrangement of the resulting clusters in a manner that reflects their interrelation with each other. The height of each vertical branch in the dendrogram indicates the degree of separation between the corresponding clusters.

## 3.2 Example Dataset
For demonstration purposes, let's assume we have the following example dataset consisting of four points: 
```python
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 2], [7, 9]])
print(X)
```
Output: 
```
[[1 2]
 [2 3]
 [3 2]
 [7 9]]
```

Each row represents a distinct observation, i.e., a point in the dataset. Let's plot these points using matplotlib to get a visual representation of the dataset.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()
```


As you can see, these points are not clearly separable into distinct clusters based solely on their features. However, if we try to apply traditional clustering algorithms like K-means or DBSCAN, they would probably produce unsatisfactory results because they require prior knowledge about the underlying distribution shape of the data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical clustering, let's proceed to implement our simple version of hierarchical clustering using Python's scikit-learn library.
