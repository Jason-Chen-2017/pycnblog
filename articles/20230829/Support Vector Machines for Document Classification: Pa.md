Support vector machines (SVMs) are powerful tools used in many applications such as image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics. In this post, we will review the soft margin method which is an extension to traditional SVM approaches. We will also talk about non-linearly separable problems that may arise when dealing with high-dimensional data. Finally, we will explore how regularization can be applied in order to avoid overfitting.
# 2. 软间隔(Soft Margin)方法
## 2.1 概念
In traditional SVM methods, there exists a hyperplane separating two classes of points in the feature space. The goal of training a SVM model is to find such a hyperplane that maximizes the distance between its support vectors and the decision boundary. However, if some of the instances belonging to one class lie far away from the other, they might end up being misclassified due to their proximity to the decision boundary. To address this issue, researchers proposed the soft margin approach where a hypersphere is used instead of a hyperplane to represent the separation between the classes. The width of the sphere controls the amount of overlap allowed between different classes. The soft margin algorithm solves the optimization problem of finding the optimal solution to both hard and soft margin constraints by using a penalty term that depends on the degree of violation of the constraints.
The soft margin allows instances to have some flexibility while still ensuring the desired level of separability between the classes. It has several advantages compared to the hard margin method:
* If all the samples belong to only one class or another, then it performs better than the hard margin classifier because it does not require any slack variables.
* Soft margin models do not assume that all the features are equally important for classification purposes. For example, if we have multiple features that are useful in distinguishing between classes, we can assign higher weights to those features during training. This improves the performance of the model.
* As mentioned earlier, the soft margin enables us to handle cases where some samples are very close to the decision boundary. Hence, it can perform well even when there are a large number of irrelevant features in our dataset.
However, this comes at the cost of increased complexity compared to the hard margin approach.
## 2.2 损失函数公式
For binary classification problems, the soft margin loss function is given by:

L = −[∑_{i=1}^{N} max(0, γ+y_i(w·x_i)+β(1−y_i)(w·x_i)) + ∇_w ||w||^2]
where N is the number of instances, γ is the upper bound on the margin size, y_i is either 1 or -1 indicating whether instance i belongs to the positive or negative class, w is the weight vector, x_i is the feature vector of instance i, and β>0 is the trade-off parameter between hard and soft margin penalties. 

For multi-class classification problems, we need to introduce additional parameters to account for each possible label. Let m be the number of classes. Each class is represented by a specific weight vector w_m. The objective function becomes:

L = −[∑_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^my_j^{(i)}[\max(0,(γ+θ_j)+β(1−θ_j))] + \sum_{m=1}^Mw_m^T||w_m||^2]
where y_j^{(i)} is the probability assigned to class j by instance i, θ_j is the score obtained by adding the corresponding weight vector to the weighted sum of input features, and γ is again the margin threshold. Here, the second sum includes a regularization term that encourages the weights to stay small so as to prevent overfitting.

## 2.3 拉格朗日对偶问题
To solve the above formulations, we first derive the Lagrangian dual function which gives the minimizing solution to the primal optimization problem. Once we obtain the Lagrangian dual, we use various techniques like gradient descent to minimize it. Since computing the Lagrangian dual directly can be computationally expensive, most modern algorithms rely on approximations. One popular approximation technique is the augmented Lagrangian method. The basic idea behind this method is to add artificial variables and constraints to the original optimization problem and transform them into simpler problems whose solutions can be easily computed. Specifically, let z=(z^(1),...,z^(n)), α=(α^(1),...,α^(n)), b≥0, κ>=0 be the new variables introduced. Then the transformed problem can be written as:

min_w \sum_{i=1}^{N}[max(0,\gamma+b+θ_i(w·x_i))]+\lambda\|\|w\|\|²_2+\frac{\rho}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^m(z_i^{j}-\alpha_j)^2-\eta KKT(w,b,\xi,\nu)\qquad s.t.\quad ∑_{i=1}^{N}α_jy_i=\delta,\forall j\in\{1,...,m\},\quad 0\leq α_j\leq c_j,c_j≥0\quad kkt(w,b,\xi,\nu)=\begin{bmatrix}
W&X\\
0&Z
\end{bmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
v_k \\
u_k
\end{pmatrix}=0,\qquad \forall k\in\{1,...,m\}\quad v_k\geq 0,\quad u_k\geq 0

Here, W, X are matrices containing the gradients of the Lagrangian relative to the model parameters w and b respectively; Z contains the gradients of the Lagrangian relative to the lagrange multipliers xi and nu; η>0 is a penalty parameter for deviation from the feasible region; κ>0 determines the smoothness of the relaxation. By introducing these new variables and constraints, the problem becomes easier to solve numerically since it requires fewer unknowns.

Once we have solved the augmented Lagrangian, we can recover the original set of variables and extract the optimized values of the parameters involved in the optimization process. Note that the objective value reported by the augmented Lagrangian may differ slightly from the actual optimum found, especially for ill-posed problems. However, we typically expect the differences to be minor and comparable to numerical errors.
