# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. In this article we will implement an SVM model using the scikit-learn library in Python to perform supervised regression on a dataset of real estate prices from Ames, Iowa. We will cover key concepts such as support vector machines, regularization techniques, and kernel functions. 

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Support vector machines are a class of supervised machine learning algorithms which seek to find a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space where the data points are divided into two classes with clear boundaries. These hyperplanes are called decision boundaries or margins. The goal of the SVM algorithm is to find the best possible hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes while also ensuring that there are enough samples from each class so that they do not overlap too much. An optimal hyperplane is chosen by solving a quadratic optimization problem known as the primal SVM objective function.

The distance between the closest point to the decision boundary and the hyperplane itself is known as margin. If all the training examples lie on one side of the margin, then the prediction of new unseen data instances may be poor due to overfitting. This leads us to consider regularization techniques that penalize complex models instead of simply minimizing their error. Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that corresponds to complexity of the model. The higher the value of the regularization parameter, the more aggressive the regularization becomes. Therefore, it is important to fine-tune the parameters of the SVM model to optimize its performance.

## Kernel Functions
Kernel functions are mathematical transformations that allow us to use non-linear decision boundaries in SVMs without explicitly creating them. The most popular kernel functions used in SVMs are radial basis functions (RBF), polynomial kernels, and sigmoid functions. RBF functions usually work well when the input features have varying ranges and are highly nonlinear. Polynomial functions map the inputs directly to the outputs, but suffer from the curse of dimensionality when dealing with large number of features. Sigmoid functions take values between 0 and 1 depending on the dot product of the inputs and weights, and can handle both linear and non-linear relationships.

A commonly used technique in SVMs is the use of kernel functions to transform the original feature space into a higher dimensional space where it is easier to apply standard SVM algorithms. One way to achieve this is by using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. Another option is to create custom kernel functions that learn the relationship between the input features and output labels based on the training data.

## Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques aim to prevent overfitting in SVM models by adding a penalty term to the cost function that depends on the magnitude of the model's coefficients. Two common types of regularization are L1 and L2 regularization, which add absolute and square of the coefficients respectively to the cost function. Both approaches encourage sparsity in the learned coefficients, meaning that only few of them are nonzero. The strength of the regularization depends on the tradeoff between generalization and simplicity of the model. For example, L2 regularization often provides better accuracy at the expense of interpretability, whereas L1 regularization allows simpler models to be trained faster while still achieving good predictive performance. Other regularization techniques include elastic net and group lasso that control the amount of shrinkage applied to individual coefficients.

In summary, SVMs represent a powerful tool for building accurate predictive models for both regression and classification problems. They require careful tuning of their hyperparameters to ensure proper performance across various datasets and conditions. Understanding how to apply kernel functions and choose the right regularization technique is essential in effectively using these tools.

# 3.Implementation
To implement an SVM model using Python, we need to follow these steps:
1. Import required libraries
2. Load and preprocess the data
3. Split the data into train and test sets
4. Build the SVM model
5. Train the SVM model
6. Test the SVM model

Let’s start implementing step by step. 

### Step 1 - Import Required Libraries 
We first need to import the necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn. We can install these packages using pip command if needed. 

``` python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVR
```

### Step 2 - Loading and Preprocessing Data 
Next, let’s load and preprocess the data by cleaning missing values and handling categorical variables. We can use pandas dataframe to read the csv file containing the dataset. Let’s check the head of the dataframe to see what columns are present and what kind of data is stored in those columns.  

``` python
data = pd.read_csv('houseprices.csv') #load house price dataset
print(data.head())
```

Output:  

As we can observe, the dataframe contains several columns including 'Id', 'MSSubClass', 'MSZoning', 'LotFrontage', etc., along with numerical attributes like 'SalePrice'. However, some of these attributes are categorical, so we need to convert them into numeric form before proceeding further. We can encode the categorical variables using LabelEncoder() method provided by Sklearn library. 

``` python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
encoder=LabelEncoder()
categorical=['MSSubClass','MSZoning','Street','Alley','LandContour','Utilities','LotConfig','Neighborhood','Condition1','BldgType','HouseStyle','OverallQual','OverallCond','RoofMatl','Exterior1st','Exterior2nd','MasVnrType','Foundation','Heating','CentralAir','Electrical','Functional','GarageType','GarageFinish','PavedDrive','SaleType','SaleCondition']
for var in categorical:
    data[var]=encoder.fit_transform(data[var])
```

After encoding the categorical variables, let’s drop the Id column since it has no significance towards our analysis. Also, we don't want to use the SalePrice variable as a predictor variable, so we remove it from X axis and store it separately in y axis. 

``` python
X=data.drop(['Id','SalePrice'],axis=1)
y=data['SalePrice'].values
```

### Step 3 - Splitting the Dataset 
Now, let’s split the dataset into training and testing set using Scikit Learn's train_test_split(). We will reserve 20% of the data for testing purpose. 

``` python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 4 - Building the Model 
We can now build our SVM model using the SVR() method from the Scikit Learn library. Here, we can specify the kernel function to use, whether to use regularization or not, and other relevant parameters such as epsilon, C, gamma, and degree. For demonstration purposes, we'll use the default values. 

``` python
regressor = SVR(kernel='rbf') #using rbf kernel function
```

### Step 5 - Training the Model 
Now, let’s fit the regressor object on the training data using the.fit() method. 

``` python
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6 - Testing the Model 
Finally, let’s evaluate the performance of the model on the test data using the.score() method. It returns the coefficient of determination R^2 of the prediction. Higher the R^2 score indicates better fit of the data. 

``` python
score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Score:", score)
```

### Summary 
Here is the complete implementation of SVM Regression using Python:
