# 1.简介
         
Concurrent programming is an important aspect of modern software development that involves dealing with multiple tasks or operations at the same time. With a solid understanding of asynchronous programming and its core concepts, we can build powerful applications that scale efficiently and handle complex situations gracefully. However, even with expertise in this area, it can still be challenging to write clean, readable code using JavaScript's built-in async capabilities. 

In this article, we will cover two primary areas of concurrent programming - promises and async/await syntaxes. We will start by defining the basic ideas behind both constructs and exploring their differences and similarities. Then we will learn how these tools work within the context of building web applications and discuss some best practices for writing cleaner code. Finally, we'll see where these technologies are going next, including new features like iterators and generators, and how they might fit into future design patterns and architectures.

By the end of the article, you should have a strong grasp on JavaScript's asynchronous functionality and mastered the basics of promise chaining and composition as well as async/await syntax. You should also understand why and when each approach is appropriate, and know how to use them effectively in your projects. If you're ready, let's get started! 

# 2.Promises and Asynchronous Functions
A Promise represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and provides a way to access its result. It is created using the `Promise` constructor function and can be either resolved or rejected based on whether the operation completed successfully or not. Once a promise has been settled (i.e., fulfilled or rejected), it cannot be changed further. 

Async functions are high-level ways of creating promises using the `async` keyword. They allow us to declare an asynchronous function using the `await` keyword, which pauses execution until the awaitable expression before it completes. The value returned by such expressions becomes the argument passed to the `resolve()` method of the resulting promise object.

Here's an example of what an async function looks like:

```javascript
async function fetchUser(userId) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
  return response.json();
}

// Calling the function returns a promise
const userPromise = fetchUser('abcd');
console.log(userPromise); // [object Promise]
```

In this case, the `fetchUser` function sends a GET request to a URL endpoint and waits for the server to respond with data before continuing execution. Once the data is received, the JSON content is parsed and returned as the result of the promise. 

# 3.Chaining Promises
When working with multiple promises, we often need to perform sequential actions on their results. One common pattern is to chain them one after another, passing the result from one promise to the next. For instance, suppose we want to fetch a list of users and then display their names once they've all arrived. Here's how we can do it using promises:

```javascript
function getUserNames() {
  const userIdList = ['abcd', 'efgh'];
  
  // Use Promise.all to wait for all requests to complete
  return Promise.all(userIdList.map(id => 
    fetchUser(id).then(response => response.name))
  ).then(names => console.log(names));
}
```

This code fetches a list of user IDs and uses `Promise.all` to create a single promise that resolves only once all requests have finished. Each individual request is represented by a call to `fetchUser`, which itself returns a promise that resolves with the name property of the JSON response. This array of values is passed to the `.then()` method, which logs the final list of usernames to the console.

Note that the `getUserNames` function does not directly manipulate the promises themselves; instead, it relies on `Promise.all` to manage the overall process. Also note that if any of the API calls fail or timeout, `Promise.all` will reject the entire chain and pass the error back through the chain. To handle errors more gracefully, we could add additional error handling logic inside the `.catch()` block associated with each individual `fetchUser` call.
