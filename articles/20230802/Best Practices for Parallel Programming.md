         # 2.基本概念术语说明
          本节先简单介绍一下相关的术语和定义。
          2.1 概念
           1) 数据并行（Data parallelism）：一个任务可以被划分为多个子任务，每个子任务独立地执行其中的一部分输入数据，然后再把结果汇总起来。一般来说，数据并行任务更容易被有效地并行化，因为子任务之间没有依赖关系。例如，在图像处理、文本处理、机器学习、计算机视觉、并行信号处理等领域都是数据并行的应用场景。

           2) 任务并行（Task parallelism）：任务并行是指把一个大任务拆分成几个小任务，每个小任务独立地运行，并且共享大任务的所有输入输出数据。这种方法能够提升计算任务的效率，特别是在大型机、集群、云计算平台上。例如，在大规模图形渲染领域，某些阶段可以进行任务并行。

           3) 指令级并行（Instruction level parallelism）：指令级并行是一种硬件加速技术，它可以在单线程的基础上并行处理指令。指令级并行利用现代计算机的特殊功能来有效地运行指令。在一些底层的操作系统中，指令集核可以并行处理多条指令，从而达到指令级别的并行。例如，Intel的Threading Building Blocks库就提供了基于线程的并行模式。

           4) 向量化（Vectorization）：向量化是一种编程技术，它把连续的数据结构或者数组元素变换为矢量形式，从而使得数据运算更高效。在传统的循环结构中，每一次迭代只能处理单个元素，如果采用矢量化技术，就可以处理多个元素，并达到相同的结果。例如，在NVIDIA的CUDA编程语言中，可以使用向量化技术优化程序的计算性能。

          2.2 术语
            1) SIMD（Single instruction multiple data）：在单条指令下操作多个数据称为SIMD（单指令流多数据）。例如，一条向量指令同时操作多个浮点数或者整数。

            2) SWAR（Single-wide word atomics）：SWAR是一种特殊类型的SIMD指令，它可以执行单个存储器操作，并且对一个对象的不同成员同时操作。例如，ARMv8.1引入了六步加载(load-acquire/store-release)指令，用于支持单宽字原子操作。

            3) MISD（Multiple instruction single data）：MISD是一种特殊的SIMD指令，它可同时执行多个指令，但是只操作单个数据。例如，PowerPC 970架构下的Altivec指令集。

            4) VLIW （Very long instruction word）：VLIW是一种CPU体系结构，它将指令集划分为多个连续的小块，称为微指令（microinstruction），从而实现超长指令字。在超长指令字中，不同类型的指令混合使用，既可以减少时延，又可以提高处理器的利用率。例如，Apple A10 Bionic Chip。

            5) SPMD（Synchronous parallel programming model）：SPMD表示同步并行编程模型。即所有处理器参与同一计算任务的执行，每个处理器都必须等待其他处理器完成自己的任务之后才开始执行。通常情况下，SPMD需要编写串行代码，并且通过MPI等消息传递接口进行通信。例如，OpenMP、MPI等标准库。

          # 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
          In this section, we will cover the basic concepts and algorithms related to parallel programming, including: Task scheduling, synchronization, communication patterns, load balancing, reduction operations and optimization techniques. We also discuss some typical challenges in developing parallel programs, such as deadlocks, race conditions, livelock, and performance bottlenecks. Finally, we will provide a detailed overview of popular parallel libraries and frameworks available in modern high-performance computing systems.
          # 3.1 Data Partitioning
          One of the most important tasks when implementing parallel programs is partitioning the input data into smaller chunks that can be processed independently by different threads or processes. This process involves both the splitting of the entire dataset (input) and the distribution of these partitions across all processors (compute nodes). There are several strategies for data partitioning depending on the nature of the problem being solved, but one common approach is to divide the input data into equal parts across all processors, which leads to efficient use of each processor's resources. However, other approaches may be more suitable in certain scenarios where there is significant data imbalance between processors. 

          For example, if the problem requires processing an image, it could make sense to partition the rows of the image instead of columns. If the program needs to compute the sum of elements in an array, it might make more sense to split the array into contiguous subarrays that can be processed independently by each thread.

          It's important to note that different partitionings can have significant impacts on performance, so it's crucial to choose the optimal partitioning strategy based on the specific algorithm and hardware architecture used.
          # 3.2 Task Scheduling
          Another critical aspect of parallel programming is task scheduling. The scheduler determines how work units should be assigned to individual processors or threads within the system, and what order they should execute in. There are many ways to schedule tasks in a parallel system, ranging from simple round-robin schedulers to complex algorithms that optimize for locality or performance. Depending on the type of application being executed, various scheduling policies can lead to better utilization of resources and improved efficiency. For example, task scheduling can help ensure that I/O requests do not block computationally intensive tasks, leading to higher throughput rates.

          As mentioned earlier, task scheduling can become even more complicated when dealing with distributed or cloud-based systems, where tasks must typically move among heterogeneous compute nodes and network connections. Moreover, the behavior of the scheduler can greatly affect application performance and scalability, so careful consideration should be given to the appropriate scheduling policy.
          # 3.3 Synchronization
          Often times, parallel applications require coordination between different processors or threads. Without proper synchronization, the results of concurrent execution may be incorrect or inconsistent. Therefore, it's essential to carefully design the structure and implementation of your parallel program to avoid potential race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks.

          When designing synchronization mechanisms, it's important to keep in mind the following principles:

          1) Avoid unnecessary synchronization: Overly fine-grained synchronization can cause contention and decrease performance.

          2) Use lightweight synchronization primitives: Favor simpler constructs like locks over expensive wait functions.

          3) Prefer sequential consistency over linearizability: Sequential consistency ensures that memory access always happens in program order, while linearizability ensures that every operation takes effect instantaneously once globally ordered. Linearizability is generally slower than sequential consistency due to overhead, whereas sequential consistency offers much lower latency guarantees.

          4) Use notification rather than busy waiting: Busy waiting wastes CPU cycles without accomplishing anything useful, whereas notifications allow other components to proceed unhindered until the condition has been met.
          
          To prevent excessive locking, it's often helpful to adopt a lock striping scheme, where adjacent processors share a lock to reduce contention. Additionally, researchers have developed advanced techniques for detecting and handling data races, including atomic transactions, compare-and-swap, snapshot isolation, and optimistic concurrency control.
          # 3.4 Communication Patterns
          Communication is another key component of parallel programming, especially in large-scale systems where tasks need to exchange data with remote processors. Broadly speaking, there are two main types of communication patterns: point-to-point (or peer-to-peer) and collective. Point-to-point communication refers to sending messages directly between pairs of communicating processes, whereas collective communication involves aggregating information from multiple sources and distributing it to multiple destinations at once. Collectives typically involve a group leader or manager who coordinates the activities of the workers participating in the collective.

          In practice, it's common to implement different communication patterns using dedicated library functions or message passing interfaces (e.g., MPI), which abstract away underlying communication protocols and handle error checking and message delivery. Most commonly used collectives include broadcast, scatter/gather, gather, and reduce. Collectives enable efficient communication of small amounts of data between groups of processes, which can be advantageous in situations where there is significant intra-node communication required. However, frequent use of collectives can significantly increase inter-node communication costs, so it's important to balance their use with optimized implementations of non-collective communications patterns.
          # 3.5 Load Balancing
          The final major component of parallel programming is load balancing, which is the process of ensuring that workload is shared fairly among all processors or threads in the system. While load balancing can improve overall performance by minimizing idle time and achieving peak scalability, it can also introduce implicit dependencies that can slow down the progress of the program.

          Common strategies for load balancing include static assignment of work units, dynamic rebalancing, resource reservation, and automata-based scheduling. Static assignment assigns fixed numbers of work units to each processor or thread, which works well when the workload is relatively homogeneous and changes infrequently. Dynamic rebalancing adjusts the allocation of work units dynamically based on the current state of the system, making sure that all processors get enough work to complete within reasonable time constraints. Resource reservation allows users to reserve a portion of system resources for critical computations, reducing the likelihood of other tasks competing for those resources. Automata-based scheduling models the scheduler as a set of finite-state machines that determine how tasks are allocated based on its internal states, allowing for flexible and adaptive load balancing decisions.

          Overall, load balancing provides a fundamental mechanism for improving program performance by sharing computational resources fairly across the cluster or grid, but it's worth considering carefully beforehand to avoid issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and oversubscription.
          # 3.6 Reduction Operations
          Among the lesser-known features of parallel programming are reduction operations, which are operations that combine values computed by multiple processors or threads into a single value. These operations are particularly useful in scientific computing and machine learning because they can often be parallelized efficiently using vector instructions or GPU acceleration. They're often implemented using parallel prefix trees or segmented scan algorithms, which enable them to operate on arrays of arbitrary size without requiring explicit synchronization.

          While reduction operations can simplify code and speed up parallel execution, they're prone to errors and can result in deadlocks, race conditions, and unexpected behaviors. Therefore, it's essential to thoroughly test and debug any code involving reduction operations to ensure correctness and reliability.
          # 3.7 Optimization Techniques
          Despite the importance of effective parallel programming, efficient coding practices still play a crucial role in terms of achieving good performance. Here are some key tips for optimizing parallel code:

          1) Minimize communication: Parallelize where possible by avoiding unnecessary communication. Favor aggregation over communication whenever possible.
           
          2) Optimize caching: Ensure that cache lines are large enough to minimize false sharing and maximize cache hits.
           
          3) Vectorize wherever possible: Vectorization techniques such as OpenCL, CUDA, and Intel VTune profiler can dramatically improve program performance.
           
          4) Profile: Profiling tools such as Intel VTune Profiler and NVIDIA Nsight Compute can identify hotspots and opportunities for optimization.
           
          5) Tune compilation flags: Optimized compilers generate faster code, so it's essential to select the right compiler flags and settings during build time.
           
          6) Use profiling and tuning tools judiciously: Once you've identified a bottleneck or area for improvement, try to quantify and understand its impact before moving forward. Doing so can help guide further optimizations.
           
          With great power comes great responsibility, but with parallel programming becoming increasingly commonplace, it's crucial to develop a strong understanding of the fundamentals and best practices to write highly performant parallel programs.
