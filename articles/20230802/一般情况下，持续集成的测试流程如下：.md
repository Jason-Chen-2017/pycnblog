         Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that requires developers to regularly integrate their changes into a shared repository. This approach helps to detect errors quickly and ensure consistent quality across the project over time. CI can help catch bugs early in the development cycle by building the code frequently with automated tests, which ensures that new code additions do not break existing functionalities. However, implementing CI correctly can be challenging for organizations as it requires technical expertise and resources from different departments within an organization. This article will explain how continuous integration works at a high level and discuss some of its key benefits and challenges.
         
         # 2.Basic Concepts & Terminology
         
         ## Repository
         
         A central location where all versions of files are stored, typically online or on a local server. Developers commit changes they make to the codebase onto this repository before submitting them for review or merging with other branches. 
         
         ## Build
         
         The process of converting source code files written in various programming languages into executable programs. It involves compiling and linking the code, running any pre-build steps like unit testing, and generating final build artifacts such as executables, libraries, or packages.
         Each build generates an artifact that represents the output of the build pipeline. These artifacts include object files, compiled binaries, static libraries, debug symbols, and reports generated during compilation.
         
         ## Testing
         
         Automated testing refers to techniques used to validate the correctness, reliability, and efficiency of applications. In CI systems, automated testing runs automatically after every build stage to identify potential issues and regressions before deployment. Tests can cover both unit and integration levels of application functionality, including validation checks against expected input/output scenarios. Some test frameworks also generate coverage reports that show what parts of the code have been tested and which still need attention.
         
         ## Deployment
         
         Once the builds pass testing, the resulting code artifacts are deployed to production environments for end users to use. Different stages of deployment may involve manual intervention depending on the severity of the issue found during testing or other business requirements. Deployment often follows a standardized release schedule that includes automation tools for managing the deployment process.
         
         ## Feedback Loops
         
         When there are issues detected during testing, developers receive feedback immediately through the CI system. Depending on the nature of the error, the developer may need to fix it locally and submit another change for testing. Within seconds or minutes, the build and testing processes repeat themselves and the entire feedback loop begins again until the issue has been fixed and the affected code is committed back to the repository.
          
         
         ## Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment
         
         Continuous delivery is the practice of automating the creation of deployable software artefacts and deploying those artefacts directly to a target environment once they've passed through several automated testing stages. Continuous deployment extends this concept further by automatically deploying updates to production when a new version of the software is ready. Both practices aim to achieve faster time-to-market while reducing the risk of unintended consequences stemming from software deployment failures. Additionally, continuous deployment allows for easier rollback if necessary.

         ## Overview
         
         Continuous integration is a core component of modern software development methodologies. Its primary goal is to increase the speed and frequency with which code is built, tested, and released, thereby ensuring that changes do not introduce regressions or bugs. At a high level, the basic workflow of continuous integration looks something like this:

             1. Developer makes a change to the codebase
             2. Code change is checked into a version control repository
             3. Continuous integration tool triggers a build
             4. Build executes automated tests to verify the validity of the change
             5. If the tests pass, the build artifacts are published for downstream consumption
         
         During the build phase, multiple steps occur, including compiling the code, running unit tests, linting, security scanning, and performance testing. After these steps complete successfully, the build artifacts are produced and packaged together to form the final product.
         
         ## Key Benefits

           - Detecting Errors Early: By building and testing frequently, CI provides visibility into problems that may have gone undetected otherwise. Failing tests prompt developers to address the underlying issues earlier in the development lifecycle.
           - Consistency Across Teams: Since everyone involved in developing the code base shares responsibility for the same codebase, consistency is ensured across teams and leads to better collaboration.
           - Reduce Time-To-Market: Building and testing frequently reduces the amount of time between changes being submitted and fixes being rolled out, leading to shorter lead times and more frequent releases.
           - Lower Costs: Continuous integration tools allow companies to reduce costs associated with testing manually or using ad-hoc testing methods.
           - Improved Quality Control: Continuous integration helps improve overall quality by integrating testing throughout the development lifecycle.
           
         ## Challenges

           - Complexity: Implementing CI properly can require advanced knowledge of many different technologies and platforms, making it difficult to set up initially. Companies must invest significant effort in establishing best practices and infrastructure to enable CI effectively.
           - Overhead: Running full-scale automated tests continuously can be resource-intensive, requiring dedicated hardware and bandwidth. Sites may need to carefully manage their use of resources to optimize utilization without compromising quality.
           - Human Error: Because humans are the main cause of errors in complex software projects, continuous integration tools should be designed to minimize mistakes made by developers. Failure to enforce proper etiquette and discipline can result in problematic behavior and damage to morale among team members.

         
         ## How Does Continuous Integration Work?

         1. Git commits trigger an event that starts a build
         
             Push events to the remote repository initiate a build. When a push occurs, the Git hook configured in the Continuous Integration (CI) system sends a request to the API endpoint exposed by the CI service to start a new build. The build agent fetches the latest source code from the repository and performs the following actions:
             
             1. Pulls down the most recent version of the code
             2. Performs a clean checkout
             3. Runs any build scripts or commands defined in the configuration file
             4. Builds the code into an artifact bundle
             5. Uploads the build artifact bundle to the artifact storage area, either locally or remotely.
               
         2. Artifact Bundle Generated by Build

             Once the build completes, the build script produces a single artifact bundle containing the compiled code along with metadata about the build itself, such as the version number, git revision hash, timestamp, and other information. The build artifact is then uploaded to the artifact storage area designated by the CI system.
             
         3. Downstream Consumption of Artifact

             As part of the continuous delivery or deployment pipeline, the build artifact can now be consumed by other services or systems, such as testing, staging, or production deployments. Typically, the CI system defines a specific format or structure for the build artifact so that it can be easily identified and processed by the next stage of the pipeline. For example, an iOS app might consist of an IPA package that contains the compiled binary and assets. The build artifact is typically extracted, signed, and delivered via a secure channel to the relevant environment for deployment.
         
         4. Reporting Results

             Continuous integration systems produce detailed reports on the success or failure of each build. These reports can be viewed by developers and stakeholders to monitor the status of the codebase over time, identify trends, and prevent regressions from creeping in. Continuous integration tools also provide notifications to alert developers when critical issues arise, allowing them to take appropriate action to resolve the issue swiftly.
