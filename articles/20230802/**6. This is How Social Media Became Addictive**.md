         # 2.基本概念和术语说明
         ## 2.1. Social Media
         ### 2.1.1. Definition
         Social media refers to any online platform where users can share information and interact with each other. It encompasses various services such as blogs, forums, social networking sites (such as Facebook), microblogs, video sharing platforms, etc., that allow users to communicate, make friends, and express themselves in a digital environment. The emergence of the Internet has revolutionized communication and mobilization of human beings by connecting people from different backgrounds, cultures, and countries together over the internet. The increasing use of social media leads to an explosion of personal and business data that are accessed and analyzed every day.

         ## 2.2. Adoption Rate
         In recent years, there have been several research papers on how adults adopt new technology into their lives. One of them is known as “The Adoption of Technology: Why People Turn Back” published in 2016 by Kaneki Labs. According to this study, technological adoption occurs mostly through positive messages or actions supported by societal norms such as support groups, social networks, education programs, and mentorship programs. Despite these efforts, fewer than one-third of adults successfully switch devices within four months after receiving notice of a new feature release.

         ## 2.3. Age Differences
         Younger generations appear to suffer more from addiction than older generations due to socioeconomic factors like higher income, access to better healthcare, lower risks of job loss, etc. Slightly younger generations may find it difficult to resist using social media, while older generations may become excessively dependent on it. Older individuals tend to possess greater professional knowledge and expertise, which makes them attracted to advanced technologies. However, they also face lesser resources and financial security, making them vulnerable to cyber-attacks and threats. Consequently, it becomes essential for governments and organizations to take preventative measures to protect against cyber-bullying and harassment through social media.

         ## 2.4. Social Features
         A person’s behavior on social media often reflects his/her social features including openness, emotional range, perceived control, trustworthiness, intimacy, empathy, competence, authenticity, leadership qualities, charisma, self-esteem, interpersonal skills, etc. These features have different impacts on whether someone develops addictions to social media. For example, some who demonstrate high levels of empathy towards others might be prone to develop addictions related to disliking comments, unwillingness to discuss sensitive topics, anxiety about negative interactions, etc. Others who exhibit low levels of trustworthiness might be prone to seek attention, gain approval, and maintain confidentiality.

          ## 2.5. Types of Addiction
         There are multiple types of addiction to social media. Some common ones include peer pressure, digital detox, snooze walkers, spreading misinformation, sharing dark patterns, cyberbullying, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Peer pressure involves feeling pressured to do things like watching porn or following influential celebrities, leading to withdrawal symptoms. Digital detox involves staying up late after hours scrolling through social media feeds to consume meaningless content without thinking critically. Snooze walkers, also known as sleepwalkers, engage in daily behaviors that cause them to feel bored and tired, leading to severe withdrawal symptoms. Spreading false news, deliberately encouraging harmful ideas, and promoting hate speech constitute forms of spread priming. Cyberbullying happens when one victim expresses hatred, injury, or ill intent toward another individual through social media. Post-traumatic stress disorder, commonly referred to as PTSD, is characterized by suicidal thoughts, rising depressions, psychosis, and depression over time.

          ## 2.6. Reward System
          Social media companies provide rewards systems based on user engagement and activity level. Users earn points, likes, followers, shares, and tokens for interacting with posts, stories, photos, videos, polls, and other community-based activities. They then redeem these points for virtual currency, gifts, or other benefits, depending on the rules set by the company.

          ## 3.1. Centralization of Data
          Before the rise of big data, social media platforms were centralized servers located in major cities. Nowadays, most social media websites offer APIs for developers to build their own applications and services. This means that they collect large amounts of data about users across all platforms, making it easier to analyze trends, identify problems, and improve services. 

          However, although social media apps and websites promise to deliver valuable insights into our lives, many of us still worry about privacy issues. Within minutes, text messages, emails, and other communication channels may contain sensitive information that could put us at risk if we choose not to disclose it. Additionally, our online activities and interests can be monitored by third parties, which can potentially expose us to identity thieves and hackers. As a result, privacy policies need to be clear and easy to understand so that everyone knows what kind of information they can expect from the service provider.

          To address these concerns, social media companies can introduce transparency reports that showcase their collection, usage, storage, and sharing practices. These reports should explain exactly how much data they collect and store about users, what personal information they gather, and what algorithms they employ to manage it. This can help users feel more comfortable giving permission to companies to access their data, enabling them to control how their private data is used.
          
          ## 3.2. Targeted Advertising
          Since social media companies target ads based on demographics, locations, and interests, they have the potential to reach millions of potential customers. While targeted advertising provides value in terms of increased sales, it also contributes to the generation of significant amounts of fake news and clickbait. To combat this problem, social media companies can establish clear guidelines around advertisement content, moderation policies, and opt-out options. They can also use AI techniques to detect fraudulent content and block it from appearing in public spaces.
          
            Another factor that contributes to the spread of misinformation is the fact that social media users rely heavily on conspiracy theories and other narratives to promote their beliefs. Although there are legal mechanisms to protect ourselves from intentionally fabricated content, it can be easy for malicious actors to create their own versions of news stories and spread them through social media platforms. To counteract this threat, social media companies can encourage users to check for facts before taking action, verify sources, and avoid being swayed by political views.
            
            ## 3.3. Monitoring User Behavior
            Social media users regularly leave detailed records of their everyday activities on the platform. This information can be used for various purposes, including monitoring crime and violence, tracking trends, identifying biases, and evaluating performance. However, collecting and analyzing this data comes with ethical considerations, especially when it includes sensitive details such as health data. Privacy laws can vary widely between jurisdictions, making it difficult for companies to comply with strict regulations.

            To address these concerns, social media companies can partner with government agencies to establish a Privacy Shield certification program. Under this system, companies must demonstrate compliance with relevant privacy laws, providing documentation that demonstrates that they have taken reasonable steps to safeguard user privacy. Companies can also obtain consent from individuals before accessing sensitive information, clearly stating what information will be shared and why, and providing clear instructions for exercising choice and opting out of data sharing altogether.
            
            Finally, even though social media platforms provide entertainment and educational value, they can also lead to addictions. Many young adults find enjoyment in interacting with strangers and sharing their passions, but they also have feelings of manipulative pressure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms. To combat this issue, social media companies can proactively engage with communities to encourage healthy habits and cope with loneliness and isolation.
