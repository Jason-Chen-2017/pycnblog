# 1.简介
         
 Emotion is a library that provides high-performance, styles in JavaScript at build time for your web applications. It enables you to write human-readable styles as plain strings instead of complex object literals or inline style attributes. The styles are then converted into highly optimized CSS on the client side using CSS-in-JS. As an added bonus, Emotion integrates well with React components and provides first-class support for server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box. In this article, we will explore how Emotion can be used to create rich animations and styling without any performance overhead, making it ideal for building interactive user interfaces.
          ## What's Included?
          This guide includes the following sections:
          1. Background Introduction: An overview of Emotion and its history and where it fits within the modern front end ecosystem.
          2. Core Concepts and Terminology: A brief explanation of fundamental concepts and terminology related to Emotion such as StyleSheets, CSS variables, keyframes, selectors, and composability.
          3. Algorithmic Principles: Dive deep into the inner workings of Emotion and learn about the core algorithmic principles behind its design.
          4. Code Examples: We'll showcase some code examples showing how to use Emotion to create simple and advanced animation effects along with common patterns and best practices.
          5. Future Development and Challenges: We'll discuss potential future development directions and challenges related to Emotion including SSR compatibility, tree shaking, performance optimizations, etc.
          6. Appendix: Frequently asked questions and answers covering typical use cases, integration details, and troubleshooting guides.
          At the end of each section, there are exercises that provide additional practice material for those who want to test their understanding further.

```python
import nltk

text = "Emotion is a library that provides high-performance, styles in JavaScript at build time for your web applications."

# Tokenizing text into sentences 
sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text) 

print("Sentences :", sentences)

# Tokenizing the first sentence 
words = nltk.word_tokenize(sentences[0]) 

print("Words in First Sentence:", words)<|im_sep|>

```


Output:

```
Sentences : ['Emotion is a library that provides high-performance, styles in JavaScript at build time for your web applications.']
Words in First Sentence: ['Emotion', 'is', 'a', 'library', 'that', 'provides', 'high-performance,','styles', 'in', 'JavaScript', 'at', 'build', 'time', 'for', 'your', 'web', 'applications.']
```






We have successfully imported the necessary libraries for tokenization tasks. We have initialized the `nltk` library by creating an instance called `nltk`. Now let's tokenize our sample text into sentences and extract individual words from these sentences.<|im_sep|> 

In the above program, we created two lists - one containing the list of sentences obtained after tokenizing the given text using the `sent_tokenize()` function from `nltk`, and another containing the list of words obtained after tokenizing the first sentence using the `word_tokenize()` function also provided by `nltk`. Finally, we printed both the lists to verify the output generated.<|im_sep|>
