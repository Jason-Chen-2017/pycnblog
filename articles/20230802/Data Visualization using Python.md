# 1.简介
         
 Data visualization is the process of converting large amounts of data into understandable and meaningful visuals that help decision-making processes and provide insights to the user. This article will be a step by step guide on how to use Python for creating interactive data visualizations with several real world examples. In this article, we will cover some basic concepts in data visualization such as scales, axes, marks and channels. We will also learn about different types of charts, including bar plots, scatter plots, line graphs, heat maps, etc., and their properties. Finally, we will create several interactive data visualizations using Python's library - Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn and Bokeh, which will allow users to explore and analyze the data interactively through various views, filters, tooltips and other features.
          # 2.术语和定义
          ## Scales
          A scale refers to an attribute or property used to map values from one set (domain) onto another set (range). It can be linear, logarithmic, sequential or categorical. Some commonly used scales include:
          1. Linear Scale − The default scale where all values are mapped evenly between two extremes.
          2. Logarithmic Scale − For large numbers, it provides better visibility by mapping them to smaller range.
          3. Sequential Scale − This type of scale has colors that gradually change from lighter shades to darker ones.
          4. Categorical Scale − This scale uses specific color schemes based on predefined categories.
          
          ## Axes
          An axis represents a dimension along which a chart or graph can be plotted. There are three main types of axes:
            * x-axis − Represents the horizontal direction.
            * y-axis − Represents the vertical direction.
            * z-axis − Represents a third dimension.
          
          ## Marks
          A mark is a graphical representation of data points. Common types of marks include:
            1. Bar Charts
            2. Line Charts
            3. Scatter Plots
            4. Area Charts
            5. Histograms
            6. Boxplots
            7. Heat Maps

          ## Channels
          A channel is a combination of attributes that can be used to represent data visually. These attributes can be things like shape, size, color, position, angle, opacity, thickness, etc. Channel combinations form multiple variables or dimensions that can be represented simultaneously. 

          # 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
          ## Basic Principle
          Data visualization helps to extract valuable insights from complex datasets. To visualize data effectively, you need to have knowledge of three fundamental principles: clarity, simplicity, and enlightenment. Here’s what these principles mean:
            * Clarity − Clarity means your visual should communicate clearly and accurately without any ambiguity.
            * Simplicity − Simplicity ensures that there isn't too much information presented on the screen at once. Choose the right markers and colors to avoid overwhelming the viewers.
            * Enlightenment − Enlightenment involves taking advantage of patterns and relationships across the dataset to draw out more interesting findings.

          ### Creating Different Types Of Visualizations Using Python Library
          Let’s start by installing necessary libraries required for our project. As I am running my code on Windows platform, so I downloaded Anaconda which contains both Python and Jupyter Notebook pre-installed. 
          
            ```python
           !pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn plotly bokeh
            ```
            
          After installation, let’s import libraries needed for plotting graphics.
          
            ```python
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
            import pandas as pd  
            import seaborn as sns
            import plotly.graph_objects as go
            import bokeh.plotting as bpl
            ```

          Now let’s read the dataset file `data.csv` using Pandas.

            ```python
            df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
            print(df)
            ```

          Output 

            ```
              Unnamed: 0          name gender age income
                0          0       John      M   29    5000
                1          1       Jane      F   32    6000
                2          2        Bob      M   28    5500
                3          3       Alice      F   33    7000
                4          4     Richard      M   31    6500
                5          5    Tommy      M   27    5500
                6          6   Donald      M   30    7500
                7          7       Thomas      M   26    5000
                8          8       George      M   29    6000
                9          9     Charlie      M   32    6500
            ```

          Now let’s create a simple bar chart showing average income per gender.
          
            ```python
            avg_income_gender = df.groupby(['gender']).mean()['income']
            
            fig, ax = plt.subplots()
            ax.bar([0,1], list(avg_income_gender), tick_label=['Male', 'Female'])
            ax.set_title("Average Income Per Gender")
            ax.set_xlabel("Gender")
            ax.set_ylabel("Income (USD)")
            
            plt.show()
            ```


          On the basis of above example, now let’s discuss each step of bar chart creation in detail.  

          #### Step 1: Create Subplots
          Firstly, we need to create subplots object, here we created figure and axes objects. 

            ```python
            fig, ax = plt.subplots()
            ```

          #### Step 2: Define X-axis and Y-axis Variables
          Next, define X-axis variable as index number and Y-axis variable as 'income' column value of dataframe grouped by gender.

            ```python
            avg_income_gender = df.groupby(['gender']).mean()['income']
            ```

          #### Step 3: Add Data Points to Graph Object
          Then add data points to graph object i.e. bars using `.bar()` method. Here `[0,1]` represents position of first and second bars respectively. And labeling of X-axis is done automatically.

            ```python
            ax.bar([0,1], list(avg_income_gender))
            ```

          #### Step 4: Set Title, Axis Labels and Show Result
          Finally, set title, labels of axes and show result using `.set_title()`, `.set_xlabel()` and `.set_ylabel()` methods.

            ```python
            ax.set_title("Average Income Per Gender")
            ax.set_xlabel("Gender")
            ax.set_ylabel("Income (USD)")
            
            plt.show()
            ```


          That's how we made a simple bar chart using matplotlib library. Later we will see few advanced techniques while making a bar chart.

        ## Advanced Techniques While Making Bar Chart
        So far we have seen how to make a simple bar chart using matpotlib library but still it can not compete with popular statistical software tools such as Excel or Tableau. We will see few advance techniques while making bar chart using matplotlib library.

        1. Adding Error Bars
        
        Error bars are a good way to give additional information regarding the accuracy of the measurements taken in a particular experiment. Error bars indicate the degree of uncertainty in measurement. To add error bars to a bar graph in python using matplotlib library, follow below steps:
        
          **Step 1:** Import necessary Libraries
          ```python
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
          ```

          **Step 2:** Generate Mean and Standard Deviation of Income Variable Grouped By Gender
          ```python
          avg_income_gender = df.groupby(['gender']).agg({'income': ['mean','std']})['income']['mean'].reset_index()
          std_income_gender = df.groupby(['gender']).agg({'income': ['mean','std']})['income']['std'].reset_index()
          ```
          From above lines, we generated mean and standard deviation of income variable grouped by gender and resetted indexes of mean and std series respectively.

          **Step 3:** Draw Error Bars
          ```python
          fig, ax = plt.subplots()
          ax.errorbar(x='gender', y='income', yerr=std_income_gender, ecolor='#33a02c', capsize=3, fmt='o--', ms=5, mew=1, elinewidth=1, capthick=1, data=avg_income_gender)
          ```
          In above lines, we added error bars to our bar chart by passing `yerr` parameter which takes standard deviation of income variable and passed formatted string `'o--'` to format style of error bars. Also, we changed marker size, width and thicknes of errors by changing corresponding parameters `ms`, `mew`, `elinewidth`, `capthick`.

          Final Code:
          ```python
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
          import pandas as pd
          import numpy as np

          df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

          avg_income_gender = df.groupby(['gender']).agg({'income': ['mean','std']})['income']['mean'].reset_index()
          std_income_gender = df.groupby(['gender']).agg({'income': ['mean','std']})['income']['std'].reset_index()

          fig, ax = plt.subplots()
          ax.errorbar(x='gender', y='income', yerr=std_income_gender, ecolor='#33a02c', capsize=3, fmt='o--', ms=5, mew=1, elinewidth=1, capthick=1, data=avg_income_gender)
          ax.set_xticks([0, 1])
          ax.set_xticklabels(['Male', 'Female'], rotation=45, ha="right", fontsize=10)
          ax.set_yticks(np.arange(0, max(list(avg_income_gender['income']))+10000, 10000))
          ax.set_ylim(-10000, max(list(avg_income_gender['income']))+10000)
          ax.grid(alpha=.5)
          ax.set_title("Average Income Per Gender With Error Bars")
          ax.set_xlabel("")
          ax.set_ylabel("Income (USD)")

          plt.show()
          ```
          Final Output:


      2. Stacked Bar Chart
      
      A stacked bar chart shows parts broken down by category within a single group. In a stacked bar chart, bars are drawn side by side horizontally, with height indicating the proportional contribution of each part to the total of that category. If the sum of the contributions is less than 100%, space is left empty underneath the bars representing the remaining percentage.
      
      To create a stacked bar chart using matplotlib library, follow below steps:
      
        **Step 1:** Read CSV File and Calculate Total Income Per Gender
        ```python
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np

        df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

        total_income = df[['name','age','gender','income']].groupby(['gender']).sum().reset_index()[['gender','income']]
        ```

        **Step 2:** Create Stacked Bar Chart
        ```python
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()

        female_income = [total_income[i][1] if row['gender']==0 else 0 for i,row in enumerate(df.iterrows())]
        male_income = [total_income[i][1] if row['gender']==1 else 0 for i,row in enumerate(df.iterrows())]

        ax.bar(['Male','Female'],male_income, bottom=female_income)
        ax.bar(['Male','Female'],female_income, color='#ff7f0e')

        ax.legend(["Total Income"])
        ax.set_title("Total Income Per Gender")
        ax.set_xlabel("")
        ax.set_ylabel("Income (USD)")
        ax.yaxis.get_major_locator().set_params(integer=True)

        plt.show()
        ```

        **Output**

      We can improve the above output by adding titles to individual bars and modifying text sizes according to our preference. 


      ## Interactive Visualization Using Plotly & Dash
      To build interactive visualizations, we need to use JavaScript-based front-end libraries like Plotly or Bokeh. But for those who don’t want to use JavaScript and prefer writing HTML + CSS, there exists another option called dash. Dash allows us to create powerful and beautiful web applications written purely in Python using Flask. Here, we will see how we can use Python with dash to create a dashboard with interactive visualizations.
