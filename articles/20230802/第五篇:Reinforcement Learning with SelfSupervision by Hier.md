# 1.简介
         
 Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning approach that allows an agent to learn from interaction with its environment and optimize its actions accordingly. It has many applications in robotics, gaming, healthcare, finance, and other areas. However, it can be challenging for complex tasks like those requiring multiple interacting agents or long horizons to achieve optimal results. In this blog post, we present the latest advancements in self-supervised reinforcement learning using hierarchical memory networks (HMNs), which address these challenges while achieving state-of-the-art performance on several important control tasks.

          # 1.1 Abstract
          Reinforcement learning (RL) is becoming increasingly popular due to its versatility and practicality in solving various decision-making problems in robotics, games, finance, and healthcare. However, training RL models requires significant amounts of data, making it difficult to obtain datasets suitable for transfer learning across different environments. To address this problem, we propose a new formulation called self-supervised reinforcement learning (SSL) where an agent learns to solve a task without any labeled expert demonstrations. We show that pretraining Hierarchical Memory Network (HMN) based SSL agents significantly improves their sample efficiency compared to non-pretraining methods. Moreover, our method outperforms existing approaches on several challenging control tasks including navigation, manipulation, and locomotion.

          Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a subset of unsupervised learning where only unlabelled data are used during model training. This has made significant progress in recent years, especially in image recognition and natural language processing. Various SSL techniques have been proposed to learn features or representations that generalize well to new but similar domains without any human intervention. Examples include deep clustering and BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent). These methods require noisy labels and do not necessarily preserve semantic information about the input space. On the contrary, hierarchical memory networks (HMNs) use a structured representation that captures both local and global dependencies between inputs and outputs, which makes them very effective at representing complex visual patterns. Despite their success, current SSL techniques still struggle to perform well when applied directly to reinforcement learning problems. 

          HMNs provide an alternative way of generating feature representations that retain some of their advantages while being more efficient than conventional deep neural networks. The architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where each layer processes one level of the hierarchy separately. Each node within a layer receives inputs from its previous nodes alongside its own features, thereby propagating contextual information throughout the network. By combining the encoded information with goal information obtained through offline supervised learning, HMNs can generate diverse, robust trajectories that avoid catastrophic forgetting. Thus, they offer a powerful tool for enabling agents to reason effectively and efficiently under uncertainty.

        # 2.2 Important Terms
        Let's define some important terms before moving ahead:

        1. **Agent**: An entity that interacts with its environment either passively or actively by taking actions.
        2. **Environment**: A world or external stimulus that influences the agent's behavior.
        3. **State/observation**: A part of the environment that the agent observes. It could be raw pixels in an image-based environment, joint angles in a robotic arm, etc.
        4. **Action**: An action taken by the agent to affect the next state of the environment. Actions may vary depending on the type of environment. For example, in a continuous control setting, actions may represent torque values sent to the actuators of a robotic manipulator.
        5. **Reward function**: A numerical value given to the agent for performing a desired task in the environment. Its range depends on the goals of the agent and how much reward it desires to receive after accomplishing the task. If the agent performs poorly, negative rewards may also be assigned.
        6. **Transition Model**: A mathematical model that defines the probabilities of transitioning between states based on the agent's actions and the environment's dynamics.
        7. **Policy Function**: A mapping of states to actions that the agent follows to maximize its expected future rewards.
        8. **Trajectory**: A sequence of states observed by the agent during interaction with the environment.
        9. **Expert Trajectory**: A set of previously generated trajectories that were annotated with human feedback to guide the agent towards higher reward regions of the state space.
        10. **Self-supervised Training**: A training procedure where the agent is trained solely on its interactions with the environment without any annotations or labelling.
        
        Now let's get started!

        # 3.方法概述
        ## 3.1 Problem Setting 
        At first glance, SSL algorithms may appear counterintuitive because the agent must identify itself as an expert in order to understand what kind of data should be fed into the algorithm. This raises two questions: 

1. How can we train an agent without relying on explicit experts?

2. Can such an agent achieve good performance even if it cannot fully understand the underlying rules behind its actions?

To answer these questions, we propose a novel self-supervised reinforcement learning approach called Hierarchical Memory Network (HMN). The key idea of HMN is to combine prior knowledge and intrinsic motivation into a single framework that generates diverse yet relevant data samples. Specifically, HMN comprises three main components:

**Memory Module:** Each module in the hierarchy represents a learned representation of the observations that capture higher-level semantics and patterns. They work together to produce a rich representation of the environment that encompasses both high-level and low-level features.

**Hierarchical Controller:** The controller is responsible for selecting appropriate actions based on the memory module output. It takes into account both high-level and low-level policies derived from the memory modules' outputs.

**Pretext Task:** In addition to providing a better understanding of the underlying dynamics, HMN introduces a pretext task that involves generating random distractor trajectories that deviate from the intended trajectory without revealing any useful information to the agent. This ensures that the agent is exposed to diverse types of distractor sequences, which forces it to develop a richer understanding of the environment and make smarter decisions. 

## 3.2 Approach Overview

        </figure>

        Fig.1 shows the overall architecture of Hierarchical Memory Networks (HMNs). The system consists of four main components - observation preprocessing, memory module, hierarchical controller, and pretext task generator. 

        ### Observation Preprocessing:
        
        Before feeding the raw observations into the memory module, we apply a series of transformations to extract meaningful features that can help the agent discover abstract concepts. We use convolutional layers to process pixel data and concatenate its channel dimensions with vector embeddings. These vectors encode object properties like color and shape, allowing us to learn discriminative features from images and enable multi-modal reasoning over video or mixed sensory modalities.

        ### Memory Modules:
        
        The memory module consists of several lightweight CNN layers that take as input processed observations and produce a fixed-size representation of the environment. The output of each module is then concatenated with the output of the previous module to create a larger tensor that encodes additional contextual information about the environment.

        ### Hierarchical Controller:

        The hierarchical controller selects appropriate actions based on the combined output of all memory modules. It combines policies learned from each module to construct a composite policy that guides the agent towards the goal.

        ### Distractor Tasks Generator:

        The distractor task generator produces random sequences that violate the intended sequence without revealing any useful information to the agent. These sequences simulate scenarios that are far removed from the actual goal-oriented exploration and encourage the agent to explore more densely. Once the agent encounters these sequences during training, it becomes less likely to rely on memorization mechanisms and instead devotes its attention to discovering unexpected aspects of the environment.

        With all these components working together, HMNs provide a powerful framework for self-supervised reinforcement learning that addresses both the exploration-exploitation dilemma and enables agents to learn complex visual and temporal patterns from raw sensor data.

        # 4.算法详解
        ## 4.1 Algorithm Details
        ### Policy Optimization Objective
        Our primary objective is to improve the sample efficiency of the agent by leveraging prior knowledge and indirect reward signals from experience replay. Specifically, we want to generate diverse, representative, and high quality dataset samples to learn policies from scratch without any prior assumptions or domain knowledge. Therefore, we follow the following steps:

        1. Train the agent on regular dataset samples collected from its interactions with the environment without any modifications. 
        2. Perform rollouts on randomly initialized policies to gather enough trajectories that cover different parts of the state space.
        3. Use Experience Replay (ER) to store these trajectories and retrain the agent on them periodically. ER stores the transitions (state, action, next state, reward) received from the agent during interaction with the environment and uses them to update the Q-function.
        4. During pretext training, we introduce a pretext task that involves producing adversarial examples against the stored transitions that violate the agent's internal belief and cause it to behave irrationally.
        5. Repeat step 3-4 until convergence.
        
        After collecting sufficient experience, the agent will begin to learn a highly specialized and informative representation of the environment. Then, we can inject the pretext task to further increase the diversity and complexity of the dataset. Finally, we can fine-tune the agent's parameters to ensure that it reaches optimal performance on the original task.

        ### Transition Model and Reward Function
        Since SSL does not require any annotated expert demonstrations, we need to come up with our own synthetic dataset to train the agent. One challenge here is that the agent may not know exactly what actions are reasonable since it is trying to learn these actions on its own. To address this issue, we use a combination of Transition Model and Intrinsic Reward functions to generate plausible, interpretable, and realistic dataset samples.

        1. Transition Model: Our transition model tries to capture the distribution of possible transitions between states that result in a valid next state. It takes the current state $s$ and action $a$ as input and returns the probability distributions of the next states $\Pr(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$ and their corresponding probabilities $\Pr(r_{t+1}|s_t,a_t,s_{t+1})$.
        2. Intrinsic Reward: We also incorporate an intrinsic reward signal that focuses on the agent's ability to exploit the internal model to reach the goals. The intrinsic reward corresponds to the agent's evaluation of its skill on the state transition $(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1})$, which includes factors such as predictive accuracy, smoothness of motion, consistency with past behaviors, and free-energy cost of staying at the same location. 

        ### Loss Function
        To optimize the agent's performance, we employ the standard cross entropy loss for classification tasks and use Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks. MSE measures the difference between predicted and true values of the target variable, while cross entropy loss measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the ground truth labels. 

        As mentioned earlier, we use pretext task generation to enhance the dataset size and the agent's ability to learn the underlying dynamics of the environment. Additionally, the pretext task helps promote exploration by encouraging the agent to search for diverse solutions and avoid local minima that lead to suboptimal policies. Here, we use a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) loss function that estimates the conditional likelihood of seeing the seen transitions ($\Pr_{    heta}(s_t^i|s_t^j,a_t^j,\delta t)$) under the hidden transitions ($\delta t$) sampled from the prior. Specifically, we assume that the agent assumes the transition model is a Bayesian approximation to the true model parameterized by $    heta$:

        $$ \Pr_{    heta}(s_t^i|s_t^j,a_t^j,\delta t) = \frac{e^{\frac{\ln p(\delta t|    heta)}{\gamma}[E_{\pi_\phi(\cdot|\delta t)}[\ln q_{\psi}(\delta t|s_t^{j},a_t^{j})]]}}{Z_{    heta}^{q}},$$

        where $\gamma$ is a discount factor, $p(\delta t|    heta)$ is the prior probability distribution of transition noise, $E_{\pi_\phi(\cdot|\delta t)}\[\cdot\]$, denotes the expectation over the sampled hidden transitions, $q_{\psi}(\delta t|s_t^{j},a_t^{j})$ is the approximate marginal distribution of the hidden transition given the state and action of the previous time step, and $Z_{    heta}^{q}$ normalizes the posterior distribution to compute a proper importance weight.

        We minimize the KL-divergence between the approximate posterior distribution and the true prior distribution, which encourages the agent to learn the underlying stochastic dynamics. Given enough pretext training, the agent will eventually converge to a deterministic policy that maximizes the expected return over the entire state space. 

        ## 4.2 Implementation Details
        We implement the above described algorithm in TensorFlow and experiment with different combinations of hyperparameters to find the best performing setup. Specifically, we split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. We use Experience Replay (ER) to keep track of the agent's experiences and gradients during pretext training. We compare the pretext performance on validation set to see whether the agent is improving or just getting stuck at a local minimum. Once the pretext task is complete, we evaluate the final performance of the agent on the original task using the validation and test sets. We report metrics like average episode length, success rate, mean squared error (MSE) for Q-value updates, and entropy coefficient during training.

        We further evaluate the pretext performance on a variety of environments and scenarios to ensure that it is indeed learning generalizable features. Next, we analyze the performance of the agent in terms of exploratory capability and stability. To measure this, we conduct extensive runs with varying levels of difficulty and visualizations of the agent's trajectories to visualize how it explores and exploits the state space. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and potential improvements of the Hierarchical Memory Networks (HMNs) for self-supervised reinforcement learning.

# 5.未来发展
        While HMNs provide promising results in self-supervised reinforcement learning, there are still a few ways we can improve the algorithm. First, we need to consider the effectiveness of the memory module's representation capacity and the hierarchical controller's composition strategy. Second, we need to validate our hypothesis regarding the efficacy of intrinsic reward in the training process and study the tradeoffs involved between exploration and exploitation. Third, we need to assess the impact of the added pretext task on the stability of the agent and evaluate its efficacy on sparse reward settings. Lastly, we need to benchmark the algorithm's scalability to large-scale environments and identify the bottlenecks that limit its scaling.
