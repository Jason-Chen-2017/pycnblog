 Block storage is a key component of cloud native storage infrastructure that provides persistent volumes for pods to consume as well as fast access to data and workloads. Kubernetes has become one of the most popular container orchestrators used by enterprises worldwide due to its simplicity and scalability. In this article we will learn about block storage principles, concepts and how it works inside kubernetes with some hands-on examples. We will also discuss about future directions and challenges. 
          # 2. Block Storage Terminology and Concepts
          ## i) Block Storage Introduction:
          Block storage refers to devices such as hard disk drives (HDD), solid state disks (SSD), or network attached storage (NAS). These are physical media designed to store blocks of information called sectors. Each sector contains raw binary data which can be read and written without formatting. 

          Data stored on these storage devices must be organized in a way that allows individual blocks to be addressed and manipulated independently. To achieve high performance, multiple devices can be grouped together to form logical units known as RAID arrays. The goal of using block storage is to provide independent addressing of large amounts of data across several nodes within an enterprise environment.

          Block storage supports two main features:
            1. Persistent Volume Claims: A claim represents a request for storage from the cluster. Once a pod claims the volume, the kubelet service binds the requested storage to the pod's node, allowing the pod to mount the device.
            2. Container Attached Storage(CASS): CASS enables the use of local storage directly inside containers, bypassing the overhead of network calls to remote shared storage systems. This feature makes it possible to run stateful applications like databases and message brokers on kubernetes clusters without needing to provision expensive external storage systems.


          ## ii) Understanding PV/PVC:
          **Persistent Volume**: It is a piece of storage in the kubernetes cluster that can hold data, similar to a physical disk drive. When you create a PV in kuberentes, you specify the size, type, access mode, and other relevant parameters required to make a volume available to your application. You can then attach this volume to a POD and start using it.

          **Persistent Volume Claim:** A claim for storage in kubernetes is a request for either empty space or existing PVs. When a POD needs storage, it creates a PVC to ask for a certain amount of capacity and access modes. The system then finds a matching PV based on the requirements specified in the PVC. If there is no suitable PV found, then the POD remains in pending status until one becomes available.

          ## iii) Access Modes:
          There are three types of access modes supported by PV:
            ReadWriteOnce – The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
            ReadOnlyMany – The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
            ReadWriteMany – The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes simultaneously.
          
          By default, all PVs created through the kubectl command are set to have ReadWriteOnce access mode. However, depending on your specific use case, you may need different access modes such as ReadWriteMany or ReadOnlyMany to ensure optimal performance and availability of your data.

           ## iv) Storage Classes:
           One thing to note when working with PV/PVC is the concept of storage classes. A storage class defines the “type” of storage required by a particular PVC. For example, if you want to create a highly available PostgreSQL database, you might choose a storage class that replicates the data to multiple servers so that if one server fails, another can take over automatically. Similarly, if you want to run a MongoDB workload, you might choose a storage class that provides low latency and throughput guarantees. 

          Different storage providers offer their own storage classes, but there are generally four categories of storage classes:

            1. Standard storage class: This class offers general purpose SSD storage backed by replication. They are ideal for serving short term data persistence demands. Examples include EmptyDir, HostPath, and GCE Persistent Disk.
            2. Long term storage class: This class offers HDD storage backed by replication or tiering. They are ideal for long term data retention and compliance demands. Examples include AWS EBS and Azure Managed Disks.
            3. Ephemeral storage class: This class offers very fast storage backed solely by RAM. They are best suited for workloads requiring extremely fast data retrieval times. Examples include Memcached and Redis.
            4. Cache storage class: This class offers specialized hardware optimized for caching purposes. They are best suited for serving frequently accessed data in memory for faster response time. Examples include OpenStack Cinder and Ceph RBD.
          
          Within each category, there are various options such as thin provisioning, dynamic provisioning, or snapshotting provided by the underlying provider.

           ## v) Topology Scheduling:
           Topology scheduling is a technique used in kubernetes to optimize the placement of pods and improve resource utilization. It allows you to define policies that control where pods should be placed based on factors such as node labels, affinity rules, and tolerations. 

          Specifically, topology scheduling allows you to specify the following constraints:

            • NodeSelector: Use this constraint to select nodes based on node labels defined in the node object.
            • Affinity & Anti-Affinity Rules: Use these constraints to target nodes based on node selectors and spread them out evenly throughout the cluster.
            • Taints and Tolerations: Use these constraints to mark nodes as unschedulable and prevent pods from being scheduled onto them unless they tolerate those taints. 


          ## vi) Reclaim Policy:
          When a PV is released from a claim, the reclaim policy determines what happens to the underlying storage resource. The default reclaim policy for newly created PVs is Delete, meaning that when the last claim referencing the volume is deleted, the underlying resources will also be deleted along with the PV itself. Alternatively, you can set the reclaim policy to Retain to keep the underlying storage intact after the release of the volume. This can be useful for debugging purposes or recovering lost data.

         # 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Operations Steps
         Now let’s dive deeper into block storage internals! Let’s first understand how data is organised on a block level and how it is mapped to filesystems and partitions. The next step would be to understand how multiple devices are grouped together into a RAID array and how that impacts I/O operations. Finally, we will see how kubernetes uses these principles to support efficient data storage management.

        ## i) Organisation of Data:
        Block storage devices typically store data in fixed sized chunks called sectors. Each sector is divided into a number of 512 bytes blocks which contain the actual user data. Together, the entire storage device forms a single virtual file system made up of blocks, which is exposed to the operating system as a partition or a whole disk. 

        On Linux systems, the underlying block layer driver manages the mapping between sectors and logical blocks. The devices themselves do not interpret any of the data contained within the blocks; instead, the kernel just passes them back to the rest of the system unchanged. The software responsible for interpreting the contents of the blocks, however, knows how to lay them out into files and directories.
        
        Here is a simple illustration of how data is organised on a block level:



        ## ii) Mapping Devices to Filesystems:
        As mentioned above, multiple devices can be grouped together to form a RAID array, providing higher levels of fault tolerance and reliability. Additionally, RAID-5 and RAID-6 provide better performance than traditional RAIDs. RAID-5 and RAID-6 operate differently by storing copies of data on separate parity disks rather than relying on parity checks during reads and writes.

        Once the data is laid out across the multiple devices, the kernel must determine how to map it to a single virtual file system. This process involves examining the metadata associated with the devices to determine how they are arranged and combining them into a unified view before presenting them to the user. 

        The resulting file system exposes a standard interface that allows programs running on the host to interact with the data transparently. Many modern operating systems (such as Linux) provide a wide range of built-in tools for managing and optimizing the performance of block storage. Using these tools, users can configure the layout of the file system to optimize performance for their specific use cases, ensuring that the overall system achieves peak efficiency while still maintaining reliability and availability.

        Here is a brief overview of how a RAID array affects I/O operations:

        ### i) RAID Arrays:
        While traditional RAIDs rely primarily on parity checking algorithms during reads and writes to reconstruct missing or corrupted data, RAID-5 and RAID-6 use a simpler approach by storing redundant copies of the same data across multiple disks, creating redundancy at the bit level rather than the block level. This eliminates the need for complex parity calculations, making RAID-5 and RAID-6 more performant and reducing the risk of failure.

        ### ii) Stripe Size and Parity Calculations:
        Another important consideration when designing a RAID configuration is choosing the appropriate stripe size and the number of parity disks involved. Typically, smaller stripes lead to lower latency and reduced IOPS, but too small a stripe could result in poor data distribution. Similarly, adding too few parity disks reduces the ability to protect against failures, while too many parity disks can slow down the I/O path and increase the likelihood of damage to the underlying storage. Ultimately, the choice of stripe size and the number of parity disks depends on the expected workload characteristics, available bandwidth, and economics of the solution.

        ### iii) Performance Optimization Strategies:
        Once the data is laid out and mapped to the filesystem, additional optimization strategies can be employed to further enhance the performance of the system. Some common ones include striping, buffer caching, and write aggregation.

        Striping involves dividing larger files or devices into smaller chunks and placing them across multiple devices to reduce the effectiveness of the interconnect switching fabric. This improves both read and write performance by reducing contention and increasing parallelism. Buffer caching can significantly improve sequential read performance by preemptively loading commonly accessed data into cache memory. Write aggregation involves grouping multiple related updates and submitting them in batches, improving write speeds by reducing overhead.

        Overall, block storage presents significant advantages compared to traditional file systems, especially in terms of data accessibility, flexibility, and scalability. However, it does require careful planning and tuning to maximize performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
