         As the use of social media continues to grow exponentially and become more personalized, it becomes crucial for businesses to be able to understand customer feedback effectively. Sentiment analysis is a technique used to gauge user opinion or sentiment towards an organization, product, service or brand. In this article, we will discuss how to implement sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques in Python. We will also present various python libraries such as NLTK, TextBlob, Scikit-learn and Keras which can help us achieve this task efficiently.
        
         The following are some popular applications of sentiment analysis:

         - Market research – Gathering insights into competitors’ opinions on products, services, promotions, etc., can lead to better business decisions. 
         - Customer support – Understanding customers’ needs, concerns and feelings can provide valuable information to improve customer satisfaction and reduce customer churn.
         - Companies and organizations that offer customer-generated content (e.g. reviews, blogs) need to analyze their audience’s emotions, mood, attitude, and preferences to improve their performance.

         Although there are several public datasets available for testing and evaluating models, building an accurate model requires time and expertise, especially when dealing with text data like social media posts or online comments. With proper pre-processing and feature engineering, effective models can perform well even with limited training data. This makes sentiment analysis particularly useful in real-world scenarios where users generate unstructured textual data such as social media posts, tweets, emails, surveys, and customer feedback forms.

         # 2.Concepts and Terminologies
         Before we dive deep into sentiment analysis, let's go over some concepts and terminology associated with it.

          ## 2.1 Polarity Score
          One way to measure the sentiment of a sentence is by assigning a polarity score to it based on its emotional tone. There are three possible polarities, positive, negative, and neutral. A positive sentence expresses joy, enthusiasm, hopefulness, love, admiration, approval, gratitude, affection, trust, acceptance, respect, recognition and love. On the other hand, a negative sentence conveys agitation, disappointment, frustration, sadness, distress, hate, hostility, resentment, hatred, disapproval, rejection, denial, contempt, dismissal, indifference, cynicism, self-pity, mortification, despair, shame, pessimism, anger and irritation. Finally, a neutral sentence has no strong emotional tone and lacks any underlying meaning or significance. 

          To assign a polarity score to each word in a sentence, we can use lexicons which contain lists of words associated with specific emotions. Each term in the list is given a score indicating its positivity or negativity. For example, "happy" might have a positive score while "sad" would have a negative one. Once we calculate the sum of scores for all terms in a sentence, we get a polarity score indicating the overall emotional tone of the sentence.

           ## 2.2 VaderSentiment
          VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically designed to capture the sentiment expressed in social media texts. It takes into account both the polarity of individual words within a sentence as well as the contextual polarity changes due to certain modifiers such as intensifiers or degree adverbs. Its accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score make it an effective choice for analyzing sentiment in social media texts. It supports multiple languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Romanian and Italian.
          
          Below is a brief description of how VADER works:
          
          ### Pre-processing 
          - Tokenize input text into individual words
          - Remove punctuation marks from the tokens
          - Convert every token to lowercase
          
          ### Feature Extraction 
          - Compute bi-gram and tri-gram features of each sentence
          - Use n-grams instead of single words because they capture higher level semantics of sentences
          - Combine different features together to form final features vector
            
          ### Classifier Training 
          - Train a logistic regression classifier using extracted features vector
           
          ### Classification 
          - Predict the sentiment label (+1 for positive, -1 for negative, and 0 for neutral) for each sentence based on trained weights
          
          ### Scoring 
          - Apply weights to the predicted labels based on their position in the original sentence
