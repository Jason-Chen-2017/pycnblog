         2.Crypto in Healthcare
         Cryptocurrency is widely used in healthcare industry to improve the efficiency of transactions and help patients access quality care at a lower cost. Here are some examples of how crypto plays an important role in healthcare:

         1) Payments and Travel insurance: Insurance companies are using cryptocurrencies as alternative payment methods for hospitalization bills, travel insurance premiums and deductibles. This way, they can offer more convenient and affordable financial services to their customers.

         2) Pandemic Response: During COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have embraced digital currency based solutions such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These platforms provide direct contact with verified medical professionals and enable them to make payments electronically.

         3) Medical Records Management: People's personal data has become increasingly vulnerable during the current global crisis. With the use of blockchain technology, patient records can be encrypted and stored securely on public ledgers that cannot be tampered or hacked by any third party. Moreover, this technology could also play a pivotal role in creating new forms of medical identity management system.

         4) Pharmacy Ecosystem: The pharmaceutical industry has been heavily relying on traditional financing models such as insurance policies and mortgages. However, with the advent of cryptocurrency, medicines can now be sold directly from manufacturers to consumers through decentralized marketplaces. This will create a more efficient supply chain and increase consumer satisfaction.

         # 2.Concepts & Terminology
         Before diving into technical details, let us briefly discuss concepts and terminologies related to cryptography in general and its application in healthcare.

         1) Encryption: Encryption refers to the process of converting plain text into cipher text, which only authorized parties should be able to decode. It involves several mathematical operations such as XOR (exclusive OR), addition, multiplication, etc., which aim to obscure the original message while retaining its content. Additionally, encryption algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) are widely used for encrypting data.

         2) Decryption: Decryption means reversing the process of encoding to obtain the original plaintext again. It requires knowledge of both keys utilized during encryption and ensures security by verifying the integrity of the ciphertext before decoding it.

         3) Hash function: A hash function takes an input string of arbitrary length and produces a fixed-size output called digest or hash value. In other words, two inputs that produce same hash value should be highly unlikely under good hashing algorithm. Common hash functions include SHA-256, SHA-3, MD5, etc.

         4) Public key infrastructure: PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure. It consists of several entities working together to establish trustworthy communication channels between users over the internet. One entity acts as certificate authority and issues digital certificates to individuals who wish to participate in the network. The others act as certifiers who check whether these certificates are valid and if not, reject them. All entities communicate among themselves via secure protocols to ensure secrecy, privacy and authentication.

         5) Digital Signature: A digital signature serves as proof of authenticity of sender and integrity of information transmitted over the network. When two parties exchange messages over a computer network, each one signs the message with his/her private key so that the recipient can validate the signature using the sender's public key. The signature helps the receiver detect any unauthorized modifications made to the message.

         6) Blockchain Technology: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows participants to transact without the need for a trusted intermediary. It uses peer-to-peer networking to record transactions across different nodes on the network. Each node contains a copy of all previous blocks along with their transactions, thus ensuring immutability and transparency. By employing smart contracts, blockchains enable token transfers, asset tracking, and micro-loan agreements.

         7) Smart Contract: A smart contract is a set of predefined rules that define the behaviour of a decentralised autonomous agent (dApp). It facilitates mutual consensus and automatization, allowing users to interact with the dApp as though it were a single entity. On top of this, smart contracts can execute automated actions whenever predetermined conditions are met, making them particularly useful in IoT devices, real estate trading, and gambling applications.

         # 3.Algorithmic Principles & Steps
         Now we move towards discussing the core algorithmic principles behind the implementation of various cryptographic technologies in healthcare. Some of the common principles are discussed below:

         1) Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption: Both symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques work on the principle of "public key encryption". In case of symmetric encryption, both parties share a common secret key. In contrast, in case of asymmetric encryption, there are two separate keys - a public key and a private key. The private key belongs to the owner whereas the public key can be shared freely. Whenever someone wants to send an encrypted message, he/she uses the public key to encrypt the message, but when the message needs to be decoded, the person possessing the corresponding private key decrypts it.

         2) Authentication and Authorization: To authenticate the user, the server verifies the user's identity using biometrics such as fingerprint scans or voice recognition. Once authenticated, the server then authorizes the user based on his/her permissions level or roles assigned by the administrator. Similarly, authorization can be achieved through API-based tokens generated by the backend systems after successful authentication.

         3) Proof of Work Algorithm: PoW algorithm involves complex computations involving a large number of processors or GPUs to generate a unique output such as a nonce. Anyone with powerful enough hardware resources can easily generate a solution to this problem within minutes. In healthcare, PoW algorithm can be used for preventing spam attacks, protecting against fraudulent activity, and providing fairness in distribution of rewards.

         4) Hashcash: An extension of PoW algorithm known as Hashcash is used for solving computational problems that require millions of cycles to solve efficiently. Users submit a challenge consisting of a random sequence of characters and additional parameters required to meet certain requirements. The server receives the challenge and hashes it multiple times until the result meets certain criteria, indicating that sufficient computing power has been applied to find the correct answer.

         5) Elliptic Curve Cryptography: ECDC works on the concept of elliptical curve maths, where points are represented as coordinates on a plane. Computationally expensive calculations involving modular arithmetic, exponentials, and logarithms are performed on the elliptic curves instead of simple arithmetic calculations. For example, signatures can be calculated faster than conventional signing mechanisms due to the reduced computation time involved in the ECDC scheme.

         6) Zero Knowledge Proofs: ZKP is a technique for proving the validity of a statement without revealing any additional information beyond what is necessary to determine its truthfulness. There are several variations of ZKP schemes including discrete logarithm, quadratic residue, linear combination, etc. They are used extensively in many fields, ranging from electronic commerce to password security.

         7) Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs: NIZK is a variant of zero knowledge proofs that does not rely on interactive provers. Instead, the prover makes a commitment to a hidden parameter to the verifier, and the verifier responds with a response without actually learning anything about the committed parameter except for its correctness. The proposed method is more secure as the verifier does not need to perform extensive computations to validate the proof, leading to significant improvements in scalability.

         8) Tokenomics: Tokenomics deals with the economics of cryptocurrencies, specifically their issuance, generation, and distribution. There are various approaches to tokenomics including inflation-based, deflationary, emission-control, risk-adjusted, and equity-oriented models. These models govern the allocation of tokens and reward holders according to predefined milestones, such as sales, usage, and network effects.

         9) Staking Model: Staking model is a mechanism in which validators stake a pre-defined amount of cryptocurrency to participate in the validation of transactions. Validators receive transaction fees and take part in social verification activities like staking airdrop programs. Validator elections typically occur every epoch, and high-staked candidates are voted out to keep the network stable.

         10) Central Bank Digital Currency: CBDC refers to central bank backed digital currencies that involve government approval of currencies such as the USD and EUR. Such digital currencies operate independently of central banks, and they are backed by fiat money that is pegged to a reference rate by the central banks. The presence of a central bank is regulated through monetary policy instruments and is responsible for maintaining stability and sound cash flow.

         Finally, we summarize what we've learned throughout the article regarding cryptography and its impact on healthcare.
