 ## 1.1 引言
         Deep learning models have achieved significant advances in image segmentation tasks due to their ability to extract informative features from images by employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most of the existing approaches for hierarchical image segmentation utilize global-to-local mapping strategies that ignore the interconnectedness among local regions within an image. In this work, we propose a novel approach named partial domain decomposition and attention mechanism (PDAM) for hierarchical image segmentation. PDAM simultaneously segments multiple levels of hierarchy in an end-to-end manner while taking into account both global contextual information and local feature relevance. The key idea is to decompose the input image into disjoint domains, each corresponding to one or more connected components of interest, based on object boundaries obtained through thresholding methods such as Otsu's method [2]. These subdomains are then segmented independently using CNNs with proper hyperparameters tailored to the specific task at hand. We exploit spatial attention mechanisms [9] to further selectively focus on salient objects in each subdomain before aggregating them to form higher-level segmentations. This allows us to effectively model the semantic relationships between different parts of the image without relying solely on global constraints. 
          ### 1.2 研究背景和意义
         The rapid advancement in computer vision research has led to breakthroughs in various fields including image processing, pattern recognition, natural language understanding, and artificial intelligence. Despite its success, however, there is still much room for improvement in other areas like medical imaging where high-quality visual inspection plays a vital role in diagnosing diseases and guiding treatment decisions. In recent years, advanced technologies have made strides towards developing automated tools for image analysis, but it remains challenging to accurately segment individual organs, structures, and cells from large complex medical images containing diverse tissues and organs. Therefore, hierarchical image segmentation is becoming increasingly essential in medical image analysis tasks.

          The main objective of this paper is to develop a deep learning framework capable of hierarchically segmenting medical images automatically by exploiting their underlying spatially-connected structure and shared statistical patterns. Our proposed method should be able to produce accurate and precise segmentation maps for numerous organ systems like heart, lung, breast, etc., and handle variations in the appearance and morphology of these organs under varying conditions. Moreover, our solution must also adapt easily to new data instances and provide robustness against noise and occlusion artifacts present in medical imaging. Finally, to test our framework’s performance, we will apply it to a large set of real-world medical images collected from various clinical settings.

         ## 2.1 Partial Domain Decomposition (PDD)
        PDD is a technique used to divide an input image into several smaller subdomains based on predefined object boundaries. It consists of two steps: region proposal generation and domain decomposition. Region proposal generation involves generating candidate locations for potential object boundaries in the input image, which can be done using various algorithms like edge detection techniques, contour detection, or connected component labeling. After identifying the potential object boundaries, the domain decomposition step separates the input image into several subdomains corresponding to each detected object boundary. Each subdomain corresponds to one or more connected components of interest in the input image.
         ## 2.2 Attention Mechanisms 
        Spatial attention mechanisms allow the network to dynamically adjust its weights over spatial regions depending on their importance in the current context. They consist of four main elements – the query mechanism, the keys and values, the matching process, and the output layer. Query mechanism calculates the weighted sum of all the feature maps at a particular position across all layers of the network. Keys and values represent and transform the raw features generated by the previous layer. Matching process measures how similar each element in the query set is to each element in the key set based on some similarity metric like cosine similarity. The final output is obtained after applying softmax function to the matched scores between the query set and the key set.

      ## 3.1 PDD+Attention Mechanism
         To address the problem of global-to-local mappings, we propose a hierarchical image segmentation framework named “Partial Domain Decomposition (PDD)+Attention Mechanism” (PDAM), consisting of three main modules: Partial Domain Decomposition module (PDM), Spatial Attention module (SAM), and Domain Aggregation Module (DAM). PDM generates a set of candidate object boundaries by predicting probability distributions for each pixel belonging to either background or foreground. SAM computes a spatial weight vector for each predicted object boundary by estimating the relative importance of pixels inside the boundary compared to those outside the boundary. DAM combines the segmented subdomains into a single segmentation map by considering their structural coherence via adjacency matrices computed between adjacent subregions. 

          1. Partial Domain Decomposition (PDM): 
             A pre-trained CNN called Partial Domain Adversarial Network (PADAN) is trained to generate dense predictions for each pixel being part of either background or foreground. The generated probabilities are fed into a clustering algorithm to obtain initial object boundaries.
           
          2. Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM):
             SAM takes the resulting object boundaries and assigns weights to each pixel based on its distance to the center of mass of the boundary around the pixel. A Gaussian kernel is applied to estimate the spatial distribution of the weights. The weights are subsequently passed through a ReLU activation function to eliminate negative weights.

           3. Domain Aggregation Module (DAM):
              DAM applies a graph-based algorithm to compute adjacency matrices between adjacent subregions, thus enforcing the constraint that adjacent subregions are less likely to become separated during the later stages of the pipeline. Several heuristics are utilized to refine the final segmentation mask by merging nearby subregions or smoothing the edges between subregions.

        Overall, PDAM uses a cascade-like architecture to sequentially segment multiple levels of hierarchy in an end-to-end manner while taking into account both global contextual information and local feature relevance. This leads to better accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional image segmentation frameworks while allowing for easy deployment and fine-tuning of individual components.

      ## 3.2 Pipeline Architecture
       As shown in Fig.1 below, the overall pipeline architecture for PDAM comprises of PDM followed by SAM followed by DAM. Here, the first level of hierarchy is formed by generating candidate object boundaries using PADAN. Then, SAM is used to assign spatial weights to each pixel based on its proximity to the center of mass of the corresponding object boundary. Next, the adjacency matrix is computed between adjacent subregions using a graph-based algorithm to ensure compatibility between adjacent subregions. Finally, the DAM merges overlapping subregions and smoothens the edges between non-adjacent subregions to obtain the final segmentation map.
