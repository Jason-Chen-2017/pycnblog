# 1.简介
         

         In this article we will build and implement the transformer model architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) using only PyTorch library and not any other deep learning framework or package like Keras or TensorFlow. We will also learn how to use PyTorch’s autograd feature to calculate gradients automatically without having to manually define them as beforehand. The code written here can be easily used for building neural networks of different sizes and complexity and for transfer learning on various tasks such as text classification, machine translation, etc.   
        
         This is an advanced level tutorial that requires some knowledge about basic concepts of neural networks and the implementation of algorithms using PyTorch. You should have at least intermediate-level understanding of Python programming and basic understanding of linear algebra operations.  
         Let's get started!

         ## 概念和定义 
         ### 1. Neural Network
         A neural network is a set of connected nodes called artificial neurons, which process input data through weighted sums and apply non-linear activation functions to produce output. It learns to approximate a mapping function from its inputs to outputs based on training examples.  
         
         ### 2. Activation Function
         An activation function takes the sum of weighted inputs and applies a non-linear transformation to it, thereby converting the net input into an output. There are many types of activation functions, but they play essential role in creating complex relationships between the input variables and the output variable, especially in deep neural networks. Popular activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, softmax, LeakyReLU, ELU, PReLU, etc. All these functions except softmax are nonlinear transformations of their corresponding inputs. Softmax is special because it converts the inputs into probabilities which add up to one.  
         
         Commonly used activation functions in deep neural networks are:  
         - Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): f(x)= max(0, x). Used in hidden layers when the input values can become negative due to vanishing gradient problem. 
         - Sigmoid: f(x)= 1/(1+e^(-x)). Usually applied in binary classification problems where the predicted probability ranges between [0,1]. 
         - TanH: f(x)= 2/(1 + e^(-2x))-1. Typically used in NLP applications. 
         - Softmax: f(x_i)= e^(x_i)/sum_j(e^(x_j)), where j goes over all possible classes. Produces a vector with elements ranging between zero and one, whose sum equals one. 
         
         ### 3. Gradient Descent 
         Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss or cost function of a neural network during training. It updates the weights of the neural network parameters iteratively by moving towards the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight. Gradients represent the slope of the loss function while traversing downward along the negative slope. The step size determines the speed at which the optimizer moves towards the minimum. Learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size. A smaller learning rate means slower convergence to the minimum. 
       
       
       ## 4. Transformers 
         A transformer is a type of neural network architecture that aims to solve sequence-to-sequence problems efficiently. It was proposed in paper "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017), which uses multi-head attention mechanism to preserve long-range dependencies in sequences. The architecture consists of encoder layers and decoder layers, where each layer consists of multiple sublayers. Here is a brief overview of the transformer architecture:

         #### Encoder Layer: 
           - Multi-Head Attention: The goal of multi-head attention is to allow each head to attend to different positions in the input sequence independently. For each position in the sequence, a query vector and key-value vectors are generated. Then these vectors are passed through a feedforward network to generate the context vector. Finally, the attention scores are combined with the original embeddings to produce the output embedding for that position. 

           - Positional Encoding: Positional encoding is added to capture the order of words in the sentence. These encodings provide positional information about the word that does not exist explicitly in the input sequence.

           - Residual Connection: Adding residual connection helps in avoiding the vanishing gradient problem.  

         #### Decoder Layer
           - Masked Multi-Head Attention: During decoding time, masking is performed so that the network cannot cheat by looking ahead. By doing this, the decoder learns to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence while generating output tokens.

           - Fully Connected Layer: After applying multi-head attention and positional encoding, the encoded representations obtained from the previous encoder layer are concatenated with the current decoder state to form a new representation which is then fed through a fully connected layer. The final output of the decoder is produced using a linear projection followed by softmax activation if required. 

         Overall, transformers offer several advantages over recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. They handle longer sequences more effectively and enable parallel processing. However, the concept and mathematical details behind transformers may require some expertise in mathematics and physics.
