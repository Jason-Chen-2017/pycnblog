        Serverless computing refers to a cloud-based deployment model in which the servers are managed by an external provider or service, known as a serverless platform. In this model, developers focus on writing code that is executed when needed rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates the need for scalability, availability, security, and maintenance of servers, allowing them to be used efficiently by paying only for what they use. 
        
       Serverless computing offers several advantages including:

        - Reduced operational costs: With serverless computing, you no longer have to worry about managing the hardware, software, networking, or other resources required to run your application. Instead, all these tasks are handled by a third party, resulting in cost savings over time.
        
        - Increased flexibility: By using serverless platforms, you can quickly scale up or down your applications based on demand without having to worry about provisioning or maintaining servers.
        
        - Better developer experience: Writing serverless functions allows developers to build applications faster and more easily since they don't need to manage their own servers. They also get instant scaling and pricing benefits, making it easier to iterate on new features and changes.
        
        - Simplified operations: Since serverless platforms provide auto-scaling capabilities, you can handle any increase or decrease in traffic automatically, minimizing downtime and ensuring high performance and reliability.
        
        
       Currently there are two main types of serverless computing platforms: AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions (GCF). We will discuss both of them separately in this article.

         ## Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda
         
           Lambda is a compute service offered by AWS that enables users to write and run code without needing to provision or manage servers. It provides a runtime environment that executes code in response to events, such as HTTP requests, message triggers, and AWS service events. The user writes the code that defines the logic of the function and specifies the resources required to execute it. Once deployed, the function runs continuously in response to events, either in a specific region or across multiple regions depending on the needs of the user.
           
           A Lambda function consists of three parts:
             * An event source, which defines how the function is triggered. For example, an S3 bucket can trigger the execution of a lambda function whenever a file is uploaded to that bucket.
             
             * Code, which contains the logic that's executed when the function is triggered. The code can be written in various programming languages supported by AWS, such as Python, Node.js, Java, C#, and Go.
             
             * Configuration settings, which specify things like memory allocation, timeout duration, and logging options. Each function has its own configuration values set at creation time and can be modified later.

           To create a lambda function, you first need to create an IAM role that grants permission to access the necessary AWS resources, such as S3 buckets. Then, you upload the function code along with any dependencies to the Lambda console or API. Finally, you configure the event source to invoke the function and set the permissions on the function so that it can access any other resources needed by the function.

         ## Google Cloud Functions (GCF)
         
           GCF is another serverless computing platform provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP), similar to AWS Lambda. Similar to AWS Lambda, it is a compute service that lets you run code without managing servers directly. However, unlike AWS Lambda, GCF is focused on running functions on GCP, specifically App Engine Flexible Environment instances. These functions share many similarities with those created using AWS Lambda but differ in some key aspects, such as being regionalized.

            To create a GCF function, you must first define the event type that triggers the function. You can then select from one of several available templates or write your own function code in JavaScript or Python. After deploying the function, you can monitor usage metrics and adjust the function's configuration if necessary.
            
            GCF uses different terminology and concepts compared to AWS Lambda. Here's a quick summary of the most important differences between the two services:
            
            1. Regionalization: GCF functions can only be deployed within specific GCP regions, whereas AWS Lambda functions can be deployed anywhere in the world.
            2. Execution context: GCF functions run inside a flexible Docker container, while AWS Lambda functions can run in various runtime environments, including Node.js, Python, Java,.NET Core, Ruby, and custom containers. Additionally, AWS Lambda functions support concurrent invocation, where multiple copies of the same function can run simultaneously.
            3. Runtimes: GCF supports a wide range of runtimes and languages, including Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, and Go, whereas AWS Lambda only supports Java, Node.js, Python, and.NET.
            4. Trigger sources: AWS Lambda currently supports several trigger sources, including S3, Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams, Alexa Skills Kit, and API Gateway. GCF only supports HTTP triggers.

         ## Amazon Web Services Lambda
         
            ### Introduction
            
               Lambda is a serverless computing platform provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which allows you to run code without needing to provision or manage servers. You simply write code that defines the logic of your function and assign the resources required to execute it. When an event occurs that matches the specified trigger source, the function is invoked automatically and starts executing. Once completed, the function continues to run until the next time a matching event occurs.
               
               When designing your Lambda function, make sure to consider the following factors:

               1. Memory Allocation: Set the amount of memory allocated to your function to determine its maximum processing power. Remember that the higher the memory size, the greater the CPU time allotted per request, potentially increasing billing rates.
                
               2. Timeout Duration: Determine the maximum length of time your function can run before it times out. If a function takes too long to complete, it may cause issues with subsequent events and result in additional charges.
                
               3. Permissions: Specify the IAM role that grants permission to access the necessary AWS resources, such as S3 buckets. Also ensure that the function has the appropriate network connectivity and permissions to interact with other AWS services.
                
                4. Logging Options: Enable CloudWatch Logs to capture logs generated by your function. These logs can help you troubleshoot issues and monitor the health of your function.
                 
                
            ### Step 1: Create a Function Role
            
               First, you should create an IAM role that gives your function permission to access the necessary AWS resources, such as S3 buckets. To do this, go to the IAM Management Console and click "Roles" under "Access Management." Choose "Create New Role," enter a name for your role, and choose "AWS Lambda" as the trusted entity. Under "Permissions," add the necessary policies, such as "AmazonS3FullAccess" to allow your function read/write access to your S3 buckets. Click "Next: Review" to review your role and create it.
                
               Keep note of the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the newly created role, which you'll need to grant permission to your function during deployment.
                    
            ### Step 2: Upload Function Code
            
               Next, you should upload your function code to the Lambda management console. Navigate to the Lambda section of the console and click "Create Function." Enter a function name and description, and choose the runtime environment and handler function for your function. Choose the IAM role that was created earlier to give your function access to AWS resources.

                
                   Note: Make sure to choose the appropriate handler function according to the language of your choice. The handler function is responsible for handling incoming events and invoking the core business logic of your function.
                    
                    Example Handler Functions:
                        
                    Python: lambda_function.lambda_handler

                    Node.js: index.handler

                    Java: com.example.Handler.handleRequest


                    Finally, you can upload your function code package as a.zip file or a GitHub repository URL. 
                    
            ### Step 3: Configure Event Triggers
            
               Now that your function is uploaded, navigate back to the Lambda management console and click "Triggers" underneath your function name. From here, you can select the trigger source that will start your function. For example, if your function is supposed to be invoked every time a file is uploaded to an S3 bucket, you would select "S3." Select the appropriate bucket and save your trigger settings.

                
                   Note: Depending on the trigger source selected, you may need to configure additional settings, such as object prefixes or suffixes.
                   
            ### Step 4: Test Your Function
            
               Finally, test your function to ensure it works correctly. To do this, you can manually trigger the function by uploading files to the appropriate S3 bucket or triggering the function through other supported trigger sources.

                
                   Note: Before testing your function, remember to deploy your latest changes to production.
