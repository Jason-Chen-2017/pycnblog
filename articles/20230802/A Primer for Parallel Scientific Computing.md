         Parallel computing has become a crucial technology in modern computer science and engineering disciplines due to the increasing computational power of computers that have increased exponentially over the past several years. The need for parallel computing is becoming more pressing with ever-increasing demands from scientific applications such as simulations, modeling, data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Parallel computing allows scientists to break down large computations into smaller tasks that can be executed simultaneously on multiple processors or cores within a single machine, which greatly improves performance compared to sequential computation. 
         
         Despite its importance, however, writing effective parallel codes remains challenging even for experienced programmers who are proficient in parallel programming techniques. In this primer, we aim to provide an introduction to parallel computing concepts, algorithms, and programming models by reviewing selected topics related to scientific computing using C/C++, Fortran, Python, and MPI. This primer assumes basic familiarity with fundamental principles of parallel processing and algorithmic efficiency optimization.

         ## Fundamental Principles of Parallel Processing
         ### Scheduling
         Scheduling refers to allocating resources among threads or processes to maximize their overall performance. There are two types of scheduling: static and dynamic. Static scheduling involves assigning fixed numbers of resources to each thread or process at compile time; while dynamic scheduling assigns these resources during runtime based on certain criteria such as priority, fairness, or round robin. Dynamic scheduling can improve system utilization significantly because it avoids idle waiting and increases throughput. 
         
         ### Communication
         
         Communication between different threads or processes requires explicit synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions or deadlocks. Several communication patterns exist, including point-to-point (send/receive), shared memory (read/write), collective operations (barrier, reduce, broadcast), and messaging passing (MPI). 
         ### Load Balancing
         Load balancing refers to distributing workloads among all available resources so that no single resource runs out of capacity. It ensures optimal resource usage by minimizing wait times and maximizing system throughput. There are three main load balancing strategies: task level, data level, and processor level. Task level load balancing distributes workloads based on tasks rather than individual data items; data level load balancing distributes workload based on data size; while processor level load balancing distributes workload based on number of active processors.  
         
         ### Asynchronism
         
         Asynchronism refers to exploiting parallelism to speed up execution without sacrificing correctness. Two common forms of asynchronism include pipelining and overlapping compute and communication. Pipelining involves executing multiple instructions per clock cycle, reducing latency but potentially introducing throughput bottlenecks. Overlapping compute and communication reduces idle cycles by performing computations in advance of receiving new input data, allowing for higher throughput. 
         
         ### Concurrency Models
         
         Concurrent computing encompasses various approaches to implementing parallel programs. These include shared memory (SMP), message passing interface (MPI), multi-threading, hybrid models, and concurrent objects. Shared memory systems use a single address space for all threads running on a node, whereas distributed systems typically employ separate nodes with shared file systems for accessing shared data. Message passing interfaces allow programs to communicate asynchronously through network sockets or shared memory regions, enabling efficient communication across heterogeneous networks. Multi-threaded programming enables parallelism within a single process, sharing memory between threads. Hybrid models combine features from both shared memory and message passing environments, enabling programs to take advantage of both forms of concurrency where appropriate. Concurrent objects enable fine grained parallelism within applications, providing access to low-level threading primitives such as locks and semaphores. 

         ## Distributed Systems and Programming Models

         Distributed computing refers to architectures that span multiple nodes connected via a network, providing high availability and scalability capabilities. The basic components of a distributed system are nodes, routers, switches, and links. Nodes comprise processing units and local storage, while routers perform packet forwarding functions. Switches connect multiple ports together, allowing messages to be passed between nodes according to routing protocols. Links may be wired or wireless connections, depending on application requirements and connectivity constraints. 

         Programming models for distributed computing usually focus on fault tolerance, elasticity, and mobility. Fault tolerance means that failures should not cause crashes or other serious errors, requiring automated recovery procedures. Elasticity refers to ability to scale resources dynamically to handle changes in workload, resulting in improved utilization and reduced costs. Mobility means that programs should continue running despite failures in some parts of the system, ensuring service continuity.

         Commonly used programming models for distributed computing include Apache Hadoop, Google's MapReduce framework, Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3), and Apache Spark. Each model provides specific functionalities such as distributed storage, map-reduce processing, and stream processing, making them ideal for different classes of problems. 


         ## Vectorization

         Vectorization refers to techniques that exploit the hardware support for vector calculations offered by modern CPUs to execute multiple mathematical operations simultaneously. Modern CPUs offer hardware acceleration for integer arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and comparison, as well as floating-point arithmetic operations. By breaking down complex computations into smaller vectors of data, software developers can gain significant speedups. In practice, vectorization is achieved by following two steps: decomposition and parallelization. Decomposition involves transforming a scalar problem into a set of vector subproblems that operate independently on their respective elements. Parallelization involves applying SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) or SIMT (single instruction, multiple threads) techniques to execute these subproblems in parallel on the same core or CPU. 

         ## Optimization Techniques

          Optimizing numerical algorithms for parallel computing involves identifying areas of potential improvement, analyzing performance metrics, and selecting appropriate tools and methods. There are several key techniques that can help achieve high-performance parallel codes: parallel libraries, cache optimizations, loop transformations, blocking schemes, and code tunings.

           #### Parallel Libraries
           Parallel libraries provide pre-built implementations of commonly used algorithms optimized for parallel processing. Popular examples include OpenMP, CUDA, and OpenCL.

           #### Cache Optimizations
           
           Cache optimizations involve configuring the caching behavior of the processor to best fit the needs of the current algorithm being executed. Proper placement of data in caches helps improve data locality and decrease access latencies, improving cache hit rates and increasing the effectiveness of prefetching policies. Cache coherency protocols ensure consistent visibility of cached data across multiple threads and processes, further optimizing cache performance.

            #### Loop Transformations
            
            Loop transformations involve restructuring loops to increase the degree of parallelism possible. Reordering iterations, eliminating unnecessary dependencies, and partitioning the iteration space can often yield significant improvements in terms of performance and energy consumption.

            #### Blocking Schemes
            
            Blocking schemes involve dividing the iteration space of a loop into smaller blocks, mapping these blocks onto individual threads, and then executing them in parallel. Commonly used schemes include tile, block, and cyclic blocking. Tile blocking partitions the domain into nonoverlapping rectangular tiles, while block blocking splits the domain into uniform grid cells. Cyclic blocking uses a ring topology to distribute the iteration space among the threads, effectively creating a torus mesh.

            #### Code Tunings
            
            Code tunings involve manually adjusting compiler flags, library settings, and parameters to optimize performance. Often, this involves experimenting with different combinations of options and benchmarking performance to identify the best setting for a particular algorithm.
