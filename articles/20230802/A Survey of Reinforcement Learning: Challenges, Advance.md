         # 2. Introduction

         ## 2.1 Background introduction

        In recent years, artificial intelligence has revolutionized many fields such as robotics, speech recognition, decision making, etc., especially in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). RL is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn how to make decisions by trial and error based on feedback from its environment. The key idea behind RL is to use past experience to improve future decisions. In this paper, we will explore the latest research advances related to reinforcement learning including exploration, exploitation, temporal difference algorithms, unified handling for discrete and continuous action spaces, distributed and parameterized techniques, diversity, zero-sum games vs nonzero-sum games, etc. We will also discuss the limitations and potential applications of these techniques in complex real-world environments. Finally, we would like to provide some tips or suggestions to help practitioners effectively apply RL in practice.

        ## 2.2 Basic concepts and terminology
        ### Markov Decision Process (MDP)
        MDP is a model used to describe sequential decision-making problems where agents take actions in response to state transitions through their observation. It consists of a finite set of states $S$, a finite set of actions $A(a)$ allowed in each state, a transition probability function $\mathcal{T}: S     imes A(a) \rightarrow P(S'|S,A)$ defining the conditional probabilities of observing the next state given current state and action, and a reward function $r: S    imes A(a) \rightarrow R$ that provides the immediate reward for taking an action in a particular state. Here are some basic definitions of MDP:

        - State space $S$: contains all possible states of the world
        - Action space $A(a)$: defines the set of available actions in any state
        - Transition probability function $\mathcal{T}$: specifies the probability of transitioning between two states under certain conditions
        - Reward function $r$: specifies the numerical value received when an agent takes an action in a specific state
        - Discount factor $\gamma$: determines the importance of future rewards relative to immediate ones

        ### Policy
        A policy $\pi_    heta(a|s)$ is a mapping from states to actions in order to select an optimal action at each state. The optimal policy maximizes the expected return over time. A behavioral cloning policy can be learned from expert demonstrations using maximum likelihood estimation. There are different types of policies such as deterministic, stochastic, epsilon-greedy, softmax, etc.

        ### Value Function
        A state-value function $V^\pi_s$ gives the expected long-term discounted reward starting from state s with policy $\pi$. It measures how good it is to be in state s under the current policy. A state-action value function $Q^\pi_{sa}$ represents the total reward obtained after executing an action in a state, under a fixed policy $\pi$.

        ### Bias and variance trade-off
        Bias is the difference between predicted values and actual outcomes. High bias means that our model performs poorly even if we have very little training data or bad hyperparameters. Variance refers to the amount of randomness involved in predictions. As the size of training dataset increases, the model becomes less accurate due to high variance. To address the issue of bias and variance, several regularization techniques have been developed, such as L1 regularization, L2 regularization, Dropout, Early Stopping, and Batch Normalization. However, there remains no consensus on which approach is best for every scenario. Thus, more research needs to be done in this area.

        ## 2.3 Key challenges

        Currently, there are still many open issues related to reinforcement learning, including:

        1. Exploration-exploitation dilemma: the problem of deciding whether to exploit knowledge gained from previous experiences or explore new possibilities. This is a crucial aspect of RL because without enough exploration, the agent may not be able to discover the underlying structure and optimal policy within the environment. Furthermore, while exploring, the agent should balance the risk-reward ratio with the goal of obtaining better knowledge about the environment.

        2. Scalability and sample complexity: training large neural networks for RL requires significant computational resources and effective sampling methods for efficient learning. While advanced optimization methods such as ADAM, RMSprop, etc. can significantly reduce the training time, they may also introduce additional biases and overfitting to the training data.

        3. Nonstationarity and noise: the emergence of rare events or stochastic dynamics usually makes traditional supervised learning techniques ineffective. This challenge lies at the core of both exploration and robustness in RL. For example, in locomotion control, the agent must adapt to changing terrain and lighting conditions. Also, decentralized and asynchronous reinforcement learning systems face the need for robust communication protocols, data collection strategies, and fault tolerance mechanisms.

        4. Contextual bandits: one common application of RL is in contextual bandit settings where the agent selects actions based on incomplete information about the current situation. Despite several advancements in deep neural network models, developing scalable solutions for this class of problems remains a challenging task.

        5. Reinforcement learning for partial observability: the agent only receives part of the state information, making inference difficult and creating the curse of dimensionality. One promising solution is to develop deep hierarchical models that capture relevant features from local and global contexts.

        6. Transfer learning: the transfer of skills or domain knowledge acquired in one task to another is a critical requirement in many real-world applications. However, existing methods mostly focus on transferring entire representations of the agent, neglecting the essential component of skill acquisition that involves fine-tuning the policy parameters to achieve higher performance.

        # 3 Exploration and Exploitation Strategies

        ## 3.1 Epsilon Greedy Strategy

        In the beginning of the training process, agent randomly explores the environment using epsilons % of the time, i.e., it takes random actions with probabilty EPSILON. Once the agent starts to accumulate some experiences, it begins to exploit its known knowledge to maximize the expected return. At each step, the agent selects either the best known action with probability 1 − ε + ε/N, or a random action with probability ε/N. Epsilon decay ensures that the agent eventually explores the environment until it reaches an optimum point where the value function converges towards its true value function.

        ## 3.2 Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Strategy

        UCB strategy is a heuristic algorithm that combines exploitation and exploration in a principled way. At each timestep, the algorithm calculates the average upper confidence bound of each arm k and chooses the arm with the highest ucb. The formula for calculating ucb is:

        $$
        UCB_k(t) = Q^*(k) + \sqrt{\frac{2 \log(    au)/N_k(t)} {N_k(t)}}
        $$

        Where:

        1. Q^*(k): the estimated mean of the arms k
        2. t: number of times arm k has been pulled so far
        3. N_k(t): the number of samples played from arm k up till time step t

        Since ucb balances exploration with exploitation, the algorithm adapts quickly to unknown situations and outperforms other exploration methods such as pure exploitation or thompson sampling. UCB works particularly well in cooperative multiagent settings since each agent learns what others want, rather than relying on the presence of a central coordinator.

        ## 3.3 Thompson Sampling

        Thompson sampling is similar to UCB but instead of selecting the arm with the highest UCB, it selects the arm randomly according to the sampled distribution. It assumes that the rewards are normally distributed and updates the estimates of the mean and standard deviation accordingly. At each round, the agent samples N different distributions and chooses the arm corresponding to the largest sample.

        ## 3.4 Bayesian Neural Networks

        In Bayesian Neural Networks, we represent the prior belief about the weights and biases of the neural network as a normal distribution. During training, the algorithm samples weights from the posterior distribution after computing the loss gradient. By doing so, the algorithm avoids overfitting by automatically adjusting the degree of smoothness of the weight distributions. Moreover, bayesian neural networks enable us to incorporate uncertainty into the choice of action and can handle partially observed environments effectively.

        ## 3.5 Noisy Network Gradient Descent

        In traditional gradient descent, the update rule is simply subtracting a small fraction of the gradient vector scaled by the learning rate from the current weights. Noisy gradients add noise to the updates and prevent the algorithm from converging to the minimum. To avoid this issue, the authors propose adding noise to the gradients before applying them to the weights. They call this method noisy network gradient descent (NNGD), and show that it can significantly improve the performance of neural networks trained with deep learning frameworks.

       ## 3.6 Bootstrapping and Intrinsic Motivation

        Bootstrapping is a technique commonly used in reinforcement learning to leverage external signals to improve the agent's ability to predict its own preferences. Instead of treating the environment as fully observable and trying to directly optimize the reward function, bootstrapping trains an auxiliary task that helps the agent indirectly estimate the preferences of the current state. The author proposes a modified version of bootstrap called intrinsic motivation (IM) that encourages the agent to perform tasks that benefit its overall goals, without explicitly optimizing the reward function. IM improves sample efficiency and reduces correlation between the agent's internal and external goals.

       ## 3.7 Trust Region Policy Optimization

        TRPO is a family of popular RL algorithms that uses trust regions to ensure convergence and guarantees safety. TRPO is designed to solve the problem of divergences occurring during policy updates. By reducing the change in the policy in a single iteration, TRPO maintains stability and prevents the agent from getting stuck in suboptimal policies.

        # 4 Temporal Difference Algorithms

        ## 4.1 Dynamic Programming

        DP solves the MDP problem exactly using dynamic programming. The most common algorithm for solving MDP is Policy Iteration algorithm, which alternates between policy evaluation and improvement phases. In each phase, the agent evaluates its policy by computing the state values using the current policy and then updates the policy by following the Bellman equation with respect to the updated values. With sufficient iterations, DP can find the optimal policy and the optimal value function.

        ## 4.2 Monte Carlo Methods

        MC methods use sample returns to approximate the expected returns of an episode. Monte Carlo methods can efficiently compute the value functions and policies under episodic and continuing tasks, whereas exact methods require access to the complete MDP formulation. The simplest way to implement MC methods is using first visit Monte Carlo, which accumulates rewards for a state only once. Alternatively, TD(0) algorithm uses bootstrapping, which computes the estimate of the next state value based on the present estimate of the current state value.

        ## 4.3 Eligibility Traces

        In eligibility traces, we keep track of the agent’s interest in each state and use it to determine which states to update in subsequent updates. Etraces work particularly well in sparse reward settings, where few actions lead to significant changes in the agent’s objective. ELFIS algorithm replaces the trace with a variable representing the strength of the link between the state and the last visited state.

        ## 4.4 Q-learning

        Q-learning is widely used in reinforcement learning literature and is known for its simplicity and effectiveness compared to other methods. At each step, the agent chooses an action based on its current perception of the environment, and the agent gets a scalar reward signal for its action selection. Then, the agent updates its estimated values for the taken actions using Bellman equation, and repeat the process for a fixed number of steps or until convergence. The Q-learning algorithm can be applied to both discrete and continuous action spaces.

        # 5 Unified Handling of Discrete and Continuous Action Spaces

        In general, the action space can be categorised into three types:

        1. Deterministic: Each action corresponds to a unique outcome;
        2. Probabilistic: Actions are associated with different probabilities;
        3. Stochastic: Actions have various effects, but the effects cannot be predicted precisely.

        In deterministic cases, we can define a separate action layer for each output node in the network architecture. On the other hand, in probabilistic scenarios, we can train multiple output nodes that correspond to different actions using cross entropy loss. Similarly, in stochastic scenarios, we can train a parametric distribution for each output node and sample an action from it during testing time. All these approaches have their advantages and drawbacks, but they allow the agent to handle a wider range of action spaces.

        # 6 Distributed and Parameterized Techniques

        Many successful RL algorithms rely heavily on parallelism and distributed computing for efficient training. Two common techniques used in distributed RL include synchronous and asynchronous algorithms. In synchronous algorithms, the update steps of different agents are synchronized, which can result in lower computation overhead. However, synchronisation introduces a lot of overhead due to the frequent communication among agents. In asynchronous algorithms, the agents exchange information asynchronously and communicate only when necessary, which leads to faster training speeds. Another important technique in distributed RL is parameter server, which allows the agent to share the learned parameters across multiple devices.

        # 7 Diversity and Generalization

        Researchers have been working on improving the diversity of policies discovered by RL agents by introducing novel exploration techniques such as Mutated Exploration Search (MES) and Novelty Search. These techniques search for diverse policies by mutating the current policy randomly or by introducing intentional errors. Other techniques involve increasing the diversity of input sequences generated by the agent, such as diverse rollout strategies and trajectory sampling. Generalization tests test the agent’s ability to solve previously unseen tasks by evaluating its performance on a validation set or test set. Several papers have proposed ways to measure the quality of policies, including intrinsic and extrinsic metrics.

        # 8 Zero-Sum Games vs Non-zero-Sum Games

        Although the term “game” might sound abstract at first glance, it is actually a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning. A game typically consists of two players who interact with a shared environment and receive rewards based on their actions. One player is designated as the “good” player and tries to maximize his or her cumulative reward whilst avoiding punishment from the “bad” player. If both players behave rationally and consistently, then it results in a zero-sum game. Otherwise, it results in a non-zero-sum game.
