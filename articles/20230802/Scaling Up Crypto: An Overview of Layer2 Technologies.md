        The field of blockchain technology is rapidly evolving with new development innovations and breakthroughs happening almost daily. As the industry continues to grow exponentially, it has become increasingly challenging for developers to create scalable and secure systems that can process a large volume of data quickly and reliably. In recent years, Layer-2 technologies have emerged as an alternative to increase network throughput and scale transaction processing. 
        
        
        This article will provide an overview of layer-2 technologies by reviewing several key concepts such as sidechains, rollups, state channels, and Plasma chains, and providing practical examples and applications. It will also include explanations of technical details, including scaling solutions like sharding, parallelization techniques, and consensus mechanisms used in these types of networks. Finally, we will discuss the current limitations and challenges in this space, and suggest directions for future research and development.
        
        
       # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
         ## Sidechains
        A sidechain is a layer two solution where one blockchain acts as a parent chain and another acting as its child chain or bridge chain connects them together. The idea behind sidechains lies in using various cryptographic protocols to ensure interoperability between different blockchains while maintaining decentralization.

         Common uses cases of sidechains include cross-chain atomic swaps, asset exchange, smart contract bridges, and payments across multiple chains. These use cases enable transfer of assets and value between different blockchains without going through a centralized platform.

         
        ### Rollups
        A rollup is a type of layer two architecture where transactions are grouped into blocks which are then submitted to a root chain but not finalized until a certain number of participants have agreed on the results. This means that any participant can verify that all transactions in each block were executed atomically before they are considered valid. 

         

        Despite their low overhead compared to a full node, rollups offer significant advantages over other forms of sidechain architecture. They allow more complex transactions and features like guaranteed execution time (SET) which ensures minimal latency between the submission of a transaction and its confirmation, making them ideal for high frequency trading applications.

         Other benefits of rolling up include faster confirmation times, lower fees due to reduced verification costs, and reduced operational burden since only a small percentage of transactions need to be reverted if there is a problem.

         There are many projects currently working on developing rollups for various use cases, ranging from financial services to gaming. However, they are still relatively early stages and require further development and testing before being adopted fully.

       ## State Channels 
        State channels are payment channels whose basic principle involves offloading computationally expensive processes onto one-off micropayments made directly among counterparties involved in the channel. Instead of relying on a trusted third party who validates all transactions, participants share information about their balances and proofs of correct execution in real-time via direct messaging. 

        Unlike traditional payment channels, state channels do not rely on trust minimization approaches like multi-hop routing and instead focus solely on optimizing the overall speed and efficiency of transaction processing. Compared to similar designs like Lightning Network, state channels offer significantly lower fees and better security guarantees for transacting within a distributed system.


         ## Plasma Chains
        A plasma chain is a type of layer two application built around the Plasma framework. Plasma is a framework designed specifically for building scalable, energy-efficient, and privacy-preserving blockchains. One main feature of Plasma is that it provides support for parallel processing of transactions, allowing multiple parties to independently validate and submit transactions simultaneously without the need for a single entity to coordinate the validation.

        Plasma chains differ from other layer two solutions in that they combine the best characteristics of both platforms. They offer fast transaction confirmation times thanks to concurrent processing of transactions, efficient storage capacity because of its tunable scaling properties, and virtually unlimited scalability thanks to Plasma's design.

         Current implementations of Plasma chains range from those based on sidechains and rollups, to fully standalone solutions that may involve several hundred validators running independently. 


      ## Coordination Contracts

        Coordination contracts are contracts that can be deployed once and run autonomously on the layer two networks. They serve to coordinate activities across different chains, ensuring that payments made from one blockchain can be received on another seamlessly. Examples of coordination contracts include ERC20-to-ERC20 token transfers, conditional transfers, and deposits/withdrawals across chains.


        ### Parallelization Techniques
        Parallelism is one of the most crucial issues in achieving high throughput on layer two networks. Various parallelisation techniques can help reduce the waiting time for transactions to be included in the main chain. Some common ones include sharding, batch processing, and signature aggregation.

         Sharding refers to dividing a large database or dataset into smaller partitions or chunks and distributing them across multiple servers. By doing so, workloads can be divided among multiple machines, reducing bottlenecks and improving performance.

          Batch processing involves aggregating multiple transactions into batches at regular intervals, reducing the number of requests sent to the main chain. It reduces transaction costs and improves overall network throughput. Signature aggregation allows multiple signers to produce a combined signature for a single transaction, reducing the risk of transaction fraud and improving security.

         

     ## Consensus Mechanisms
    Layer two networks typically operate under a weak form of consensus, known as proof of authority (PoA). While PoA does guarantee safety, it is vulnerable to attack and requires specialized hardware to maintain validator nodes. To address this issue, several alternate consensus mechanisms have been proposed, including BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance), Proof of Stake (POS), Proof of Work (POW), and committee based consensus algorithms.

    In addition to selecting an appropriate consensus mechanism, it is important to carefully consider the role of stakeholders and what level of participation they should demand. Depending on the selected mechanism, some networks may choose to open source their code for examination and contribution by interested developers. 

    On the flip side, some projects are seeking to partner with established institutions or companies to build out validator ecosystems and funding structures, enabling greater decentralization and resilience against attacks.
