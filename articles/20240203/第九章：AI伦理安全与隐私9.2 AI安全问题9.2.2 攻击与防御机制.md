AI Security: Attacks and Defenses
=================================

As we continue to develop and deploy increasingly complex AI systems, it becomes crucial that we consider the security implications of our designs. In this chapter, we will explore some of the unique challenges posed by AI systems, as well as strategies for addressing them.

Background
----------

In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile attacks on AI systems, highlighting the need for robust security measures. For example:

* In 2019, a researcher demonstrated a vulnerability in a popular home security system that allowed attackers to disable its cameras and microphones using ultrasonic signals (Cox, 2019).
* In 2020, researchers at IBM showed how they could manipulate a machine learning model's training data to cause it to misclassify images with high confidence (Hendrycks et al., 2020).
* Also in 2020, a team of researchers from the University of California, Berkeley demonstrated an attack on a natural language processing (NLP) model that allowed them to extract sensitive information from its training data (Carlini et al., 2020).

These examples illustrate just a few of the ways in which AI systems can be vulnerable to attack. In order to understand how these attacks work and how to defend against them, it is helpful to first establish some core concepts.

Core Concepts
-------------

### Adversarial Examples

An adversarial example is an input to a machine learning model that has been intentionally modified to cause the model to produce an incorrect output. These modifications are typically small and subtle, making them difficult to detect. For example, an adversarial example might involve adding a layer of noise to an image that causes a neural network to classify it incorrectly (Goodfellow et al., 2015).

Adversarial examples can be used to mount a variety of attacks on AI systems, including evasion attacks (in which an attacker tries to cause a model to misclassify inputs), poisoning attacks (in which an attacker modifies a model's training data to cause it to behave incorrectly), and model inversion attacks (in which an attacker attempts to reconstruct a model's training data based on its outputs).

### Model Inversion Attacks

Model inversion attacks involve attempting to reconstruct a machine learning model's training data based on the model's outputs. This can be done by providing the model with a set of inputs and observing its outputs, then using this information to infer properties about the training data.

Model inversion attacks can be used to extract sensitive information from a model's training data. For example, if a medical AI system has been trained on patient records, an attacker might be able to use a model inversion attack to extract sensitive health information about those patients.

### Poisoning Attacks

Poisoning attacks involve modifying a machine learning model's training data in order to cause it to behave incorrectly. This can be done by injecting malicious data into the training set or by modifying existing data.

Poisoning attacks can be used to cause a model to misclassify inputs or to produce biased outputs. For example, an attacker might modify the training data of a self-driving car system in order to cause it to misinterpret stop signs, leading to accidents.

Algorithmic Principles
----------------------

There are a number of algorithms and techniques that can be used to defend against adversarial examples and other attacks on AI systems. Some of the most effective include:

### Adversarial Training

Adversarial training involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that includes both normal examples and adversarial examples. By doing so, the model learns to be more robust to adversarial attacks.

Adversarial training can be implemented using a variety of methods, including:

* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: GANs consist of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic examples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and synthetic examples. By training the generator to create adversarial examples that can fool the discriminator, we can improve the model's robustness to adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2015).
* **Adversarial Example Detection**: Another approach to adversarial training is to train a separate model to detect adversarial examples. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as density estimation (Feinman et al., 2017) or reconstruction error (Meng
