Preface: From Monoliths to Microservices
---------------------------------------

In recent years, the trend has shifted from monolithic architectures towards microservices-based ones. This shift was primarily driven by the need for scalability, maintainability, and resilience in modern software systems. As a result, distributed tracing has emerged as an essential tool for monitoring and debugging complex applications composed of multiple services communicating over networks. In this article, we will explore the principles and practices of distributed tracing, enabling you to understand and utilize it effectively.

## Background

<a name="monolithic-architecture"></a>
### Monolithic Architecture

Monolithic architecture refers to a single, self-contained application with all its components deployed together. While simple to develop and deploy, monolithic applications suffer from several drawbacks, such as tight coupling, lack of scalability, and difficulty in maintaining and updating individual components.

<a name="microservices-architecture"></a>
### Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture decomposes an application into smaller, loosely coupled services that communicate via APIs or message queues. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, making it easier to manage and update individual components without affecting others. However, managing inter-service communication and understanding system behavior become more challenging due to the distributed nature of these applications.

<a name="core-concepts"></a>

## Core Concepts & Relationships

<a name="distributed-system"></a>
### Distributed System

A distributed system consists of multiple interacting components, typically spread across different nodes or machines, communicating through a network. Components may include servers, databases, message queues, or other services. Understanding the behavior of a distributed system requires analyzing the interactions between its components.

<a name="trace"></a>
### Trace

A trace represents a single request's lifetime as it passes through various services within a distributed system. It captures the end-to-end journey, allowing developers to analyze performance, diagnose errors, and optimize their applications.

<a name="span"></a>
### Span

A span is a unit of work done in a distributed system. It represents a logical operation within a service and contains metadata about the operation, such as start time, duration, and tags (key-value pairs). Spans can be nested, forming a tree-like structure, where child spans represent operations invoked by parent spans.

<a name="correlation-id"></a>
### Correlation ID

A correlation ID is a unique identifier assigned to each incoming request. It propagates across service boundaries during inter-service communication, enabling related operations to be grouped together in a trace. This allows developers to follow the flow of requests and responses throughout the system.

<a name="algorithms-and-operational-steps"></a>

## Algorithms & Operational Steps

<a name="sampling"></a>
### Sampling

Sampling is the process of selecting traces for detailed analysis while discarding others. Since analyzing every trace can be resource-intensive, sampling enables developers to focus on a representative subset of traces, balancing visibility and resource usage. Common sampling strategies include probabilistic, deterministic, and adaptive approaches.

<a name="propagation"></a>
### Propagation

Propagation involves passing the correlation ID between services as they communicate with one another. This ensures that related operations are grouped together, regardless of which services are involved. Popular propagation methods include header-based, context-based, and message-based approaches.

<a name="aggregation"></a>
### Aggregation

Aggregation refers to collecting and summarizing data from multiple traces to provide insights into system behavior. By aggregating data over time, developers can identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, helping them optimize and troubleshoot their applications.

## Best Practices

<a name="code-examples"></a>
### Code Examples

#### Java
```java
import brave.Tracer;
import brave.Span;
import brave.Tracing;
import brave.propagation.CurrentTraceContext;
import brave.propagation.TraceContext;
import io.opentracing.ScopeManager;
import io.opentracing.SpanContext;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;
import io.opentracing.tag.Tags;
import zipkin2.Endpoint;
import zipkin2.Span;
import zipkin2.reporter.Reporter;
import zipkin2.reporter.okhttp3.OkHttpSender;
```
#### Python
```python
from opentracing import Tracer
from opentracing.propagation import Format, TextMap carrier
import zipkin.reporters
import zipkin.tracer
from zipkin.endpoint import ITelemetry, MemoryTelemetry
```
Create a tracer instance and configure it based on your use case. For example:

#### Java
```java
Tracing tracing = Tracing.newBuilder()
  .localServiceName("my-service")
  .build();

Tracer tracer = tracing.tracer();
```
#### Python
```python
tracer = Tracer(
   zipkin.reporters.JSONReporter(url),
   sample_rate=0.1
)
```
Start a new span when handling an incoming request:

#### Java
```java
Span span = tracer.buildSpan("operation-name").start();
try (Scope scope = tracer.activateSpan(span)) {
   // Perform the operation here
} finally {
   span.finish();
}
```
#### Python
```python
with tracer.start_active_span('operation-name'):
   # Perform the operation here
```
Add metadata to a span using tags:

#### Java
```java
span.setTag(Tags.HTTP_URL, "https://example.com");
span.setTag(Tags.SPAN_KIND, Tags.SPAN_KIND_RPC_CLIENT);
```
#### Python
```python
span.set_tag('http.url', 'https://example.com')
span.set_tag(Tags.SPAN_KIND, Tags.SPAN_KIND_RPC_CLIENT)
```
Propagate the correlation ID using headers:

#### Java
```java
carrier.put(Format.Builtin.HTTP_HEADERS.getHeaderName(), "trace-id");
tracer.inject(tracer.extract(Format.Builtin.HTTP_HEADERS, carrier), Format.Builtin.HTTP_HEADERS, carrier);
```
#### Python
```python
carrier = {'b3': '0123456789012345'}
tracer.inject(tracer.extract(Format.Builtin.HTTP_HEADERS, carrier), Format.Builtin.HTTP_HEADERS, carrier)
```
Send traces to a Zipkin collector:

#### Java
```java
Reporter reporter = OkHttpSender.create("http://zipkin-collector:9411/api/v2/spans");
tracing.tracer().getSpanReporter().report(span);
```
#### Python
```python
tracer.flush()
```
