## 5. Background Introduction

### 5.1 Overview of AI Model Training

In this section, we will briefly introduce the basics of AI model training to help readers better understand the importance and necessity of hyperparameter optimization and learning rate adjustment strategies. AI models learn from large datasets through various algorithms like gradient descent. However, these algorithms are sensitive to specific settings called hyperparameters that significantly affect their performance.

<a name="52-importance-of-hyperparameter-optimization"></a>

### 5.2 Importance of Hyperparameter Optimization

Hyperparameters are crucial for AI models because they control how an algorithm learns and generalizes knowledge from data. Properly tuned hyperparameters can lead to faster convergence, improved accuracy, and more robust models. Conversely, poorly chosen hyperparameters may result in slow learning, overfitting, or underfitting. Therefore, understanding hyperparameters, their relationships, and optimizing them is essential to obtain high-performing AI models.

<a name="6-core-concepts-and-relationships"></a>

## 6. Core Concepts and Relationships

### 6.1 Definition of Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are parameters that govern the behavior and performance of machine learning algorithms during training. Unlike model parameters that are learned directly from the dataset, hyperparameters are set before training begins and remain constant throughout the process. They include learning rates, regularization coefficients, batch sizes, and others depending on the specific algorithm.

### 6.2 Impact of Hyperparameters on Model Performance

Hyperparameters play a critical role in determining the quality of learning, convergence speed, and overall performance of AI models. For example, learning rates control the step size at each iteration of the training process; regularization coefficients prevent overfitting by controlling the trade-off between fitting the data and preserving model simplicity. Selecting appropriate values for these hyperparameters significantly impacts the final model's effectiveness.

### 6.3 Definition of the Learning Rate

The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at each iteration of the training process when updating model parameters using gradient descent or other optimization methods. It controls how aggressively or conservatively the model learns from new data points. A higher learning rate may result in faster convergence but could also cause overshooting and instability, while a lower learning rate may lead to slower convergence and potentially getting stuck in local optima.

<a name="7-algorithm-principle-and-operational-steps"></a>

## 7. Algorithm Principle and Operational Steps

### 7.1 Gradient Descent Algorithm Review

Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize objective functions or loss functions in machine learning problems. The primary goal is to find optimal model parameters that minimize the difference between predicted and actual values. At each iteration, the algorithm updates the parameters based on the negative gradient of the objective function concerning the current parameter values. Mathematically, it is expressed as follows:

$$
\theta_{i} = \theta_{i - 1} - \alpha \cdot \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)
$$

where $\theta$ represents the model parameters, $\alpha$ denotes the learning rate, $J(\theta)$ signifies the objective function, and $\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)$ calculates the gradient of the objective function with respect to the model parameters.

### 7.2 Learning Rate Effect on Gradient Descent

As mentioned earlier, the learning rate is a critical hyperparameter in gradient descent. A well-tuned learning rate ensures fast convergence, avoids overshooting, and prevents getting stuck in local minima. On the other hand, an improperly selected learning rate may result in slow convergence, oscillations, or divergence.

### 7.3 Commonly Used Learning Rate Adjustment Strategies

There are several learning rate adjustment strategies available for AI model training. This section introduces some common ones, including fixed learning rates, step decay learning rates, exponential decay learning rates, 1/t learning rates, cyclical learning rates, SGD with momentum, and adaptive learning rates (AdaGrad, AdaDelta, and Adam).

#### 7.3.1 Fixed Learning Rate

Fixed learning rates maintain a constant value throughout the training process. While simple to implement, fixed learning rates often require manual tuning and can be suboptimal since the ideal learning rate might change during training.

#### 7.3.2 Step Decay Learning Rate

Step decay learning rates periodically decrease the learning rate by a fixed factor after a specified number of epochs or iterations. This strategy helps balance exploration and exploitation during training and can improve convergence and model stability.

#### 7.3.3 Exponential Decay Learning Rate

Exponential decay learning rates reduce the learning rate by a multiplicative factor at each iteration or epoch. Compared to step decay learning rates, exponential decay offers smoother changes in learning rates and better adapts to changing gradients during training.

#### 7.3.4 1/t Learning Rate

The 1/t learning rate gradually decreases the learning rate as the inverse of the total number of completed iterations ($t$). This approach provides a smooth and continuous reduction in learning rates, allowing for stable convergence without requiring manual intervention.

#### 7.3.5 Cyclical Learning Rates

Cyclical learning rates vary the learning rate within a predefined range according to a cyclic pattern. This method encourages exploration during early stages of training and fine-tuning towards the end, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation.

#### 7.3.6 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Momentum

SGD with momentum incorporates historical gradient information into the update rule to stabilize and accelerate learning. By combining past and present gradients, this method reduces oscillations and improves convergence.

#### 7.3.7 Adaptive Learning Rates

Adaptive learning rates automatically adjust the learning rate based on the observed changes in gradients during training. These methods include AdaGrad, AdaDelta, and Adam, which we will discuss next.

##### 7.3.7.1 AdaGrad

AdaGrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter individually, taking into account the frequency and magnitude of historical gradient observations. It normalizes the learning rate for each parameter based on historical squared gradients, providing smaller learning rates for frequently updated parameters and larger learning rates for infrequently updated ones.

##### 7.3.7.2 AdaDelta

AdaDelta extends AdaGrad by addressing its shortcoming in handling accumulated historical gradients. Instead of maintaining a running average over all historical gradients, AdaDelta uses a moving average window to capture recent gradient information. This allows for more efficient adaptation of learning rates and improved training performance.

##### 7.3.7.3 Adam

Adam combines ideas from both momentum and adaptive gradient methods. It maintains separate estimates for first and second moments of the gradient and employs bias correction to ensure accurate estimates. Adam has gained popularity due to its robustness and efficiency in training deep neural networks.

<a name="74-mathematical-models-and-formulas"></a>

### 7.4 Mathematical Models and Formulas

#### 7.4.1 Learning Rate Schedules

Learning rate schedules outline how the learning rate should change over time or based on specific conditions. Examples include fixed learning rates, step decay learning rates, exponential decay learning rates, and 1/t learning rates. The following formulas illustrate these learning rate schedules:

* **Fixed learning rate**: $\alpha_{t} = \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a constant.
* **Step decay learning rate**: $\alpha_{t} = \alpha_{0} \cdot d^{n}$, where $d < 1$, $n$ denotes the current epoch or iteration, and $\alpha_{0}$ represents the initial learning rate.
* **Exponential decay learning rate**: $\alpha_{t} = \alpha_{0} \cdot e^{-kt}$, where $k > 0$ controls the decay rate, and $t$ signifies the current epoch or iteration.
* **1/t learning rate**: $\alpha_{t} = \frac{\alpha_{0}}{t}$, where $\alpha_{0}$ is the initial learning rate, and $t$ denotes the current epoch or iteration.

#### 7.4.2 Adaptive Learning Rate Methods

Adaptive learning rate methods like AdaGrad, AdaDelta, and Adam modify the learning rate dynamically during training. They consider historical gradient information to adjust learning rates, improving convergence and model stability.

* **AdaGrad**: $\alpha_{t} = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{G_{t} + \epsilon}}$, where $\alpha$ is the initial learning rate, $G_{t}$ is the sum of squared historical gradients up to time $t$, and $\epsilon$ is a small positive value added for numerical stability.
* **AdaDelta**: $\alpha_{t} = -\frac{\sqrt{S_{t-1} + \rho}}{\sqrt{G_{t} + \rho}} \cdot m_{t}$, where $m_{t}$ is the moving average of historical gradients up to time $t$, $S_{t-1}$ is the moving average of historical squared gradients up to time $t - 1$, $\rho$ is a smoothing factor, and $G_{t}$ is the current gradient.
* **Adam**: $\alpha_{t} = \alpha \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1 - \beta_{2}^{t}}}{1 - \beta_{1}^{t}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1 - \beta_{2}^{t}}}{\sqrt{v_{t} + \epsilon}}$, where $\alpha$ is the initial learning rate, $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ are exponential decay rates, $v_{t}$ is the biased first moment estimate, and $m_{t}$ is the biased second raw moment estimate.
