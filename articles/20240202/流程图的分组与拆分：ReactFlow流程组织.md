### 1. Background Introduction

#### 1.1 What is a Flowchart?

A flowchart is a diagram that represents an algorithm or a process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting these with arrows. It is a graphical representation of an algorithm, and is used in various fields, such as computer science, software engineering, and business process management.

#### 1.2 What is ReactFlow?

ReactFlow is a library for building interactive flowchart components using React. It provides a set of reusable components, such as Nodes, Edges, and Controls, which can be used to create custom flowchart applications. It also includes features like zooming, panning, and undo/redo, making it easy to build complex and dynamic flowcharts.

#### 1.3 The Importance of Grouping and Splitting

When working with large and complex flowcharts, it is essential to organize the elements into groups and split them into smaller sub-charts. This helps to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability. By grouping related nodes and edges together, we can reduce clutter and make the overall structure more apparent. By splitting the chart into smaller parts, we can work on each part independently and avoid getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the whole.

### 2. Core Concepts and Relationships

#### 2.1 Nodes and Edges

The basic building blocks of a flowchart are nodes and edges. A node represents a step in the process, while an edge represents the connection between two steps. In ReactFlow, nodes and edges are represented by the `Node` and `Edge` components, respectively.

#### 2.2 Groups

A group is a collection of nodes and edges that are treated as a single unit. Groups can be nested, allowing for hierarchical organization. In ReactFlow, groups are represented by the `Group` component.

#### 2.3 Sub-Charts

A sub-chart is a separate flowchart that is embedded within another flowchart. Sub-charts can be used to break down complex processes into smaller, more manageable pieces. In ReactFlow, sub-charts are represented by the `SubChart` component.

#### 2.4 Relationships

The relationships between nodes, edges, groups, and sub-charts can be summarized as follows:

* A node can belong to zero or one group.
* An edge can connect any number of nodes.
* A group can contain any number of nodes and edges.
* A sub-chart can contain any number of nodes, edges, groups, and other sub-charts.

### 3. Algorithmic Principles and Specific Operational Steps, along with Mathematical Models and Formulas

#### 3.1 Grouping Algorithm

The grouping algorithm involves selecting a set of nodes and edges that should be grouped together. This can be done manually, by dragging a selection box over the desired elements, or automatically, by using algorithms like clustering or community detection. Once the elements have been selected, they can be grouped together using the `Group` component.

#### 3.2 Splitting Algorithm

The splitting algorithm involves dividing a chart into smaller sub-charts. This can be done manually, by dragging a selection box over the desired elements and creating a new sub-chart, or automatically, by using algorithms like graph partitioning or flow simulation. Once the sub-chart has been created, it can be embedded within the parent chart using the `SubChart` component.

#### 3.3 Mathematical Models

The mathematical models used in flowchart organization depend on the specific algorithm being used. For example, clustering algorithms may use distance metrics or similarity measures to determine which elements should be grouped together. Graph partitioning algorithms may use minimum cut criteria or modularity measures to divide the graph into smaller sub-graphs.

#### 3.4 Formulas

Some common formulas used in flowchart organization include:

* Distance metric: $d(u, v) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(u\_i -
