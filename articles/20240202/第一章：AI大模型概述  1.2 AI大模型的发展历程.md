AI大模型的发展历程
=================

## 1.2.1 起源

### 1.2.1.1 symbolic AI

在20世纪50年代，人工智能的研究由数学逻辑学家Alan Turing 和 John McCarthy等人发起，其初衷是利用形式化语言和符号处理技术来模拟人类的智能行为。这种方法被称为符号 artificial intelligence (symbolic AI)。

symbolic AI 的主要思想是，利用符号（token）表示知识，并通过规则（rule）来操纵这些符号，从而实现智能行为。 symbolic AI 的代表作品包括 expert systems 和 inference engines，它们被广泛应用在医疗、金融、制造业等领域。

然而，symbolic AI 存在一个基本的问题，那就是知识 engineering 成本过高。 symbolic AI 需要人类专家手动编写大量的规则和符号，这限制了它的扩展性和适用性。

### 1.2.1.2 connectionism

face recognition, object detection, speech recognition, machine translation and so on.

connectionism 的思想是，将人类的大脑视为一种神经网络（neural network），它由大量简单的neuron（神经元）组成，每个neuron 收集输入信号，经过 non-linear transformation（非线性变换），产生输出信号。

connectionism 的优点是，它能够自动学习和 generalize from data, without the need for explicit knowledge engineering. However, connectionism also has its limitations, such as the difficulty of interpreting the model and the lack of explainability.

## 1.2.2 发展

### 1.2.2.1 shallow models

The first wave of deep learning started in the 1980s with the introduction of backpropagation and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). These models were called shallow models because they only had one or two hidden layers. Shallow models were successful in solving many simple problems, such as handwritten digit recognition and speech recognition.

### 1.2.2.2 deep models

The second wave of deep learning started in the 2010s with the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These models were called deep models because they had many hidden layers. Deep models were successful in solving many complex problems, such as image classification, natural language processing, and game playing.

Deep models have several advantages over shallow models. First, they can learn more complex features by stacking multiple non-linear transformations. Second, they can capture hierarchical structures in data, such as spatial and temporal dependencies. Third, they can handle large amounts of data and computational resources.

However, deep models also have some challenges. First, they require a lot of data and computational resources to train. Second, they are prone to overfitting and regularization techniques are needed to mitigate this problem. Third, they are hard to interpret and explain, which raises concerns about their reliability and safety.

## 1.2.3 frontiers

### 1.2.3.1 few-shot learning

Few-shot learning is a subfield of machine learning that aims to learn a model from a few examples. The idea is to reduce the amount of labeled data required to train a model, and make it more adaptable to new domains and tasks. Few-shot learning has several applications, such as robotics, medical diagnosis, and natural language understanding.

### 1.2.3.2 transfer learning

Transfer learning is a subfield of machine learning that aims to leverage pre-trained models for new tasks. The idea is to reuse the knowledge and parameters learned from one task, and fine-tune them for another related task. Transfer learning has several benefits, such as reducing the amount of data and computation required, improving the performance and generalization of the model, and enabling cross-modal and cross-domain learning.

### 1.2.3.3 unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is a subfield of machine learning that aims to learn a model from unlabeled data. The idea is to discover the underlying structure and patterns in data, without the need for explicit supervision or feedback. Unsupervised learning has several applications, such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

### 1.2.3.4 reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that aims to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward in a sequential decision-making process. The idea is to interact with an environment and receive feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjust the policy accordingly. Reinforcement learning has several applications, such as robotics, games, and autonomous systems.

## 1.2.4 challenges

### 1.2.4.1 data scarcity

Data scarcity is a common challenge in many real-world scenarios, where collecting and labeling data is expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. Data scarcity limits the performance and generalization of machine learning models, and requires special techniques to overcome, such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and few-shot learning.

### 1.2.4.2 model interpretability

Model interpretability is a important requirement for many applications, where understanding how the model makes decisions and why it fails is crucial for trust, safety, and accountability. Model interpretability is challenging for deep learning models, which rely on complex and opaque representations and transformations. Researchers are exploring various methods to improve model interpretability, such as visualization, explanation, and validation.

### 1.2.4.3 ethical considerations

Ethical considerations are becoming increasingly important in AI research and development, as AI systems may affect human values, rights, and welfare. Ethical considerations include fairness, transparency, privacy, security, accountability, and responsibility. Researchers and practitioners need to address these issues in the design, deployment, and use of AI systems, and ensure that they align with human values and norms.

### 1.2.4.4 societal impact

Societal impact is a broader aspect of AI research and development, which involves not only technical but also social, economic, cultural, and political factors. Societal impact includes opportunities, benefits, risks, harms, and challenges for individuals, groups, organizations, and societies. Researchers and practitioners need to anticipate and manage these impacts, and engage with stakeholders to co-create responsible and sustainable AI systems.
