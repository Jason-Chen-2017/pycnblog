### 1. 背景介绍

#### 1.1. 什么是分布式系统？

分布式系统是一组通过网络连接起来的 autonomous computers，它们协同工作以完成共同的 task。这些 computer 被称为 nodes，它们可以是物理机器或虚拟机。分布式系统中的 nodes 可以位于相同的 room，building，campus，city，country 甚至 planet。

#### 1.2. 为什么需要分布式系统？

随着互联网的普及和数字化转型，越来越多的 application 需要处理海量 data，并提供 low latency response。单机 system 已经无法满足这些 requirement，因此需要分布式 system 来解决这些 challenge。

### 2. 核心概念与联系

#### 2.1. 分布式系统 vs. Parallel System vs. Cluster System

* **Parallel System**：multiple processors cooperate to solve a single problem, typically on a single computer.
* **Cluster System**：a collection of interconnected computers working together so that they can be viewed as a single system.
* **Distributed System**：a collection of autonomous computers, connected via a network and interacting with each other to achieve a common goal.

#### 2.2. 分布式系统的 Five Key Properties

* **Concurrency**: the ability of a system to deal with multiple tasks at the same time.
* **Fault Tolerance**: the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of failure of (parts of) the system.
* **Scalability**: the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources to the system.
* **Transparency**: the property that makes it appear to the user as if the system was not distributed.
* **Security**: the protection of a system against unauthorized access or malicious behavior.

### 3. 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

#### 3.1. 分布式一致性算法（Distributed Consistency Algorithms）

##### 3.1.1. Two Generals' Problem

Two Generals' Problem is a thought experiment that illustrates the challenges of achieving consistency in a distributed system. It involves two generals, each commanding a separate army, who are planning to attack a common enemy. The generals can only communicate through messengers, and they must agree on a time to attack. However, the messengers may be intercepted or delayed, leading to inconsistencies in the communication.

##### 3.1.2. Distributed Consensus Protocols

Distributed consensus protocols are algorithms that allow a group of nodes to agree on a value, even in the presence of failures. There are many different consensus protocols, including Paxos, Raft, and Multi-Paxos. These protocols use various techniques, such as leader election and quorum intersection, to ensure consistency.

###### 3.1.2.1. Paxos Algorithm

Paxos is a classic consensus algorithm that ensures consistency in a distributed system. It consists of three main phases: Prepare, Promise, and Accept. In the Prepare phase, a proposer sends a prepare request to a set of acceptors. The acceptors then respond with their current highest-numbered promise. In the Promise phase, the proposer selects a proposal number and sends an accept request to the acceptors. The acceptors then promise to accept the proposal if no higher-numbered proposal is received. In the Accept phase, the acceptors send their decisions back to the proposer. If a majority of acceptors have promised to accept the proposal, the proposer can consider the proposal accepted.

###### 3.1.2.2. Raft Algorithm

Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easier to understand than Paxos. It uses a leader-follower model, where one node is elected as the leader and the others are followers. The leader is responsible for managing the cluster and ensuring consistency. Raft uses a log replication mechanism to ensure that all nodes have the same data.

##### 3.1.3. Distributed Transactions

Distributed transactions are a way to ensure consistency across multiple databases in a distributed system. They use a two-phase commit protocol to coordinate the transaction. The protocol consists of a prepare phase and a commit phase. In the prepare phase, the transaction coordinator sends a prepare request to all participating databases. If all databases respond success
