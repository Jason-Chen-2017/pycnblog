# 1.简介
  

> Cluster alignment is an essential problem in pattern recognition, which aims to match multiple clusterings of objects into a single global clustering that minimizes some similarity or dissimilarity measure between their corresponding subsets. The traditional methods for solving this problem involve kernel functions, such as RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernels, but recently, there has been growing interest in other kernel-based algorithms that do not rely on explicit kernel function computation or approximation. In this article, we will review two recent algorithms for solving cluster alignment problems: kernel mean matching and spectral clustering with eigenvectors. We will also discuss how these algorithms are related and what challenges remain for advancing the state of the art.

Cluster alignment是模式识别中一个重要的问题，其目标是在给定多个对象的聚类结果后找到一种全局的聚类方式，使得各个子集之间的相似性或不相似性的测度最小。传统的方法往往依赖于核函数（Radial Basis Function）来解决这个问题，但是最近，人们越来越感兴趣于其他不需要显式计算或者近似的核函数的算法。在本文中，我们将会总结两种近期用于解决聚类对齐问题的算法：核平均匹配（Kernel Mean Matching）算法和带特征向量（eigenvectors）的谱聚类算法。我们也会讨论这些算法的相关性以及目前存在的挑战。

 # 2.基本概念及术语说明
  - **Pattern recognition**: Pattern recognition refers to the task of identifying meaningful patterns within data sets, using various statistical techniques and mathematical models. It is one of the most fundamental fields of machine learning and AI.
  - **Clusters:** A set of objects or points grouped together because of certain similarities among them. They can be formed by hierarchical agglomerative clustering or k-means algorithm.
  - **Kernel function:** A mathematical function used to convert raw input data to a higher-dimensional space where nonlinear relationships can be modeled more effectively than linear ones. Kernel functions can be seen as generalized distance measures over inputs from different distributions. There are several types of kernel functions including radial basis function (RBF), sigmoidal, polynomial, and other types.
  - **Mean shift:** A popular clustering method based on density estimation, which detects the areas of high density separated by low density regions. It computes the mean value of each region in a spatial map and moves the center of mass towards it iteratively until convergence. 
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA is a technique used for dimensionality reduction that finds the principal components (linear combinations of features) explaining maximum variance in the dataset. It transforms the original feature vectors into new ones whose directions have maximal variance.

## 3.1 算法描述
> Kernel Mean Matching (KMM) is a popular approach for solving the cluster alignment problem when dealing with categorical variables rather than continuous values. KMM first constructs a joint probability distribution between all pairs of clusters from the labeled datasets, then applies a Gaussian kernel to estimate the density around each pair of clusters, resulting in a similarity matrix. Finally, it uses graph-based optimization techniques to find the optimal permutation of the labels to minimize the dissimilarity between the joint probabilistic model and the empirical distribution of the labels. This approach can handle large amounts of data without explicitly computing kernel matrices, making it useful for very large datasets like images or speech signals. However, unlike kernel methods based on SVD decomposition, KMM does not require a priori assumptions about the structure of the data beyond the number of clusters and the presence of noise. Moreover, since it relies only on distances between clusters and does not make any assumption about the shape of the underlying distribution, it may perform better than other approaches depending on the choice of similarity metric or noise level.

核平均匹配（KMM）是一种基于核函数的最近邻算法，用于处理连续变量（如实数值）而非离散变量（如分类变量）。KMM首先根据标记数据集构建所有集群对的联合概率分布，然后利用高斯核估计每个集群对的密度，从而得到相似性矩阵。之后，它采用图形优化技术寻找标签的最优排列，以最小化联合概率模型与标签经验分布之间的差异。通过避免显式地计算核矩阵，该方法可以有效地处理大量数据，尤其适合像图像、音频信号等非常大的数据。然而，与基于SVD分解的核方法不同，KMM没有关于数据的先验假设，只要确定了数据的簇个数以及是否存在噪声即可。此外，由于仅仅考虑了两个集群之间的距离并不做任何关于底层分布形状的假设，因此可能优于其他算法，取决于选择的相似性指标或噪声级别。 

The basic idea behind KMM is to construct a joint probability distribution between all pairs of clusters from the labeled datasets, apply a Gaussian kernel to estimate the density around each pair of clusters, and use graph-based optimization techniques to find the optimal permutation of the labels to minimize the dissimilarity between the joint probabilistic model and the empirical distribution of the labels. Specifically, the procedure follows these steps:

1. Compute the conditional probabilities $P(x_i|y)$ and $P(x_j|y)$ for every pair $(x_i, x_j)\in X$ where $X$ is the joint sample space consisting of all possible label assignments $\{(x_{ij}, y_k)\}$, where $x_{ij}$ denotes the $i$-th observation in the $j$-th dataset and $y_k\in Y=\{1,\ldots,K\}$ represents the $k$-th class label. These conditional probabilities can be computed efficiently using MLE estimates of the parameters in Bayesian classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis, etc.

2. Construct the similarity matrix $S$, where $S_{kl}=k(1-\rho)-l(1+\rho)$, where $k, l$ represent the indices of the two clusters being compared, and $\rho$ is the bandwidth parameter that controls the width of the kernel function. By default, $\rho=1$. To avoid degenerate cases, a small constant epsilon ($10^{-5}< \epsilon < 0.1$) is added to $\rho$. The goal is to trade off between fitting the local geometry of the data and capturing long-range dependencies across the entire dataset. 

3. Apply spectral clustering to the similarity matrix obtained in step 2, resulting in a partition of the data into clusters. Each cluster corresponds to a subset of the samples, represented by its centroid.

4. Find the optimal permutation of the labels by optimizing a cost function that compares the empirical distributions of the labeled data to the predicted distributions according to the learned clusters. One common loss function for comparing the two distributions is cross entropy.

5. Return the final optimized assignment of labels that maximizes the mutual information between the two partitions.

To summarize, KMM involves constructing a joint probability distribution, applying a kernel function to estimate the density around each pair of clusters, finding the optimal permutation of labels using graph-based optimization techniques, and returning the final optimized assignment of labels that maximizes the mutual information between the two partitions. 

## 3.2 核函数Kernel Functions
> Kernel functions play a crucial role in many applications of machine learning, particularly those involving non-linear relationships between input data. A kernel function takes an input point x, maps it onto a higher dimensional space (usually called the feature space), and returns a scalar value indicating the similarity between x and another point z. When applied repeatedly to a collection of training examples, they capture complex relationships between the inputs and produce a highly dimensional representation of the data that facilitates effective classification and regression tasks. Common choices of kernel functions include RBF (Radial Basis Function), Sigmoidal, Polynomial, and other types. Another important aspect of kernel functions is that they allow us to approximate a solution to a kernelized problem by reducing it to a convex optimization problem. Additionally, some kernel functions provide automatic feature selection, meaning they automatically identify the most relevant features for a given task. For example, in support vector machines (SVMs), the dot product between the input data and their weights form a kernel function that enables automated feature selection and improves the performance of SVMs.

核函数是机器学习的一个重要组成部分，特别是在涉及输入数据之间存在非线性关系时。核函数接收输入点x，将其映射到更高维的空间（通常称作特征空间），并返回一个标量值，表示x与另一点z之间的相似度。当应用多次到训练样例集合上时，它们能够捕获输入数据的复杂关系，并产生高度维度的表示，从而促进分类和回归任务的有效执行。常见的核函数包括径向基函数（Radial Basis Function）、Sigmoidal、多项式、其他类型的核函数。另外，核函数还提供了一个自动特征选择的功能，意味着它们能够自动识别出最相关的特征来实现某种任务。例如，在支持向量机（Support Vector Machine，SVMs）中，输入数据和权重的点积就是一种核函数，它可以实现自动特征选择并提升SVM性能。

## 3.3 高斯核函数Gaussian Kernel
> A commonly used type of kernel function is the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, which is defined as $K(x_i, x_j)=e^{-\gamma ||x_i-x_j||^2}$. Here, $x_i$ and $x_j$ are points in the input space, and $\gamma$ is a hyperparameter controlling the width of the kernel function. Intuitively, the larger $\gamma$ is, the wider the kernel tends to be, and the smoother the decision boundary becomes. Mathematically, the RBF kernel produces smooth interpolation between nearby points, making it well suited for problems with non-linearity and few training examples. The choice of the correct kernel function can significantly affect the overall performance of machine learning algorithms, especially if the input features are non-linearly separable.

一种常用的核函数类型是径向基函数（Radial Basis Function，RBF）核，它定义为$K(x_i, x_j)=e^{-\gamma ||x_i-x_j||^2}$。这里，$x_i$ 和 $x_j$ 是输入空间中的点，$\gamma$ 是控制核函数宽度的参数。直观地说，随着$\gamma$的增大，核函数变得越宽，越平滑。更确切地说，RBF核产生接近于邻域点的平滑插值，适用于具有非线性和较少训练样本的各种问题。正确选择核函数对于机器学习算法的整体性能影响很大，特别是在输入特征不好分割的时候。

## 3.4 伸缩性与局部感知
> Since the similarity matrix is constructed from the joint probability distribution directly, KMM does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality or vanishing gradients due to the sparsity of the joint distribution. Instead, it works well even with large numbers of dimensions and numerous clusters. This makes KMM suitable for handling high-dimensional sparse data, such as text documents or image pixels, while still maintaining good accuracy on typical benchmarks. Also, KMM is able to adapt dynamically to changes in the underlying distribution by updating the similarity matrix at each iteration, ensuring that it remains accurate even as the size and complexity of the data change over time. Finally, KMM naturally handles missing values and outliers, which cannot be handled by traditional clustering methods. Overall, KMM provides a simple, robust, and efficient approach to solving the cluster alignment problem with categorical data.

由于相似性矩阵直接来自联合概率分布，所以KMM无需担心维度灾难或梯度消失导致的稀疏联合分布的困扰。KMM可以很好地处理拥有大量特征和多个聚类的高维稀疏数据，比如文本文档或图像像素。这样就可以满足处理典型基准测试时的精度要求，并且KMM能够灵活地适应数据的变化，使其仍然保持良好的准确性。最后，KMM自然地处理了缺失值和异常值，这种方式不能被传统的聚类方法所处理。综上所述，KMM提供了一种简单、健壮且高效的方法来解决聚类对齐问题中的分类数据。
