# 2. Basic Concepts of Linear Algebra
  ## 2.1 Matrices and Vectors
  A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. In linear algebra, we usually use upper-case letters for matrices to distinguish them from vectors (which are column or row matrices), as well as the lower-case letter "matrix". For example, let $A$ be a $m\times n$ matrix, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. The element at position $(i,j)$ of this matrix is denoted by $a_{ij}$.

  Similarly, a vector is also an array of numbers but only one dimension. We can represent it using either a horizontal or vertical line. If it's written horizontally, then we call it a column vector; if it's written vertically, we call it a row vector. It is important to note that vectors must have the same number of elements as their corresponding dimensions. So, for instance, $\vec{x}$ could be a vector with $n$ elements, while $\vec{y}$ could be a vector with $m$ elements, which would make the multiplication not possible.  

  ### Properties of Matrices
  Here are some properties of matrices that should be known before moving on to more complex topics such as matrix operations:
  
  1. Addition: When adding two matrices together, they need to have the same size (same number of rows and columns). Then you add each corresponding element pair up, and get a new resulting matrix.
  2. Subtraction: Same as addition, just subtracting instead of adding.
  3. Multiplication: Multiplying two matrices involves taking the dot product of each corresponding row of the first matrix with every column of the second matrix, and putting these products in a new matrix. This operation takes place when the number of columns of the first matrix matches the number of rows of the second matrix. However, both matrices need to have the same size along those dimensions.  
  4. Transpose: The transpose of a matrix flips it over its diagonal, switching the row and column indices. That means that the original matrix will become its own inverse. 

## 2.2 Scalar Products 
  One very useful operation is scalar multiplication. Given a scalar value $\alpha$, multiply each element in a matrix by $\alpha$. The result is another matrix with the same size as the original. The symbol $\cdot$ represents the scalar product between two vectors. We define it as follows:

  $$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = v_1 w_1 + v_2 w_2 +... + v_n w_n$$

  Where $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ are column vectors, and $v_i$ and $w_i$ are scalars representing their respective components. Note that there is no dot product notation in Python for vectors since we don't typically manipulate vectors themselves directly like scalars. Instead, we often perform operations on their underlying matrices. Also, $\cdot$ can be read as "dot" or "by", depending on context.

  
  ### Dot Product Derivation
  Let's derive the formula for calculating the dot product between two column vectors using the fact that $AB=\begin{pmatrix}a_{11}b_1+a_{12}b_2+\cdots+a_{1n}b_n\\ a_{21}b_1+a_{22}b_2+\cdots+a_{2n}b_n\\ \vdots \\ a_{m1}b_1+a_{m2}b_2+\cdots+a_{mn}b_n\end{pmatrix}$, where $B^T=b_1^Ta_1+b_2^Ta_2+\cdots+b_n^Ta_n$. Using this definition, we can see that
  
  $$\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = (\vec{v}^TB)\vec{w}$$
  
  where $(\vec{v}^TB)=(\vec{v}\cdot b_1, \vec{v}\cdot b_2,\ldots,\vec{v}\cdot b_n)^T$. 

  Now, let's substitute in our initial definitions of $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ to complete the derivation. First, $\vec{v}=(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)^T$ and $\vec{w}=(w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n)^T$. Then, using the property of dot product:
  
  $$ v_iw_i = v_i w_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n}{v_jb_j} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{n}{v_j^2}\right)w_i = (\vec{v}^T\vec{v})\vec{w}_i = (\vec{v}^TW_i)(W_i\vec{w})$$
  
  Finally, plugging back into our equation for $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}$, we obtain:
  
  $$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = (\vec{v}\cdot b_1, \vec{v}\cdot b_2,\ldots,\vec{v}\cdot b_n)^Tw_i = (\vec{v}^TB_i)\vec{w}_i = (\vec{v}^TB)\vec{w}_i$$
  
  Therefore, we have shown that $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}=((\vec{v}^TB)_i)\vec{w}_i$.
