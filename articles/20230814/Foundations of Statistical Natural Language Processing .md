# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. It involves automatic methods for analyzing, understanding, and generating natural language text. Its applications range from social media analysis to medical diagnosis and translation, and NLP research has grown significantly in recent years due to the immense amount of data generated through modern technologies such as social media and internet communications. In this article, we will introduce some basic concepts and terminologies involved in statistical natural language processing and present an overview of popular techniques used in various NLP tasks. We will also discuss how these techniques can be applied to practical problems related to information retrieval, sentiment analysis, document clustering, machine translation, and speech recognition. Finally, we will propose directions for future research in the field.

## Tokenization
In natural language processing, tokenization refers to dividing a text into meaningful units or tokens, which are then fed into further processes such as parsing, tagging, and classification. Tokens could be words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or any other meaningful units within a piece of text. A common approach for tokenizing a text is by breaking it down into individual words based on whitespace characters such as spaces, tabs, and line breaks. However, more sophisticated tokenizers may take into account word boundaries, punctuation marks, numbers, abbreviations, and other linguistic features when tokenizing a text. 

## Stop Words Removal
Stop words are commonly used words like "the", "and", "a" etc., which carry no significant meaning or contribute nothing towards understanding the content of a sentence. These stop words need to be removed before processing the text and make sense of its meaning. Common approaches include removing all occurrence of stop words or only removing them if they appear at the beginning of a phrase or follow certain patterns.

## Stemming vs Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization are two important processes used for reducing words to their base form while preserving their meaning. The difference between stemming and lemmatization lies in whether they change a word into its root form or keep the original form but group it with similar ones under one roof. For example, the word "running" would be changed into "run" using stemming, whereas it remains unchanged using lemmatization since both forms refer to the same concept. Lemmatization requires a morphological dictionary containing detailed information about each word’s part-of-speech tag, so it takes longer than stemming.  

## Bag of Words Model
The bag of words model represents text documents as vectors of word frequencies in which each unique word is represented by its frequency count in the document. This model assumes that order does not matter, i.e., the position of a word does not affect its contribution to the overall representation. The vector representation of a document can be obtained by counting the frequency of each word across all documents in a corpus or dataset. Vector space models like TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) can help normalize the weights assigned to each term in the vector representation, making it easier to compare and analyze different texts. 

## Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic algorithm used for binary classifications, where the input consists of discrete feature values representing observations of the instance being classified. Each observation belongs either to a given class or another. The prior probability distribution assigns the probabilities of each class before observing any training examples. Based on these probabilities, the algorithm calculates the likelihood of each observation belonging to each class. The maximum likelihood estimate is then calculated to determine the class assignment of the test instance. 

## Hidden Markov Models 
A hidden markov model (HMM) is a generative stochastic model that describes a sequence of observed events and underlying states. HMMs use dynamic programming to find the optimal state sequence that maximizes the joint probability of the entire sequence. Hidden Markov models have been widely used for modeling sequential data including speech, gesture recognition, bioinformatics, and stock price prediction. 

## Maximum Entropy Models
Maximum entropy models are often used in natural language processing for predicting the next word or the most likely sequence of words in a text. The objective function of a maximum entropy model defines the extent to which the predicted distribution matches the actual distribution of the training data. Unlike standard supervised learning algorithms, maximum entropy models do not require labeled data, allowing them to capture non-stationarity in the data and handle high dimensional inputs effectively.

## Part-of-Speech Tagging
Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning a category to each word in a sentence according to its syntactic role in the sentence. There are many techniques for performing part-of-speech tagging, including rule-based systems, unigram language models, n-gram language models, and neural networks. Rule-based systems rely on predefined rules to assign tags to words based on their contextual relationships with other words. Unigram language models assume that each word follows the distribution of its surrounding words, and assign the most likely tag based on this assumption. N-gram language models combine multiple consecutive words to generate new possible sequences of tags and select the most probable sequence based on their conditional probability distributions. Neural networks can learn complex associations between words and tags and perform well on large corpora. 

To implement part-of-speech tagging using a bigram language model, we first create a vocabulary set consisting of all the unique words in the training data along with their corresponding parts of speech tags. We then build a bigram probability matrix, which gives the probability of each combination of words and tags occurring together. To get the tag of a new word, we multiply its bi-grams with their respective transition probabilities and choose the highest scoring tag.

P(tag_n|word_n-1,..., word_1) = P(tag_n|tag_n-1) * P(word_n|tag_n) *... * P(word_1|tag_2) * P(start_tag) / normalization constant

where:
* P(tag_n|tag_n-1): Transition probability from tag n-1 to tag n
* P(word_n|tag_n): Probability of the nth word appearing after the current tag
* start_tag: Start tag of the sentence

Normalization constant ensures that probabilities sum up to 1.

## Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of identifying named entities in a text and categorizing them into pre-defined classes such as organizations, locations, persons, and time expressions. Many techniques exist for performing NER, including rule-based systems, neural networks, and machine learning methods. Rule-based systems look for specific patterns in the text such as capitalized names, hyphenated words, and keywords associated with specific types of entities. Neural networks can extract features from the raw text and classify entities directly from this representation. Machine learning methods involve training classifiers on labeled data and testing them on unlabeled data. One common technique for doing this is the Conditional Random Field (CRF), which treats each word in the text as a potential state and uses transitions between states to define the dependency structure between words. CRFs can produce accurate results even when the training data contains errors and noise. Another method is the recurrent neural network (RNN)-CRF, which combines RNNs with CRFs to handle long contexts and improve performance over single models.
