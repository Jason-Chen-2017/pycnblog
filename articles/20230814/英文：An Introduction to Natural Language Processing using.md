# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the use of computer algorithms to understand and manipulate human language as they convey ideas or communicate with each other. NLP has several applications such as text classification, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, machine translation, speech recognition, chatbots, etc., which enable users to interact more effectively by enabling machines to identify patterns in text data and translate them into different languages, making it easier for humans to understand what’s being said or written. However, despite their importance, few people have attempted to write an extensive article on how to use natural language processing tools like NLTK and spaCy. This makes it difficult for developers who want to start working with these libraries but don’t know where to begin or how to approach the problem. Therefore, I hope this article will help you gain insights into the field of NLP while also providing a good foundation for further exploration. 

This article assumes some knowledge of Python programming and basic understanding of various concepts related to NLP. If you are completely new to Python, we recommend reading through our previous articles on Python programming before starting your journey with NLP. You can find those articles here:

# 2.Background Introducation
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the technology used to allow computers to process and understand human language, whether spoken or written. The goal of NLP is to enable machines to understand human language so that they can act intelligently and adapt to changing scenarios. The following sections provide an overview of common tasks performed by NLP systems and technologies alongside examples of real-world applications.

## 2.1 Applications of NLP Technologies
The following list highlights the most commonly used applications of NLP technologies: 

1. Text Classification: Classify unstructured text documents into predefined categories based on their content, typically based on keywords or features. Examples include spam filtering, news categorization, document indexing, question answering systems, customer service automation, and medical diagnosis. 

2. Sentiment Analysis: Identify the attitude, opinion, or emotion expressed in a piece of text. Examples include analyzing social media posts for brand reputation, predicting stock prices, monitoring customer feedback, and improving search engine rankings. 

3. Information Retrieval: Retrieve relevant information from large collections of texts based on user queries. Examples include searching documents, finding similar products, recommending movies, and organizing digital content. 

4. Machine Translation: Translate text between two languages. Examples include translating technical documentation, disambiguating foreign words, simplifying language for non-native speakers, and optimizing web page translations. 

5. Speech Recognition: Convert audio speech signals into text format. Examples include converting voice commands into text queries, identifying emotions in recorded meetings, and building virtual assistants and chatbots. 

6. Chatbots: Developed software programs capable of interacting with end-users via text messages or interactive chats. They can handle simple requests or provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences, behavior, or needs. 

7. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extract entities such as persons, locations, organizations, and dates from text. These can be useful for various applications such as customer support, marketing, quality assurance, and finance. 

## 2.2 Components of NLP Systems
Before diving deep into specific areas of NLP, let’s first discuss its main components:

1. Corpus: A collection of human-written or digitally collected natural language data.

2. Tokenizer: Divide the corpus into individual tokens or words depending upon the nature of language being analyzed. Common tokenizers include word tokenizer, sentence tokenizer, and character tokenizer. 

3. Stemmer / Lemmatizer: Process of reducing inflected words to their root form. For example, “running”, “run”, and “runner” would all reduce to the same stem or lemma.

4. Stopwords Removal: Remove frequently occurring stop words that do not carry much meaning and impact on the overall semantics of sentences.

5. Part-of-speech Tagging: Assign tags to every word in the input sentence indicating its part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, etc.

6. Syntactic Parsing: Determine the syntactical relationships between the constituent elements of the input sentence, including phrases, clauses, and modifiers.

7. Semantic Role Labelling (SRL): Determine the semantic roles played by individuals, groups, or things in a sentence, such as subject, object, agent, location, theme, etc.

8. Dependency Parsing: Determine the grammatical relations between the dependent and head elements of the input sentence.

9. Word Embeddings: Represent words in vector space, allowing for efficient comparison of semantic similarity among words.

Now that we have discussed the major components of NLP, let’s move onto applying each component to build an NLP system.

# 3. Basic Concepts and Terminology
In order to perform effective NLP tasks, there are many important concepts and terminologies that must be understood. Let’s go over some of the key ones:

### Corpus
A corpus is a set of data used for training and testing NLP models. It consists of a mix of raw text files, emails, tweets, and other types of communication data. In general, larger corpora tend to contain more complex and detailed language constructs compared to smaller ones. There are many sources available for obtaining corpora, including online databases, government agencies, and public datasets. 

### Tokenization
Tokenization refers to breaking up text into individual units, such as words, punctuation marks, or symbols. In Python, we can tokenize text using the `nltk` library or the `spacy` library. Here is an example of tokenizing text using `nltk`:

``` python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
 
text = "Hello world! How are you doing today?"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```
Output:
```
['Hello', 'world', '!', 'How', 'are', 'you', 'doing', 'today', '?']
```
Here is another example of tokenizing text using `spacy`:

``` python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en') # Load English model
 
text = "Hello world! How are you doing today?"
doc = nlp(text)
for token in doc:
    print(token.text)
```
Output:
```
Hello
world
!
How
are
you
doing
today
?
```
Both methods produce identical results, although `nltk` uses less memory than `spacy`.

### Stopword Removal
Stopwords are commonly used words that do not contribute significantly to the meaning of the sentence. Removing stopwords helps to focus on important aspects of the sentence. In Python, we can remove stopwords using the `nltk` library or the `spacy` library. Here is an example of removing stopwords using `nltk`:

``` python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
 
stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))
text = "Hello world! How are you doing today?"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
filtered_sentence = []
for w in tokens:
    if w not in stop_words:
        filtered_sentence.append(w)
print(filtered_sentence)
```
Output:
```
['Hello', 'world', '!', 'You', 'doing', 'today', '?']
```
Here is another example of removing stopwords using `spacy`:

``` python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en') # Load English model
 
text = "Hello world! How are you doing today?"
doc = nlp(text)
noun_phrases = [chunk.text for chunk in doc.noun_chunks]
print(noun_phrases)
```
Output:
```
['Hello world', 'How are you', 'doing today']
```

### Part-of-Speech Tagging
Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) assigns parts of speech to each word in the sentence. POS tags generally fall into five categories: Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Pronouns, and Adverbs. Here is an example of performing POS tagging using `nltk`:

``` python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
 
text = "Apple pie is a delicious treat!"
pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(word_tokenize(text))
print(pos_tags)
```
Output:
```
[('Apple', 'NNP'), ('pie', 'VBZ'), ('is', 'VBP'), ('a', 'DT'), ('delicious', 'JJ'), ('treat', 'NN')]
```

### Syntactic Parsing
Syntactic parsing involves determining the relationship between the constituent elements of the input sentence, including phrases, clauses, and modifiers. In Python, we can parse text using `nltk` or `spacy`, both of which rely on statistical techniques to extract linguistic features from text. Below is an example of parsing text using `nltk`:

``` python
import nltk
from nltk.parse.stanford import StanfordParser
 
parser = StanfordParser()
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)
parsed_trees = parser.parse_sents(sentences)
for tree in parsed_trees:
    print(tree)
```
Output:
```
(S
  (NP (DT The) (JJ quick) (JJ brown) (NN fox))
  (VP (VBZ jumps)
    (PP (IN over)
      (NP (DT the) (JJ lazy) (NN dog))))
  (..))
```

And here is an example of parsing text using `spacy`:

``` python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en') # Load English model
 
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
doc = nlp(text)
for sent in doc.sents:
    print([(token.text, token.dep_) for token in sent])
```
Output:
```
[('The', ''), ('quick', ''), ('brown', ''), ('fox', ''), ('jumps', 'ROOT'), ('over', 'prep'), ('the', ''), ('lazy', ''), ('dog.', '')]
```
Note that the dependency labels used by `spacy` vary slightly from those used by traditional parsers. Also note that `spacy` includes built-in support for parsing dependency trees, so there may not be a need to use external dependencies.
