# 2. 概念、术语、定义
## 2.1 AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation and automated reasoning of human cognitive processes in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. As early as the 1950s, AI was described as a scientific field studying how computational systems can simulate human intelligence and behavior. The term "artificial" comes from the fact that artificial means "made up" or imitating natural entities while intelligent indicates the ability of machines to understand and use language, concepts, and knowledge. Today, we use artificial intelligence technology to perform a wide range of tasks including speech recognition, image understanding, robotics, and predictive analytics. 

## 2.2 Satisfaction 
Satisfaction is one of the key metrics used by businesses to measure customer satisfaction level. It quantifies the degree of customer's positive feedback about their experience with a product or service. When customers rate products and services on various criteria such as quality, speed, price, effort, etc., they often express their satisfactions using either numerical ratings or qualitative comments. Numerical ratings can be scaled from 1-5, where 5 is the highest rating and 1 is the lowest. Qualitative feedback includes textual descriptions, which offer consumers more nuanced information about why they liked or disliked a product. Business owners usually look at these types of feedback alongside other factors such as customer engagement, retention rates, and loyalty points to gain insights into how satisfied customers are with their brand and/or business strategy.

## 2.3 Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms process large amounts of data to extract patterns and relationships between inputs and outputs. These learned models can then make predictions based on new input data, making it possible for software applications to adapt to changing environments and preferences over time. One common type of machine learning algorithm is called supervised learning, where the model learns by example - given labeled training data, it identifies relationships between inputs and outputs. Another type of ML algorithm is unsupervised learning, where the algorithm only has access to input data without any labels or guidance. In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns within data, allowing organizations to identify groups, clusters, or outliers that might not otherwise stand out. Overall, machine learning enables businesses to improve efficiency, accuracy, and profitability through better decision-making and improved outcomes for customers.

## 2.4 Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is another form of machine learning where an agent interacts with an environment in order to learn optimal behaviors. RL involves a system that takes actions in response to its percepts and receives rewards for those actions. The goal of RL is to find a policy that maximizes long-term reward. Agents can take different actions depending on the current state of the world, so policies specify what actions should be taken under each situation. Examples of reinforcement learning include computer games like Go, Atari, and Starcraft; trading bots in financial markets; and autonomous vehicles in self-driving cars. With RL, businesses can design efficient strategies for achieving desired objectives and reduce costs.

## 3.1 Conversational Agent
A conversational agent is a chatbot or virtual assistant that provides responses to user queries in real-time via text messaging or voice commands. Chatbots have become increasingly popular due to their convenience and effectiveness. They provide answers to users' frequently asked questions and automate repetitive tasks that save time and money for companies. However, building high-quality chatbots requires a good understanding of NLP techniques and natural language generation. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process of extracting meaningful features from raw text data such as keywords, topics, sentiment, emotional tone, grammar errors, and syntax. Text generation refers to the task of producing natural-sounding sentences, paragraphs, and entire documents.

To build a conversational agent that generates high-quality responses, follow the steps below:

1. Define the purpose and scope of your chatbot. Decide whether you want to create a general-purpose bot or specialized for a specific industry or domain.
2. Choose a platform for developing your chatbot. There are several platforms available such as Dialogflow, Botpress, Microsoft Bot Framework, Amazon Lex, etc. Select the right platform based on your needs.
3. Design the conversation flow of your chatbot. Create conversations that allow users to navigate smoothly through the bot, providing relevant information and prompts when necessary. Use narratives and visual aides to guide users throughout the interaction.
4. Train the chatbot using intent classification and entity extraction. Identify the main intent behind the messages sent by users, classify them, and extract important entities such as dates, times, locations, prices, brands, and product names using pre-trained models or custom models trained on your own dataset.
5. Develop your response templates. Write clear and concise response templates that address all the intents defined earlier. Use template-based methods instead of manually writing every sentence to ensure consistency across all utterances. You may also choose to use pre-written responses based on user reviews or survey results.
6. Test your chatbot. Deploy your chatbot to testers and collect feedback on performance, usability, and effectiveness. Refine the conversation flow, response templates, and intent classification models as needed. Repeat testing until you achieve satisfactory results.

Once you have built a robust chatbot, you can integrate it into your existing website or app to increase customer engagement and sales. Additionally, you can monitor the performance of your chatbot using metrics such as average wait time, error rate, number of escalations, and abandonment rate. Based on this data, you can fine-tune the bot’s parameters and update it periodically to improve its effectiveness and relevance.


## 3.2 Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics applies statistical modeling techniques to historical data to make accurate forecasts, trend analysis, and prediction of future events. These models combine multiple datasets, statistics tools, and mathematical equations to make predictions based on patterns and correlations. The central component of predictive analytics is the data science pipeline. The following are some of the key components of the data science pipeline:

1. Data collection: Collecting data on past events helps the company determine if there will be similar events in the future. Different sources of data such as surveys, logs, social media posts, transactions history, etc. can be collected. 
2. Data cleaning: The data collected must be cleaned before applying statistical techniques. This step involves removing missing values, detecting and correcting anomalies, handling duplicates, and normalizing the data.
3. Exploratory data analysis: After cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis is done to explore the characteristics of the variables involved. This step includes analyzing summary statistics, visualizing the distribution, identifying outliers, correlation among variables, and checking for covariate shift.
4. Feature engineering: Creating features from the data is essential for creating accurate models. Some of the feature engineering techniques involve normalization, encoding categorical variables, transforming continuous variables, selecting most significant features, and dealing with multi-collinearity.
5. Model selection: Once the features have been selected, different machine learning algorithms can be applied for regression or classification problems. Regression problems deal with continuous outcome variables while classification deals with categorical variables. Depending on the problem at hand, suitable evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared score, F1-score, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curve can be chosen.
6. Hyperparameter tuning: Tuning the hyperparameters of the model helps optimize the performance of the model. Optimal hyperparameters depend on the nature of the data and the choice of algorithm. Common hyperparameters include regularization parameter, tree depth, leaf nodes, learning rate, and batch size.
7. Model deployment: Once the best performing model is determined, it can be deployed to production for prediction purposes. Monitoring the performance of the model on a regular basis ensures that issues with the model are detected and addressed effectively.

Assessing the impact of marketing campaigns on customer engagement and sales success plays a crucial role in retaining valuable customers. Using predictive analytics, businesses can analyze their customer behavior data, identify patterns, and develop targeted marketing campaigns that contribute to overall growth. By analyzing historical customer data, businesses can develop personalized recommendations, adjust pricing, and personalize offers to maximize the value of their assets.
