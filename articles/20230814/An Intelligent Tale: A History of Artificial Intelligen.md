2. Historical Facts About Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as Machine Learning, is a branch of computer science that focuses on enabling machines to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. The term "artificial" refers to machines that mimic human behavior rather than following rules set by humans. Artificial intelligence was originally defined in 1956 by <NAME> as “the science and engineering of making computers capable of rational thought like humans.” Since then, researchers have continued to develop new methods and techniques for creating machine-like intelligences that can perform tasks better than humans.

The first sign of popular adoption of AI was at Google’s DeepMind project in 2010. This led to a significant explosion of interest in artificial intelligence and a hype wave throughout the tech industry. During this time period, companies such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM started investing heavily in AI development projects. However, before achieving widespread adoption, there were several hurdles to overcome including legal and ethical issues related to privacy and security. Today, most AI technologies are gaining widespread use across various industries and sectors. 

There are several other factors that contribute towards the rise of AI such as automation, economic opportunities, social impact, increased global connectivity, access to big data, and improved efficiency in various industories. These advancements enable businesses to significantly improve productivity, reduce costs, increase revenue, and create better experiences for customers.

3. Key Concepts and Terminology Used in Modern AI Systems
Before delving deeper into the inner workings of AI, let’s quickly go over some basic concepts and terms that come up frequently while working with AI systems. Some of these terms may sound familiar but it’s always good to refresh your memory when working with new technologies.

3.1 Definition of AI
Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a machine to imitate intelligence processes that humans perform. It involves developing computational models that behave in a way similar to real-world objects and environments. AI enables machines to solve complex problems through reasoning and decision-making which makes them experts in identifying patterns and extracting knowledge from large amounts of data.

To define machine learning further, it involves training machines to recognize patterns in data and extract information by interacting with feedback provided by users. These patterns allow machines to make predictions based on previously seen examples and identify new trends. Machine learning allows for automatic optimization of performance parameters, allowing for faster responses to changing needs.

3.2 Types of AI Systems
AI systems can vary widely depending on their capabilities and goals. There are three main categories of AI systems - Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

3.2.1 Supervised Learning
Supervised learning systems have labels associated with input data. The goal of supervised learning is to train a model that can predict output values based on input features given the correct label. Examples include image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

3.2.2 Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning systems do not have labeled data. They rely on unstructured data to find meaningful relationships within the data. Examples include clustering, anomaly detection, and recommendation engines.

3.2.3 Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Reinforcement learning systems interact with an environment and select actions based on rewards received in response to those actions. RL is commonly used in games, robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual assistants.

3.3 Key Components of an AI System
Now that we have covered some fundamental concepts and terminology, let’s dive into the building blocks of an AI system. Here are some of the components that play a role in AI systems:

3.3.1 Data Collection
Data collection is one of the most crucial components of an AI system. It involves gathering large volumes of data that can be analyzed to build accurate models. Different sources of data can include structured databases, text files, images, videos, and streaming data.

3.3.2 Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing includes cleaning, normalizing, and manipulating data so that it can be fed into the ML algorithm. Techniques such as feature scaling and dimensionality reduction can help ensure that the data is suitable for analysis.

3.3.3 Algorithm Selection
Algorithm selection determines which type of algorithm to use for modeling. There are multiple types of algorithms available including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and deep neural networks (DNN).

3.3.4 Model Training
Model training involves feeding the preprocessed data into the selected algorithm to generate a trained model. The process of fitting the model to the data is called hyperparameter tuning, where the optimal settings for each algorithm are determined to optimize the accuracy of the resulting model.

3.3.5 Model Evaluation
Once the model is trained, it must be evaluated against test data to measure its accuracy and ensure it generalizes well to new data. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used to evaluate models.

3.3.6 Prediction/Inference
After the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions or inferences on new data. Inference typically requires running the model on new inputs and returning the predicted results.

3.4 Core Algorithms for Processing Data
We now know the major components of an AI system and some common terms. Let’s look at some of the core algorithms that are used for processing data.
