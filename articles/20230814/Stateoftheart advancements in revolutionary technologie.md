Sustainable Agroforestry (SA) is a promising technology that can provide substantial economic benefits to smallholder farmers by conserving water and reducing soil degradation over time through controlled tree planting. In recent years, various research efforts have focused on developing advanced methods of SA for its practical applications in the field of agroforestry. However, it has been relatively rare to see an extensive review article on the current state-of-the-art advancements in SA technological development. In this paper, we present an overview of existing technologies related to SA and highlight their potential future directions. 

The purpose of writing this article is to provide an accessible guide to SA technology research as well as to demonstrate our capability in providing scientific insight into changing developments in the industry. Moreover, the reader will gain valuable knowledge about relevant fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Science. With these insights, they should be able to design new or optimize existing techniques based on their specific requirements. 

In this article, we first introduce the basic concepts and terminologies related to SA. We then discuss several advances in artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies for controlling tree growth, including deep learning, image processing, pattern recognition, and multi-agent algorithms. Next, we explore ways to integrate different technologies together to improve efficiency in control of large scale crop production. Finally, we evaluate the potential impact of different strategies on carbon emissions, nitrogen fertilizer use, land usage, and other environmental factors, and identify challenges and limitations associated with implementing SA practices efficiently and effectively. The article ends with a discussion of future trends and opportunities in SA technology development. 

2.相关概念术语
Sustainable Agroforestry: Sustainable agroforestry is a type of forestry whereby smallholders retain control over the distribution and management of their own crops while taking into account the long-term consequences of global warming and climate change. It involves cultivating and protecting rainfall-sensitive tropical trees, which are responsible for maintaining ecosystems and ensuring food security. Smallholders must consider their savings from selling used items during droughts, increasing prices due to competition among producers, and competing for market share with larger corporations. 

Technology: Technology refers to tools, machines, processes, and principles that enable us to perform tasks and carry out activities more efficiently and accurately than before. Technologies can range from simple machines like hoppers to complex algorithms that simulate the interactions between physical and biological entities within an ecosystem. Many advances in SA technology research have involved the use of powerful machine learning and data science techniques coupled with novel AI models.

AI: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the study and simulation of human intelligence. There are two main subcategories of AI - symbolic AI and neural networks. Symbolic AI focuses on logical reasoning, natural language processing, and problem solving using mathematical formulas. Neural networks focus on recognizing patterns and identifying relationships between input data and output labels. The ability of AI to learn and adapt quickly and easily enables it to achieve superhuman performance on challenging problems. 

Image Processing: Image processing is the process of extracting meaningful information from digital images and transforming them into useful representations. This includes various techniques like feature extraction, segmentation, classification, enhancement, and restoration. Most image processing techniques involve analyzing pixel intensity values, edges, shapes, textures, and spatial relations. By combining multiple image processing techniques, we can build robust AI models that can extract insights from complex scenes and make accurate predictions. 

Pattern Recognition: Pattern recognition refers to the analysis of data to recognize regularities, trends, and correlations. These can take many forms, ranging from simple rules-based approaches to complex statistical models trained on massive datasets. One common application of pattern recognition in SA is detection of critical areas such as understory vegetation affected by soil moisture levels. 

Multi-Agent Systems: Multi-agent systems combine several agents working together to solve a single problem. They operate independently but collaborate with each other to reach a goal or coordinate actions. The interaction between agents can lead to coordinated action that improves system performance. Multi-agent systems are particularly important in SA because they require coordination across entire farms and regional networks of devices. 

Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subset of AI that uses multiple layers of connected neural nodes to process complex inputs and produce outputs. Compared to traditional ML techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, etc., deep learning architectures can model complex non-linear relationships in high dimensional spaces better. Research in SA has focused on building deep learning models that can autonomously control trees in real-time to improve yield, reduce fuel consumption, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. 

Computer Vision: Computer vision involves capturing, analyzing, understanding, and interpreting images, videos, and other visual content to generate insights. The ability to interpret the world around us using computers has made it possible to create programs capable of detecting objects, tracking motion, predicting outcomes, and classifying visual features. Advances in computer vision have led to improvements in object recognition, tracking and prediction, motion estimation, and scene understanding in many applications.

Data Science: Data science involves the collection, organization, cleaning, integration, and exploration of large sets of structured and unstructured data to derive value from it. Data scientists typically work closely with domain experts, mathematicians, and engineers to discover patterns, relationships, and trends in the data. The resulting insights can be used to inform business decisions, improve products and services, and optimize operations. 

Carbon Sequestration: Carbon sequestration refers to the reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentration by plants and animals to mitigate global warming. One approach to carbon sequestration in SA involves reducing the amount of energy needed for leaf growth, improving air ventilation, and reducing transpiration rates. Despite significant progress, there are still some key challenges to overcome, including improved regulation of seedbed germination and nitrogen fertilization, efficient operation of hydroponics systems, and establishment of continuous monitoring and evaluation systems to track the effects of changes in carbon dioxide levels. 

Nitrogen Fertilization: Nitrogen fertilization (NF) is the conversion of nitrogen compounds, such as ammonia or phosphates, to nitrogenous organic matter. NF plays a crucial role in soil acidification, nutrient cycling, and microbial activity. NF also reduces losses due to evaporation and runoff. NF is essential in most terrestrial ecosystems, making up approximately 7% of the Earth's surface area. Although NF provides numerous benefits, it comes with significant costs, especially in terms of cost per hectare and financial burden for small holders. To address these issues, new NF technologies need to be developed and implemented to increase efficiency, decrease price, enhance harvest quality, and mitigate negative impacts. 

Land Use: Land use refers to the way humans use the land around them. Manipulating the landscape to provide habitats for wildlife, industrial production, and residential development is one of the main goals of sustainable agriculture. Developing effective and innovative land use policies that promote social cohesion and stewardship are necessary components of successful SA implementations. As land use continues to shift towards urban centers, tree-growing periods are expected to become shorter, longer growing seasons less frequent, and limited access to arable resources. Techniques such as remote sensing and geospatial analytics will help us monitor and manage this changing landscape.
