# 2.1 Random gradient descent (SGD)
## 2.1.1 Basic ideas of SGD algorithm

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular optimization method that uses iterative approach to solve an objective function with continuously decreasing cost until the minimum is reached or some other stopping criteria are met. The basic idea behind SGD is simple: at each step, we update the parameters in the direction of negative gradient of the loss function w.r.t current parameters. We use small batches of data instances for this process called minibatches. In each iteration, we randomly select a mini-batch from our training set and calculate the gradients on it, then apply these gradients to update the parameters based on the learning rate. This process is repeated for multiple epochs until convergence or early termination condition is met. 

Here is how SGD works:

1. Initialize weights $w$
2. Choose batch size $m$, learning rate $\alpha$, and number of iterations $T$. 
3. For $t=1...T$:
    * Draw a random mini-batch $(x_i^b, y_i^b)$ of size $m$ from the training dataset. 
    * Calculate the gradient $\nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(f(x;\theta^{t}), y_i^b; \theta^{t})$ using backpropagation algorithm. 
    * Update the weights by subtracting $\alpha\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j}^{m}\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}(f(x_j;\theta^{t+1}), y_j; \theta^{t+1})$ from $\theta^{t}$.
4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until converges or reaches maximum number of iterations. 

In general, stochastic gradient descent can be very effective when dealing with large datasets due to its low memory requirement. However, since it relies on calculating the gradients on only one instance, it may not always lead to optimal solution. To further improve the performance of SGD, various variants have been proposed, such as momentum and nesterov accelerated gradient. 


## 2.1.2 Mathematical formulation of SGD 
Let $f(\cdot)$ denote a differentiable scalar function parameterized by $\theta = (\theta^{(1)},..., \theta^{(d)})$, where $d$ represents the dimensionality of the weight vector. Given the labeled training examples $((x^{(1)},y^{(1)}),..., (x^{(n)},y^{(n)}))$, we want to find the best values of $\theta$ that minimize the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ over all possible choices of parameters. That is, given any initial point $\theta_0$, we should find the smallest value of $\theta$ that minimizes $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ over all $\theta$. Intuitively, we hope that if we start from any point along the curve defined by $\mathcal{L}$, we can eventually reach a global minimum. Therefore, finding the optimum point along the curve is equivalent to solving the optimization problem: 

$$\min_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta). $$

### Learning Rate
We choose the learning rate $\alpha$ carefully to balance between the rate of convergence and oscillations around the minimum. If $\alpha$ is too high, the model will oscillate around the minimum frequently, resulting in slow convergence. On the other hand, if $\alpha$ is too low, we risk taking a long time to converge to the true minimum because we are making very small updates at each step.

### Momentum
The key idea behind momentum is that if we take many small steps towards the direction of steepest descent, we end up going into deep valleys rather than ravines, which is often more efficient than just moving in a single direction. The intuition is that we accumulate the gradient at each step, so that instead of updating the weights directly, we add a fraction of the previous gradient to it, thus getting faster convergence speeds.

The equation for momentum update is:

$$v_{t+1}= \beta v_t + \nabla_\theta f(x_{t},\theta_{t}) \\
\theta_{t+1}=\theta_{t}-\alpha v_{t+1}$$

where $\theta_{t}$ is the updated parameter after t iterations, $v_{t}$ is the velocity term corresponding to the position parameter $\theta_{t}$ before the update, and $\beta$ is the momentum factor chosen by the user. By adding a fraction $\beta$ of the previous velocity $v_t$ to the current gradient, we get a better estimate of the overall trend, which helps us avoid being trapped in local minima.

### Nesterov Acceleration
One way to incorporate momentum into SGD is to modify the order of updates. Instead of updating the weights immediately after computing the gradient, we first compute the next position $\hat{\theta}_{t+1}$ without actually moving there yet. Then we evaluate the gradient at $\hat{\theta}_{t+1}$ instead of the current position $\theta_{t}$, and move to $\hat{\theta}_{t+1}$ according to the regular formula. This acceleration technique, named "Nesterov acceleration", has two advantages compared to plain momentum: (a) It takes into account the future direction of movement, leading to faster convergence rates, especially in shallower regions of the error surface, while still respecting the momentum effect along the way; and (b) It provides us with a good starting point for the next iteration, even though we haven't made any progress towards the optimum yet.

The main idea behind Nesterov acceleration is to look ahead at the future direction of movement. Specifically, we let $\theta_{t-1}$ represent the old position, $\theta_{t}$ represent the new position computed from the current gradient, and $\gamma$ is a momentum term. The NAG update rule is as follows:

$$v_{t+1}=\beta v_{t}+\nabla_{\theta_{t-1}}f(x_{t},\theta_{t-1})-\beta v_{t-1}\\
\theta_{t+1}=\theta_{t}-\alpha v_{t+1}.$$

The difference between standard SGD and NAG is the second line. Here we make sure to move to $\theta_{t-1}$ for evaluating the gradient, whereas previously we moved straight to $\theta_{t}$. Another important modification is that we store both the position and velocity terms of the last two positions, and update them together during the calculation of the velocity term. Overall, NAG is a powerful variant of momentum that achieves good results across a wide range of problems.
