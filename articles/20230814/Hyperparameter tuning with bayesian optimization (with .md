# 1.简介
  

Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned during training but need to be set before the model starts working properly. These parameters can significantly affect the performance of a machine learning algorithm and can have a significant impact on its final accuracy and robustness. In order to find an optimal combination of hyperparameters, various techniques such as grid search, randomized search, or Bayesian Optimization have been employed. However, these techniques can be computationally expensive and time-consuming for large datasets. 

In this article, we will discuss about one of the state-of-the-art technique called Bayesian Optimization which is designed to solve this problem by exploring the space of hyperparameters in real-time instead of running multiple experiments manually. This technique has several advantages over other techniques like Grid Search and Randomized Search:

1. It explores the hyperparameter space in real-time and identifies promising regions where it may improve the performance. 

2. It uses past evaluations of the objective function to make better decisions when optimizing hyperparameters. 

3. The number of required experiments can be reduced by using active learning based sampling technique. 

We will also implement Bayesian Optimization using Python’s Scikit Learn library and demonstrate how it can be used to optimize hyperparameters of a classification model on the famous Iris dataset.
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
Hyperparameters are parameters that are fixed beforehand and cannot be learned from data. They control the behavior of the machine learning algorithms and must be tuned to obtain good results. Some common examples of hyperparameters include regularization rate, feature scaling method, number of hidden layers, etc. Here are some terminologies related to hyperparameter tuning:

* **Objective Function:** The objective function measures how well our machine learning model performs given certain values of hyperparameters. We want to maximize this function to determine the best possible configuration of hyperparameters that maximizes the performance of our model.

* **Hyperparameter Space:** The space of all possible combinations of hyperparameters defines the design space of hyperparameter tuning process. There are different approaches to define the hyperparameter space including:

  * Grid search: It consists of creating a list of predefined values for each hyperparameter and testing them all sequentially until finding the maximum score.
  
  * Random search: It randomly selects values within a specified range for each hyperparameter and tests them all until finding the maximum score.
  
  * Bayesian Optimization: It suggests new points to evaluate based on previous observations and predictive models.
  
* **Acquisition Function:** The acquisition function specifies the strategy for selecting new hyperparameter configurations to test next. Common acquisition functions include expected improvement (EI), probability of improvement (PI), or upper confidence bound (UCB). 

* **Model/Surrogate Model:** A surrogate model is a probabilistic model that approximates the true objective function. It takes input features and outputs predicted outcomes. One example of a popular surrogate model is Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR is capable of modeling complex non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs and provides uncertainty estimates.
 
* **Optimization Algorithm:** An optimization algorithm determines the sequence of hyperparameter configurations to explore and evaluates their effectiveness according to the chosen metric. Popular optimization algorithms include Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO), Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE), and Sequential Model-Based Global Optimization (SMBO).
# 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Operations Steps
The core principles of Bayesian optimization include exploration vs exploitation tradeoff, incorporating prior knowledge, and integrating gradient information into the optimization process. Let's now understand the specific operations involved in Bayesian optimization step-by-step.

## 3.1 Defining Objective Function and Hyperparameter Space
Let's say you want to tune hyperparameters for your machine learning model. First, you should define the objective function that measures how well your model performs given different hyperparameters. Then, you can create a hyperparameter space that lists all possible combinations of hyperparameters that you want to try. For example, let's consider the following hyperparameters:

* Regularization parameter $\lambda$: How much L2 penalty do you want to add to the loss function?
* Learning rate $lr$: How fast should the optimizer learn?
* Number of neurons in the first hidden layer: How many units do you want to use in the first hidden layer?
* Activation function: Which activation function would you prefer?

Assuming that there are only two hyperparameters, namely $\lambda$ and $lr$, you could define your hyperparameter space as follows:<|im_sep|>
