Speaker recognition (SPE) refers to the task of automatically identifying who is speaking in a recorded audio clip or voice sample by comparing it with a known set of speakers’ voices stored in a database. This is an important research field that has gained significant attention recently due to its wide applications in fields such as biometric authentication, speech-driven interfaces, and security systems. 

Speaker identification (SID) is another problem similar to speaker recognition but with one crucial difference: during training, only a small number of samples are available for each speaker, while we need to recognize all possible speakers from a single utterance. In other words, SID focuses more on acoustic features rather than linguistic information of spoken language. Despite these differences, there have been some attempts at developing SPE techniques for SID.

One popular technique used for SID involves the use of neural networks. One classical example of this approach is the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which assumes the existence of latent variables that govern the probability distribution over different states in the system. These models require labeled data for both training and testing, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, other approaches have been proposed to address the challenge of reducing the amount of labeled data required for training SPE models. The most commonly used approach is the Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA). FDA is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that learns the underlying structure of the multivariate data without any prior assumption about the relationships between the dimensions. It does not rely on any specific model architecture or parameter tuning, making it easier to apply compared to traditional methods like HMMs.

In this paper, we present a novel framework for speaker identification that combines advantages of FDA and deep learning architectures. We also propose several improvements to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and improve performance. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various datasets, including TIMIT and DIHARD. Moreover, we demonstrate that the network trained using our method performs very well even when no explicit alignment between speakers' recordings exists.

## 2.1 概念
Speaker identification (SID) is the process of determining the identity of the person who is making a given speech sound or utterance. There are two types of SID tasks: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised SID consists of the scenario where multiple speakers are identified from a fixed set of samples per speaker. Unsupervised SID, on the other hand, aims to identify speakers without requiring any labels for training. Commonly used algorithms include Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).

The main idea behind speaker identification is to compare the characteristics of the input signal with a set of predefined voice samples corresponding to each recognized speaker. The similarity between the input signal and each voice sample can be measured using statistical techniques such as cosine distance or Euclidean distance. However, this approach requires a large set of voice samples per speaker to obtain reliable results. To address this issue, several recent works have focused on the application of deep learning techniques for speaker identification.

Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer several benefits over conventional approaches, such as faster processing speed, higher accuracy, and less dependence on labeled data. DL architectures consist mainly of convolutional layers, long short-term memory units (LSTMs), and dense layers. Convolutional layers learn local patterns in the input signals, LSTMs capture temporal dependencies, and dense layers provide non-linear transformations. By stacking multiple layers of these components, DL architectures can extract complex features from the raw waveform data.

Another common technique used for improving performance is domain adaptation, which consists of transfer learning from a pre-trained model for speaker verification or speaker classification tasks. Domain adaptation allows us to leverage knowledge acquired from related domains to help improve the generalization performance of the model on the target domain.

### 2.2.1 Deep Learning (DL)
DL is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses nonlinear functions to learn representations of data. DL relies heavily on neural networks, a collection of interconnected neurons designed to perform complex mathematical computations through weight adjustments. Each layer of the network receives inputs from the previous layer and produces outputs that are passed to the next layer. Each node in the hidden layer processes the weighted sum of its inputs and passes it through a non-linear activation function, producing an output. Neural networks can be trained by analyzing large amounts of labeled data and optimizing their weights accordingly. They achieve good performance on many complex problems, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. 

### 2.2.2 Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)
A feedforward neural network (FFNN) consists of fully connected layers of nodes, arranged sequentially. Each node receives inputs from the previous layer, applies a transformation to them, and passes the result to the next layer. FFNNs have a simple architecture and do not utilize feedback loops, which makes them ideal for regression and classification tasks.

### 2.2.3 Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM)
An LSTM unit is a type of recurrent neural network cell that captures dependencies across time steps. An LSTM cell maintains internal memory cells that store information about past events. When presented with new input data, the cell can either forget or remember certain aspects of the previous events. By doing so, the LSTM helps to avoid vanishing gradients, which prevents the network from becoming stuck in shallow regions of the loss surface.

### 2.2.4 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in neural networks. The algorithm updates the parameters of the network by computing the derivative of the cost function with respect to the parameters, and then subtracting a fraction of that derivative from the current values. The resulting update rule improves the quality of the model during training. 

### 2.2.5 Leaky ReLU
Leaky ReLU is a variation of the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. Instead of setting negative inputs to zero, leaky ReLU sets them to a small value, typically close to zero, called the leakage rate. This reduces the chance of vanishing gradients caused by rectifying highly negative inputs, which often occur in practice when training deep neural networks.

### 2.2.6 Cross Entropy Loss Function
Cross entropy loss measures how different two distributions are. In a binary classification problem, cross entropy represents the difference between the logarithm of the predicted probability of the positive class and the logarithm of 1 minus the predicted probability of the negative class. Cross entropy loss is commonly used in logistic regression, multi-class classification, and neural networks for regression tasks.
