# 1.简介
  

Healthcare industry has the highest competitive advantage and provides unique challenges for technology companies that aim at optimizing its operations. One of these challenges is cross-disciplinary collaboration between doctors, nurses, radiologists, pharmacists, administrators, and physicians involved in various stages of patient care. As a result, data integration systems are required to effectively manage patients' medical records across different domains to ensure efficient and accurate diagnoses. 

Data integration is the process of bringing multiple datasets together to provide a comprehensive view on a single entity or subject by combining relevant information from disparate sources. This article discusses how reliable data integration systems can be built within the healthcare ecosystem to improve cross-disciplinary collaboration and enable better decision making and outcomes for patients. It also highlights the importance of establishing clear data governance policies and protocols as well as leveraging cloud technologies such as Hadoop to implement scalable solutions. Finally, it explores best practices around designing data models and developing data pipelines with appropriate tools and techniques to help organizations build reliable data integration systems that meet their business objectives.

## 2.1 Data Integration
Data integration refers to the merging of several data sets into one comprehensive source of information, which enables meaningful insights into individual entities or subjects. Data integration is essential in today's world where large amounts of heterogeneous data are being generated through various sources including medical devices, clinical notes, imaging studies, social media platforms etc. The ultimate goal of any data integration project is to derive value from this integrated dataset to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare professionals.

The following figure shows an example of data integration:



In the above illustration, we have multiple datasets collected from different sources like surgery reports, lab results, clinical notes etc., along with additional metadata. These datasets need to be consolidated and combined so that they can be used for analysis purposes. In this case, data integration ensures that all relevant data points from different datasets are brought together to produce more comprehensive insights on a particular patient’s condition. Moreover, data integration helps to identify patterns and trends amongst the data that may indicate underlying disease processes leading to improved outcomes for patients.

## 2.2 Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration
Cross-disciplinary collaboration is a key aspect of healthcare in today's world because it promotes the use of diverse expertise to provide better outcomes for patients. Within each field (i.e. medicine, science, engineering), there are specialized individuals who play critical roles in achieving optimal outcome. For instance, physicians often assist in diagnosing illnesses while nurses assist in managing physical conditions, radiation therapists provide treatment options, and pharmacists cure treatments. By working closely with these specialized individuals, healthcare providers can offer better quality of care that leads to better outcomes for patients. However, effective coordination and communication among these individuals is crucial for successful cross-disciplinary collaborations. Therefore, data integration plays a significant role in enabling cross-disciplinary collaboration throughout the entire healthcare ecosystem.

The following figure shows an example of cross-disciplinary collaboration:


As shown in the above illustration, a patient comes in for general checkup but then requests a specialist opinion based on his symptoms. To achieve this, the patient needs to access multiple datasets from various departments like surgery reports, labs, imaging studies etc., integrate them, and provide input to a physician. Thus, cross-disciplinary collaboration involves working closely with multiple domain experts to extract valuable insights and develop a holistic understanding of the patient's condition.

## 2.3 Patient Records Management
Patient record management includes a wide range of activities that collectively make up the patient administration workflow. Patient records must be created, stored, retrieved, analyzed, reported, and distributed in a timely manner to ensure optimal care delivery to the patient. A robust patient records management system should facilitate effective communication between staff and patient alike during the course of care. Additionally, the system should support data exchange with external partners and compliance requirements of various regulatory bodies.

A common way to store patient records is via electronic health records (EHR). EHRs allow hospitals to efficiently store, organize, retrieve, report, analyze, and distribute medical information related to a patient. They usually consist of various forms containing structured and unstructured data such as prescription orders, diagnostic tests, chief complaints, billing information, discharge summaries, immunizations, hospital admissions, procedures, vital signs, encounter details, and family history. In addition, EHRs can also capture more non-clinical data such as demographics, insurance claims, and employment details. Despite their many benefits, implementing a healthy patient records management program requires careful planning, organizational leadership, and regular updates.
