# 1.简介
  

Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) is a machine learning approach that aims at training agents in realistic simulated environments with minimal interaction with the environment and without any access to demonstrations or expert feedback. It has been used extensively in robotics, gaming, healthcare and other fields. Despite its importance, however, there are still many challenges and uncertainties associated with ORL such as high variance and sparse rewards. To address these challenges, we propose an offline bias correction algorithm based on linear regression. This algorithm uses observational data collected from the agent's interactions with the environment to correct biases caused by overly optimistic value estimates. We also propose two methods of evaluating the accuracy of our bias correction method using evaluation metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root-mean square error (RMSE) and average reward difference (ARD). These methods provide valuable insights into how well our bias correction method works and can help us decide when to trust our agent model trained via ORL. In addition, this article will demonstrate how our proposed bias correction method performs across different environments and settings, including simple grid worlds, continuous control tasks, and adversarial environments.

Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) refers to techniques that train artificial intelligence agents in realistic simulated environments without having access to demonstrations or expert feedback. The basic idea behind ORL lies in collecting large amounts of data generated during agent's interactions with the environment and then applying standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms to learn policies directly from the collected data. Many advanced approaches have been developed for ORL, but most work focuses on addressing several problems related to data collection, storage, and computation efficiency. One promising research direction is bias correction, which attempts to remove systematic errors introduced by underestimating the value function of the agent. However, it remains unclear whether bias correction alone suffices to improve the performance of ORL agents, and moreover, even if bias correction does work, it may not be sufficient to avoid catastrophic failure cases where the agent fails to learn the true behavioral policy due to insufficient exploration in the simulated environment. Nevertheless, recent progress towards efficient data generation through simulation platforms like Gazebo have made it feasible to perform large-scale simulations, making ORL a viable approach for studying complex behaviors and decision-making processes in challenging domains. With such advances, we believe that there is much room for further research on improving the reliability of offline reinforcement learning systems.
# 3.基本概念术语说明
Offline reinforcement learning (ORL): A type of machine learning technique that aims at training AI agents in realistic simulated environments without having access to demonstrations or expert feedback. It involves collecting large amounts of data generated during agent’s interactions with the environment and then applying standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms to learn policies directly from the collected data.
Agent: An autonomous entity that interacts with the environment and learns through trial and error.
Environment: A virtual representation of the world in which the agent operates.
Policy: A mapping between the current state of the environment and the action taken by the agent. Policy is learned by interacting with the environment and observing the effects of actions on the future states and rewards.
Experience replay buffer: A memory structure that stores transitions observed while interacting with the environment. Experience replay allows the agent to learn from previous experiences and improves sample diversity and stability.
State: The information about the surrounding conditions in the environment at a particular instance in time.
Action: The decision made by the agent to interact with the environment. Actions affect the state of the environment and result in subsequent observations.
Reward: A numerical scalar signal that indicates the outcome of taking an action within the environment. Rewards guide the agent to learn appropriate policies.
Value function: A measure of the expected utility of being in a given state. Value functions estimate the long-term return of being in each state and are estimated online from experience.
Discounted Monte Carlo returns: A theoretical approximation of the actual discounted sum of future rewards encountered after reaching a terminal state. DMC returns are calculated recursively using predicted values obtained from the current policy.
Temporal difference (TD) updates: A variant of Monte Carlo estimation that applies TD errors directly to update the value function instead of waiting until the end of episode to accumulate samples.
Data collection: Collecting large amounts of data requires various strategies such as random sampling, imitation learning, and curriculum learning to ensure that the agent explores varied behavior patterns in the simulated environment.
Mean squared error (MSE): A commonly used evaluation metric for measuring the difference between two probability distributions. MSE measures the average of the squares of the differences between predicted and actual values.
Root-mean square error (RMSE): Another common evaluation metric for measuring the difference between two probability distributions. RMSE is the square root of the mean squared error.
Average reward difference (ARD): ARD compares the perceived reward distribution with the actual one and computes the normalized maximum absolute difference between them.
Adversarial environment: An environment in which the agent faces multiple opposing opponents that try to steal or deceive the agent. Adversarial environments pose a unique challenge because they require careful design of the agent's policies to defeat all of the enemies, and sometimes lead to unexpected consequences.
Overestimation bias: Overestimation occurs when an agent incorrectly believes that its value function is higher than it actually is, leading to poor exploration and reduced learning speed.
Underestimation bias: Underestimation occurs when an agent incorrectly belance that its value function is lower than it actually is, leading to excessive exploration and slow convergence rate.
Catastrophic failure case: A scenario where the agent cannot learn the desired behavior due to either incorrect or noisy input data. Catastrophic failure typically arises in real-world applications where the agent must operate in highly dynamic environments and encounters noise and uncertainty.
Bias correction: Technique that attempts to remove systematic errors introduced by overly optimistic value estimates by adjusting the predictions accordingly.

We present an offline bias correction algorithm called "Linear Regression Bias Correction" for reducing overestimation bias in ORL agents. Our algorithm works by fitting a linear regression model to the agent's observed values and predicting their corresponding target values. Based on the fitted model, we use the predicted targets to correct the agent's bias towards positive values. Specifically, we calculate the corrected values according to the formula:

corrected_value = observation + [predicted_target - observation] * alpha

where observation is the actual observed value, predicted_target is the predicted target value produced by the linear regression model, and alpha is a hyperparameter that determines the degree of bias correction. If alpha=0, we get rid of the bias; if alpha=1, we fully correct the bias. We evaluate the accuracy of our bias correction method using three popular evaluation metrics: mean squared error (MSE), root-mean square error (RMSE), and average reward difference (ARD). 

To implement Linear Regression Bias Correction, we follow the following steps:

1. Collect a dataset of agent's experience tuples consisting of (state, action, reward, next_state, done) sampled uniformly from the agent's trajectory in the environment. 

2. Preprocess the dataset by computing temporal difference (TD) targets for every tuple in the dataset based on the current policy. 

3. Fit a linear regression model to the dataset using scikit-learn library's LinearRegression class. Each feature vector consists of four components: current state, current action, current reward, and next state (i.e., discounted Monte Carlo return). Train the linear regression model using the td targets computed earlier as the response variable. 

4. For every new observation received by the agent, compute the predicted target using the fitted linear regression model. Use the predicted target to update the original observation by adding a weighted error term proportional to the magnitude of the prediction error. Alpha is set as a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the weight applied to the prediction error.

5. Repeat step 4 for multiple iterations or until the agent's bias reaches a certain level of stableness. During this process, keep track of the change in mean squared error (MSE), root-mean square error (RMSE), and average reward difference (ARD) as evaluators. Whenever the MSE drops below some threshold value, consider the agent reliable enough to start using the corrected values for training purposes. Alternatively, stop iterating early once the bias becomes too extreme and the agent begins to oscillate around zero repeatedly.


For example, suppose we want to apply Linear Regression Bias Correction to the agent's observations in a simple grid world. Here's how we would do it:

Step 1: Collect a dataset of agent's experience tuples in a grid world

Here's what the dataset might look like:

(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
(0, 0, -1, 1, False)
(0, 1, 0, 1, False)
(1, 0, 1, 2, False)
(1, 1, 0, 2, True)
(2, 0, -1, 3, False)
(2, 1, 0, 3, False)

Step 2: Compute TD targets based on current policy

Given a tuple t, the corresponding TD target can be computed using the formula:

td_target = r[t+1] + gamma*max(Q(s[t+1],a) for a in A)

where s[t+1] is the next state, Q(s[t+1],a) is the maximal action-value function for the next state s[t+1], and gamma is the discount factor.

So for the above example, the corresponding TD targets for the first five tuples in the dataset would be:

(-1, 0, -1, 1, False) -> (-1, 0, 0, 1, False) = -1
(-1, 1, 0, 1, False) -> (-1, 1, 0, 1, False) = 0
(0, 0, -1, 1, False) -> (0, 0, 0, 2, False) = -1/gamma^2
(0, 1, 0, 1, False) -> (0, 1, 0, 2, False) = 0
(1, 0, 1, 2, False) -> (1, 0, 1, 2, True) = 1

Step 3: Fit a linear regression model to the dataset using scikit-learn

Here's how we could define the feature vectors for the first few examples:

X_train = [[0, 0, -1, 1],
          [0, 1,  0, 1],
          [1, 0,  1, 2]]
          
y_train = [-1, 0, -1/math.pow(discount,2)]

where X_train contains the features for each example and y_train contains the corresponding responses. We call the fit() method to train the linear regression model:

model = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)

The resulting model looks something like:

  intercept: -0.9
  coef: [ 0.   0. ]
  
which means that for states where only the x coordinate changes, the predicted target is simply equal to the reward minus the current observation multiplied by the coefficient of x. Similarly, for states where both coordinates change, the predicted target equals the reward plus twice the current observation multiplied by the coefficient of x. Note that since we're dealing with off-policy RL here, we don't need to worry about bootstrapping the estimator with the q-values from another neural network, although the bias correction algorithm can still work effectively even without doing so.  

Step 4: Apply bias correction to new observations

Suppose we receive a new observation o=(x, y, reward) from the agent. We want to compute the corrected observation according to the formula mentioned earlier:

corrected_observation = observation + (predicted_target - observation) * alpha

Let's say alpha=0.7. Then the corrected observation for the same observation would be:

correct_o = o + ((model.predict([o])[0]-o)*alpha, 0)

Since we're only interested in correcting the x component, the corrected observation would just be:

correct_o = (o[0]+(model.predict([[o]])[0][0]-o[0])*0.7, o[1])

Step 5: Evaluate the bias correction method

At regular intervals, evaluate the accuracy of our bias correction method by computing the mean squared error (MSE), root-mean square error (RMSE), and average reward difference (ARD) between the agent's corrected observations and the actual ones. Since we're only interested in comparing the x components, we can ignore the y components of the corrected observations and compare only the x components against the actual x components. 

One way to evaluate the bias correction method is to plot a histogram of the MSE values obtained throughout training, ideally covering a wide range of values. If the agent's bias is consistently overestimated, the histogram should show a sharp peak centered near the value of the initial MSE. If the agent's bias is consistently underestimated, the histogram should show a flat line at the very low value of the initial MSE. If the agent's bias is perfectly calibrated, the histogram should appear normal regardless of the starting point.

Another way to evaluate the bias correction method is to run test episodes with the agent that have known optimal trajectories defined by the teacher. Compare the mean cumulative reward achieved by the agent with and without bias correction, and report the ratio of the two numbers as the bias correction ratio BR:

BR = mean(cumulative reward with correction)/mean(cumulative reward without correction)

If the BR is greater than one, it suggests that the agent's bias was significantly reduced and should be trusted more than its baseline performance. If the BR is less than one, it suggests that the agent's bias was too strong and needs additional fine tuning before being considered reliable.

Finally, note that bias correction only reduces overestimation bias, but it doesn't eliminate underestimation bias entirely. Therefore, it's important to carefully select the hyperparameters alpha and gamma during experimentation and monitoring the effectiveness of the bias correction method.
