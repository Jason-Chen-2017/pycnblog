# 1.简介
  

The article will provide an overview of the importance of learning rate scheduling in deep neural networks (DNNs) training process. DNN training is often proved to be highly non-convex optimization problem which requires careful consideration of hyperparameters such as learning rate schedule to obtain better performance during model training.

In this blog post I will discuss why learning rate scheduling is necessary for DNN training, its key challenges, and some commonly used approaches towards addressing these challenges. The main goal of this post is to explain why a well designed learning rate scheduler can make all the difference in your models’ performance. 

# 2. Learning Rate Scheduling Overview
Deep Neural Networks are widely used in various applications ranging from image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition to medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. In recent years, there has been growing interest in applying Deep Learning techniques to real world problems with high level of complexity. These complexities include large data sets, multiple tasks involved, dynamic environments and challenging interdependencies among different factors that drive the system behavior. To address these complexities, several efficient methods have been proposed including transfer learning, multi-task learning, and self-supervised learning. However, each method introduces additional parameters or layers into the network architecture and may require finetuning the learning rate schedule to achieve best results. 

To train a deep neural network effectively, one must carefully tune the hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate. Good understanding of how these hyperparameters impact the convergence and generalization performance of the model is crucial before attempting to optimize them further. It is also important to note that many practical tricks exist to improve the speed and stability of the gradient descent algorithm while avoiding instability issues due to poorly scaled gradients. Some popular schedules used for optimizing the learning rate include step decay, exponential decay, and cosine annealing.

Learning rate scheduling refers to the process of adjusting the learning rate over time during the course of training a DNN. One should start by choosing a suitable initial learning rate and then use one of the learning rate schedulers provided below to gradually decrease it during training. This strategy allows the model to converge faster to a minimum loss value and prevent divergence if the learning rate is too high at the beginning of training. On the other hand, excessively slowing down the learning rate could lead to slower convergence and even overshooting the optimum solution, causing the model to learn suboptimal solutions or not converging at all. A good learning rate scheduler ensures that the model doesn't fall victim to the curse of dimensionality, i.e., small variations in input data can cause significant changes in the output. Hence, a well-designed learning rate scheduler can help improve the quality of the final model and save much effort spent on fine-tuning hyperparameters.

# 3. Learning Rate Schedule Challenges
There are two main challenges related to learning rate scheduling:

1. Overfitting: With increasing depth and complexity of a DNN, it becomes more prone to overfit the training set. This happens because a higher degree of freedom in the model leads to larger variance in the parameter estimates leading to worse generalization performance. Therefore, reducing the learning rate too quickly after every epoch would risk losing out on valuable information learned from the previous ones. 

2. Cyclical Behavior: As described earlier, cyclical behavior occurs when the learning rate suddenly drops rapidly to zero or remains constant throughout the entire training process. If left unchecked, cyclical behavior can lead to unpredictable convergence patterns and result in less than optimal performance. During cyclical behavior, the model struggles to find the global minima resulting in longer training times. Furthermore, cyclical behavior makes it difficult to determine the optimal learning rate since the optimal learning rate changes over time depending on the current state of the optimizer.

# 4. Commonly Used Approaches to Address Learning Rate Scheduler Challenges
Commonly used approaches to address the above mentioned challenges include:

1. Step Decay: Step decay is the simplest form of learning rate scheduling. Here, the learning rate decreases linearly over a fixed number of iterations until a certain milestone iteration is reached where it stays fixed. This approach is simple but effective and can handle most scenarios without any tuning. However, it does suffer from catastrophic oscillation if the learning rate is reduced too quickly. Additionally, it only works for convex functions and can become unstable in non-convex settings like RNNs.

2. Exponential Decay: Similar to step decay, exponential decay reduces the learning rate exponentially over time. However, instead of keeping the learning rate constant at a particular iteration, it starts with a small learning rate and eventually decays it exponentially. This helps to reduce the oscillations that can occur in step decay and can perform better under non-convex settings. However, it requires careful tuning of the hyperparameters and is computationally expensive compared to step decay.

3. Cosine Annealing: This is another type of learning rate scheduling that improves on both step decay and exponential decay by gradually decreasing the learning rate from the peak to the end of cycle using a cosine function. This approach is particularly useful for very large datasets where cycling through the entire dataset is not feasible. Also, cosine annealing is robust to bad initialization of the weights and provides fast convergence in the early stages of training. However, it can still get stuck in a local minimum if the learning rate is set too low and is sensitive to the choice of momentum term.

4. 1Cycle Policy: Finally, a new policy called “1cycle” was recently proposed that combines the advantages of traditional schedules like step decay, exponential decay, and cosine annealing. Instead of changing the learning rate linearly or exponentially, they increase and decrease the maximum learning rate separately using a combination of triangular and circular annealing. They perform a series of steps within the first few hundred iterations that progressively increases the maximum learning rate until reaching the desired value, while maintaining a constant minimum learning rate throughout. This policy is specifically designed to handle the cyclical behavior that appears during deep networks training and prevents the model from getting stuck in a bad local minimum.

Based on my experience working with deep neural networks, I believe that selecting the right learning rate scheduler plays a critical role in obtaining better results. Selecting the wrong scheduler can lead to inferior results, longer training times, or even divergences. For instance, if we choose the incorrect scheduler based on our intuition or naive assumptions about the distribution of the error signal, the model might learn suboptimal solutions that don’t generalize well to new test inputs. Moreover, having a well-tuned learning rate scheduler can significantly accelerate the convergence of the model and help us reach the global optimum.
