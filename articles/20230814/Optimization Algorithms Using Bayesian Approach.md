# 1.简介
  

In this article, we will discuss the optimization algorithms using bayesian approach and how to use them in practical problems. We also explain some key concepts such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, variational inference algorithm and model selection criteria like AIC, BIC or Cross Validation technique. Finally, we implement these algorithms on two popular machine learning libraries namely scikit-learn and tensorflow for comparison purposes. In conclusion, this article provides a good understanding of various optimization techniques used by modern deep neural networks, which can be implemented efficiently using existing packages.

# 2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method
## Definition
Markov chain is a sequence of random states with certain probabilistic transitions between those states depending on the previous state. It can be defined mathematically as:

$P(x_{t+1} \mid x_t)= P(x_{t+1}, x_{t-1},..., x_1)$

where $x_i$ denotes the current state at time step i. The probability distribution $P(x_{t+1}\mid x_t)$ specifies the conditional probability that the next state is x_{t+1} given the present state x_t. 

The purpose of MCMC methods is to approximate the true target density function p(x), where x represents the input space of our problem. It does so by simulating a series of steps through the Markov chain starting from an initial point xi, whose value is usually chosen randomly. At each step t=1...T, the algorithm proposes a candidate state xc and evaluates its acceptance probability, which is related to the likelihood ratio. If it exceeds a predefined threshold, the proposal is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected. Eventually, we converge to the desired target distribution p(x). 

We have several MCMC algorithms available such as Metropolis Hastings, Gibbs Sampling, etc., but here we will focus on one particular algorithm called "Metropolis-Hastings".

## Procedure
1. Choose a probability distribution q(x) to represent the unknown target distribution p(x).

2. Initialize your position xi ∼ U[−π, π], where −π ≤ ξ < π are the boundaries of the state space. 

3. Repeat until convergence {

   a. Generate a proposed move dx ∼ N(0, σ), where σ is a tuning parameter.
   
   b. Compute the acceptance probability A = min[q(xc)/q(xi), 1]. 
   
   c. Generate u ∼ Uniform[0, 1]
   
   d. Accept if u ≤ A, else reject.
   
   e. Set xi = xc.
   
  }

Here's how we can interpret the above algorithm:

1. We start by choosing a distribution q(x) which has been assumed beforehand to represent the real world data generating process. This means we don't know what the underlying generative process is, but instead assume it follows a known probability distribution.

2. We initialize our starting position in a region of state space where most of the mass is concentrated. We do this because we want to avoid getting stuck in local minima, especially early in the training process.

3. Our main goal is to find the best set of parameters such that the estimated density function of our samples matches the target distribution as closely as possible. Therefore, we repeatedly generate new positions xi' within the same state space, evaluate their acceptance probabilities and decide whether to accept them or not based on the Metropolis-Hastings criterion.

By repeating this procedure many times, we eventually obtain a sample from the target distribution that is representative of the actual distribution of the data generating process.

# 3 Variational Inference Algorithm
Variational inference is a powerful tool for approximating complex posterior distributions in complex models. Unlike other optimization algorithms, variational inference works by constructing a family of potential functions and optimizing them with respect to a Kullback-Leibler divergence term. The basic idea behind variational inference is to optimize a lower bound on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) with respect to the approximation error:

$$\text{argmin}_{\phi} \mathbb{E}_{p_\theta}(L(\theta,\psi)) - D_{\KL}(q_\phi(\theta)||p_\theta(\theta|x)), \text{ s.t.} \; \theta \in \Theta, \psi \in \Psi $$

Here, $\theta$ refers to the latent variables of interest and they are typically treated as hidden variables in the form of vectors. $\Phi$ is the set of all possible sets of values for $\phi$, and $\Psi$ is the set of all possible sets of values for $\psi$. In practice, the complexity of $\Theta$ and $\Psi$ grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of the observed data $x$. Thus, finding the optimal solution may require computing very large numbers of values.

One common choice for $\phi$ and $\psi$ is the mean field assumption, where both families consist of independent multivariate Gaussian distributions. Specifically, the prior distribution over $\theta$ is represented by a mean vector and a covariance matrix, while the variational distribution is represented by a set of diagonal covariance matrices applied to independent standard normal noise variables. Hence, the ELBO can be written as:

$$L(\theta,\psi) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log p(y_i|\theta) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^D (\mu_j^2+\sigma^2_j-\log\lambda_j)^2 + const.$$

Where $\theta=(\mu_1,...,\mu_D)$ are the mean vectors, $\sigma^2_j$ are the variances and $\lambda_j$ are the inverse scales corresponding to each dimension of $\theta$. By taking the gradient of the ELBO with respect to $\phi$ and maximizing it, we get an estimate of the optimal family of distributions for $\theta$ that minimize the approximation error. These estimates correspond to the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) point estimator, and they provide a natural way of incorporating prior knowledge into the estimation process. Moreover, since the number of dimensions involved increases quadratically with the size of the dataset, computation time becomes impractical even for relatively small datasets.

Another useful choice for $\phi$ and $\psi$ is the stochastic variational inference (SVI) algorithm, which uses stochastic gradient descent to optimize the ELBO. In particular, we first draw a mini-batch of data points $B=\{x_b\}$ and compute the reparameterized gradient using a Monte Carlo approximation of the expectations over the complete dataset. Then, we apply a stochastic update rule to adjust the parameters of the variational distribution $\psi$ based on this gradient. Since we only need to store the history of gradients rather than the full dataset during the entire training process, SVI is much more memory efficient compared to deterministic gradient-based approaches. However, due to its dependence on sampling, SVI is less stable and prone to slower convergence rates than deterministic gradient-based approaches.

Finally, there exist many other variations of variational inference, including structured variational inference and score function variational inference, which provide additional flexibility and control over the family of distributions being optimized. Overall, the choice of the exact family of distributions depends on the structure of the model and the strength of prior assumptions, which makes variational inference a powerful tool for building complex statistical models.

# 4 Model Selection Criteria
Model selection refers to selecting the best model among a set of candidates. In order to select a suitable model, we need to define a measure of discrepancy between the expected performance of different models and the empirical performance of a specific test set. Common metrics include AIC, BIC, cross validation and regularization methods. Here, we will introduce AIC, BIC and cross validation techniques respectively.

AIC stands for Akaike Information Criterion. It is a penalty-based model selection criterion used in statistics to compare multiple models based on information theory. The formula for AIC is:

$$AIC(\theta)=n\ln(\hat L)-2\ell(\hat \theta)$$

$\hat L$ is the maximum likelihood estimate of the log-likelihood of the model with fixed hyperparameters $\theta$ evaluated on the training set. $\ell(\hat \theta)$ is the negative log-prior probability of the model. Intuitively, AIC measures the relative quality of the fitted model against the complexity of the model. A higher AIC indicates a better fit whereas a smaller AIC indicates a simpler model. A small value of AIC is preferred over larger values when comparing models.

Similarly, BIC stands for Bayesian Information Criterion. It is another penalty-based model selection criterion that takes into account the complexity of the model. The formula for BIC is:

$$BIC(\theta)=n\ln(\hat L)-\frac{1}{\ell(\hat \theta)}\sum_{i=1}^{K}\ln(m_i)$$

where $m_i$ is the number of observations in group $i$ in the training set. BIC penalizes models with higher complexity by adding a penalty term proportional to the square of the number of free parameters ($m_i$). Hence, increasing the number of groups decreases the impact of the penalty term and results in a simpler model. As with AIC, a smaller BIC value is preferred over larger values when comparing models.

Cross validation involves partitioning the data into separate subsets and fitting a model to each subset separately. We then average the out-of-sample errors obtained by applying the model to the remaining data to estimate the generalization error of the model. Cross validation gives us a more reliable estimate of the predictive performance of the model than simple train/test splits, particularly in cases where the amount of data is limited.

Regularization methods involve introducing a penalty term to the loss function that controls the complexity of the model. For example, ridge regression adds a squared magnitude of the coefficients to the loss function, while lasso regression limits the absolute value of the coefficient weights. Both approaches aim to reduce variance without significantly affecting the bias of the model. Regularization helps to prevent overfitting, thus improving the predictive performance of the model.
