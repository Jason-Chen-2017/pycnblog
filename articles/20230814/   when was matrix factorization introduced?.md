Matrix Factorization (MF) is a collaborative filtering algorithm that decomposes the user-item rating matrix into two smaller matrices: one representing the latent preferences of users and another one for items. These latent factors are learned through collaborative filtering by observing user behavior on various items they have not rated but interacted with. The two latent factors represent the underlying preferences of users and items respectively and can be used to recommend new items or improve existing ones. Matrix Factorization has been around since 1997 and is widely used in recommender systems including Netflix, Amazon, etc. It can handle large datasets efficiently because it involves efficient optimization algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares (ALS). 

In this article we will discuss how MF was first proposed, why its implementation details matter and what are some key advantages of using ALS over other popular approaches like SVD or Regularized Logistic Regression. We will also provide detailed step-by-step instructions and code examples to help readers understand the basic principles behind Matrix Factorization. Finally, we will look at some current research directions and open challenges related to MF.

Let’s get started!


# 2. 背景介绍
One of the earliest works addressing collaborative filtering is known as “collaborative filtering” based on KNN algorithms [1]. Collaborative Filtering, also called User-based CF or Item-based CF, refers to techniques where information about user preferences and their past behavior on items is utilized to predict the ratings of unseen items for a given user [2]. Since then, many collaborative filtering models have been developed to address different aspects of recommendation system, from content-based filtering (CBF), to hybrid recommendation algorithms combining CBF and social network analysis (SNA) [3], to deep learning methods for personalized recommendations [4].

However, matrix decomposition techniques were originally designed for image and text processing applications and were considered computationally expensive due to high dimensionality and sparsity requirements [5]. Therefore, there had not been much effort put towards developing matrix decomposition algorithms for recommendation systems until recently. 

Matrix Decomposition based Collaborative Filtering techniques, which refer to those methods that use a low-rank approximation of the original user-item rating matrix to learn the latent preferences of users and items, have emerged in recent years, particularly for sparse data sets [6] and better performance compared to standard linear regression based collaborative filtering methods [7]. 

Matrix Factorization, a specific type of matrix decomposition technique commonly used for collaborative filtering, was first proposed in 1997 by Singh and Bach [8]. However, the origin of MF remains controversial and many papers propose alternative solutions before discussing the details of MF itself. In this article, we focus specifically on the development of Matrix Factorization model, as well as presenting some of its most relevant characteristics.

## Users and Items 
The core idea behind collaborative filtering is that people who share similar interests tend to rate similarly to the same products, services, or ideas. Thus, the goal of collaborative filtering is to develop a prediction model that takes into account individual user preferences and their interactions with different items (e.g., books, movies, restaurants). 

Users and items are typically represented by numerical indices. For example, if we have N users and M items, each user could be identified by an index i = 1, 2,..., N, while each item could be identified by an index j = 1, 2,..., M. Each entry of the user-item rating matrix R(i,j) represents the user’s preference for item j, ranging between 1 (terrible) and 5 (excellent). 

In general, each row of the matrix corresponds to a user, while each column corresponds to an item. The diagonal entries of the matrix correspond to the ratings provided by the user for the corresponding item, usually indicating the level of agreement between the user and the item. Nonzero values indicate preferences or ratings made by users to items, whereas zero values mean that no explicit feedback has been received regarding these pairs. 

To compute predicted ratings, we assume that the true preference of user u for item i can be approximated by the dot product of their latent factors, denoted by Uu and Ii, respectively, plus a bias term: 

rui = bu + Bi + Su * Ui + Vj 

where bi is the bias term associated with user u; Bu and Vi are the bias terms associated with item v; Si is the element at position i of the vector Si; Ui is the element at position u of the vector Ui. This equation estimates the score of user u for item v by taking into account both her own preferences for item v as well as the preferences of similar users with respect to items v. Hence, MF aims to find two low-rank matrices, one for users and one for items, such that the error between the estimated scores and the actual ratings can be minimized.

## Latent Factors 
Latent factors play an essential role in the matrix factorization approach. They capture the underlying structure of the user-item rating matrix without explicitly modeling any user/item features. Intuitively, a latent factor captures a property or feature of the object being modeled, such as the color or texture of an item, or the taste of a customer. The latent factors should capture important patterns that influence the similarity between users and items, so that missing links can be filled automatically by the algorithm during the prediction process. By inferring latent factors directly from the data, we hope to obtain better predictions than just relying on simple rules or heuristics.

In MF, the latent factors are represented as vectors in the space of user-item interactions. Each user and each item is associated with a set of k latent factors, typically chosen as small enough to explain most of the variance in the observed ratings. The two sets of factors are combined together to form the complete representation of the user-item rating matrix. Specifically, the user factors (denoted by U) contain the effects of all possible combinations of latent factors among all items that the user interacted with; likewise, the item factors (denoted by I) contain the effects of all possible combinations of latent factors among all users that have interacted with the item. Then, we estimate the user-item interaction score as follows: 


ruv = ∑∑ Σij Rij ui vi 

where ui and vi are the elements of the user factor vector Ui and the item factor vector Vi, respectively, obtained after multiplying the corresponding columns of the U and I matrices, respectively. This formula expresses the expected value of the user's rating for a particular item, based on the sum of the effect of every user on every item. 

Note that the complexity of calculating the dot product of two rank k matrices becomes O(nk^2) in the worst case, making this method impractical for very large data sets. To reduce the computational cost, several optimizing algorithms have been proposed to approximate the exact solution of the problem within reasonable time constraints, depending on the size of the dataset and the number of latent factors. These include Alternating Least Squares (ALS), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization. All these methods aim to minimize the loss function (i.e., the difference between the predicted and actual ratings) by updating the parameters of the matrices iteratively, rather than computing the full dot product repeatedly.

In summary, MF defines a low-rank approximation of the user-item rating matrix, where each user and each item is represented by a set of latent factors, which are jointly optimized to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual ratings. Within this framework, traditional linear algebraic methods such as SVD and Lasso are adapted to solve the problems associated with handling large datasets, allowing us to make accurate predictions even for extremely sparse matrices.
