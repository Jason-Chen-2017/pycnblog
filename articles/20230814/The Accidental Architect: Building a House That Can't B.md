“Accidental architects” are the kind of people who create things that aren’t quite what they set out to build - but that somehow work well and are fulfilling in their daily lives. This is a misconception that I want to clear up for you today by explaining why this phenomenon exists, how it works, and why we need to avoid getting caught up in its myths.

In our modern world, we often think about architecture as something that has been carefully planned over many years. In reality, though, most architectural designs come from accidental inspiration or creativity - just like every other project that we undertake on a regular basis. We find solutions that work better than any plan we could have imagined at the beginning, usually due to an unexpected constraint or new challenge. Just like all kinds of projects, building anything requires careful consideration of materials, layout, construction techniques, and ongoing maintenance to ensure the final product is both functional and comfortable for the user. And while accidental architectures can be fascinating, they also present unique challenges, such as keeping them simple and practical without being too complicated or convoluted.

To understand more deeply the role of accidental architects, let me tell you a story of a few months ago when I was working with one of these “accidental architects.” It happened so suddenly that I couldn’t even remember exactly how or where I had ended up during that time – until I found myself standing outside a high-rise building in San Francisco… A long time ago, I had built a small townhouse for my grandmother who had just moved into town. After seeing her home, I realized that I had done the exact same thing! But instead of rebuilding the entire house, I chose to make some modifications to it based on her needs. I removed the old garage and replaced it with a smaller, brighter storage space, which she uses frequently to store clothing and linen. Then I made sure to add low-energy light fixtures throughout the home, to provide enough natural light for her comfort whilst still allowing for cooling through the windows. All of these changes seemed so unusual that they must have been designed intentionally, rather than simply following a blueprint. Despite these differences, the result is a beautiful, easy-to-maintain house that looks great and functions perfectly fine for her use case.

Now imagine that you were tasked with building another similar structure, but one that was supposed to accommodate different occupancy levels. You know your limitations and would want to keep the project as simple and straightforward as possible, yet ensure that everything is accessible and affordably priced. How would you approach this problem? Would you start with scratch or look for similar structures that may have already been designed for a lower occupancy level and repurpose them? Or would you try to recreate a simplified version of the first structure using various wood types and finishes, and adjust it according to the new requirements?

This brings us back to the concept of accidental architects - not only do they make amazing designs that completely change the way we live, but they also serve as test cases for new technologies, ideas, and processes. By taking advantage of the unexpected nature of building, we learn early on that there is always room for improvement, and no matter how much experience we have accrued, we cannot predict precisely what will happen next. So if you encounter an opportunity to explore new areas of technology, ask yourself whether it might also be an opportunity to create something entirely original and unconventional. Maybe you don’t even realize it yet, but you have already been exploiting the potential that lies within every day objects, living spaces, and environments. Do you ever consider those possibilities for your own life or work?
2. 概览Introduction
"accidental architects" 也被称为 "意外建筑师(accidental architect)"。他们制造出来的东西和预期完全不同，但是却得到了不少人的喜爱。这是因为在现代世界里，我们通常把建筑领域理解成一件有计划、多年打磨过的事情。实际上，很多建筑设计都是偶然的创意或者反应，就像每天都要面对许多重复性工作一样。我们找到的是比起一开始设想的方案更有效的解决方法，往往是因为突发状况或新的挑战引起的。与其他所有项目一样，建造任何东西都需要仔细考虑材料、布局、施工技术和日后维护等方面的因素，以确保最终产品既能满足用户的需求，又能让他心满意足。而虽然意外建筑可以令人着迷，但它们也会给人带来独特的挑战，比如要保持简洁、实用，同时也不要太复杂或繁琐。

为了更深刻地理解意外建筑的作用，让我用一个亲身经历告诉你吧。那时，我正在参与一个"意外建筑师"的项目。项目很突然，记忆力差，甚至连从哪里来到这里都模糊不清。不过幸运的是，我发现自己站在一座高架公寓门前，恰巧看到她家中的大楼。十几年前，我曾经为祖母的新居打造了一个小木屋。看完她的房子之后，我意识到我所做的一切，正好和她当初一样！只是后来，我选择了一点小小改动，把原先的车库砌墙一新，并添置了一些在客厅和卧室中使用的低功耗灯光，这使得祖母能够在外面读书，同时也提供了足够的暖气。这些改变虽显得陌生而不可思议，但却也确实在于设计之下，才可能出现如此神似之物。尽管这些变化带来了不少不便和麻烦，但结果却是一栋美丽，功能齐全的小屋，对于她来说已经足够。

在这个故事里，你应该能看到，意外建筑的作用。尤其是在面对不同的居住层次时，如何让建造物尽量简单直白，并且价格合理，这是一个重要的问题。那么，如果你遇到这样的建造任务，该怎么办呢？是否应该从零开始，还是适应类似原有结构的设计，并改进呢？还是仿照第一套建筑结构，采用不同的木质和布 finish ，然后再根据新的需要进行调整呢？

这种探索既可以是为了享受生活带来的惊喜，也可以成为学习新技术、新想法、新过程的良好机会。通过突发事件的特性，我们早期就知道，建造某些东西不只局限于符合设计要求，还可能受到外部环境的影响甚至干扰。所以，无论我们手头有多少经验，如果发现某个领域可供开发，那就可以考虑一下，是否也能将之用于自己的生活或者工作中。毕竟，日常生活中，每个物品，空间，环境都在提供着我们宝贵的未知，你是否也不妨多加利用呢？
