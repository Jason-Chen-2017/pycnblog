Visual question answering (VQA) is a challenging computer vision task that requires both visual understanding and language understanding abilities of the system. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated great success in VQA tasks due to their ability to capture contextual relationships between objects and text descriptions. However, most existing CNN-based VQA models do not explicitly consider temporal information, which can be crucial for some complex questions such as those involving motion or actions. To address this issue, we propose an attention mechanism called "temporal attention" that captures both spatial and temporal dependencies among image regions and words in a VQA sequence. Our approach is integrated into two state-of-the-art CNN-based VQA models: EfficientNet and BiDAF. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show significant improvements over these baseline models with temporal attention enabled. In addition, our experiments reveal several interesting insights into how different features affect performance on VQA tasks, and help identify relevant areas for future research in this area. This article provides an overview of the problem, basic concepts, algorithms, experiment results, and future directions for VQA using temporal attention.

Recent years have seen an explosion of deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). With increasing computational power and availability of large amounts of data, CNNs have been rapidly applied to numerous computer vision tasks such as object recognition, segmentation, classification, and detection. Despite the promising performance of CNNs in various computer vision applications, it remains a challenge to handle visual input sequences containing varying levels of complexity while maintaining high accuracy. One common way to solve this challenge is through recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where sequential inputs are processed sequentially in time rather than all at once. A typical RNN architecture involves processing each element of the input sequence individually by passing them through a hidden layer, resulting in a final output vector representing the entire sequence. 

One example of a previous work that has attempted to use RNNs to model VQA tasks is the Bidirectional Attention Flow (BiDAF) network proposed by Grishman et al., 2017. The BiDAF network combines a bidirectional LSTM module and self-attention mechanisms to predict the start and end positions of answers within images, given a natural language question. Self-attention allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and focus on important elements during inference, improving overall performance compared to conventional RNN methods. Although BiDAF outperformed standard RNN models by a wide margin on some benchmarks, its main drawback was its dependence on pre-trained word embeddings, making it difficult to generalize to new VQA datasets with different vocabulary sizes. Moreover, BiDAF did not take advantage of spatial relationships between objects and text, potentially limiting its utility for more complex tasks like visual question answering.

To improve upon BiDAF, Chen et al., 2019 introduced the EfficientNet model that significantly improved the original BiDAF methodology and reduced the number of parameters by a factor of 4-10x. They also introduced techniques like width scaling and depth scaling to further increase efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Nevertheless, they still used static image features extracted from ResNet-50 instead of spatio-temporal features obtained through a transformer-like model. Their findings suggested that using efficient architectures and effective regularization strategies may result in similar accuracies but with smaller parameter counts. To incorporate spatio-temporal dependencies, Zhang et al., 2021 proposes another novel technique called Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) based Temporal Attention Module (TAM) that leverages long short-term memory units to capture interdependencies between adjacent frames in a video. TAM is used to generate temporal contexts for both image regions and tokens in a VQA sequence, allowing the model to capture both local and global dependencies across the sequence. In contrast to TAM, our approach only considers consecutive pairs of image regions and words in the sequence. We believe that this limitation may limit the scope of our approach, but could prove useful in certain situations where stronger temporal dependencies are required. Overall, there is a need for better approaches that integrate both spatial and temporal dependencies in order to achieve higher accuracy in VQA tasks.
