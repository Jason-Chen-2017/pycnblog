Medication management is an important aspect of a successful treatment plan for a variety of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, heart disease and many others. It involves selecting the most appropriate medication(s) at the right doses based on patient’s symptoms and health status so that the medication has optimal effectiveness in treating the condition. However, there are limited data available to predict the expected duration of each medication once prescribed, especially when it comes to tapering dosages over time or administering more frequently than daily or weekly. This article aims to provide an accurate prediction of how long your medication will last by applying a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), which uses a combination of statistical models and decision trees to learn patterns in historical medication administration data and accurately forecast future treatments with high accuracy. GBT combines both expert-derived features and automatically learned features from the medical records to create a highly accurate model that provides predictions within one hour of actual administration. 

In this article, we will go through the following steps:

2. Feature Engineering using Expert Knowledge and Medical Records
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Prediction of Future Dosage Duration

## What Is Medication Management?
Medication management is the process of selectively choosing medications based on symptoms, physical conditions and personal preference to prevent, manage, and cure illness or injury. The goal of medication management is to optimize the use of medical care while maintaining healthy functioning and improving outcomes for patients. In recent years, researchers have found numerous ways to improve medication management programs, including increasing access to quality drugs, enhancing patient education about medication use, and streamlining processes such as dispensing and refilling medicines. By managing medication effectively, people can achieve better results in their lives.

## Types Of Medication Management Programs
There are several types of medication management programs, depending on the structure, resources, and goals of the program. Some examples include:

1. Community Based Care Plans: These programs involve community organizations working together to identify needs and address issues related to medication access and usage. Examples of community based care plans include Mental Health Program (MHP) for individuals struggling with depression, Drug Abuse Prevention Program (DAPP) for children with substance abuse concerns, and Veteran’s Administration of Care Program (VACP) for military veterans seeking support and guidance during their recovery period.

2. Integrated Delivery Models: With integrated delivery models, individuals receive medications throughout the day without having to visit a clinic or pick up a pill box. Examples of integrated delivery models include Apple Watch apps like Headspace, Insulin Pump Online App (IPOA) for those who want to track insulin intake, and Fitbit Charge 2 for exercising or getting some fresh air after a hard day’s workout. 

3. Home Medication Management Systems: These systems allow users to monitor medication schedule, reminders, statistics, and medication adherence. Examples of home medication management systems include MyMedicare Advantage, NetMedics, Tidewise, and MediGuide.

4. Individualized Medication Adherence Management Tools: These tools help patients make informed choices about when to take medication based on their preferences and symptoms, rather than relying solely on prescription schedules. Popular examples of individualized medication adherence management tools include QuikScrum, Epicurve, and Meditech ADHERENCE PLANNER™.

5. Pharmacotherapy/Therapeutic Modalities: Therapeutic modalities, also known as pharmacotherapies, are designed to target specific diseases or conditions and focus on specific treatment modalities. They typically involve natural products (e.g., herbal medicine, probiotics) or synthetic products (e.g., biologics). For example, Lipitor is used to relieve acne symptoms caused by topical application of aloe vera gel. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) therapy is used to treat high blood pressure. Anticoagulation therapy is often recommended in cases of cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease.

## Terminology Used In Medication Management
Before proceeding further, let's briefly review terminology commonly used in medication management.

### Dose
The amount of medication administered to a patient. Different medications may require different doses to be effective. A common unit of measurement for doses is mg per tablet or milligram per unit, although units varied across various medications. Dosing regimens consist of a regular frequency and a fixed dosage amount, either specified by the manufacturer or determined by a prescriber or physician's assessment of the patient's need. For instance, a person might start taking aspirin 4 times per day with a daily dose of 2mg/day initially followed by repeated administrations of the same dose every other day until symptoms resolve.

### Treatment Plans
Treatment plans specify the medications to be taken along with any additional dosage instructions, timing, or scheduling details. Common planning templates include “daily medication” (medications to be taken before sleeping or eating) and “routine medication” (medications to be taken during normal office hours). Treatment plans should be reviewed annually to ensure they remain relevant and provide the best possible care to patients.

### Medication Adherence
Medication adherence refers to the consistent and accurate application of medications over time according to a prescribed schedule. Patients who consistently follow their prescribed medications are considered to be well-managed, while those whose adherence falls below a certain threshold are considered to have poor adherence or under-taking medications. Overall, good medication adherence helps patients avoid side effects and maintain optimal health outcomes.

### Patient Safety
Patient safety plays a crucial role in medication management programs. Assessing and promoting safe practices is essential to reducing potential harm to patients, families, and communities. Guidelines for ensuring medication safety include labelling all medications clearly, limiting concentrations of medications, keeping medication containers clean, and implementing post-administration monitoring and feedback mechanisms. Continuous patient monitoring is an integral part of medication management to ensure continuous compliance with treatment protocols.

### Monitoring And Evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation of medication performance is critical in order to identify areas where medication management can be improved. There are several methods and techniques used to evaluate medication effectiveness, including behavioral tests, questionnaires, surveys, and retrospective reviews. Regular evaluations can help determine whether current medication regimens still meet the needs of patients, and to detect changes in patient behaviors that could indicate the need for adjustment.

Overall, medication management programs serve multiple purposes, including optimizing patient care, minimizing risks associated with medication errors, and providing beneficial outcomes for patients. Despite these complexities, successful implementation requires patience, understanding of medication options, and consistency in practice.
