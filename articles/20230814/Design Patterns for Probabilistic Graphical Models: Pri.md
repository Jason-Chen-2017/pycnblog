# 1.简介
  

Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are a popular statistical framework used in various fields such as machine learning, data analysis, signal processing, and network modeling. In this article, we will review the basic concepts of PGM along with its algorithms, terminology, notation, implementation, and applications. We will also discuss how to use these patterns effectively to solve probabilistic problems. 

The objective of writing this article is to provide an accessible introduction to PGM, explain key terms and principles, present concrete examples illustrating their usage, and highlight common pitfalls and potential issues that may arise while using them. The insights gained from this paper will be beneficial to practitioners who want to become more proficient at designing, implementing, and analyzing complex probabilistic systems. This paper can serve as a reference guide for developers, researchers, teachers, and students interested in working with PGMs.

In summary, the goal of this article is to help readers understand the fundamental principles behind PGMs, gain practical skills by demonstrating effective application of these patterns, and prevent common mistakes and pitfalls when dealing with real-world problems.


# 2.PGM Background
## 2.1 History of PGM
PGM was first proposed in the field of computer science as a way to model joint distributions over a set of variables. It has been widely adopted since then, and it continues to be one of the most important statistical frameworks used today. Its popularity stems from several factors such as computational efficiency, interpretability, and scalability.

The earliest work on probabilistic graphical models dates back to the late 1970s, when Thompson introduced a method called Bayes nets for representing conditional probability distributions. In fact, all modern PGM techniques have borrowed elements from Bayesian networks or extended them. Nevertheless, much of the theory underlying PGM remains unexplored until relatively recently.

As a result, there are many different variations of PGM, each with its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the problem domain. However, they share some core ideas and methods. These include directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), factorization, conditionals, inference, optimization, and marginalization.

## 2.2 Terminologies and Notations
Before moving forward with our discussion, let us familiarize ourselves with some commonly used terms and notations in PGM. Here's what you should know before continuing:

1. Random variable: A random variable is any variable whose value depends on chance alone. Examples of random variables include coin flip, die roll, stock price, disease status, etc. 

2. Factor: A factor refers to the product of two or more random variables. Each factor represents a portion of the joint distribution between multiple random variables. For example, if we have three binary random variables X, Y, Z, then their joint distribution can be represented as a three-way table known as a clique table. Each cell contains the number of ways we could observe X, Y, and Z simultaneously given that they are all equal to either 0 or 1. Therefore, we can represent the corresponding factor graphically as a three-node cliques joined together through shared edges.

3. Clique: A clique refers to a fully connected subgraph within a factor graph. The nodes in a clique correspond to the random variables involved in its definition. For instance, a single node in a chain graph corresponds to a single random variable; a single node in a grid graph corresponds to a pair of random variables.

4. Markov blanket: The markov blanket of a node in a graph defines all other nodes that influence its values directly or indirectly. That means, if a random variable influences another random variable directly but does so indirectly through its parents, then both will be included in the markov blanket of the child.

5. CPD: Conditional probability distribution. An extension of the term "probability distribution" that describes the probability of a specific outcome occurring under certain conditions. In general, it is a function that specifies the probabilities of each possible combination of values for the variables in the event that all of those variables take on nonzero values.

6. Parent set: The parent set of a node in a factor graph refers to all the variables that affect its value directly. The children of the node then determine its value based on the values assigned to its parents.

7. Potential: A potential is a measure of the degree to which a variable might take on a particular value given the current state of the system. It captures the degree of uncertainty associated with the probability distribution of a random variable. 

8. Inference: The process of estimating or inferring hidden variables given observed data. There are two main types of inference in PGM - exact inference and approximate inference. Exact inference involves computing the true answer to a question, whereas approximate inference relies on heuristics or approximations to obtain a reasonably accurate solution.

9. Belief propagation: A technique for performing efficient inference in probabilistic graphical models. It works by passing messages across the graph from variable to variable to update their beliefs about their values based on their incoming messages.

With these definitions out of the way, let's move onto discussing PGM itself!
