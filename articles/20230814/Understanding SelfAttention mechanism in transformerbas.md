# 2.Background Introduction
Transformer-based models are state-of-the-art NLP models that have achieved tremendous progress recently. In recent years, they have emerged as one of the most popular deep learning models for sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and text classification. These models employ an attention mechanism called "self-attention" which allows them to focus on different parts of the input at different times during training and inference. In this section, we will briefly explain the basic concepts behind the self-attention mechanism. 


Self-Attention Mechanism 
A self-attention mechanism is an attention mechanism where each element in the query vector is compared only with elements from the corresponding key vectors and value vectors. This means that the model learns to assign weights to different parts of the input sentence instead of just comparing individual words or characters. Let us consider an example to understand this concept more clearly. 

Suppose you want to learn about movies. You start by watching a few reviews on IMDB website and come up with a list of recommended movies. Each movie review contains a list of actors, directors, genre, plot summary, etc. One possible way to represent these features is using word embeddings. Now let's say you want to rate a particular movie on a scale of 1-10. To do this, you need to figure out which features were important to determine your rating. One way to approach this problem would be to calculate the similarity between the selected movie feature and all the features associated with similar movies. However, calculating pairwise similarities between thousands of movie features may not be feasible. So, another solution could be to use a self-attention mechanism. 

In self-attention mechanism, the model calculates a weighted sum of the values vectors given the queries vectors and keys vectors. The weight assigned to each value vector depends on the similarity between the query vector and the corresponding key vector. Mathematically, it represents the dot product of the query and key vectors divided by the square root of the dimensionality of the vectors. 

This idea can be extended to any sequential data such as sequences of images, speech signals, texts, etc., making it very powerful in solving many problems related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Medical Imaging.


Self-Attention vs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) / Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Although both the self-attention mechanism and CNNs/LSTMs have certain common traits, there are significant differences among them. Here are some points to keep in mind while comparing them:

1. Input Sequence Length - In both cases, the length of the input sequence affects the computational complexity of the model. For instance, if we want to predict the sentiment of a sentence, the longer the sentence, the higher the chance that the model might get lost in the details. On the other hand, CNNs and LSTMs are designed to process fixed size inputs such as images or audio clips. Therefore, they don't take variable-length input directly but instead pad or truncate the sequence before feeding it to the network. 

2. Attention Over Ranges of Positions - Both self-attention mechanism and CNNs allow the attention weights to be computed over multiple positions within the input sequence. However, the range of attention positions is limited in the case of CNNs because they rely on local receptive fields and therefore cannot look ahead beyond a single pixel position. On the other hand, self-attention allows for global connections across all positions in the input sequence, thus allowing much deeper reasoning than traditional convolutional neural networks. 

3. Multi-head Attention - Self-attention mechanism uses multi-head attention to capture the relationships between different positions in the input sequence. A typical implementation involves dividing the embedding space into multiple subspaces and performing separate attention operations on each subspace separately. It then concatenates the resulting vectors to obtain the final output representation. In contrast, CNNs typically involve a single linear projection followed by several layers of non-linearity. Therefore, they perform channel-wise attention without considering spatial correlations.  

Overall, self-attention mechanism has shown impressive results in capturing complex relationships in input sequences compared to standard CNNs and LSTMs. With further development and optimization, these models could potentially replace traditional approaches in various NLP applications.
