## Abstract

DeepMind’s StarCraft II is a massively multiplayer online battle arena video game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. In this article, I will talk about the basic principles of Reinforcement Learning algorithm which is used to train AI agent in StarCraft game. Moreover, I will explain how the Q-learning algorithm works with some code examples for better understanding. Lastly, I will show some future challenges that can be faced by using Reinforcement Learning in StarCraft game as well as its advantages over other machine learning algorithms like Deep Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks.

This blog post will help anyone interested in studying and implementing Reinforcement Learning algorithms on their own. If you have not played any games before then it might take some time to understand the concepts mentioned below but once you get hang of them then this article would definitely make your life easier. So let’s begin…!


## Introduction 

Reinforcement Learning(RL) refers to an area of Machine Learning where agents learn from experience and take actions based on the rewards they receive. It is widely used in fields such as robotics, gaming, finance, healthcare, etc. The main aim behind RL is to develop an agent that learns to perform tasks in an environment without being explicitly programmed. The agent explores the environment by taking action, receives feedback regarding its performance and adjusts itself according to the result. This process continues until the agent achieves the desired goal.

In DeepMind's StarCraft II, we are given a scenario consisting of several different types of units, known as "units". Our task is to build a single army unit called "Protoss" that will fight against multiple opponents and win the game. Here, we use the term Protoss instead of Human because only Prociesses can fight using special abilities called Forge ability. We also need to remember that our Agent must build one army unit.

We start by defining what exactly is an agent? An agent can refer to any software system or device that interacts with the environment either by producing actions or consuming observations.

In Reinforcement Learning, there are two main components - the Environment and the Agent. The Environment represents the world in which our agent exists. It provides the agent with information about its surroundings such as obstacles, enemy positions, friendly positions, resources available around it. The Agent, on the other hand, takes actions that affect the environment. It receives rewards when it performs a good action and punishes it when it performs a bad action. 

The most popular form of reinforcement learning is called Q-Learning. Q-Learning is a type of model-free reinforcement learning method which means it does not require a model of the environment's dynamics. Instead, it uses a set of Q-tables to estimate the quality of each possible action in a particular state. The agent selects the action that maximizes the expected reward, estimated using the Q-table. Initially, all Q values are set to zero, but as the agent interacts with the environment, new Q values are learned through trial and error. By doing so, the agent learns to balance between exploring unexplored states and exploiting knowledge acquired earlier in training. Once trained, the agent can take optimal decisions in real-time while playing the game. 


Now, we move towards explaining how the Q-learning algorithm works with some code examples. 

1. Definitions & Assumptions

Before moving further, we should first define certain terms and assumptions needed for understanding the following sections.

1. State space - A state consists of the complete information about the current situation of the agent. It contains both static information about the map and dynamic information about the agent's position, health, energy, inventory, resources, etc. 
2. Action space - Actions represent the various ways an agent can influence the environment. They can vary from attacking another unit to gathering minerals or vespene gas.
3. Rewards - The reward function evaluates the agent's performance at each step. It measures whether the agent has completed a task successfully or suffered an injury. There may also be negative rewards if the agent tries to do something illicit or harmful.
4. Discount factor - This value determines how much importance we give to future rewards compared to immediate ones. A discount factor of 0.9 indicates that we consider the benefit of having obtained the current reward plus half of the benefits of getting more than that later down the line.
5. Exploration vs Exploitation - The agent needs to explore new states to improve its estimates of the Q-values. However, it should exploit existing knowledge whenever possible to avoid getting trapped into local optima. We can achieve this by maintaining a probability of selecting random actions during exploration phases. Additionally, we can decay the exploration rate over time to encourage the agent to converge towards the best action.

2. Implementing Q-Learning Algorithm

Implementing the Q-learning algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Initialize the Q-table - Create a table to store the estimated Q-value for every possible combination of state-action pairs. Initialize the Q-table with zeros.
2. Select initial state - Start in a randomly chosen starting state.
3. Play episode - Repeat for a fixed number of iterations until termination condition met:
   * Take action - Choose an action from the current state using the epsilon-greedy policy. 
   * Observe next state and reward - Receive observation of the next state and obtain a reward signal.
   * Update Q-table - Use the Bellman equation to update the Q-table with the observed reward and maximum Q-value of the next state.
4. Decay epsilon - Decrease the exploration probability epsilon over time to encourage convergence to the optimal solution.

Here is an example implementation of the above algorithm in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q_table = {}

    # Define a function to choose an action
    def choose_action(self, state):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            return np.random.choice([0, 1])
        
        q_values = [self.q_table[state][i] for i in range(len(self.q_table[state]))]
        max_index = np.argmax(q_values)

        probabilities = [0.7, 0.3]
        choice = np.random.choice([max_index], p=probabilities)

        return max_index
    
    # Define a function to update the Q-table
    def update_q_table(self, old_state, action, new_state, reward, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9):
        if old_state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[old_state] = [0, 0]
        
        old_value = self.q_table[old_state][action]
        max_future_reward = np.max(self.q_table[new_state])
        new_value = (1 - alpha) * old_value + alpha * (reward + gamma * max_future_reward)
        self.q_table[old_state][action] = new_value
        
    def play_episode(self, env, render=False):
        total_reward = 0
        done = False
        obs = env.reset()
        
        while not done:
            if render:
                env.render()
            
            action = self.choose_action(obs)
            new_obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

            self.update_q_table(obs, action, new_obs, reward)
            total_reward += reward
            
            obs = new_obs
            
        return total_reward
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import gym
    env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
    agent = QLearningAgent()
    
    num_episodes = 1000
    min_score = 195
    
    scores = []
    epsilons = []
    
    for e in range(num_episodes):
        score = agent.play_episode(env)
        
        scores.append(score)
        epsilons.append(agent.epsilon)
        
        avg_score = sum(scores[-100:])/100
        epsilon = max(epsilons[-100:])/100
        
        print("Episode:", e,
              "\tAverage Score:", "{:.2f}".format(avg_score),
              "\tEpsilon:", "{:.2f}".format(epsilon))
        
        if avg_score >= min_score:
            print("\nEnvironment solved after", e, "episodes!\tAverage Score:", avg_score)
            break
```
