# 1.简介
  

Attention机制（英文：attention mechanism）是近几年比较火热的一种机器学习技术，其目的是为了解决Seq2Seq模型中解码问题，即如何将模型学习到的信息用于预测下一个输出。2017年，斯坦福大学、微软研究院和香港中文大学的科研人员合作提出了Self-Attention机制，其核心思想就是把注意力集中在需要关注的目标上，而不是整个输入序列或输出序列。因此Self-Attention机制可以更有效地处理长文本、图像和视频等序列数据。本文主要介绍Self-Attention机制，并着重介绍两种Self-Attention机制——Scaled Dot-Product Attention和Multi-Head Attention。另外本文还会介绍Self-Attention机制的应用场景及与其他方法的对比。

## （1）Attention
Attention mechanisms refer to the process of assigning different weights to different parts of an input sequence based on some criterion or model. It is commonly used in neural networks for tasks such as machine translation and image captioning where it helps focus on relevant parts of the input while ignoring irrelevant information. The attention distribution over each position in the input sequence is calculated using a weighted sum of the corresponding features from each encoder hidden state. Attention mechanisms are typically used with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which can learn long-term dependencies between inputs. In general, they make use of learned representations at each time step to compute a context vector that captures information about the entire input sequence at that point. This allows RNNs to selectively pay attention to relevant parts of the input sequence while ignoring unimportant details.


## （2）Scaled dot product attention
The Scaled Dot Product Attention function is one of the simplest forms of attention. At each decoding step, we calculate a weight for each encoder hidden state by taking the inner product of its feature representation and a query vector. We then normalize this scaled dot product score by dividing it through the square root of the dimensionality of the key vectors. Finally, we multiply each normalized score by the value vectors corresponding to the encoder states and take their weighted sum to produce our final output. The key idea behind this approach is that we want the model to assign more importance to certain parts of the input when generating the next word. To do this, we multiply the similarity scores between the decoder hidden state and each encoder hidden state by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$, where $d_k$ is the dimensionality of the key vectors. This ensures that the dot products scale approximately proportionally to the magnitude of the vectors involved, making it easier for the model to learn what's important. Here is a schematic illustration:




## （3）Multi-head attention
In Multi-head attention, we divide the query, key, and value vectors into multiple heads and perform attention operations separately on each head before combining them together. Each head outputs a set of attention weights for each encoder hidden state. These sets are then combined to generate the final output using a combination function like concatenation or average pooling. Instead of having just one set of query, key, and value vectors per layer, we split these vectors into multiple heads so that the model can capture different aspects of the input at different times. One advantage of multi-head attention is that it allows the model to learn different types of interactions among the components of the input sequence without resorting to complex weight matrices. Another benefit is that it allows us to train separate attention heads in parallel, leading to faster convergence compared to training all heads simultaneously. Here is how the architecture looks like:


Let’s assume we have two heads, A and B. Then, given an input sequence X, we first compute the following three linear projections of X into three separate subspaces Q', K', V':

$$Q' = W_Q^1 \times X + b_Q^1 $$

$$K' = W_K^1 \times X + b_K^1 $$

$$V' = W_V^1 \times X + b_V^1 $$

where $W_Q^1$, $b_Q^1$, etc., represent the parameters for the first head, i.e., A, and so on for the second head, i.e., B. Similarly, let's assume that there are L total heads. We repeat the same operation L - 1 times, except now we replace X with $Y_{l}$ instead:

$$Q'_l = W_Q^{l+1} \times Y_l + b_Q^{l+1} $$

$$K'_l = W_K^{l+1} \times Y_l + b_K^{l+1} $$

$$V'_l = W_V^{l+1} \times Y_l + b_V^{l+1} $$

Finally, we concatenate the resulting output vectors Q', K', V', and pass them through another linear transformation WO to get our final output y:

$$y = WO \times [concat(Q', K', V')] $$

Now let's assume that we have N total elements in the input sequence X, and L total heads. The size of each head's output vectors will be d_model / L. So if d_model=128 and L=2, each head would have an output size of 64. Therefore, the total number of output neurons would be 64 * 2 = 128.

Note that we can also stack multiple layers of self-attention using residual connections to allow the network to retain more useful contextual information across multiple layers.
