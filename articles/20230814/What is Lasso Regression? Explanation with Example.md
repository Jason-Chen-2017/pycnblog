# 1.简介
  

Lasso regression (also known as the L1 penalty) is a type of linear regression that uses shrinkage to eliminate some of the overfitting associated with traditional methods such as ordinary least squares (OLS). The basic idea behind this method is to add a penalty term that encourages the coefficients to be smaller in magnitude than those obtained through OLS. This leads to sparse solutions where only a few variables are included in the model, which can reduce the risk of overfitting and improve generalization performance on unseen data. 

In this blog post, we will discuss the basics of Lasso Regression and provide an example code implementation using Python library scikit-learn along with explanation of each step in detail. We will also address common pitfalls or limitations of Lasso Regression like issues related to collinearity and feature selection. By the end of this article, you should have a clear understanding of how Lasso Regression works, its advantages and disadvantages, and when it may be useful for your machine learning project.

Linear Regression: Linear regression refers to a statistical method used to establish a linear relationship between one dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (X). It assumes that the observations are independent of each other, meaning that there is no correlation between them. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the most commonly used technique for linear regression and finds the best fitting line through a set of points by minimizing the sum of squared errors between predicted values and actual ones. In other words, it tries to minimize the difference between the actual value and the estimated value of y based on a given X value. If there are outliers in the dataset, they can significantly impact the accuracy of OLS and result in biased predictions.

Lasso: Lasso stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and is often used as an alternative approach to regularized regression. Lasso adds a penalty term that increases the absolute size of the parameters during training. It forces some of the coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating their effect on the model if they do not carry any meaningful information. This process helps in reducing the variance of the model and reduces the chance of overfitting. On the other hand, Lasso tends to increase the number of non-zero coefficients, making it harder to interpret the results and prone to some issues related to multicollinearity.

## 3.1 模型训练
The first step in building Lasso Regression model involves selecting the appropriate hyperparameters such as alpha, which controls the strength of the penalty term applied during training. Alpha determines how much the coefficients are penalized during training. A higher alpha means stronger penalty and a lower alpha means less severe penalty. Hyperparameter tuning is crucial in Lasso Regression as a proper choice of alpha is essential to achieve good performance.

Once the optimal alpha has been determined, Lasso Regression follows the standard procedure for training models:

1. Define the target variable Y and independent variables X. 

2. Calculate the beta coefficients using the formula:

   
   Where *RSS* is the residual sum of squares, *x_i* represents the i-th predictor variable, *sign(beta_{i})* represents the sign function of beta, and $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, which controls the amount of shrinkage applied. 
   
   The $beta_{i}$'s represent the change in the response variable Y due to a unit change in the corresponding predictor variable X. The coefficient assigned to the predictors with non-zero weights gives us an indication about the importance of these variables in determining the outcome variable. When all the $\lambda$ coefficients are zero, we get an ordinary least squares solution, which corresponds to conventional linear regression without regularization.
   
3. Fit the model by adjusting the coefficients according to the gradient descent algorithm. During training, we update the coefficients iteratively until convergence criteria are met or maximum iterations limit is reached. 

After completing training, the trained model can then be used for prediction purposes. However, before doing so, it's important to check whether the intercept term needs to be added or removed from the final model depending on the problem at hand. Intercept terms are usually omitted in many cases because they don't make sense outside the context of linear regression.  

## 3.2 模型预测
To use the trained Lasso Regression model to make predictions, we simply plug in new values of the input variables into the formula above to obtain the predicted output. Alternatively, we could extract the individual coefficients of the model and use them to make predictions directly.

## 3.3 正则化参数调优
As mentioned earlier, choosing an appropriate value of $\lambda$, which controls the amount of shrinkage applied, is crucial to achieving good performance. Tuning the hyperparameters becomes even more critical when dealing with high dimensional datasets or multiple features involved. One way to tune the regularization parameter is through cross validation techniques such as k-fold CV or nested CV.

One advantage of Lasso Regression is that it allows for easy interpretation of the model coefficients since we can easily identify the subset of predictors that contribute to the final outcome. However, Lasso Regression does come with certain drawbacks, including issues related to collinearity and reduced flexibility compared to Ridge Regression. These issues need to be addressed during model development and testing to ensure that the model performs well under different conditions.
