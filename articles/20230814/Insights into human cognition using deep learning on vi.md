Deep Learning is transforming many fields such as image processing, natural language understanding and robotics. Visual AI can play a crucial role in driving the advancement of artificial intelligence and making it a real competitor with humans. In this article, we will discuss how to use deep learning algorithms for analyzing and interpreting human visual cognition. 

The goal of our research project is to develop an automated system that uses computer vision techniques to understand what people are looking at and recognizing objects and actions without being explicitly programmed or trained by experts. The main components of our system include (i) object detection algorithm, which identifies different objects present in an image, (ii) action recognition algorithm, which determines the intent behind a person's action based on their movements, (iii) language interpretation algorithm, which translates human speech into machine-readable text, and (iv) interactive interface design, which enables users to interact with the system through natural language commands. To achieve these goals, we have developed several models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and attention mechanisms. We also collected various datasets consisting of images, videos, and annotations from various sources, and tested our model accuracy and efficiency against other state-of-the-art approaches.

In this article, we focus on explaining the basic concepts, terminologies, and mathematical formulas involved in the development of our system. We also provide clear step-by-step instructions on how to implement each component of the system and explain the working principles underlying each approach. Furthermore, we highlight some interesting insights obtained during testing and report our findings in terms of future directions and challenges for developing a comprehensive visual AI system. 

Let us start by exploring the basics of visual perception, cognition, and neuroscience. Then we move towards our core ideas and methods used in building our visual AI system. Finally, we discuss the results obtained by testing our model and share our future plans and outlook.

# 2. Basics of Perception, Cognition, and Neuroscience
## 2.1 What is Visual Perception? 
Visual perception refers to the process where information about an object is extracted from its appearance, shape, texture, and color. Humans have evolved to be able to extract complex information from simple visual patterns such as lines, shapes, colors, textures, and light. 

Examples of common visual perception skills include:

1. Object Recognition: Identifying specific objects in an image such as faces, cars, animals, etc.
2. Scene Understanding: Gaining an understanding of the environment around oneself, identifying obstructions, objects, and features. 
3. Recognition of Familiar Surroundings: Gaining familiarity with familiar objects and scenes through experience. 
4. Color Segmentation and Recognition: Separating different colors in an image and then recognizing them individually.
5. Pattern Recognition: Identifying similar patterns throughout an image and determining their meaning. 

## 2.2 Human Cognition and Intelligence
Cognitive science has been studied extensively over the past century, and much progress has been made in understanding various aspects of human brain function. It has been shown that humans possess abilities like problem-solving, reasoning, learning, and decision-making. These capabilities enable us to solve complex problems in a variety of domains ranging from medical diagnostics to financial analysis.

### Intelligence Levels
Humans have four types of intelligence levels: 

1. Autonomic: These are those who can do tasks independently without any guidance or input from others. They often operate under strong autonomy but may require specialist assistance when facing certain challenges. Examples of autonomous individuals include spacecraft pilots and drones. 
2. Superior Motor: These individuals demonstrate high level expertise in motor skills like walking, running, swimming, kicking, and jumping. They can perform a wide range of physical activities effectively. However, they lack natural talents like drawing and memorizing. Examples of superior motor individuals include chess players, boxers, and sailors.
3. Language Competence: This category includes individuals who can speak, read, and write fluently. They can communicate easily both verbally and in writing. Some examples include lawyers, teachers, engineers, scientists, and journalists.
4. Consciousness: This type of individual involves highly refined thought processes and emotional intelligence. They are capable of waking up from sleep, remembering events, and planning ahead. Examples of consciousness individuals include actors, authors, musicians, and athletes. 

Human cognition plays an essential role in achieving advanced technical feats like self-driving cars and medical diagnosis. Over the last decade, there has been significant breakthroughs in technologies related to visual perception, cognition, and neuroscience. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are particularly well suited for the task of visual recognition due to their ability to learn and adapt to new environments and inputs within milliseconds. Therefore, this technology has revolutionized the field of computer vision and has enabled numerous applications across multiple industries.

## 2.3 Human Brain Function
The nervous system consists of several interconnected structures called neurons. Each neuron receives signals from other neurons either directly or indirectly. These connections between neurons transmit messages representing sensory stimuli. The majority of the message passing occurs via electrical impulses along the axons of the neurons.

Neurons receive excitatory inputs from neighboring neurons or synapses, while non-excitatory inputs come from outside sources. Excitatory inputs activate the cells positively, whereas inhibitory inputs decrease the cell’s firing rate negatively. Dendrites carry the incoming signal to the axon terminals of the neurons. Neurons fire only if the threshold voltage is exceeded after receiving the total input. If no presynaptic spikes occur before the threshold, the neuron remains inactive. During a burst, a small percentage of neurons release synaptic current, causing modifications in the postsynaptic neuron’s membrane potential, which leads to changes in its electrical properties such as conductance, resistance, and activation gains.


**Sensory organs**: Eyes, nose, throat, skin, hair follicles, ear, teeth, jaw, nails, and lungs all produce electrical impulses that affect the innervation of various parts of the body. These signals pass through the central nervous system and reach the relevant neurons. For example, the retina produces signals that activate rods and cones in the optic chambers. 

**Motor systems**: The spinal cord controls movement of the body, sending signals to muscles throughout the body. Sensory signals travel down the spinal column to neurons in the cervical cortex and motor areas. Dentate gyrus sends signals to the sternum and pelvis while vagus and clavicles send signals to the arms and legs respectively. 

**Social behavior**: Emotions and moods are communicated through the brain via social cortices. For instance, a person’s emotions can affect how they act and make decisions. Taste buds sense food quality and mental activity through the saliva. Head movements cause vibrations in the occipital lobe and nucleus accumbens. The hypothalamus regulates tone and posture. 

By studying these neuronal interactions and communication pathways, scientists have uncovered fundamental mechanisms responsible for human cognition and behavior. Through exploration of these pathways, researchers have discovered new ways to improve human performance, expand our knowledge base, reduce health risks, and create novel medicines and therapies.
