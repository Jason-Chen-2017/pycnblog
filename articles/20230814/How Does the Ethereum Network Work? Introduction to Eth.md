# 1.简介
  

The Ethereum network is a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain platform that enables smart contracts to be executed on its distributed ledger of transactions. It is based on Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and uses a public transaction ledger where all transactions are shared among nodes in the network. The number of miners producing blocks in each round of the PoW algorithm depends on the amount of computation required for validating new blocks. This article will introduce you to the inner workings of the Ethereum network as well as how mining works behind the scenes. We will also look at how different types of nodes such as full nodes, light clients, and wallets interact with the network. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before we dive into more detailed technical details, let’s first understand some basic concepts and terminology used in the Ethereum ecosystem:

1. **Blockchain:** A distributed database that stores digital records called blocks linked together using cryptographic hashes. Each block contains data from previous blocks along with the hash of the previous block. All transactions and blocks are verified by verifying the cryptographic proof attached to them before they are added to the chain.

2. **Smart Contract:** An executable program stored on the blockchain which can store value, execute functions, and accept payments. These programs run deterministically, without any interference or control over external factors like human input or other software applications. 

3. **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):** Turing complete virtual machine designed specifically for executing smart contract code. Its design ensures that all operations performed inside it are fully verifiable and traceable back to the original source code.

4. **Ether (ETH):** A cryptocurrency used for payment and gas fees on the Ethereum platform.

5. **Gas:** Gas refers to the cost of resources required to execute instructions on the EVM. Every operation on the EVM requires a certain amount of computational power known as “gas”. 

6. **Transaction:** Transactions refer to messages sent between accounts on the Ethereum network. They contain information about the sender, receiver, and value being transferred. 

7. **Account:** Accounts hold ether and tokens on the Ethereum network. They have two main attributes - nonce and balance. Nonce represents the number of transactions made by an account. Balance represents the total amount of ether owned by an account.

8. **Public Key Address:** Public key addresses identify accounts on the Ethereum network. They consist of a 20 byte hexadecimal string derived from the public key associated with an account.

9. **Private Key:** Private keys are used to sign transactions generated by an account. They are essential to protect sensitive information such as funds held in an account. If someone gains access to both the private key and the corresponding address, he/she can spend the entire balance of the account. To keep your private key safe, do not share it with anyone except for authorized persons who need to send you ether or tokens.

Now let's get into the nitty-gritty details of the Ethereum network. In this section, I will discuss the core algorithms used in Ethereum and explain their working principle. I will use examples and explanations to illustrate my points. Before going forward, make sure you have a good understanding of blockchain technologies and how they work in general. Let’s start!

## 3.1 分布式共识机制
When discussing the Ethereum network, we often hear references to a decentralized peer-to-peer networking system. However, what does this mean exactly? More importantly, what makes Ethereum unique compared to traditional centralized networks like Bitcoin? One answer lies in the way the network achieves consensus. 

In traditional centralized systems, there typically exists only one entity responsible for accepting new transactions and distributing them across all participants in the network. The role of the central authority becomes critical when issues arise, leading to delays and errors in the distribution process. Decentralized systems allow for multiple entities to participate in processing transactions simultaneously, allowing for higher efficiency and faster transaction processing times. 

To achieve consensus in a decentralized environment, the majority vote approach is commonly used. Here, the decisions reached by each node are determined by a set of rules defined by the protocol. For example, if node A receives a proposal that includes a transaction X, it may decide to add it to its local copy of the ledger while ignoring proposals containing Y. Once the network reaches agreement on the same transaction, the transaction is added to the shared ledger.

This consensus mechanism is based on several principles:

1. Security: Consensus mechanisms should maintain high levels of security to prevent attacks and tampering with the data. 

2. Speed: Despite being decentralized, consensus mechanisms must operate quickly enough to handle incoming transactions.

3. Resilience: When a single node fails, the network should still remain functional.

4. Flexibility: Consensus mechanisms should be adaptable to changing conditions in the network.  

In Ethereum, the consensus mechanism implemented is called Proof-of-Work (PoW). As mentioned earlier, this means that individual machines compete against each other to solve complex mathematical problems to produce valid blocks that can then be added to the shared ledger. The difficulty level determines the strength of the competition and affects the speed and performance of the network. 

As blocks are produced, they undergo validation and verification before they are accepted by the rest of the network. At a minimum, each block needs to satisfy certain requirements to be considered valid. These include the following checks:

1. Validity check: The correct syntax and semantics of the transaction and the block header.

2. Block reward: The miner receiving block creation rewards.

3. Transaction validity: Each transaction is checked for validity according to the current state of the network.

4. Double spending protection: Ensures that no two identical transactions can exist in the same block.

5. Consistency checks: Checks whether the network has converged to a consistent state.

Once these steps are completed successfully, the block is deemed final and added to the blockchain. Note that even though the network relies on Proof-of-Work consensus to reach agreement, the actual work done by miners cannot be controlled by the network directly. Rather, this responsibility falls onto specialized hardware devices referred to as "miners". 

In addition to ensuring the integrity and consistency of the network, Proof-of-Work also provides incentives for those who perform the most intensive computations needed to validate blocks. By allocating a portion of the block reward as revenue to the miner, the network encourages users to contribute computing power to support the network. Additionally, the financial benefits associated with the usage of cryptocurrencies like ETH provide another layer of motivation for miners to join the network.

## 3.2 DAG（有向无环图）
DAG stands for directed acyclic graph. Unlike a regular linear sequence, a DAG allows cycles or branches within its structure. The purpose of a DAG is to enable parallel processing of tasks rather than relying on serial execution of one after the other. In the case of the Ethereum network, a DAG is formed whenever a new block is proposed by a miner. A DAG helps minimize the likelihood of forks or conflicts that could result from a naïve sequential model. Instead, updates to the network can proceed concurrently throughout the day, making it easier to manage complexity and ensure continuous synchronization between various nodes.  

Each block in the Ethereum network is identified by its cryptographic hash value. Since each change to the network introduces a new block, the overall history of changes is represented by a large directed acyclic graph known as the block tree. The root of the tree corresponds to the genesis block, which establishes the initial state of the network. New blocks are validated and added to the tree in a series of stages, as shown below:


On top of the block tree, each node maintains a collection of pending transactions that haven't yet been included in a mined block. Whenever a miner proposes a new block, he sends his list of pending transactions along with a reference to the latest block in the tree. The receiving node validates the transactions, adds them to its own copy of the transaction pool, and prepares a new block incorporating the updated contents of the tree and the transaction pool. Finally, the new block is broadcasted to the network and added to the tree.

To improve scalability, nodes in the network may choose to ignore older blocks that haven't been included in the longest chain for some time. Alternatively, nodes may request missing blocks from other nodes, depending on their ability to keep up with the pace of new blocks.

## 3.3 账户模型
One fundamental aspect of the Ethereum network is the concept of accounts. In essence, accounts act as containers for ether and tokens, and allow individuals or groups to transact electronically. Each account has a unique address that serves as a primary identifier for the owner of the account. Addresses are generated from public-private key pairs that represent ownership rights. 

Accounts are further divided into three categories:

1. Externally Owned Account (EOA): An account that holds ether or tokens and that doesn't have the right to create additional subaccounts. 

2. Contract Account: An account that runs contracts on behalf of owners who don't necessarily own the physical machines hosting the contracts. Contracts are programs that can store and retrieve value, execute functions, and accept payments. They are created and deployed through transaction calls and can automatically trigger events based on specific actions taken by the contract's creator.  

3.  Concise representation of balances: The amount of ether or tokens currently present in an account can be represented concisely using numbers instead of lists of individual token units.

Each account also has a nonce attribute, which tracks the number of transactions that have been initiated but not yet confirmed by the network. Essentially, this attribute acts as a measure of the degree of certainty in the transaction record associated with the account.

## 3.4 智能合约(Smart Contract)
Contracts are programs that live on the Ethereum blockchain and can be invoked by sending transactions to the network. Smart contracts can perform virtually any function that requires interaction with the outside world, including banking services, automated market makers, insurance brokers, and other trusted third parties.

A typical contract involves defining a set of conditions that must be met before the contract executes a given action. For instance, a contract might require a participant to deposit a certain amount of ether before trading begins. After meeting the condition, the contract would transfer the specified quantity of ether to the trader's account. Similarly, the contract could monitor prices on a stock exchange and initiate automatic orders when price thresholds are crossed.

Smart contracts are written in a high-level language called Solidity and can be compiled down to bytecode that can be interpreted by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), providing a secure and reliable environment for running arbitrary code. Compilation creates a bytecode object that can be executed on the EVM, guaranteeing that the resulting execution is always deterministic and traceable back to the original source code.

Additionally, smart contracts can interact with other contracts and libraries to simplify development and reduce redundancy. Developers can focus on implementing the business logic necessary to meet their needs, leaving the underlying infrastructure concerns to the platform itself. Overall, smart contracts are expected to significantly enhance the ease of use and transparency of the Ethereum network.

## 3.5 虚拟机(EVM)
The EVM is the runtime environment for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It consists of a stack-based register-based machine that performs arithmetic calculations and memory manipulations. The machine processes low-level instructions, such as ADD, SUB, MSTORE, etc., and handles interactions with the external world via I/O operations. 

It's worth noting here that the EVM is completely transparent and completely open-source. Anyone can inspect the implementation of the EVM to gain insight into how it works internally and why it was chosen as the basis for the Ethereum platform. The choice of programming language and compiler optimization techniques were carefully designed to maximize the potential performance of the system, enabling developers to write high-performance smart contracts that offer competitive pricing models while remaining flexible and easily upgradeable.

## 3.6 以太币(Ether)
Ether is the currency used on the Ethereum network and plays a crucial role in securing the network. It is an ERC-20 token standard that conforms to the Ethereum specification and is compatible with many popular cryptocurrency wallets. There are two kinds of ether - native and standard. Native ether is created during the Genesis block and is the base unit of measurement for ether, whereas standard ether is created by users requesting an equivalent value in ether.

All transactions on the network require a fee denominated in ether. Users pay a fee to the network operator when submitting a transaction or creating a contract, and validators also collect fees for performing computational operations on the network. To avoid spamming the network with unrealistic amounts of ether, miners can adjust their profits accordingly, while delegating some of their hashing power to cover the costs of maintaining the network.

Fees paid to miners also help fuel the growth of the network by increasing the supply of ether, encouraging additional demand for stablecoins like DAI and USDC. By supporting widespread adoption of the network and establishing a self-sustaining economy built on decentralization, Ether is already seeing significant uptake beyond pure speculation.

## 3.7 节点类型(Node Types)

Finally, we'll explore the various roles played by different types of nodes in the Ethereum network. Full nodes, lightweight clients, and wallets are some of the most common types of nodes found in the ecosystem. Below is a brief overview of each type of node:


1. Full Node: A full node maintains a complete copy of the Ethereum blockchain, storing every piece of data published on the network and able to verify all transactions. Full nodes serve as the core infrastructure for running the Ethereum network, requiring fast internet connectivity and storage space. With a full node setup, users can participate in the validation process and earn transaction fees. Popular platforms for running full nodes include Geth, Parity, and Hyperledger Besu.

2. Lightweight Client: A lightweight client is essentially a simplified version of a full node, with much less disk space and computing power required. It synchronizes the network by downloading a recent snapshot of the blockchain and updating its view of the network in real-time. It can be useful for managing small amounts of ether or interacting with the network from locations with limited bandwidth or limited storage capacity. Examples of lightweight clients include geth --light and Nethermind. 

3. Wallet: A wallet is an application that manages the user's ether and tokens, allowing them to send and receive transactions and interact with smart contracts. Their responsibilities include keeping track of addresses, private keys, and transaction histories. Popular wallets for desktop and mobile include MetaMask, Ledger Live, and TrustWallet.
