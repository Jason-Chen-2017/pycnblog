Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular natural language processing (NLP) tasks that helps to understand human emotions and opinions towards a topic or product from social media posts, reviews, feedback etc., and predict their sentiment towards such topics. The task has applications in various industries including marketing, finance, customer service, healthcare, travel, politics, sports, entertainment, news agencies etc. Currently, there are several NLP frameworks available like Stanford Core NLP, spaCy, NLTK etc., which have been used to perform sentiment analysis on different text sources. However, these frameworks only focus on English texts and do not scale well with large volumes of data. In this work, we will explore how deep learning models can be leveraged to effectively tackle the problem of scalable sentiment analysis in social media platforms. Specifically, we will build a multi-task model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and attention mechanisms to classify positive/negative sentiment labels in tweets. We will also discuss about other potential areas where deep learning models can help us, particularly those related to multimodal and cross-media analysis. Overall, our goal is to create a framework where AI agents can easily incorporate into their workflows to support more advanced sentiment analysis techniques while reducing errors caused by manual labeling efforts.

## Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis refers to the process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text based on their underlying tone, polarity, attitude, or emotion. It involves classifying each individual statement or document as either positive, negative, or neutral in terms of its overall impression or evaluation. This task is essential in many application domains such as marketing, business development, customer service, political analysis, information retrieval, and health care. To perform sentiment analysis, the system analyzes the words used in a sentence or document along with their context to determine whether it expresses a positive, negative or neutral opinion.

Some commonly used features of sentiment analysis include:
* Polarity: Affective intensity conveyed by the words in a given statement. Positive statements tend to use more positive words than negative ones, whereas negative statements tend to use more negative words.
* Emotionality: Underlying mood or subjective state of an author's perspective. Whether a person is happy, sad, surprised, excited, annoyed etc. determines the emotionality level associated with his/her viewpoint.
* Context: Sarcasm, irony, humorous situations may deviate the actual intended meaning of a sentence. Analysing the immediate surrounding context can provide valuable insights into the sentiment of a sentence.
* Intensity: How strongly an emotion is exhibited by a speaker. Influenced by the amount of positivity, negativity, and presence of certainty keywords in a statement.

In this paper, we are interested in performing sentiment analysis on social media platform tweets, i.e., classifying them as either positive, negative or neutral based on the underlying sentiment content present in them. Therefore, we need to define some key concepts and terminology before moving forward.

### Tweets
Tweets are short messages sent over social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. They typically contain at least two parts - a user profile picture and a message body containing up to 140 characters. Users can choose to make their tweets public or private, depending on their choice. Publicly shared tweets can be viewed by anyone, whereas privately shared tweets can only be seen by followers who opt-in to receive updates.

Each tweet contains metadata such as timestamp, location, hashtags, and links to images, videos, and external websites. These attributes enable users to identify trends, conversations, interactions, and sentiment across multiple platforms. There are no explicit guidelines for writing quality tweets or the right way to frame sentences for better impact, so it’s difficult to formulate objective criteria for sentiment analysis. Nevertheless, the following is a brief overview of common ways people express sentiment through language:

1. Expressions of gratitude or compliments: People often use positive expressions when showing their appreciation for someone else’s achievement, success, contribution, or knowledge. For example, "Thank you" or "+1".

2. Expressions of disappointment or criticism: People may use negative expressions to describe their feelings of frustration, shock, uncertainty, or lack of understanding after receiving something bad. For example, "I don't think I did enough" or "This isn't what I expected".

3. Subjective comments or evaluations: Often times, people share their views, experiences, thoughts, and preferences without actually stating any judgments or actions. Instead, they offer a discussion or expression of interest or a reflection. Examples include open-ended questions, personal observations, jokes, and sarcastic remarks.

The first type of language (positive or gratitude) often indicates positive sentiment, while the second type usually denotes negative sentiment. Additionally, certain phrases or patterns may indicate a stronger sentiment, for instance, the phrase “amazing” would likely indicate a high degree of positive sentiment compared to the phrase “horrible”. Subjective language may involve a range of interpretations, making it challenging to draw solid conclusions. Nonetheless, the basic principles behind sentiment analysis remain relatively straightforward and widely applicable.

### Features of social media platforms
Social media platforms are increasingly becoming a primary source of real-time communication and sharing, especially among younger generations. With the explosion of mobile devices, online shopping, globalization, and rapid economic growth, new technologies and channels drive the increase in the volume and velocity of traffic. While traditional media outlets still play a significant role in driving engagement, online communities provide opportunities for developing new relationships, building trust, and exploring new ideas. Despite their importance, sentiment analysis remains a niche area of research and development due to its complex nature and interplay between culture, linguistic styles, and social context.

Major players in the market include YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Each platform offers unique features and formats that require specialized algorithms and tools to extract meaningful insights. Some examples include video summarization, automatic comment generation, community moderation, and microtargeting. Regardless of the specific platform being analyzed, the majority of the challenges lie in acquiring and preprocessing large amounts of data, handling diverse languages, and ensuring accuracy.

As mentioned earlier, sentiment analysis requires special treatment due to the diversity of linguistic styles and cultural influences, which makes it a fundamental challenge even for experienced researchers. The most prevalent approach to handle such variability is known as feature engineering. Feature engineering involves selecting relevant features from raw data and transforming them into informative representations suitable for machine learning tasks. Common approaches include bag-of-words, word embeddings, and semantic vectors.

One important aspect of feature engineering is tokenizing the input text, which means splitting it into small units called tokens. Tokens could represent individual words or characters, but in general, longer sequences are preferred because they capture more complex semantics and subtle nuances in language. Tokenization should preserve the original structure of the text, avoiding loss of information and creating homogeneous vectors. Another important step is stemming or lemmatization, which reduces inflectional variations to obtain consistent forms of words. This improves consistency and enables comparison between words regardless of their surface representation. Lastly, normalization techniques like case folding and stopword removal remove unwanted artifacts from the text, such as punctuation marks, numbers, or non-informative tokens.

Finally, another critical factor is awareness and training. Humans have a hard time accurately evaluating the sentiment of every single statement, especially if it comes in an unknown context or written in a foreign language. To develop effective sentiment classifiers, researchers rely heavily on labeled datasets, which must cover a wide variety of contexts and scenarios. This can be challenging and expensive for both humans and machines, requiring expertise in linguistics, computer science, and social sciences.

Overall, sentiment analysis presents a rich and challenging space for research and development, as evidenced by the number of publications, papers, and resources available today. It provides insightful and actionable results that can directly improve consumer experience, businesses, and governance decision-making.
