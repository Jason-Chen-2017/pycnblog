# 2. Core Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Introduction
### 2.1.1 What is machine learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves programming computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. In other words, it enables machines to make predictions or decisions based on the inputs they receive instead of just following fixed instructions. It allows for modeling complex systems by training algorithms on large datasets with no human intervention required. ML has been around since the late 1950s, but its popularity in recent years has surpassed even traditional software development techniques such as object-oriented programming and database management. The term "learning" refers to the ability of an algorithm to improve itself over time through feedback received from the environment. This process is called "reinforcement learning".
In this book we will cover several popular ML algorithms including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks. We'll start our journey by understanding these core concepts and terminology.
### 2.1.2 Types of ML Problems
There are three main types of problems that can be solved using machine learning: classification, regression, and clustering. Each type of problem requires different algorithms and approaches. Let's break down each type in detail.
#### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training algorithms on labeled data, meaning that there is a target variable associated with each input example. There are two main types of supervised learning problems: classification and regression. 

Classification involves predicting discrete categories or classes, such as spam detection, facial recognition, or disease diagnosis. Here, the goal is to map input examples into one of multiple predefined output classes. One common approach to perform classification is logistic regression, which maps input features onto a probability distribution using a sigmoid function. Another commonly used technique is support vector machines (SVM), which constructs a hyperplane or set of parallel lines that separate the input data points into distinct classes. Other algorithms include decision trees and random forests, both of which construct a hierarchy of decisions based on feature values.

Regression involves predicting continuous outputs, such as stock prices, sales forecasts, or material properties. Regression algorithms typically use linear or non-linear functions to estimate the relationship between input variables and their corresponding targets. Commonly used methods include linear regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regressions (SVR).

#### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled data, meaning that there are no predetermined target outcomes or results. Instead, the aim is to discover patterns and relationships within the data without any prior knowledge about what those patterns might indicate. One common task is dimensionality reduction, where high-dimensional data is transformed into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving most of the information contained in the original data. Commonly used techniques include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).

#### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves training agents to take actions in environments to maximize their rewards. Agents interact with an environment through observations and actions, and reward signals are provided at certain times during interaction. The agent learns how to select actions that result in maximum cumulative reward, and can adapt its behavior to achieve goals over time. Reinforcement learning is widely applied in fields such as robotics, gaming, autonomous driving, and adversarial games. Examples of RL algorithms include Q-learning, policy gradient, actor-critic, and deep Q-network.

#### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain. They rely on highly specialized layers of computation, known as neurons, that transform input data into output representations. These layers are designed to extract important features from the raw input signal, enabling them to generalize beyond the current dataset. Deep learning architectures have become particularly powerful in recent years due to advances in hardware technology and enormous datasets available. Popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet. Some popular applications of deep learning include image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and recommender systems.

#### Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specific type of deep learning architecture that were first introduced in 2012. CNNs are effective for computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation, among others. The key idea behind CNNs is the concept of convolutional filters. A filter sweeps across the input image or matrix, taking individual patches or regions of interest, computing a dot product between them and a weight matrix, and producing an output pixel value or activation map. Multiple filters can then be stacked on top of each other, allowing them to capture various aspects of the input image or feature map. By repeating this process for multiple layers, deeper CNNs can eventually produce increasingly rich and abstract representations of the input data.

Ultimately, all of these ML algorithms share some fundamental principles and ideas, so mastering any one of them independently will enable you to apply them effectively when solving real-world problems.
