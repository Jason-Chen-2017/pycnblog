In 2021, the web is becoming more and more important in our lives and we need to ensure that all users have access to it with equal opportunity and equity. Accessible User Interfaces (AUIs) are essential for achieving this objective, as they help people with disabilities navigate websites using assistive technologies like screen readers or voice control software. However, building AUIs can be challenging due to various technical and non-technical factors such as color contrasts, keyboard accessibility, text size, language support, etc., which make them less accessible than traditional desktop applications. To address these challenges, there has been a push towards adhering to industry standard Web Accessibility guidelines and creating inclusive design practices. In this article, I will explain how web accessibility guidelines and tools can help you build trustworthy AUIs for your website.

# 2.Web Accessibility Guidelines
Before getting into the details of creating trustworthy user interfaces, let’s first understand what exactly web accessibility means. According to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), web accessibility refers to "the provision of easy-to-use products or services through the use of technology that enables individuals with disabilities to use the Internet." The W3C also defines web accessibility standards and guidelines that establish minimum requirements for making web content accessible to everyone. These guidelines cover several areas including:

1. Perceivable - This includes ensuring that content is readable and understandable by everyone regardless of their abilities, including those with visual impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive disabilities, limited mobility, and learning disabilities. It ensures that the text and images have sufficient contrast and are not illegible when displayed on different background colors.
2. Operable - This involves enabling users to interact with the interface without relying solely on mouse clicks or tactile feedback. It involves providing alternative input methods like keyboard shortcuts and speech recognition features.
3. Understandable - This covers making sure that content is written clearly and concisely so that even people who cannot read or understand it fully can still understand its purpose and function. It ensures that information is presented in an organized, hierarchical structure and provides helpful descriptions and instructions for better understanding.
4. Robust - This refers to ensuring that content is compatible across multiple devices and platforms, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. It ensures that all functionality is available via keyboard navigation, touch screen gestures, and voice commands.

Web accessibility guidelines offer developers and organizations a set of best practices to create AUIs that are accessible to everyone. They enable users with disabilities to access information and functionality quickly and easily while keeping the experience consistent across various devices and platforms. By following web accessibility guidelines, developers can build user interfaces that provide equal access to information for all users, improving overall usability and satisfaction.

# 3.Tools & Resources
There are many resources and tools available online that can help you develop AUIs that are accessible to all users. Here are some key ones that are useful for creating trustworthy AUIs:

1. Color Contrast Checker - This tool allows you to test if the color contrast between foreground elements and background is appropriate based on WCAG 2.1 level AA specifications. You can choose from a range of color themes and font sizes to customize the checker's output.

2. ChromeVox - This browser extension helps visually impaired users access web pages by simulating a virtual cursor that reads aloud every element on the page. It supports different types of keyboard controls such as tabbing, arrow keys, and space bar activation. 

3. WebAIM Screen Reader - This tool is designed specifically for testing accessibility of web pages using assistive technologies like screen readers. It offers comprehensive reports that highlight any issues found with the webpage's markup, coding, and stylesheets. You can download the free version of this tool at https://webaim.org/resources/screenreader/.

4. Google Accessibility Insights - This chrome extension analyzes webpages' accessibility issues using automated checks and manual tests and provides detailed suggestions on how to improve accessibility. You can install this extension from the Chrome Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-insights-fo/pbjjkligggfmakdaogkfomddhfmpjeni?hl=en&authuser=2.

5. Wave Evaluation Tool - This online tool allows you to evaluate the quality of your HTML code against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level AA specification. It provides detailed reports that identify any errors or warnings related to contrast ratio, keyboard accessibility, and alt attributes. You can use this tool at http://wave.webaim.org/extension/. 

Overall, these tools and resources should give you a good starting point to create accessible and robust AUIs for your website. If you need further assistance during the development process, do not hesitate to reach out to me at <EMAIL>.
