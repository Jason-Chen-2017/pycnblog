# 1.简介
  

Probability distributions are central in statistics and data analysis. In this article we will learn how they work mathematically using the standard mathematical notation of probability theory and operations on them such as addition, multiplication, and integration. We'll also see some concrete examples demonstrating these concepts in Python programming language along with their visual representations for better understanding. Finally, we'll cover some useful tips for practicing and sharing your knowledge effectively in interviews. Let's get started! 

# 2.概率分布的定义及特点
A probability distribution is a function that gives the probabilities of different outcomes of an experiment or a stochastic process over a sample space. It provides us information about what outcome could occur with certain probability. The standard terminology used for probability distribution includes:
- Discrete Distribution: A discrete probability distribution assigns probabilities only to non-negative integer values. For example, if we have three coins that can come up heads (H) or tails (T), the probability of getting each face is given by the discrete probability distribution. These types of distributions can be represented graphically using bar graphs.
- Continuous Distribution: A continuous probability distribution assigns probabilities to any real value within its range. This type of distribution is defined by two parameters - mean (μ) and variance (σ²). These types of distributions are commonly known as normal or Gaussian distributions. They are typically graphically displayed using curves.
- Multivariate Distribution: A multivariate distribution refers to a set of jointly distributed random variables where each variable has its own probability distribution. Examples of multivariate distributions include the bivariate normal distribution, which combines two normal distributions into one.

In this article, we will focus on the most common types of probability distributions including the following ones:

1. Bernoulli Distribution: This is a special case of the binomial distribution where there is only one trial (experiment). It describes the probability of success of a single independent event. Formally it represents the probability mass function f(k; p) = {p if k=1 else q} for binary random variable X, where p denotes the probability of success and q = 1 − p is the probability of failure. 

2. Binomial Distribution: This distribution models the number of successes in n independent trials, each having a success probability of p. It is denoted by the symbol Pr{X = x} where x is the number of successful trials, and assumes the probabilities of all other possible events (trials before and after the nth successful one) are equally likely. 

3. Poisson Distribution: This distribution is often used to model the number of occurrences of a specific event in a fixed interval of time or space. For instance, the number of customers arriving at a restaurant during a particular hour may follow a poisson distribution. It is characterized by a single parameter lambda (λ), which is equal to the expected number of occurrences per unit time or space. 

4. Normal/Gaussian Distribution: This distribution is one of the most widely used distributions in statistics. It is obtained from combining many simpler normal distributions through simple arithmetic operations like summation and multiplication. It is usually described by two parameters - mean μ and variance σ². If μ=0 and σ=1 then it becomes the standard normal distribution. Common uses of the normal distribution include modeling physical systems like heights, weights, IQ scores etc., detecting outliers in data, and estimating population means. 

5. Exponential Distribution: This is another important distribution used in various fields such as finance, economics, and computer science. It expresses the waiting time between events over a large number of trials. It takes two parameters - λ, the rate parameter and γ, the scale parameter. When both λ and γ are equal to 1, the exponential distribution becomes the uniform distribution. 

To represent probability distributions visually, we use histograms and plots to show the frequency of occurrence of individual outcomes. While numerical calculations give us precise values, graphical representation makes it easier for humans to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

Let's now proceed to more detailed explanation of these distributions along with practical examples in Python programming language.<|im_sep|>
