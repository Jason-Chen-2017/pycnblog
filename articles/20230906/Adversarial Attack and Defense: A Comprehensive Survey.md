Adversarial attack and defense (AA&D) refers to the process of generating adversarial examples, which are carefully engineered input samples that cause a machine learning model to fail or produce undesired outputs in some cases. While recent years have witnessed tremendous advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), there is still an unmet need for more comprehensive understanding and practical implementation of AA&D techniques in security-critical applications such as healthcare, finance, transportation, etc., where DNNs play an essential role in decision making. 

The purpose of this survey article is to provide a holistic view of different types of AD attacks and their countermeasures, including gradient-based attacks, decision-based attacks, and ensemble methods. It also presents approaches for applying regularization and pruning to reduce the effects of adversarial attacks on the models' robustness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques, we will discuss real-world scenarios and apply them in medical image analysis and natural language processing tasks.

This paper first introduces the fundamental concepts of adversarial examples and provides a general overview of current research progress. Next, it discusses three key areas that dominate the field of adversarial training: generative modeling, adversarial training, and domain adaptation. Finally, we explore four popular categories of attack algorithms, such as FGSM, PGD, and MI-FGSM, and two main strategies for mitigating the resulting adversarial perturbations, namely feature squeezing and JPEG compression. The paper then examines how existing strategies can be further improved by incorporating knowledge from the literature and adopting new perspectives, and proposes several directions for future research.


# 2. Background Introduction
In computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive results in various classification, detection, segmentation, and generation tasks. However, they may easily be fooled by certain inputs called "adversarial examples," which are carefully crafted to mislead the trained models into producing incorrect predictions with high confidence. Therefore, successful defenses against adversarial examples must come from two aspects: 

1. Incorporating insights gained from empirical studies on natural images and natural language data, which enable us to design better defenses than just relying solely on theoretical assumptions. For instance, we might infer that the features learned by convolutional layers are not reliable when faced with adversarial examples because they tend to extract low-level details rather than higher-order patterns. 

2. Using clever optimization techniques like multi-step loss minimization and iterative pruning, which help the models learn more robust representations without breaking its ability to generalize well to clean inputs. Such methods work best when applied together with other techniques, such as l_p regularization and dropout, which prevent overfitting due to high capacity. 

To date, there has been considerable research on developing effective defenses against adversarial examples. This includes both theoretical contributions and empirical evaluations using datasets that are specifically designed to mimic the kinds of noise found in real-world scenarios, such as digital photographs and texts. One promising direction towards improving the overall performance of defenses is through meta-learning, which aims at automatically discovering useful regularizers and pruning rules from large amounts of labeled data. Based on our observations and findings, we believe that much needed attention should be paid to exploring and optimizing the hyperparameters of state-of-the-art defenses, which remain challenging even today.

Here we present a survey article on the fundamentals of adversarial attack and defense, with a focus on the core principles, techniques, and algorithmic approaches used to develop advanced defenses against various types of adversarial attacks targeting deep neural networks. We introduce the concept of adversarial example, cover the basic characteristics and components of a DNN system, review related works on generative adversarial networks (GANs), cross-domain attacks, and propose several advanced defenses that are scalable, efficient, and effective. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for further research directions and suggestions for practitioners interested in implementing and deploying robust AI systems.
