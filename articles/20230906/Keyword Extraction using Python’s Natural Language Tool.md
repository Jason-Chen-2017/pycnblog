Keyword extraction is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) that helps to identify the most significant phrases or words within a text document. It plays an essential role in various applications such as search engine optimization (SEO), information retrieval (IR), and summarization of large texts.

The main idea behind keyword extraction is to rank the words based on their importance or relevance to the entire text. This can be achieved by applying techniques like TF-IDF weighting, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, sentiment analysis etc. 

Python has become one of the popular programming languages for NLP due to its simplicity, flexibility, powerful libraries, and support for machine learning algorithms. Here we will see how to implement keyword extraction using NLTK library in Python. We will also learn about different feature selection methods used to select relevant keywords from a given text corpus.

2. Basic Concepts & Terminologies
In this section, we will discuss some basic concepts and terminologies associated with keyword extraction. These include: 

1. Corpus - A collection of documents or sentences containing the target content.

2. Document - A sequence of words representing a unique instance of a topic or subject matter.

3. Sentence - A group of words that form grammatically complete thought or expression.

4. Token - The smallest meaningful unit of text, which could be a word, punctuation mark, sentence, or paragraph.

5. Stop Words - Commonly occurring words that do not provide much meaning and are often filtered out during keyword extraction.

6. Stemming - Process of reducing words to their base forms. For example, "running", "run", "runner" all stem to "run".

7. Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagging - A process of assigning parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective etc.) to each token in a sentence.

8. Named Entity Recognition (NER) - Identifying proper names, organizations, locations, dates, and other entities mentioned in a text.

3. Algorithm Implementation

We will use the following steps to extract keyphrases from a given corpus of text data:

1. Import necessary modules - First, let's import the necessary modules required for implementing keyword extraction algorithm using NLTK library. 

2. Load Corpus Data - Next, we need to load the corpus data into memory. The corpus should contain multiple documents or paragraphs along with their corresponding labels.

3. Preprocess Text - Before starting any type of processing, it is always recommended to clean and preprocess the textual data. This step involves removing stopwords, punctuations, digits, converting all characters to lowercase letters, and so on.

4. Feature Selection Method - Once the raw text has been preprocessed, the next step is to choose the appropriate feature selection method to filter out unwanted words and keep only those that carry significant importance. There are several approaches for selecting features, including:

   * Unigram Model - In this model, every word in the document contributes independently to the score of the phrase. 

   * Bigram Model - In this model, two consecutive words contribute together to generate a phrase.

   * Trigram Model - In this model, three consecutive words contribute jointly to create a trigram, and so on.

   * Linguistic Models - Some linguistic models consider certain relationships between words (e.g., synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms).
   
   Choose the appropriate feature selection method based on your specific dataset and problem statement.

5. Generate Keyphrases - Finally, once the features have been selected, we can generate the list of keyphrases using a technique called tf-idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency) scoring. The score assigned to each phrase is calculated based on its occurrence in the entire corpus and represents its overall importance.
