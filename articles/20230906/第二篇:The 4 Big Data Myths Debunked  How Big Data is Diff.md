In this article, we will explain why big data has become so popular in the last decade and what are its different characteristics compared to other types of data such as structured or unstructured data. We also provide a detailed explanation on how to apply big data technologies for various business scenarios and demonstrate their applications using case studies along with our key takeaways. Finally, we will identify some of the challenges that lie ahead and suggest ways to overcome them. 

The following topics will be discussed in detail below:

1. Introduction: An overview of Big Data terminology and history
2. Different Characteristics of Big Data: Compared to Structured and Unstructured Data
3. Applications of Big Data Technologies: Demonstration of use cases
4. Challenges Ahead: Identification and Suggestions
5. Conclusion: Summary and Takeaways

We hope that through our discussion, readers can gain an understanding of big data's unique characteristics and potential benefits. They can then apply these skills to solve real-world problems by utilizing appropriate techniques, tools, and platforms to address specific requirements. Additionally, they can learn about the challenges faced by businesses while applying big data technology and discuss ways to overcome those obstacles to enable more efficient decision making processes and improved performance results.

Big data refers to the massive volume, variety, and velocity of data generated across multiple sources and industries. It has gained widespread attention due to its revolutionary potential to transform organizations' operations, increase efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction. However, many people believe that big data only applies to digital data collected digitally rather than non-digital data like physical documents, audiovisual media, or sensor data. In fact, there are several differences between big data and traditional data types including size, complexity, and speed. Let’s explore each concept further.

## 2.1.Big Data Terminology
Firstly, let’s understand the core terms associated with big data:

1. Volume – The amount of data produced or collected at any given time
2. Variety – The range of data types being captured within the same dataset
3. Velocity – The rate at which new data is generated (measured in “data points per second,” often abbreviated as “dp/s”)

## 2.2.Structured vs Unstructured Data
Unstructured data refers to all forms of data that cannot be easily categorized into logical groups. These include text, images, videos, social media content, sensor data, etc. On the other hand, structured data, also known as relational databases, stores data in tabular format with predefined fields, records, and relationships. 

In contrast to structured data, unstructured data does not have a fixed structure and requires additional processing to extract meaningful insights from the data. This makes it difficult to search, filter, analyze, and manipulate. Structured and unstructured data play an essential role in the world of big data because they vary in the nature of data collection and storage formats. As a result, big data solutions must be capable of handling both types of data in order to achieve significant value. For example, sentiment analysis of user feedback can be performed on structured data such as reviews, but needs to be applied differently on unstructured data such as social media posts. Therefore, the choice of data type determines the appropriate approach and methodologies used for analyzing big data.

## 2.3.Big Data History
Big data was first coined in the context of web analytics, a term referring to the collection and analysis of large amounts of data related to online activities, typically stored on websites. Within two years of its introduction, the term was quickly adopted as the buzzword around which major companies turned to look for new opportunities. Over the next few years, numerous startups created their own big data products and services to leverage big data analytics capabilities. In recent years, however, the field has experienced tremendous growth and innovation as a result of the exponential rise of internet usage and the ever-increasing volumes of data generated daily.

Now, let us focus on the difference between structured and unstructured data. Since structured data follows a well-defined schema and structure, it allows easy manipulation, retrieval, indexing, searching, and querying of data. Whereas, unstructured data, on the other hand, lacks a prescribed structure and may require complex parsing techniques to retrieve and process information. Nevertheless, unstructured data still holds valuable insights that could help organizations make better decisions and improve their overall performance.  

However, one limitation of unstructured data lies in its difficulty in scalability. Due to the immense sizes of datasets, it becomes difficult to perform comprehensive analysis on the entire dataset in a short span of time. Another challenge is that processing unstructured data may lead to loss of useful metadata, rendering certain tasks like entity recognition challenging. To handle these limitations, various Big Data technologies have been developed that utilize machine learning algorithms to automatically mine patterns, trends, and correlations from large sets of data. Some of these technologies are listed below:

1. Hadoop: Hadoop is a distributed computing framework that provides high throughput and scalability for batch processing of large datasets.
2. Apache Spark: Apache Spark is another distributed computing platform designed specifically for fast analytics on large datasets.
3. MapReduce: MapReduce is a programming model used to process large datasets in parallel.
4. Pig: Pig is a high-level language for developing parallel processing workflows on Hadoop.
5. Hive: Hive is a SQL-like query language that uses HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) to store and manage large datasets. 
6. Impala: Impala is a low-latency SQL engine for interactive queries against Hadoop.
7. Kafka: Kafka is an open-source stream processing software that enables highly scalable, fault-tolerant event streaming pipelines.
8. Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch is a search engine and database that provides flexible and powerful full-text search capabilities.
 
On top of these Big Data technologies, businesses need to carefully select the right data source, clean and preprocess data, apply appropriate algorithms, models, and frameworks, and integrate the resulting insights into existing systems. By implementing effective data management practices, organizations can effectively leverage big data technology to unlock new business opportunities, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience.
