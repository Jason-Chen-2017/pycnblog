Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as Karhunen-Loève transform or singular value decomposition (SVD), is a popular method for dimensionality reduction of data sets. PCA is often used in various applications such as image processing, pattern recognition, bioinformatics, and finance. It has become one of the most commonly used tools in machine learning because it can help us discover patterns that are not visible from traditional methods. In this article, we will gently introduce you to the basic concepts and terminology of PCA, followed by its mathematical formulation and its implementation using Python libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn. We will end with some suggestions on how to apply PCA effectively in different scenarios and what should be considered when doing PCA in real world problems. 

In summary, I hope my article can provide a comprehensive guideline about PCA for those who are new to this field and want to learn more about it. If you have any questions or concerns during reading, please let me know! Let's get started writing our first blog post together!

There have been many research papers published in recent years related to principal component analysis (PCA). Here, I will briefly discuss two main approaches: 

1. Classical PCA (PCA) approach - This is mainly based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique which reduces the dimensions of the input dataset while retaining maximum information regarding the variance of original data. The maths behind SVD technique will be explained below along with the step-wise procedure of performing PCA using SVD.
2. Bayesian PCA - This is a variant of classical PCA where instead of directly optimizing the eigenvalues of covariance matrix, the Dirichlet process prior distribution is used to model the uncertainty around the eigenvectors. The paper "Bayesian PCA" by Athey et al., 2010, provides an excellent explanation of this approach.

Both these techniques can perform dimensionality reduction on high dimensional datasets with complex relationships between variables and retain useful features that represent the underlying structure in the data. For example, if we have images containing millions of pixels, PCA can reduce them down to thousands of meaningful features that capture variations among the pixels' intensities. Similarly, text classification tasks can benefit greatly from PCA since they usually involve working with large feature spaces consisting of hundreds of dimensions. Therefore, knowing how to use both techniques and choose the right one depending on the specific problem at hand is essential.


## 3.PCA的基本概念与术语
Before delving into the technical details of implementing PCA in Python, let's understand the basic concepts and terms involved in PCA algorithm.
### 3.1 Input Data Matrix
PCA involves reducing the dimensions of a given multivariate dataset $X$ to a smaller subset of uncorrelated variables called Principal Components (PCs). Mathematically speaking, X is represented as a linear transformation of the standard normal random variable Z, denoted by $X = WSZ$, where $W$ is a matrix of weight vectors and S is the diagonal matrix of corresponding singular values. In other words, each observation in X is a linear combination of weights defined by $WS$. The number of columns in $W$ corresponds to the number of PCs we aim to extract, and the rows correspond to the observations in the original dataset. By choosing only the top k largest singular values (or equivalently, eigenvectors), we can obtain a reduced representation of the original data, where each observation becomes a linear combination of the top k eigenvectors.

For simplicity, let’s assume there are n observations ($n \times d$) in the input dataset X, where each observation contains d variables. The goal of PCA is to find a projection matrix W that maps the input data onto a lower dimensional space where the variance across the components is maximized. Each column of W represents a principal component vector, and the size of the resulting output space is determined by the desired number of principal components k.

### 3.2 Mean Centering of Data Matrix
To remove any mean bias that might exist in the data set, we subtract the sample mean $\mu_x$ from each individual variable x in the training set. The reason why we need to center the data is to make sure that all the independent variables are measured on the same scale. 

### 3.3 Eigendecomposition of Covariance Matrix
The covariance matrix C of a dataset measures the pairwise covariances between the variables in the dataset. To compute the covariance matrix, we divide the centered input matrix X by n-1 and take its transpose (denoted as X^T):
$$C = (X - \mu_{X})^{T}(X - \mu_{X})/n-1$$
where $\mu_{X}$ is the mean of the input matrix X. Then, we calculate the square root of the inverse of the covariance matrix:
$$S^{-1} = (\frac{1}{n-1}\Sigma)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$
Here $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix calculated earlier. Finally, we decompose the covariance matrix S into its eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues. The eigenvector v with the largest eigenvalue λ is associated with the direction of greatest variance, and can be interpreted as a principal component.

### 3.4 Principal Component Regression
After computing the principal components and their directions, we can use them to project the entire dataset onto the reduced subspace spanned by the principal components. This allows us to estimate the relationship between the original variables and the projected variables. However, the primary purpose of principal component analysis (PCA) is to identify the dominant directions of variation in the dataset. When interpreting the results of PCA, we typically focus on the direction(s) of highest variance, rather than examining every single principal component individually.

We can interpret the regression coefficients obtained after PCA as follows:
- Positive coefficient indicates that the corresponding factor explains a positive contribution to the total variability in the response variable Y.
- Negative coefficient indicates that the corresponding factor explains a negative contribution to the total variability in the response variable Y.
- Zero coefficient indicates that the corresponding factor does not contribute much to explaining the variation in the response variable Y.

By comparing multiple factors contributing to the variation in the response variable Y, we can determine which ones carry significant predictive power for the outcome Y. For example, if two factors explain over 90% of the variance in the response variable Y, then we may conclude that they are strongly associated with Y. Alternatively, if one factor explains less than 5% of the variance but others do, then we may decide to include additional factors to improve our prediction accuracy.

### 3.5 Application of PCA
PCA can be applied in numerous domains including computer vision, pattern recognition, bioinformatics, and finance. Some common application areas of PCA are listed below:

1. Image Processing: Many popular algorithms involving image recognition, object detection, and segmentation rely heavily on PCA. Using PCA to compress color images can significantly reduce storage requirements without compromising on the image quality. Additionally, applying PCA to analyze the visual appearance of objects can reveal valuable insights about their structural properties and behavior.

2. Pattern Recognition: Although supervised learning models like neural networks and decision trees can automatically learn relevant features on their own, PCA can help filter out irrelevant features and improve generalization performance. One important use case is in the area of anomaly detection, where labeled examples are noisy and difficult to classify. Applying PCA before feeding the data to a classifier can potentially separate noise from signal and highlight the relevant features that are indicative of anomalies.

3. Bioinformatics: Gene expression datasets collected from different sources often contain redundant and highly correlated gene expressions. Applying PCA can reveal the underlying structure of the data and identify subpopulations within the population. Proteins and drug targets identified through mass spectrometry experiments can also be reduced to fewer dimensions and studied for functional similarity using PCA.

4. Finance: High-dimensional financial time series data can present challenges for modeling and forecasting due to large dimensionality. Performing PCA on the data can reduce its dimensionality while preserving key trends and seasonal cycles. Additionally, using PCA to cluster similar stocks can enable analysts to study market dynamics and anticipate future price movements.
