Deep image synthesis (DIS) has emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality imagery from semantic inputs such as natural language descriptions. The field of DIS is still evolving rapidly, but several recent advances have already been made to enhance the quality of generated images. These include utilizing inverse graphics techniques to generate higher resolution imagery in real time, increasing the diversity of the output images, using attention mechanisms to focus on important parts of an image during generation, and incorporating auxiliary tasks like object detection or style transfer to improve visual coherence between different elements of the generated image. Despite these improvements, however, the underlying principle of DIS remains that it relies heavily on a powerful generator model that learns to map semantic input into high-resolution outputs without any prior knowledge of the content being described. This article examines this fundamental limitation of DIS by introducing two new approaches: 1) integrating inverse graphics techniques into DIS models so they can learn to generate imagery directly from raw inputs, and 2) using pre-trained deep neural networks as domain adaptation modules within DIS models to enable them to more easily adapt to variations in the input distribution. By combining these ideas together, we hope to produce even better generated imagery than those seen so far. 

This article will cover the following topics:

5. Conclusion and Future Work
6. Appendix: FAQs and References
Let's get started!

# 2.Limitations of DIS Models
The first step towards understanding and improving DIS models is to understand their limitations. Specifically, what are the reasons why DIS models require human-designed architectures? What makes them hard to train, fine-tune, and optimize effectively? And how can we leverage advancements in computer vision and machine learning to make them more effective? Let's discuss each point in turn.

## 2.1 Human Designed Architectures
One reason why DIS models rely heavily on human-designed architectures is because they were initially designed to be highly specialized and specific to a particular type of data. For example, the VAEGAN architecture introduced by Gulrajani et al. [1] is specifically designed for image generation and requires the use of convolutional neural network layers. Similarly, the PGGAN architecture introduced by Karras et al. [2] was developed for photo-realistic image synthesis, requiring careful design choices regarding layer sizes, filter counts, and other architectural details. As a result, neither of these models can be directly applied to natural language processing problems, where input sequences can vary significantly in length and complexity.

To address this limitation, researchers often resort to transferring learned features from large datasets of labeled examples, which provide a strong foundation for training generative models [3]. However, this approach typically involves relying entirely on pre-trained representations, making it difficult to adjust parameters or tune hyperparameters to achieve desired performance levels. Additionally, these methods cannot easily scale up to larger models or handle long sequences, making them less suitable for real-world applications.

Overall, while human-designed architectures may seem necessary at times to satisfy specialized requirements, there must exist clear benefits to automation to outweigh the costs involved. Aspects of traditional AI, such as scalable inference, modularization, modularity, and representation reuse, should not come at the expense of specialization. Instead, modern AI systems should allow users to quickly and easily customize components according to their needs, enabling true compositionality and flexibility.

## 2.2 Difficult Training and Fine-Tuning
Another challenge faced by DIS models is the need to carefully select and train appropriate architectures, carefully balance various hyperparameters, and regularize the model to prevent overfitting. This process takes a significant amount of expertise and patience, and it can be challenging to find optimal settings that strike a good trade-off between accuracy and convergence speed. Moreover, optimization algorithms used by most DIS models, such as stochastic gradient descent, do not perform well when facing complex non-convex loss functions.

A promising direction for addressing these issues is to move away from ad hoc manual designs and adopt automated search procedures such as genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning [4], which can explore a much broader space of possible configurations and avoid local minima by exploring multiple solutions simultaneously. Another potential solution is to employ techniques from deep reinforcement learning, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO), which uses actor-critic methods to jointly optimize policies and value functions [5]. While these methods offer substantial promise, they also pose additional challenges related to training stability and memory usage.

While further development is needed to fully leverage automated optimization techniques, some initial steps could include experimenting with popular open-source implementations of image synthesis frameworks like StyleGAN and ProGAN, which provide easy access to common hyperparameter settings and extensive documentation. With sufficient customization options available, developers can explore various possibilities for achieving accurate results across diverse domains and application contexts.

## 2.3 Modern Computer Vision Approaches
Finally, one advantage gained by moving beyond handcrafted feature extractors is the ability to leverage cutting-edge computer vision techniques like self-attention, transformer networks, and implicit neural representations. One key observation made by Denton et al. [6] is that the distribution of values encountered during training tends to be multimodal and difficult to isolate. Using self-attention allows DIS models to capture relationships among input tokens without explicitly modeling them, leading to improved robustness and interpretability.

Similarly, using transformer networks enables DIS models to capture contextual dependencies without explicitly engineering complicated recurrent models, opening up new avenues for creativity and expressivity. Implicit neural representations represent latent variables in an unsupervised manner by learning interpretable factors such as color, shape, motion, etc., rather than explicit pixel intensity labels. While these advances have opened up new horizons for disentangling and understanding worlds, they also present unique computational and statistical challenges that remain to be solved.

Despite all these considerations, current state-of-the-art DIS models still face significant challenges in practice due to their complex internal structures and lack of explanatory power. Nonetheless, through closer integration of these techniques with modern computer vision tools, we may eventually see breakthroughs in DIS and unlock new capabilities for both image generation and Natural Language Processing.
