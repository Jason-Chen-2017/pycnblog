# 2. Architecture Overview
Before getting started with our discussion, let us first understand what is meant by hybrid cloud architecture? Hybrid Cloud refers to a combination of technologies and services that are stored within both public and private clouds. Public cloud platforms offer global reach, scalability, and economies of scale. On the other hand, Private clouds have lower latency, better security, and less cost compared to public clouds. However, it can be challenging for developers who want to build hybrid apps because they must consider several factors such as performance, scalability, security, availability, manageability, and ease of use among others. Therefore, while building a hybrid cloud application, the developer should choose appropriate tools and techniques that best suit their needs based on the nature of their project and the constraints associated with each platform. Let’s discuss how one leading company has leveraged different Azure Stack Hub features to develop its hybrid cloud application. 

Here is a high-level overview of the hybrid cloud application development process: 

1. Identify business requirements - It is essential to clearly define your application’s purpose and target audience. This information helps you identify which components of the system need to be moved from public cloud to private cloud. 

2. Choose platform selection criteria - Based on your business needs, select the right platform for hosting your mobile or web application. You may opt for a fully managed service like Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub if you do not require any control over the underlying virtual machines. Alternatively, if you require access to low-level virtualization features like nested virtualization or hardware acceleration, then you may choose a dedicated hypervisor option like Oracle VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player. You also need to evaluate your preferred database option. Is it possible to migrate your existing database to the private cloud? Should you create a new database instance? Which version and edition of SQL Server is compatible with your stack hub environment? etc., 

3. Set up cloud infrastructure - Once all the necessary preparations are complete, set up your cloud infrastructure. Here, you would provision your required resources like VMs, storage accounts, SQL databases, etc., onto either public cloud or Azure Stack Hub depending upon your decision. Make sure that your configuration aligns with the selected platform selection criteria. 

4. Develop application code - After setting up the cloud infrastructure, start writing your application logic using the programming language and framework of your choice. Use standard coding practices and design patterns like separation of concerns, loose coupling, and dependency injection principles. Always ensure that your application meets scalability and performance targets across various devices. 

5. Test and deploy application - Perform end-to-end testing before deploying your application to production. Ensure that all functionalities work seamlessly. Provision additional test environments like Dev/Test, Staging, UAT, etc., where you can perform integration tests. Deploy your application to production after thoroughly testing and validating it. 

6. Monitor and optimize application performance - Keep track of application performance metrics like response time, CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, disk I/O, etc., and analyze them regularly. If any metric shows unusually high values, investigate root causes and fix issues accordingly. Optimize your application code and configurations to achieve optimal performance. 

7. Connect application to external systems - Integrate your application with external systems such as legacy systems, SaaS applications, and third-party APIs. Configure authentication mechanisms, firewall rules, routing tables, load balancers, DNS servers, and SSL certificates to secure your application communication channel. 

8. Continuous delivery and deployment - Leverage continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) processes to automate the entire application lifecycle. Enable teams to quickly and easily deploy updates without interrupting users. Provide feedback loops throughout the entire lifecycle to improve quality and user satisfaction. 

9. Maintain application patches - Continuously update your application patches to benefit from latest bug fixes and enhancements. Also, monitor patch compliance and remediate any non-compliant instances. Ensure that your application remains highly available during maintenance periods. 

10. Take advantage of hybrid capabilities - Utilize advanced management, monitoring, backup, disaster recovery, networking, identity, and security features offered by Azure Stack Hub to implement advanced scenarios like multi-cloud management, hybrid identity federation, and cross-platform migration. 

Based on the above steps, the following diagram illustrates the overall hybrid cloud application development flow: 



The main challenges faced by organizations when planning and implementing a hybrid cloud application include architectural complexity, technical debt, and vendor lock-in. To address these challenges, leading companies have adopted several strategies such as microservices, serverless architectures, and DevOps culture. In summary, the key to successful hybrid cloud application development lies in optimizing application performance, integrating with external systems, managing data migrations, and taking advantage of platform features. By choosing the right platform, tools, and techniques, organizations can build robust and efficient hybrid applications that solve real world problems efficiently and effectively.
