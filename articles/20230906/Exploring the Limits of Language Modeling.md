In recent years, language models have become increasingly popular as they are capable of generating novel text based on a given prompt. This is achieved by training neural networks to predict the next word or sequence of words in a sentence, typically using the previous few words as input. The outputted probabilities can then be used for various tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering systems. However, building high-quality language models remains challenging due to several factors such as limited data availability, model complexity, computational constraints, and inference speed. In this paper, we explore the current state-of-the-art approaches to language modeling, with an emphasis on their shortcomings and possible solutions. We begin by describing the basics of language modelling including n-gram, skip-gram, and transformer architectures. Next, we discuss some promising advancements made over the past decade towards improving language modeling performance. Finally, we provide guidelines for researchers looking to build high-quality language models that consider practical limitations and future potentials of language models.
2.相关工作回顾Language modeling has been a fundamental problem in natural language processing (NLP) since the early days of deep learning. It aims to learn statistical patterns from large corpora of texts and is widely applied in applications such as speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. There have been many attempts at developing effective models, ranging from simple n-gram models to complex deep learning models like transformers. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, making it difficult to draw conclusions about which one will perform best under different settings. To address these issues, various works have explored advanced techniques, such as subword tokenization, noise injection, self-training, and multi-task learning. Over the course of the last two decades, several breakthroughs have also emerged in terms of model quality and efficiency, leading to new perspectives on how to train better language models. However, there still exist several open challenges and limitations that must be addressed before language models can be truly used in production systems.

In this paper, we first describe the fundamentals of language modeling: what is it, why is it necessary, and what role does it play in NLP today. Then, we explain the most commonly used language modeling algorithms – n-grams, skip-grams, and transformers – and highlight how each algorithm works. After that, we review some promising advances in language modeling development, including efficient hardware optimizations and improved preprocessing methods. Finally, we propose guidelines for building high-quality language models by considering practical limitations and future potentials of language modeling systems.

4.语言模型概述What is Language Modeling? Language modeling refers to the task of training computer programs to assign high probability scores to sequences of words. It allows us to understand and generate human languages, enabling machines to interact more intelligently with humans than any other technology. A typical application of language modeling is text generation, wherein the program generates a coherent paragraph or article given only a few starting words or sentences. Moreover, language models enable new ways of analyzing and understanding language, allowing us to discover insights into human communication and preferences.

Why do we need Language Models? Despite the significant progress made recently in natural language processing through advanced models like BERT and GPT-3, the underlying assumption that language follows a probabilistic process continues to hold true. For instance, while modern models often outperform traditional rule-based methods when predicting the next word in a sentence, they tend to produce less diverse and creative results compared to humans who have an innate ability to formulate complex ideas. This gap between humans and machines is likely to continue to grow as the field matures, particularly with regard to domains like image captioning, dialog systems, and chatbots.

So, how can we develop high-quality language models? One way is to use robust pre-processing techniques that eliminate unwanted features and artifacts such as punctuation marks, capital letters, stop words, and rare words, and to include rich contextual information within the model's input vector. Another important aspect is model architecture design, whereby we optimize both the capacity and memory usage of our model so that it produces accurate predictions. Moreover, we can leverage transfer learning techniques that take advantage of existing language models trained on large datasets, which can significantly reduce the time and cost needed to develop new language models. Additionally, we should ensure that our language models can handle variable length inputs and outputs, and be able to adapt quickly to new domains and scenarios. Nevertheless, even with all these measures in place, language modeling remains a challenging task, and we cannot expect them to match human language perfectly without extensive fine-tuning and testing.
