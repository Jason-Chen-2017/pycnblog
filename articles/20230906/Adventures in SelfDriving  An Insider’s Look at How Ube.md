Self-driving cars, also known as automated vehicles or driverless cars, have been gaining momentum with the advancements of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies over the past several years. This has led to exciting new possibilities for transportation and commerce that were previously impractical or even impossible without such technology. However, these advances come with significant challenges both technically and socially, including safety concerns, road conditions, and other environmental factors. In this article, we will discuss how three leading companies are working on developing self-driving cars and their key insights and approaches towards addressing these challenges. 

Firstly, let's start by discussing what exactly is a self-driving car? A self-driving car is an autonomous vehicle that can operate independently by itself using sensors to detect and recognize objects around it, plan routes, avoid collisions and react accordingly. The car uses machine learning algorithms, which use data from various sources to generate driving decisions, and utilizes advanced control systems to ensure safe navigation through complex environments. With improved performance and reduced fuel consumption, self-driving cars could become a game changer for transportation and commerce, making them far more affordable than traditional vehicles.

In terms of security, one key aspect to consider is accident prevention. Self-driving cars need to be able to detect and prevent potential harmful events like pedestrians crossing paths or cyclists colliding into each other before they cause serious damage. To do so, the system should constantly monitor its surroundings and identify potential threats and respond appropriately. Another important challenge is ensuring privacy during travel. Traditional cars record personal information such as names, addresses, and phone numbers, while self-driving cars must be designed to collect minimal amounts of data and keep sensitive information secure. For example, in recent times, researchers have demonstrated that facial recognition software used by self-driving cars may not comply fully with EU data protection regulations. 

Last but not least, self-driving cars face another critical challenge related to social impact. One issue is congestion, where too many vehicles attempt to drive around the same intersection simultaneously, resulting in heavy traffic jams. Other issues include pollution caused by excessive production and disposal of garbage, air quality issues due to exhaust emissions, and noise pollution created by engine operation. Despite the growing awareness about the risks associated with self-driving cars, few organizations are currently focused on mitigating these effects. Many promising solutions exist, ranging from increased enforcement efforts to better infrastructure design to strengthening social ties between driver and company. Overall, there is much work still to be done to develop high-quality self-driving cars and address all the relevant challenges. Let us look deeper into some of the most significant initiatives that are being pursued within different companies:

1. Waymo

Waymo, founded by Google and headquartered in Palo Alto, California, is the second largest self-driving car company after Uber in the US. It was launched in May 2017 and is building a fleet of fully self-driving vehicles to test and refine its products. Its flagship product, the Waymo self-driving car, is expected to launch late 2020 and bring together drivers and passengers alike in a safer, more convenient way. According to officials, Waymo aims to “offer seamless mobility across cities and regions, enabling people to reach their destination in no time”. It has raised $1.5 billion from investors, led by Tencent Holdings Limited, and holds approximately 90 employees worldwide. 

2. NVIDIA DRIVE AGX

NVIDIA Corporation is home to the popular CUDA-based deep neural networks (DNN) platform called CUDA Toolkit. DRIVE AGX, founded by Jaguar Land Rover in Germany and manufactured by NVIDIA Corporation, leverages DNN models trained on large datasets to create powerful self-driving cars. The device is capable of navigating urban areas and minor roads, handling obstacles like construction sites and parking lots, and recognizing pedestrians and bicycles. NVIDIA DRIVE AGX has made major strides in development lately, improving accuracy, speed, and power efficiency compared to previous generation devices. 

3. Uber Advanced Technologies Group

Uber is known for providing first class transportation services throughout the country, making up half of all international air traffic. In order to provide real-time decision-making capabilities to its self-driving cars, Uber recently announced the launch of its Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), consisting of multiple sub-teams responsible for technical development, hardware integration, algorithm optimization, and deployment strategies. These groups are tasked with creating robust and reliable self-driving platforms that enable people to travel safely and efficiently across city streets and unpredictable terrain. ATG includes expertise from Computer Science, Robotics, and Electrical Engineering departments at Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University respectively. Uber plans to hire a team of 10-20 AI and robotics professionals to lead ATG forward in the next five years.
