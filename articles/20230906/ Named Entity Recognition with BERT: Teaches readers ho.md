# 1.简介
  

Named entity recognition (NER) is a crucial task of natural language processing which aims at recognizing and classifying named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, times, etc. NER plays an essential role in many applications like information retrieval, question answering, text mining, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and speech recognition. However, achieving high accuracy in NER remains challenging because the complexity of human languages makes it impossible for machines to capture all the nuances present in texts. In this article, we will learn how to build a NER system using BERT, a powerful transformer-based neural network architecture, by following these steps:

1. Introduction to Natural Language Processing
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
3. How does BERT work?
4. Building our NER System Using BERT

We assume that you have some basic knowledge about Python programming language, familiarity with deep learning techniques, and an understanding of NLP concepts. Let's get started!

## 2.1 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with enabling computers to understand and manipulate human languages naturally. The field has grown immensely over the years from research labs led by computational linguists to practical products like Siri or Alexa. It involves various subtasks including text classification, parsing, understanding, semantics, and coreference resolution. Here are some important terms related to NLP: 

1. Tokenization: Tokenization refers to the process of splitting raw text data into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be words, phrases, or any other meaningful element that serves as the basis for further processing tasks. 

2. Tagging: This step involves assigning tags to each token based on its syntactic function in the sentence. Some common tag sets include pos tags (part-of-speech tags), ner tags (named entity tags), and dependency tree tags. These tags help identify and classify different components within sentences, making them easier to analyze and comprehend. 

3. Parsing: Parsing involves identifying the relationships between individual tokens based on their syntactic dependencies. For example, consider two clauses linked by a coordinating conjunction "and". Depending on the structure of the sentence and grammar rules, both clauses might be parsed separately or together as one unit. 

4. Semantics: Semantics refers to analyzing the meaning of language through linguistic principles and cognitive abilities. This includes concepts like lexical ambiguity, polysemy, discourse relations, and world knowledge. 

5. Coreference Resolution: Coreference resolution is the task of determining whether there is more than one mention of the same entity in a given text. This problem arises when two people, places, or things share the same name but refer to distinct things. Coreference resolution helps resolve such references so that downstream applications can properly interpret the text.

## 2.2 Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named entity recognition (NER) refers to the process of identifying and classifying named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, times, etc. NER is widely used in various application areas, ranging from information extraction to sentiment analysis. One of the most popular datasets used for evaluating performance of NER systems is the ConLL-2003 dataset, consisting of 7,298 English tokens annotated with eight entity types. To achieve good results, modern models need to combine multiple features and incorporate external resources. BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa are three of the most commonly used models for NER tasks. Below is an overview of NER systems: 

### 2.2.1 Standalone Models
Standalone models are rule-based methods that involve looking up pre-defined lists of names or keywords corresponding to specific types of entities and checking if they appear consecutively in the input text. They are effective for small scale NER tasks, but suffer from low recall due to the limited training examples provided. 

### 2.2.2 Statistical Methods
Statistical methods apply machine learning algorithms to automatically learn patterns and correlations between word sequences and label distributions. There are several approaches, such as maximum entropy modeling and conditional random fields (CRFs), that exploit statistical inference and pattern discovery. Examples of state-of-the-art CRF-based NER systems include OpenCalais, Stanford CRF++, Aylien Text Analysis API, and spaCy. 

### 2.2.3 Neural Networks
Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the way the human brain works. They learn complex representations of inputs from labeled examples by adjusting weights iteratively. Modern NER models utilize transformers, recurrent layers, attention mechanisms, and convolutional filters to generate robust feature vectors from input text. Three representative architectures for NER tasks are BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa. We will focus on building an end-to-end NER system using BERT in this article. 

## 2.3 BERT
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based neural network architecture that was published in October 2018 by Google AI language team. BERT offers significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art models like ELMo and GPT-2. The key idea behind BERT is to use a combination of bidirectional training and transfer learning to improve NER performance. The main advantage of BERT is that it uses a masked language model objective during fine-tuning, where a subset of positions in each sequence are randomly masked out and predicted based on the remaining context. This approach enables BERT to predict words without explicitly looking ahead or generating long sequences of words. Additionally, the transformer architecture allows BERT to process variable length contexts while maintaining computation efficiency and scalability. 

The general flowchart for using BERT for NER consists of four steps:

1. Preprocessing: Prepare input text data by tokenizing and tagging it. Convert the tagged data into suitable format for the BERT model.
2. Fine-tuning: Train a pre-trained BERT model on your own NER task. This involves selecting a pre-trained checkpoint and adding a new output layer for NER tasks.
3. Inference: Use the fine-tuned BERT model for prediction on new test data. During inference time, the tokenizer and tagger should be removed before passing the input text to the BERT model. Only the extracted embedding vectors should be kept and passed to the classifier layer for final predictions.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on test data using metrics like precision, recall, and f1 score.

Let's now move on to learn more about BERT and how it works.
