## 3.1 Overview
In this article we will talk about practical considerations on deploying self-driving cars for real-world applications. We will start by discussing some basic terminologies such as perception, decision-making, control, planning, localization, and communication protocols, which have been used throughout different development stages of the car. Next, we will look at various types of safety mechanisms required during testing and evaluation phases, as well as other issues that must be taken care while operating the vehicles in actual environments. Finally, we will explore several methods for reducing system latency, handling failures, and achieving high levels of efficiency.


## 3.2 Terminologies and Key Concepts
### Perception
The process of understanding the surrounding environment is known as "perception". The main functions of perception include object detection, classification, tracking, and recognition. The use of sensors such as cameras and LIDAR for detecting objects and their spatial relationships are crucial in ensuring accurate information about the surroundings. To achieve this goal, it's essential to develop algorithms that effectively utilize multiple sensors and feature extraction techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), image processing techniques, depth estimation, and others. 


### Decision Making
Once the vehicle has gathered sufficient data from its sensor inputs, it needs to make decisions based on what it knows and understands about the environment. The most common decision-making processes used in autonomous driving involve using advanced motion planning techniques like A* search, dynamic programming, and cost maps, alongside path planning algorithms like RRT, RVO, and SSPT, to generate smooth, safe paths through unknown terrain. In addition to these, decision-making can also rely on predictive models that take into account factors such as traffic conditions, weather forecasts, social dynamics, and road geometry. These models help estimate where obstacles might be present and avoid them accordingly, providing enhanced safety and comfort.


### Control
"Control" refers to the act of controlling the car's movement to navigate safely and efficiently around obstacles. In order to perform efficient autonomous driving, self-driving cars require powerful processors and very low latency communication channels between modules within the vehicle. As a result, PID controllers, state machines, and feedback loops are commonly used to design control systems for autonomous driving applications. Some of the key components involved in controls are steering angles, speeds, and braking signals, which allow the vehicle to maintain optimal performance under different circumstances. Ultimately, effective control requires careful consideration of hardware limitations, signal noise characteristics, and disturbance rejection techniques. 


### Planning
Planning involves developing algorithms that determine the overall course of action to reach a specific destination. Autonomous vehicles typically employ complex and reactive planning strategies that leverage contextual knowledge, risk assessment, and uncertain events to ensure safety and efficiency. For example, cruise control modes can be designed to minimize fuel consumption by adjusting speed profiles dynamically based on predicted road conditions, without interfering with navigation tasks. In addition, advanced planners such as multi-modal path planning can incorporate multiple sources of information, such as GPS, lidar, radar, and IMU measurements, to create more robust trajectories that anticipate unexpected situations and respond quickly to changes in traffic congestion.


### Localization
Localization refers to determining the position, orientation, and velocity of the vehicle in relation to external factors, such as GPS, IMU, and odometry sensors. Estimation errors caused due to hardware limitations, sensor faults, and noisy input data all contribute to degraded accuracy. While global positioning systems (GPS) offer highest level of accuracy, they introduce large latencies and require frequent updates, limiting their utilization in highly dynamic environments. In contrast, inertial measurement units (IMU) and differential odometry provide lower-cost solutions for precise local position estimation but suffer from biases and drift over time. Localizing accurately requires intelligent fusion techniques that combine information from multiple sensors and estimators to produce accurate estimates of pose, velocity, and acceleration. 


### Communication Protocols
To communicate with other devices and systems, self-driving cars often utilize wireless communications protocols such as WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa, Zigbee, or WAN (wide area networks). It's critical to optimize these protocols to maximize throughput, reliability, and range, since wireless connectivity makes up the majority of the battery life of modern smartphones and tablets. Additionally, a good choice of radio frequencies, transmission power, and packet size can significantly improve the quality of wireless communication and reduce communication latency.


## 3.3 Testing and Evaluation
Testing and evaluation are critical aspects of the development of any self-driving car project. During the early stages of the project, it's crucial to test each subsystem individually to ensure proper integration and compatibility. Moreover, unit tests should also be developed to verify individual components of the software stack, ensuring correct functionality of the code base. Additionally, it's essential to conduct end-to-end testing to validate system functionalities across different physical and simulated environments. To evaluate the performance of the vehicle, metrics such as average speed, collision rates, and road compliance can be tracked continuously, allowing teams to identify areas of improvement and fine-tune the system further. Ultimately, testing and evaluation should continue to remain an integral part of the self-driving car development cycle, regardless of the stage of development.


## 3.4 Efficiency
Efficiency is one of the primary concerns when deploying self-driving cars for real-world applications. With increasing popularity and demand, it becomes increasingly critical to deploy self-driving cars with high levels of efficiency and reduced latency. Reducing latency means responding quickly to changes in the environment, enabling responsive adaptive behavior, and maintaining comfortable driving conditions even in extreme conditions. There are several ways to improve the efficiency of self-driving cars, including optimizing algorithmic complexity, leveraging parallelism and caching, improving compute capabilities, and minimizing redundant computations. Effectively monitoring and controlling the performance of self-driving cars over long periods of time is another aspect of reducing latency. Ultimately, reducing latency impacts not only the user experience but also the economics of deployment and maintenance costs associated with self-driving cars. Therefore, there is a need to strike a balance between meeting strict deadlines and achieving reasonable levels of efficiency while adhering to regulatory requirements and managing risks.
