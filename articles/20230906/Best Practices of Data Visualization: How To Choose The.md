# 1.简介
  

Data visualization is the process of translating large data sets and metrics into clear and informative visual representations that help users to understand complex information quickly and intuitively. There are several types of charts available for various purposes such as showing trends, comparing data, presenting distributions, etc. Choosing the right chart type, design, colors and other aspects can have a significant impact on the overall user experience and engagement with your data. In this article, we will explain how to choose the best chart type, colors and other elements for different scenarios in order to create engaging and compelling visualizations. 

# 2.Charts Types
## 2.1 Line Charts
Line charts are one of the most commonly used chart types because they show changes over time or categories. They are suitable for displaying continuous data, typically from a single source, where each value represents an individual observation or measurement. Examples include stock prices, sales figures, and temperature readings. Here's an example line chart for stock price movements:



The main features of line charts include connecting all data points with straight lines, providing context by using color coding and allowing easy comparison between multiple series of data. However, there are many variations of line charts that provide more flexibility in terms of presentation. Some common ones are:

  - **Stacked Area Chart**: This chart shows the total area covered by a set of data over time, broken down into separate areas representing each category or subcategory. It allows you to compare the relative sizes of data sets within different categories.
  

  
  - **Step Line Chart:** A step line chart connects the values of subsequent observations in a sequence with vertical bars rather than horizontal lines. It is useful when dealing with discrete events, such as service calls or system downtime periods.
  
  
  


  - **Spline Charts** are similar to line charts but use cubic splines instead of straight lines to give a smoother appearance. Spline charts offer better control over the shape and curvature of data, making them ideal for displaying multivariate data or data with varying levels of correlation. 





## 2.2 Bar Charts
Bar charts represent categorical data as rectangles, where the height of each rectangle corresponds to its numerical value. They are well suited for displaying simple comparisons among categories, since each bar occupies only one row. Two basic forms of bar charts are stacked and grouped. Stacked bar charts combine multiple categories together into a single bar while grouping them separately. Grouped bar charts group categories along the x-axis, effectively creating parallel columns. Each column has its own label and tick marks, making it easier to discern differences across groups. Here's an example of a grouped bar chart:



Another variation of grouped bar charts is hierarchical clustering, which arranges the bars based on their similarity, resulting in a tree structure. This makes it easier for users to identify patterns and relationships across categories. Finally, strip plots are another alternative form of grouped bar chart, where individual bars represent data points without overlapping. These plots allow you to display distributions or clusters of data side by side.




## 2.3 Pie Charts
Pie charts are circular graphs that display proportions of a whole. They are often used to depict a small portion of a whole, usually represented as a percentage. Pie charts are easy to understand and interpret, making them a popular choice for small datasets. Here's an example pie chart:


Pie charts are typically divided into wedges corresponding to categories or segments, with the size of each segment indicating its proportion. Wedge labels can be added to further describe the breakdown of data. Other variations of pie charts include donut charts, which add a center slice to emphasize the central angle of the data.





## 2.4 Scatter Plot
Scatter plots are two-dimensional plots that display pairs of variables in Cartesian coordinates. One variable is mapped onto the x-axis, and the other variable is mapped onto the y-axis. Each point represents a data point from a two-dimensional dataset. Scatter plots are useful for examining relationships between two continuous variables, especially if those variables are not related through a linear relationship. For instance, scientists might use scatter plots to study the relation between weight and height of people, or temperature and air pressure in a climate model. Here's an example scatter plot:








## 2.5 Maps
Maps are graphical representation of geographic locations. They are commonly used to display spatial patterns, such as population density or traffic flows. Different map projections can enhance the perception of spatial patterns by breaking up space into distinct regions. Common examples of maps include choropleth maps, which assign different colors to different regions based on a chosen metric, and cartograms, which use shapes and size instead of colors to encode data. Here's an example of a choropleth map of US Census demographics:
