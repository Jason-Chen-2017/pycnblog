在机器学习领域，聚类算法被广泛应用于分类、异常检测、数据降维等应用场景中，它的目的就是将具有相似性的对象归属到同一个簇或簇族当中。其中一种典型的聚类算法就是K-均值聚类算法(K-means clustering algorithm)。本文详细阐述了K-均值聚类算法的工作原理及其应用场景，并给出了代码实现。文章结构如下图所示：





# 2. K-Means Clustering Basics and Mathematical Intuition 

## What is a Clustering Problem? 


Clustering problem refers to the task of grouping similar data points into clusters based on their features or attributes. The goal is to discover patterns in unstructured or noisy data that can be useful for further analysis. In other words, it involves partitioning a dataset into groups such that objects within each group are more similar to each other than they are to those in other groups. Various clustering algorithms have been proposed over the years for solving this problem but the most commonly used one is K-Means clustering. 


In K-Means clustering, we start by randomly initializing k centroids where k denotes the number of desired clusters. Then, we assign each point in our dataset to its nearest cluster center using Euclidean distance as the measure of similarity. Next, we update the position of each cluster center to the mean of all points assigned to it. We repeat these steps until convergence i.e., the positions of the cluster centers do not change significantly between two consecutive iterations. 

Here's how it works step-by-step with an example. Let’s assume we want to segment a collection of documents into three different categories - Sports, Entertainment and Politics. To perform this task using K-Means clustering, we will follow the following steps:

1. Choose the number of clusters (k=3). This means there would be three resulting groups after segmentation.

2. Randomly initialize k centroids, say c1, c2, c3. These represent the initial starting point from which we will find optimal clusters.

3. Assign each document to the nearest cluster center according to their Euclidean distances. For instance, let's consider the first document "The best sport player ever" belongs to the category “Sports” since it has the least difference compared to both other categories. Similarly, let's call second and third documents belong to the remaining two categories. So, our assignment matrix might look like this:

   |   Doc    |      Sports     |Entertainment|Politics|
   |:--------:|:---------------:|:-----------:|:------:|
   |Doc1      |       1         |      0      |    0   |
   |Doc2      |       √2√2      |      0      |    0   |
   |Doc3      |      √2√2       |      0      |    0   |
   |Doc4      |       √2√2      |      0      |    0   |
   |...       |     ...        |    ...     | ...   |
   |DocN      |       N√2√2     |      0      |    0   |

4. Calculate new centroids by taking the average of all documents assigned to them. Now, suppose we get the following updated values for centroids:
   
   ```
      Centroid1 = (1 + 0+0)/3 
      Centroid2 = (0+√2√2+0)/3
      Centroid3 = (0+0+N√2√2)/3
   ```
   
5. Repeat step 3 and step 4 until convergence occurs. At this stage, the resultant clusters would look something like this:

   | Documents |           Category          | 
   |:---------:|:---------------------------:| 
   |Doc1-Doc2  |            Sports           | 
   |Doc3-Doc4  |          Entertainment      | 
   |Doc5-DocN  |             Politics         | 
   
  Note: Each row represents a cluster and shows all documents assigned to it. Also note that some documents may not be classified into any of the existing categories because they did not meet the minimum threshold required to form a cluster. 


6. Finally, we obtain k clusters formed by merging together all documents that share similar traits. Here, the resulting segments can be categorized into Sports, Entertainment, and Politics, depending upon the level of overlap between the documents within each cluster.





## Understanding mathematical representation of K-Means Clustering
To understand the working principles behind K-Means clustering, let us discuss its basic mathematical representations:

1. **Euclidean Distance**: The standard method of measuring distance between two points in Euclidean space is known as the Euclidean distance formula:


   Where p and q are two vectors representing coordinates in n-dimensional space. The above equation calculates the distance between two points represented by their x, y coordinates.
   

2. **Distance Matrix**: A distance matrix stores pairwise distances between every possible combination of elements in a set of data. Given n observations, the distance matrix D has dimensions nxn, where Dij represents the distance between observation i and j. Formally, Dij = distance(xi,xj), where xi and xj are observations and distance() function measures their distance based on the chosen metric.
   

3. **Assignment Matrix**: An assignment matrix stores information about which cluster a particular observation falls into at each iteration. If we were given n observations and k clusters, then the assignment matrix P has dimensions nxk, where Pi indicates the cluster index to which observation i belongs. Moreover, pi = argmin[kj]Dik. Here, argmin[] is the index of the minimum value in array [] respectively. Hence, Pij = argmin[k]{Dii}, if i belongs to cluster k, otherwise, Pij = ∞, indicating that observation i does not belong to any cluster.
   

4. **Centroid Vector**: The centroid vector represents the central location of a cluster. Specifically, it is calculated as follows:

   <center>μ<sub>i</sub>=∑<sub>j=1</sub><sup>n</sup>PijXi</center>

   Where μ<sub>i</sub> is the centroid of cluster i, Xi is the jth observation in the cluster, and Σ is the summation operator.
   

5. **K-Means Objective Function**: The objective function of K-Means determines the quality of our clustering solution. One popular choice of the objective function is the Sum Of Squared Errors (SSE):

   <center>J(C,P)=∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>[Σ<sub>j=1</sub><sup>k</sup>Pij(dijk)^2]</center>
  
   Where C represents the centroid matrix containing k centroid locations and dijk represents the distance between the ith observation and the jth centroid.



6. **Learning Process**: After choosing the number of clusters k and initializing the centroid matrix C, the K-Means learning process consists of iteratively updating the centroid matrix and assigning observations to the nearest centroid until convergence. At each iteration t, we calculate the SSE cost function J(C<sub>t</sub>,P<sub>t</sub>) and optimize it via gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss function J(). 

Therefore, the overall training process looks like:

   1. Initialize k centroids randomly
   2. Repeat until convergence {
      3. Assign each observation to the closest centroid
      4. Recalculate centroid positions
      5. }
   
Finally, we converge to a local optimum and have found the final set of k clusters along with their corresponding centroids.
