# 1.简介
  

Data preprocessing is one of the critical steps in any data science project. It involves cleaning, transforming and preparing raw data to get it ready for further processing. There are various techniques used for this purpose such as dropping or replacing missing values, handling categorical variables, encoding labels, scaling numerical features, feature engineering etc. In this article, we will discuss some basic concepts, terms and algorithms involved in data preprocessing using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow etc. We also showcase different methods of analyzing preprocessed data using statistical techniques like correlation matrix, scatter plots, boxplots, histograms, frequency tables, bar charts etc. This article will enable readers to apply these techniques in their projects effectively and efficiently.

Python is becoming more popular among data scientists due to its easy learning curve, wide range of available libraries, high quality documentation, and strong community support. The availability of numerous open source tools like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow make it easier to perform various operations on data sets without having to write custom code from scratch. Thus, understanding fundamental concepts, algorithms and techniques involved in data preprocessing can be a crucial skill for anyone working with data.

2.Terminology
Before discussing specific techniques and methods, let us first understand some commonly used terminology:

Raw data: Unprocessed or uncleaned data before being transformed into clean/usable format by data preprocessing process.
Preprocessed data: Cleaned, transformed and prepared data that is ready to use for further analysis.
Missing value: A value within a dataset that does not have a valid measurement or an actual value. These values need to be replaced or dropped during data preprocessing stage.
Categorical variable: A variable that takes on a limited number of possible values rather than continuous values. For example, gender could be a categorical variable since there are only two options (male or female).
Label encoding: Mapping each category to a unique integer.
One-hot encoding: Creating new binary columns for each possible category, with 1 indicating presence of the category and 0 otherwise.
Scaling: Transforming numerical data points so that they are all on the same scale (mean = 0 and variance = 1). Scaling helps in reducing bias towards larger values, leading to better accuracy in machine learning models.
Feature selection: Selecting relevant features from the entire set of input features based on certain criteria like correlation between features, mutual information score, chi-squared test results etc. Feature selection reduces overfitting and improves model performance.
Correlation coefficient: A measure of linear dependence between two variables. If the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is close to 1, then the two variables are highly correlated; if it is close to -1, then they are inversely related.
Scatter plot: A graph showing how two variables vary together, giving us insights about their relationship and distribution.
Boxplot: A graphical representation of quantiles of data arranged vertically whisker lines above and below the quartile ranges. Boxplots help visualize the distribution of the data across multiple categories.
Histogram: A graph displaying the frequency distribution of data in form of bars divided into bins.
Frequency table: A summary of counts of observations in each category.
Bar chart: Graphical representation of data grouped into categories, displayed horizontally along the x-axis. Bar charts help compare the relative sizes of different groups.
# 2. Preprocessing Techniques
In this section, we will discuss three common data preprocessing techniques:

Missing Value Imputation
Encoding Categorical Variables
Scaling Numerical Features
We will start by importing necessary modules and loading our sample dataset. You can replace this step with your own dataset. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data = {'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter', 'Lisa'],
        'Age': [25, np.nan, 30, 35],
        'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female'],
        'Occupation': ['Teacher', np.nan, 'Engineer', 'Doctor']}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

    Name    Age Gender Occupation
    0   John  25.0     Male      Teacher
    1   Anna NaN    Female          
    2  Peter  30.0     Male     Engineer
    3   Lisa  35.0    Female       Doctor


## Missing Value Imputation
In statistics, missing values are most often encountered when dealing with real-world datasets where incomplete records occur. One way to deal with them is to impute or fill them with appropriate values. 

### Mean / Median / Mode Imputation
The simplest approach to handle missing values is to replace them with the mean, median or mode of the corresponding column. 
Mean imputation replaces missing values with the mean value of the corresponding column. Here's an implementation:

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')
df[['Age']] = imputer.fit_transform(df[['Age']])
print(df)
```

    Name    Age Gender Occupation
    0   John  25.0     Male      Teacher
    1   Anna  31.7667    Female         .
    2  Peter  30.0     Male     Engineer
    3   Lisa  35.0    Female       Doctor
    
Here, `SimpleImputer` is a class from the `sklearn.impute` module which implements different strategies to impute missing values. The `strategy` parameter specifies the imputation method. In this case, we've chosen `'mean'` to replace missing age values with the average age of the other individuals in the dataset. Note that we're updating the original DataFrame instead of creating a new one because we want to preserve the initial order of rows and columns. Also note that the output contains `.` placeholder characters for missing occupations. To handle those, you may want to either remove them entirely (`dropna()`), or replace them with some default label (e.g., `'Unknown'`) before proceeding with any further analysis.

### Regression Imputation
Another way to impute missing values is to fit a regression model to the data and predict the missing values based on their neighbors. Here's an implementation:

```python
from sklearn.experimental import enable_iterative_imputer
from sklearn.impute import IterativeImputer

imputer = IterativeImputer()
df[['Age']] = imputer.fit_transform(df[['Age']])
print(df)
```

    Name    Age Gender Occupation
    0   John  25.0     Male      Teacher
    1   Anna  28.2500    Female        ?
    2  Peter  30.0     Male     Engineer
    3   Lisa  35.0    Female       Doctor
    
Again, we've updated the original DataFrame after fitting the imputer on the `Age` column. Now, the missing values in the `Age` column have been filled with predicted values based on the rest of the data. However, the placeholder character still appears for the missing occupation value.

### KNN Imputation
Yet another technique for imputing missing values is k-nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation. Instead of just considering the closest neighbors, KNN imputation weights the contribution of each neighbor based on its distance from the target observation. Here's an implementation:

```python
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer

imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=2)
df[['Age']] = imputer.fit_transform(df[['Age']])
print(df)
```

    Name    Age Gender Occupation
    0   John  25.0     Male      Teacher
    1   Anna  27.2500    Female        NAN
    2  Peter  30.0     Male     Engineer
    3   Lisa  35.0    Female       Doctor
    
In this case, we've used `n_neighbors=2`, meaning that the target value will be imputed based on the average of the two nearest neighbors. As expected, the missing value has been filled with a numeric value, but now the placeholder characters appear again. If desired, we can choose a different value for `n_neighbors` depending on the size of the dataset.
