Communication systems are crucial components of our lives as we share information with others over a variety of mediums such as telephone lines, radio signals, and computer networks. To improve the communication quality, various encoding techniques have been developed that convert binary data into modulated signaling formats suitable for transmission through wireless channels. One of these encodings is superdense coding which enables two parties to transmit one message by sending each bit twice (one carrier wave per bit) and receiving an echo on their return channel. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on quantum entanglement to build superdense coding capabilities in communication systems. 

Quantum entanglement plays a pivotal role in quantum computing applications where it allows us to perform computation and store information without losing any piece of information along the way. A qubit can be thought of as the smallest unit of quantum information and consists of both a spin and a quantum state. The spin represents the direction of the magnetic field and determines whether the qubit is excited or ground state. In classical computers, bits are represented using only zeros and ones. However, with quantum computing, we can represent a single qubit as having either a zero or one depending upon its spin direction. This means that if we send multiple copies of the same qubit through entangled states, they will collapse to different values and allow us to carry out computations effectively. Similarly, using quantum entanglement, we can use entangled pairs of qubits to implement error-correcting codes that can detect and correct errors in transmitted messages. Using entanglement, we can exploit properties of quantum mechanics and probability theory to develop more efficient algorithms for superdense coding. 

In this paper, we present a protocol for building superdense coding capabilities in communication systems using quantum entanglement. We first discuss the background concepts behind quantum entanglement before going on to describe the proposed protocol. Then, we illustrate how we can encode and decode messages using entangled pair of qubits in superdense coding scheme. Finally, we discuss some limitations and future directions of the work. 


# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum physics that describes the interaction between two subatomic particles. An entangled state refers to the physical properties of a system that cannot be separated into individual constituents. When two systems are strongly coupled, even if separated physically, the resultant state may behave like a completely independent entity. Quantum entanglement occurs when two or more subsystems exhibit non-classical interactions beyond normal macroscopic quantum effects, resulting in complex, nonlinear correlations between their internal states. For example, entangled photons may become dephased due to loss of coherence, creating multi-level atoms, or polarization swaps at the atom level, leading to unpredictable results in electronics and optics.

Quantum entanglement offers several benefits, including increased reliability, scalability, and speed compared to conventional digital communications methods. It also helps to lower costs and improves security. The main challenge in exploiting quantum entanglement for superdense coding is to design protocols that can recover lost messages in case of errors while minimizing waste of resources.

A qubit is typically composed of two distinguishable degrees of freedom: the spin degree of freedom and the energy level of the nucleus inside the spin sphere. These two degrees of freedom interact collectively within the overall quantum state of the qubit. There are four possible combinations of these degrees of freedom: |0⟩ = (|00⟩, |01⟩), |1⟩ = (|10⟩, |11⟩). These basis vectors correspond to the two states of a classical bit and play an important role in developing protocols that operate on quantum devices.

A bell state refers to a quantum state that possesses certain features required for entanglement. A Bell state is usually represented as follows:


where α and β are arbitrary complex numbers, and I is the identity operator. Two commonly used types of bell states are the maximally entangled states, named after the physicists who discovered them, which possess equal probabilities of being measured in either |ψ+⟩ or |ψ−⟩ states, and the Werner State, which possesses higher probabilities of measuring |ψ+⟩ than |ψ−⟩. 

The Hadamard gate is another essential component in quantum computing and mathematics that operates on two qubits. The purpose of the Hadamard gate is to create a superposition of eigenstates, and hence it can be used as a tool to generate random quantum states that are closely related but not identical to each other. In particular, applying the Hadamard gate to a qubit followed by a measurement produces either the |0⟩ or |1⟩ eigenstate with equal probability. Therefore, we can think of the Hadamard gate as converting the logical value of a qubit from |0⟩ to |+⟩, and vice versa.

Superdense coding is a method of communicating using two qubits, specifically entangled pairs, to transfer digital data via light. Each qubit contains a spin, which can be rotated from either the |0⟩ or |1⟩ state. If Alice wants to send a binary digit D to Bob, she sends her qubit in the |0⟩ state, followed immediately by her own qubit in the corresponding state |D⟩ = |11⟩ or |10⟩. Her original qubit remains in the state |0⟩ and now lies dormant until Bob measures his own qubit, revealing the original binary digit D. While there exist many variations of superdense coding, we focus on the simplest implementation in this paper, known as Steane code, consisting of five qubits arranged in a checkerboard pattern.

# 3.Protocol Overview
Our proposal builds on the following steps to enable superdense coding over entangled pairs of qubits:

1. Prepare the shared resource: Create an entangled pair of qubits according to the chosen basis set. These qubits serve as the primary source of entanglement. In practice, we prepare two sets of entangled qubits, one for Alice and one for Bob, so that each party has a unique pair. 
2. Encode the message: Once the entangled pair of qubits is created, Alice prepares her own qubit in the |0⟩ state and applies an X-gate to it. This flips the spin of the qubit from |0⟩ to |+⟩. Next, she feeds this qubit to Bob's entangled qubit, allowing them to perform a CNOT operation simultaneously on both qubits, resulting in entangled states. At this point, Alice can discard her original qubit and wait for Bob's measurement to determine the value of the received message.
3. Decode the message: After Bob receives Alice's message, he performs a CNOT operation again to obtain the receiver qubit in the desired state and then measures it. Depending on the outcome of the measurement, he obtains either |0⟩ or |1⟩, which corresponds to a logical '0' or '1', respectively. Thus, the entire process provides reliable transmissions of digital data using entanglement alone.

To further enhance the efficiency and scalability of the protocol, we suggest using amplitude amplification to reduce the noise introduced by the intermediate CNOT gates and optimize the rate of recovery in case of errors. Additionally, we explore ways to leverage quantum control to eliminate the need for physical contacts between the qubits during transmission, reducing the risk of interception and facilitating mobility across long distances. 

We now describe the details of the proposed protocol.
