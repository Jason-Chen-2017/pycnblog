Artificial Intelligence (AI), a subset of Machine Learning (ML), is one of the hottest topics in the modern world. Within this field, there are many different techniques and algorithms to solve complex problems such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc., but how do we approach solving any machine learning problem? This article will provide an overview of the process for approaching almost any machine learning problem using Python code.

In general, the steps involved when applying AI techniques to solve a particular problem include:

1. Data collection and preparation - Collecting and cleaning data that is relevant to your specific problem can be crucial to building accurate models. Often, labeled datasets with annotations or labels must also be used for training and evaluating your model.

2. Algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning - Choosing appropriate algorithm(s) based on your dataset's characteristics and requirements is important in order to achieve good results. Hyperparameters, which are adjustable settings within each algorithm, need careful attention during tuning to ensure optimal performance.

3. Model architecture design and implementation - The choice of network architecture and optimization methodology is critical in achieving high accuracy and efficiency. It requires some creativity and experimentation to find the best solution.

4. Training and evaluation - Finally, you need to train and evaluate your final model to see if it meets your expectations. You may fine-tune your model by iterating over various architectures, optimizers, regularization techniques, and hyperparameters until you reach the desired level of accuracy.

To tackle these challenges, here are three key points to keep in mind while thinking about applying machine learning:

1. Data: Ensure that your data is clean and representative enough to address your specific problem. Consider collecting diverse data sets from multiple sources and labeling them appropriately to improve overall performance. Also, consider balancing your dataset across classes to prevent bias towards certain categories.

2. Algorithms: Experiment with a variety of algorithms and compare their performance against each other. Use grid search or randomized search to optimize hyperparameters for each algorithm. Be aware of the pros and cons of different algorithms depending on your data set and use case.

3. Architecture: Designing effective neural networks requires careful consideration of input sizes, layer types, and activation functions. Make sure to balance between complexity and accuracy. Incorporate regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization. Test different combinations of layers and activations to find the best result. 

Now let's get into the details of this project! We'll start with an introduction to the problem at hand. Then we'll go through basic concepts and terminologies necessary for understanding the problem. After that, we'll move on to look at the core algorithm behind most popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Finally, we'll implement our own version of the decision tree algorithm and apply it to the same breast cancer classification task. Let's dive right in!
# Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases among women in the United States. Early detection of breast cancer has been shown to play a significant role in reducing morbidity and mortality rates. Breast cancer screening involves analyzing mammograms taken from both male and female patients, but current technology does not offer a realistic option due to its cost and time consumption. To automate this process and improve diagnosis accuracy, researchers have proposed several automated methods including mammography classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, even though CNNs have achieved impressive results on image classification tasks, they cannot directly handle tabular data like medical imaging features. Therefore, it becomes essential to convert tabular data into images before feeding them into CNNs for classification purposes. 

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that takes in patient information, demographics, and medical imaging features and predicts whether a person has breast cancer or not. For simplicity, we will assume that only breast ultrasound images are available for prediction, but the same principles could be applied to other types of imaging modalities such as digital MRI. 
# Basic Concepts & Terminologies

Before starting our exploration of the problem, it's important to familiarize ourselves with some basic concepts and terminologies related to machine learning. Here are some definitions and explanations:

1. **Classification**: A type of supervised learning where the output variable is categorical rather than continuous. Example applications include spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and credit card fraud detection. 

2. **Regression**: A type of supervised learning where the output variable is numerical rather than categorical. Example applications include stock price prediction and customer behavior modeling.

3. **Supervised Learning:** A type of machine learning where labeled input/output pairs are provided to learn the mapping function between inputs and outputs. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVMs).

4. **Unsupervised Learning:** A type of machine learning where unlabeled input data is provided without any target values or corresponding output variables. Commonly used in clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.

5. **Reinforcement Learning:** A type of machine learning where an agent interacts with an environment to learn by performing actions and receiving rewards in return. Examples include playing games like Go or Atari.

Let's now explore the different types of data preprocessing techniques commonly used in machine learning projects. 

**Data Cleaning:** The first step in any machine learning project is to clean the data. It includes removing missing values, handling outliers, detecting duplicates, and normalizing data ranges. Some common issues that arise during data cleaning include: 

1. **Missing Values:** Missing values occur whenever no value exists for a given feature or instance. They can significantly impact the quality of the data and lead to biased predictions. There are two main approaches to deal with missing values:

   a. **Deletion:** Delete instances or features with missing values.
   
   b. **Imputation:** Replace missing values with statistical estimates, such as mean or median.
   
2. **Outliers:** Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from other observations. Identifying and dealing with outliers can help improve the quality of the data and improve model performance. Three main strategies to identify and remove outliers are:

   a. **Z-score:** Calculate the z-scores for each observation, then remove those whose absolute value exceeds three standard deviations away from the mean.
   
   b. **IQR Score Method:** Compute the interquartile range (IQR) for each feature, then remove those outside the upper bound Q3 + 1.5*IQR or lower bound Q1 - 1.5*IQR.
   
   c. **Tukey’s Rule:** Define a threshold value T above which a point is considered an outlier, then remove all data points more than twice the interquartile distance below Q1 and above Q3.

3. **Duplicates:** Duplicates refer to rows that contain identical copies of the same record. Dealing with duplicates can affect the ability of the model to generalize to new data. One way to remove duplicates is to merge records that share a common identifier, such as a patient ID. Alternatively, you can randomly select one copy of duplicate rows to retain and discard the rest.

4. **Normalization:** Normalization involves scaling data to a fixed scale, usually between zero and one. This makes it easier to compare different features and prevents issues caused by large differences in scales. Two common normalization techniques are min-max scaling and standardization. Min-max scaling involves subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Standardization involves computing the mean and variance of the original data, then subtracting the mean and dividing by the square root of the variance.

Now that we've covered some basics, let's delve deeper into what exactly deep learning is. Specifically, we'll focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) because they're commonly used for medical image analysis.
