# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables machines to understand and process human language in natural language. The primary goal of NLP is to enable computers to read and understand text data and respond appropriately. It involves techniques such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and speech recognition. In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of tokenization and perform sentiment analysis on English language text using Python programming language. We will use various libraries including NLTK library for performing tokenization and SentiWordNet library for analyzing sentiments.

Tokenization is the process of breaking down large blocks of text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens are typically words but can also be other types of meaningful units such as punctuation marks or phrases. Each token has its own unique characteristics, which includes lexical features such as word form, part-of-speech tag, tense, etc., and syntactic features such as dependency relationships with adjacent tokens. 

Sentiment analysis refers to the task of determining the underlying attitude, opinion, or emotion conveyed by an expression in free-form text. There are several ways to measure the intensity or polarity of the sentiment, such as positive, negative, neutral, mixed, or compound. One approach uses dictionaries of frequently used words associated with different emotions, along with their respective scores. However, this approach often fails to capture fine nuances within language, making it difficult to accurately detect sentiment in real-world scenarios where context plays a significant role in understanding meaning. Therefore, machine learning models have been proposed to learn from annotated datasets of labeled examples to automatically classify sentences according to their intended sentiment.

## Sentence Segmentation and Tokenization
Sentence segmentation is the process of dividing a block of text into individual sentences. For example, given the input string "Hello World! How are you?" sentence segmenter would divide this into three separate sentences - "Hello World!", "How are you?". Similarly, tokenization is the process of converting each sentence into individual words or terms. This step typically requires handling special cases such as contractions, abbreviations, and URLs. NLTK provides powerful tools like Regular Expressions (regex), Stemming, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal, Wordnet Lemmatizer, Penn Treebank POS Tagger, Spelling Corrector, and more. Here's how to tokenize a sentence using NLTK's default tokenizer:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

sentence = "This is a sample sentence."
tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)

print(tokens) # Output: ['This', 'is', 'a','sample','sentence', '.']
```

In the above code snippet, `nltk` module is imported to access the necessary functions such as `word_tokenize()` function. The `word_tokenize()` function takes a string argument and returns a list containing individual tokens separated by whitespace characters. 

## Part-Of-Speech Tagging
Part-of-speech tagging assigns a category to every single word in a sentence based on its grammatical properties. A common way to represent parts of speech is through the Penn Treebank POS tags. Here's how to assign POS tags to a given sentence using NLTK's built-in POS tagger:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.tag import pos_tag

sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
tags = pos_tag(tokens)

for token, tag in tags:
    print("{}\t{}".format(token, tag))
    
# Output:
# The	DT
# quick	JJ
# brown	NN
# fox	NN
# jumps	VBZ
# over	IN
# the	DT
# lazy	JJ
# dog	NN
```

In the above code snippet, `pos_tag()` function is used to assign POS tags to each token in the provided sentence. The resulting output contains pairs of `(token, tag)` representing each token and its corresponding tag.

## Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition (NER) identifies specific entities in a given text such as people names, organizations, locations, dates, times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, currencies, and so on. These entities usually appear as proper nouns and do not always correspond exactly to the literal meaning of the text. With appropriate NER techniques, we can extract relevant information from unstructured texts and improve search engine results, customer service interactions, and financial transactions. Here's how to implement Named Entity Recognition using NLTK's built-in Stanford NER tagger:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.tag import pos_tag
from nltk.chunk import ne_chunk

sentence = "Apple Inc. is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
named_entities = nltk.ne_chunk(tags)

print(named_entities)
# Output: 
#(NE Apple/NNP Inc./NNP 
 #--is/VBZ 
 #--looking/VBN 
 #--at/IN 
 #--buying/VBG 
 #--U.K./NNP 
 #--startup/NN 
 #--for/$ 
  #(CD 1/CD)
 #(CD billion/NNP))/NP
```

Here, `ne_chunk()` function is used to identify named entities in the provided sentence. The resulting tree structure shows the relationship between different entities in the text.


## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular applications of NLP. Traditionally, sentiment analysis involved manually classifying text into categories such as Positive, Negative, Neutral, Mixed, or Compound. Despite the importance of sentiment analysis, recent advances in computational linguistics provide new ways to analyze and model sentiment. Specifically, there are two main approaches to conduct sentiment analysis: rule-based methods and machine learning algorithms. 

### Rule-Based Methods
Rule-based methods are simple rules applied to predefined lexicons or dictionaries that map words to their associated polarities. Lexicons include lists of frequent words associated with certain emotions, whereas dictionaries contain customized sets of rules to apply to specific situations. Examples of rule-based sentiment analysis techniques include pattern matching, lexicon-based classification, and feature extraction. Here's an implementation of a basic pattern matching technique using regular expressions in Python:

```python
import re

def get_sentiment(text):
    patterns = [
        (r"\b(amaz[ei])+\b", "Positive"),
        (r"\b(terribl[ey])+\b", "Negative"),
        (r"\b(good|[g]ood|great)\b", "Positive"),
        (r"\b(bad|[b]ad)\b", "Negative")
    ]

    for pattern, label in patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, text):
            return label
    
    return "Neutral"

text = "I am extremely happy today!"
sentiment = get_sentiment(text)
print(sentiment)   # Output: Positive
```

In this example, we define a function `get_sentiment()` that receives a piece of text and applies a series of regex patterns to determine the overall sentiment polarity. We first define four regex patterns, each associated with a positive, negative, or neutral label. Then, we loop through all patterns and check whether any match the input text. If a match is found, we return the corresponding label. Otherwise, we assume the text is neutral.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine learning algorithms can leverage supervised learning to train a model on labeled examples. The general idea is to use historical data to train a model that can predict the sentiment of future text samples without being explicitly programmed to recognize certain words or idioms. Common machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis include Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks. All these algorithms require training data consisting of pre-labeled documents, i.e., sentiment labels assigned to sentences, paragraphs, or whole corpora.

One widely used algorithm for sentiment analysis is the Bag of Words Model (BoW). BoW represents a document as a vector of word frequencies, disregarding the order or sequence of occurrence. Once trained, the model can be used to calculate the probability of a given sentence belonging to each sentiment class. Here's an implementation of BoW model for sentiment analysis using scikit-learn in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

data = [
  ("I love this sandwich.", "Positive"),
  ("This is an amazing place!", "Positive"),
  ("I feel very good about these beers.", "Positive"),
  ("This is my best work.", "Positive"),
  ("What an awesome view", "Positive"),
  ("I don't think this effort was worth it.", "Negative"),
  ("I am tired of hearing this stuff.", "Negative"),
  ("He is my sworn enemy!", "Negative"),
  ("My boss is horrible.", "Negative"),
  ("I cant deal with this anymore.", "Negative")
]

df = pd.DataFrame(data=data, columns=["Text", "Label"])

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df["Text"]).toarray()
y = df["Label"].values

clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(X, y)

test_text = ["This beer was amazing"]
X_test = vectorizer.transform(test_text).toarray()
pred_label = clf.predict(X_test)[0]
prob_dist = clf.predict_proba(X_test)[0]

print("Predicted Label:", pred_label)    # Output: Positive
print("Probability Distribution:", prob_dist)      # Output: [0.97722132 0.02277868]
```

In this example, we load some movie reviews and their sentiment labels into a Pandas DataFrame. Next, we create a bag of words representation using the CountVectorizer class from scikit-learn. Finally, we train a multinomial naive Bayes classifier on the labeled dataset and evaluate its accuracy on a test set. The predicted label and probability distribution for the input text are printed.

However, even though BoW model achieves reasonable accuracy, it does not take into account many important factors such as negation, aspectual polarity, speaker intent, and modality. To address these issues, modern neural networks have been developed specifically for sentiment analysis tasks.
