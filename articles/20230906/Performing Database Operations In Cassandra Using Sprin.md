# 1.简介
  

Apache Cassandra is an open-source distributed NoSQL database that provides high availability and scalability for large datasets. It's designed to handle a wide range of data types including complex nested structures such as JSON or XML documents, time series data, geospatial data, graph data models, etc., with high performance and low latency. 

In this article, we will see how to perform CRUD operations in Cassandra using Spring Boot and the Java driver. We'll also learn about some core concepts and terminology used in Cassandra databases.

Let's get started!

Prerequisites:

We assume that you are familiar with Spring Boot, Java programming language, RESTful APIs, and JSON objects. If not, please go through the following tutorials before proceeding further:

Before starting writing code, let's have a look at what it means to do CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Cassandra. 

# What Is CRUD?

CRUD stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete. These four basic operations are performed on most modern databases. They allow us to create new records, retrieve existing records, update existing records, and delete existing records from the database. 

To understand how these operations work in Cassandra, let's break them down into three main steps: 

1. Insertion 
2. Querying
3. Deletion

## Inserting Records

Insertion refers to adding new data into a table. When inserting a record into Cassandra, we need to provide values for all columns. Each row has a unique primary key which identifies its position in the table. Here's how to insert a new record in Cassandra:


```java
String query = "INSERT INTO my_keyspace.my_table(id, name, age, email) VALUES(?,?,?,?)";

PreparedStatement preparedStatement = session.prepare(query);

BoundStatement boundStatement = new BoundStatement(preparedStatement).bind("user1", "John Doe", 30, "johndoe@example.com");

session.execute(boundStatement);
```

Here, `my_keyspace` and `my_table` represent the name of our keyspace and table respectively. The first parameter of the `VALUES()` method represents the value of the id column. Other parameters represent the other columns of our table.

The `insert()` statement takes two arguments: the first argument is either a string representing the CQL statement itself, or a PreparedStatement object obtained via one of the prepare() methods on Session objects. The second argument specifies any bind variables associated with the statement; if provided, they must be passed alongside their corresponding bind values when executing the statement by calling the execute() method on Statement or BatchStatement instances. 

## Retrieving Records

Retrieval refers to retrieving data stored in a table based on certain criteria. Cassandra supports different querying techniques like select(), findById(), and simple queries. Let's take a look at each technique individually. 

### Selecting All Records From A Table

If we want to fetch all the records from a table, we can use the `select()` method on Session objects. This method returns a ResultSet object containing all rows in the specified table. Here's how to select all records from a table named `users`:

```java
ResultSet results = session.execute("SELECT * FROM users;");
for (Row row : results) {
    System.out.println(row.getString("name") + ", " + row.getInt("age"));
}
```

This code selects all columns (`*`) from the `users` table and iterates over the resulting rows, printing out the names and ages of each user. Note that if there are no matching rows, the ResultSet will be empty and nothing will happen inside the loop body.

### Finding A Record By ID

Sometimes, instead of selecting everything, we only want to fetch a single record based on its primary key. For example, if we have a `users` table with a `uuid` primary key, we might want to fetch information about a specific user given their UUID. Cassandra allows us to specify clustering keys for tables so that data can be queried more efficiently. Here's how to find a record by its ID:

```java
ResultSet result = session.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE uuid=c9cf11e0-07f2-11ec-b0a0-acde48001122;");
if (!result.isExhausted()) { // check if the ResultSet is exhausted (i.e., contains zero rows)
    Row row = result.one(); // retrieve the first row
    String name = row.getString("name");
    int age = row.getInt("age");
    // process the retrieved record here...
} else {
    // handle case where no matching record was found
}
```

This code retrieves the row with the specified UUID from the `users` table and checks whether there is exactly one matching row. If there is, it retrieves the name and age fields from the first row and stores them locally. Otherwise, it handles the case where no matching record was found.

### Simple Queries

Simple queries refer to SELECT statements that do not involve filtering or grouping clauses. In practice, these statements often include a WHERE clause specifying conditions that determine which rows should be returned. Here's an example of a simple query:

```java
ResultSet results = session.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30 AND gender='male';");
```

This code uses a filter condition to return only male users who are older than 30 years old. Note that this kind of query can be quite fast even for very large datasets because Cassandra uses indexes behind the scenes to quickly locate relevant rows. Also note that since simple queries don't support joins or subqueries, they may not always be as efficient as those with filters and projections. However, depending on your requirements, choosing between simple queries versus filtered and projected queries can depend on factors such as read vs write throughput, response times, and complexity of the queries.

## Updating Records

Updating involves modifying existing data in the database. There are several ways to update records in Cassandra, but let's start with a straightforward approach using the UPDATE statement:

```java
String query = "UPDATE my_keyspace.my_table SET age=? WHERE id=?";

PreparedStatement preparedStatement = session.prepare(query);

BoundStatement boundStatement = new BoundStatement(preparedStatement).bind(40, "user1");

session.execute(boundStatement);
```

This code updates the age field of a particular user whose ID matches "user1" to 40. Note that we're binding both parameters to the statement before execution, just like with inserts. Similarly to inserts, updating requires that we specify all columns and values explicitly.

## Deleting Records

Deletion removes data from the database. Here's how to delete a record from a table:

```java
String query = "DELETE FROM my_keyspace.my_table WHERE id=?";

PreparedStatement preparedStatement = session.prepare(query);

BoundStatement boundStatement = new BoundStatement(preparedStatement).bind("user1");

session.execute(boundStatement);
```

Again, we're binding the ID parameter to the statement before execution, similarly to the previous examples. After executing this statement, the row with ID="user1" will be deleted from the table. 

Now that we've covered the basics of performing CRUD operations in Cassandra, let's move on to exploring some important core concepts and terminology used in Cassandra databases.
