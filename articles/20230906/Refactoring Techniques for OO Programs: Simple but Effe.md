The code quality of object-oriented programs (OOPs) is often a delicate balance between maintainability and flexibility. Object-oriented programming has several design patterns that help developers create reusable components, increase modularity, and improve the extensibility of applications. However, these techniques can be challenging to implement in large-scale systems with complex architectures and tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code. This article explores some common refactoring techniques used by professional software engineers to improve the quality of object-oriented programs. We will cover four main areas: refactoring naming conventions; improving data encapsulation; using inheritance effectively; and refactoring loops and conditional statements. In each area, we will discuss what makes a good refactor, identify potential risks, and present recommended practices for implementing the refactors.
In this article, we assume the reader is familiar with basic concepts of object-oriented programming, such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, constructors, and polymorphism. Also, the reader should have a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals like algorithms, complexity analysis, and time and space complexity.
The purpose of this article is not to provide an exhaustive explanation of all refactoring techniques, nor does it attempt to explain how to use any particular technique correctly or avoid potential pitfalls. Instead, the focus is on providing practical guidance for applying various refactoring techniques when developing real-world systems. It is expected that readers who read this article would gain new insights into ways to improve the quality of their own object-oriented programs. Additionally, by sharing our experiences from refactoring, we hope to inspire other software professionals to adopt best practices for writing high-quality code, which leads to more efficient and maintainable software systems.
# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the details of refactoring techniques, let’s first review some fundamental concepts and terminology.

## 2.1 Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class consists of instance variables, methods, and constructor functions. The class specifies the state and behavior of an object and defines its interactions with other objects. When you define a class, you specify the types and order of its instance variables, the inputs required to construct an object, and the output produced by calling its methods. A class definition also includes access control information about the members of the class, such as whether they are public, protected, private, or package-private. 

## 2.2 Attribute
An attribute is a variable associated with an object. An attribute contains data specific to one instance of the class and represents a piece of knowledge about the object. For example, if you were building a car class, your attributes might include its make, model, year, color, and mileage. Each individual car object would have different values for those attributes. Attributes allow classes to store and manage data associated with objects efficiently, making them powerful tools for organizing and encapsulating related information.

## 2.3 Method
A method is a function belonging to a class that performs a specific task or action upon receiving input parameters. Methods modify the internal state of an object and return a value based on its current state or input parameters. They enable external entities to interact with the object and carry out tasks defined within the context of the class. For example, consider a Car class with a `drive()` method that takes a distance parameter as input and increases the car's mileage accordingly.

## 2.4 Constructor
A constructor is a special method called automatically whenever an object of a class is created. Constructors initialize the state of an object and set up its initial configuration before being used by other parts of the program. Constructors take zero or more arguments that are passed to the class during instantiation. For example, suppose you have a Person class with two attributes, name and age, and a no-argument constructor that initializes both attributes to default values ("Unknown" and -1). You could then create instances of the Person class like this:

```python
person = Person()   # creates a person named "Unknown" and age -1
```

Note that while there can be multiple constructors in a single class, only one of them can be declared with no arguments because it serves as the default constructor. If you need additional constructors, you must declare at least one of them explicitly without any argument list.

## 2.5 Inheritance
Inheritance allows us to reuse existing code by creating a subclass that inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass. Subclasses inherit the instance variables, methods, and constructor functions from their parent class(es), allowing us to extend the functionality of the base class. One important aspect of inheritance is the ability to override methods inherited from the parent class. By doing so, subclasses can customize the behavior of certain methods without affecting the behavior of other methods.

## 2.6 Polymorphism
Polymorphism refers to the concept where an object can take many forms depending on the context in which it is used. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism enables us to write generic code that works with objects of different types, instead of having separate blocks of code for each type. To achieve polymorphism, we typically use interfaces and abstract classes, which restrict the types of operations allowed on objects. Interface definitions define a set of methods that an object must support, and abstract classes define classes that cannot be instantiated directly, but may contain abstract methods that require implementation by concrete subclasses. Once implemented, polymorphic code can call methods on objects of different types, regardless of their actual runtime type.
