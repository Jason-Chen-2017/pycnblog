Gradient descent is one of the most popular optimization algorithms used in neural networks for training and optimizing weights and biases. It is a technique that finds the local minimum of a function by iteratively moving towards its direction of steepest decrease. In this article, we will go through step-by-step how gradient descent algorithm works on a simple example to get you started with understanding it better. We will also implement a more complex neural network using gradient descent as an optimizer in Python, and train it to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This tutorial is intended for people who are new to deep learning or machine learning and want to learn about basic concepts like gradient descent, backpropagation, loss functions, activation functions, weight initialization, and regularization techniques. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them below! Enjoy reading! 

In order to fully understand what gradient descent is and how it can be applied to neural networks, we need to first understand some basic concepts such as cost function, activation functions, forward propagation, backward propagation, and weight initialization. I hope after going through all these sections, you'll gain a deeper insight into gradient descent and how it can help us optimize our models faster and better than traditional methods.

# 2.概要 Introduction
Deep learning has revolutionized many fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and medical imaging. However, building high-performance neural networks requires expertise in various areas such as linear algebra, probability theory, numerical computing, and optimization techniques. Although there are many resources available online for learning these topics, it can still be challenging to learn and apply all the necessary knowledge at once. Therefore, in this article, we will focus solely on the basics of gradient descent and how it can be used to optimize neural networks efficiently. By the end of this article, you should be able to:

1. Understand the concept of gradient descent and its applications to neural networks.
2. Write code to implement gradient descent on a simple example and use it to train a neural network for binary classification on the MNIST dataset.
3. Apply gradient descent to other types of problems beyond regression and classification tasks.
4. Use knowledge gained from the article to build your own neural networks optimized using gradient descent.

Let’s get started! 

First, let's define some key terms and concepts before diving into the main topic of this article. 

## Key Terms and Concepts
### Cost Function
The cost function measures the error between the predicted output and the actual output of the model during training. The goal of training is to minimize the cost function by adjusting the parameters of the model until convergence occurs. There are different kinds of cost functions depending on whether we are dealing with a regression or classification problem. For regression problems, commonly used cost functions include mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). While for classification problems, common cost functions include cross entropy and hinge loss. Each cost function has its own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to performance. Hence, it is important to carefully select the appropriate cost function based on the type of problem being solved. 

### Activation Functions
Activation functions are crucial components of neural networks because they introduce non-linearity to the input signal and allow the network to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, tanh, softmax, and leaky ReLU. Leaky ReLU is a variant of ReLU where negative values are multiplied by a small factor instead of being set to zero. These activation functions work differently under different situations and may require fine tuning hyperparameters. 

### Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation
Forward propagation involves calculating the output of each layer given the input data. During forward propagation, the input data passes through the layers one by one, and the intermediate results are stored. Backward propagation involves finding the gradients of the cost function with respect to each parameter in the model. Gradients provide information about which directions to move in order to reduce the cost function and improve the accuracy of the model. 

### Weight Initialization
Weight initialization refers to initializing the weights of a neural network randomly so that the initial guesses don't result in an overly simplistic solution. One way to do this is to initialize weights close to zero, but not too close. Another option is to use techniques such as Xavier initialization or He initialization, which automatically scale the weights according to the number of inputs and hidden units. 

### Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques add a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes large weights, thus encouraging smaller, more efficient models. Some common regularization techniques include L1 regularization, L2 regularization, dropout, and batch normalization. Batch normalization helps stabilize the training process and improves generalization, while dropout removes random connections during training, preventing co-adaptation of neurons. Dropout can increase the stability of the model and reduce overfitting, making it an effective technique for reducing the risk of overtraining.
