# 1.简介
  

“Talk is cheap, show me the code.”在计算机科学界是一个经典的话语。它指的是把想法展示给别人，从而达成共识的方式有两种：要么直接上代码，要么通过技术文档。前者需要有丰富的编程技能，能够理解代码背后的逻辑和算法；后者则依赖于对相关领域的知识储备和理解力。本文试图通过分析技术博客文章的特点，阐述作者对读者期望、兴趣点、阅读目的、专业水平等方面的看法。
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
# 2.1 Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves various algorithms, models, and techniques for training machines with large amounts of data and extracting meaningful insights. There are several categories within machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. This article will focus on supervised learning, which involves using labeled data to train predictive models that can make accurate predictions based on new inputs.
# 2.2 Supervised Learning
Supervised learning refers to the task of inferring a function from labeled training examples, where the desired output for each example is provided. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs by emphasizing patterns that exist in the input-output pairs. Here's how it works:

1. Data collection: Collect a set of labeled input-output pairs (training dataset). Each pair consists of an input vector x and its corresponding output y. For example, if we're trying to classify images as "cat" or "dog", our training dataset might contain many pictures of cats, some pictures of dogs, and labels indicating whether they're a cat or dog.

2. Model definition: Choose a model class such as logistic regression or decision trees, and define its parameters, hyperparameters, etc. Hyperparameters control the complexity of the model and may need to be tuned during training.

3. Training phase: Feed the training dataset into the chosen model and adjust its parameters to minimize the error between predicted values and actual values. During this process, the model makes predictions on each input point and compares them to their true outcomes. The error between the predicted value and the actual value is used to measure how well the model performs and update its weights accordingly. 

4. Testing phase: Once the model has been trained, use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. Compare these predictions to the true outcomes to assess the accuracy of the model. If the accuracy is not satisfactory, retrain the model or adjust its hyperparameters until it achieves the required level of performance.
# 2.3 Loss Function
The loss function measures the difference between the predicted and actual values of a model. A common loss function for classification problems is cross-entropy, also known as logarithmic loss or negative log likelihood loss. Cross-entropy takes two probability distributions - one for the true outcome and another for the predicted outcome - and finds the average number of bits needed to identify the correct distribution. Mathematically, it looks like this:

L = −(ylog⁡(p) + (1−y)log⁡(1−p))

where L is the loss function, p is the predicted probability of the positive class, and y is the ground truth label (either 0 or 1). As you can see, cross-entropy penalizes incorrect predictions more heavily than ones that are close but still incorrect. Other commonly used losses include mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These functions measure the difference between the predicted and actual values in different ways, allowing us to tune the tradeoff between bias and variance.
