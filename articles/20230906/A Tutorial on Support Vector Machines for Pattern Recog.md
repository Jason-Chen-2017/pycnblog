# 1.简介
  

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a popular type of machine learning algorithm used in pattern recognition and classification problems. In this tutorial, we will discuss the basic concepts behind SVMs and present how to use them with code examples. We will also cover some advanced topics such as kernel functions, soft margins, and non-linearity support. Finally, we will talk about future trends and challenges related to SVMs.

In this article, we will focus on SVMs specifically for binary classification problems, where each instance can be labeled either positive or negative. The main objective is to learn a hyperplane that separates the two classes effectively by maximizing the margin between them. Our goal is not only to understand the theory but also to develop practical skills in applying SVM algorithms.

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
Before we dive into more technical details, let's start with a brief introduction to SVMs and its terminology. 

## 2.1 Overview
SVM stands for "support vector machine" and was introduced in 1990s by Vapnik and Chervonenkis. It is based on the idea of finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data points belonging to different classes. This means it helps us classify new instances into predefined categories while minimizing the error rate. Here's what makes SVM special compared to traditional ML models like logistic regression and neural networks: 

1. Effectiveness:

    SVM has been shown to perform well even with large datasets and complex decision boundaries. Traditional methods like logistic regression and neural networks often struggle with these cases due to computational complexity and overfitting.


2. Interpretability:

    SVM provides a visual interpretation of the model. Instead of trying to extract patterns from raw data, we can directly look at the final output produced by the algorithm which shows the direction of the separation boundary. This gives us insights into the nature of the problem and may help to identify any issues or errors early in the process.
    
    
Overall, SVMs are widely used for various applications such as image processing, text analysis, bioinformatics, and financial analysis.

## 2.2 Key Features
The fundamental idea behind SVMs lies in the existence of a hyperplane that separates the data points of different classes. Let's consider a simple example of a linearly separable dataset where both classes lie on a single line. If we were to draw a straight line perpendicular to this line that intersects both the classes, then our task would be relatively easy -- we just need to find the correct intersection point along the line. However, if the classes are not perfectly linearly separable, then this approach becomes much trickier.  

One way to address this issue is to allow some deviation from the straight line, thus creating a wider gap between the two sets of data points. Intuitively, we want to create a partition where the misclassification is smaller than the cost of misclassification on any individual training sample. To achieve this, we introduce two additional parameters called **margin** and **slack**. These terms correspond to the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point of either class. The larger the margin, the better the discrimination capacity of the classifier, whereas the smaller the slack variable allows the hyperplane to move farther away from the closest points and capture more difficult cases. 

Furthermore, there exist several ways to define the optimization objective function of an SVM algorithm depending on whether we want to maximize the margin width or minimize the number of support vectors. For now, we'll assume we're interested in achieving good accuracy and interpretability. 

Now that we've established the basics, let's take a deeper look at SVMs through mathematical formulation. 


# 3. Mathematical Formulation
To solve the problem of separating two classes, SVM constructs a hyperplane in high dimensional space to separate the data points. The hyperplane should satisfy two conditions:

 1. The hyperplane should correctly classify every data point within the margin.
 2. The hyperplane should provide maximum margin.

We aim to choose the hyperplane that satisfies both conditions. Given a set of input vectors $X$ and corresponding target values $y$, we optimize the following objective function subject to certain constraints:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{w}\|^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i \\
\text{subject to } y_i(\mathbf{w}\cdot x_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i \quad \forall i = 1,\cdots, n \\
\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \xi_i \geq 0
$$

where $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector, $b$ is the bias term, $\|\mathbf{w}\|$ represents the L2 norm of $\mathbf{w}$, $C$ controls the tradeoff between ensuring sufficient separation and achieving small misclassification error, $n$ denotes the number of samples, $x_i$ and $y_i$ represent the inputs and targets respectively, and $\xi_i$ is a slack variable constraining the degree of violation of constraint $(1)$ above. The optimizer searches for the values of $\mathbf{w}$, $b$ and $\xi_i$ that minimize the given objective function under the constraints.

In order to understand the role of each term in the objective function, we need to break down the optimization problem further. Firstly, the penalty term $\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{w}\|^2$ ensures that the solution stays on the correct side of the margin. Secondly, the loss term $C \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i$ enforces the tradeoff between minimizing the margin width and satisfying the constraint ($1$) without violating it. Lastly, the constraint $(2)$ guarantees that the margin is wide enough so that no individual data point is considered too close to the hyperplane. Hence, by adjusting the value of $C$, we can balance the two objectives mentioned earlier.

Let's consider the first part of the formula more closely. Using the definition of dot product, we can write $\|\mathbf{w}\|$ as $\sqrt{\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{w}}$ since $\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{w}$ always >= 0. Therefore, the square root of the dot product between $\mathbf{w}$ and itself tells us the length of $\mathbf{w}$. By minimizing this term, we ensure that the hyperplane remains within the margin. Next, let's see how the second part affects the result. Note that by relaxing the condition on the margin, we allow some deviation from the hyperplane. This creates a trade-off between keeping the hyperplane compact and limiting the amount of error allowed. Thus, setting $C$ appropriately determines how much flexibility we want to give the model. As mentioned earlier, the greater the value of $C$, the less strict the constraint on the margin. On the contrary, a lower value of $C$ means a tighter fit between the hyperplane and the data points, potentially leading to overfitting. 

Moving on to the third part of the formula, the constraint $(2)$ requires that for any data point $x_i$, the distance between the point and the hyperplane must be greater than $1-\xi_i$. This is achieved by subtracting $\xi_i$ from both sides of the inequality. Since $\xi_i$ cannot be negative, adding it back to the left side results in $y_i(\mathbf{w}\cdot x_i+b) \geq 1$. Setting this equal to zero yields the slope of the hyperplane equation, which defines the decision boundary. Overall, by solving the optimization problem, we obtain the optimal hyperplane that separates the two classes effectively.
