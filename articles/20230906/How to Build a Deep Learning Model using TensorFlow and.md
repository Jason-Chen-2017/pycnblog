# 1.简介
  

Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) technique that enables computers to learn from large amounts of data without being explicitly programmed. In this article, we will be building a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras library in Python language step-by-step guide. The goal of the project is to create a simple image classification model that can classify images into different categories such as animals, vehicles, etc., based on their features like color, shape, texture, etc. We will also train the model with our own dataset and evaluate its accuracy on unseen data sets.

In this article, you should have some prior knowledge about how to use Tensorflow and Keras libraries in Python. If you are new to these libraries, please refer to the official documentation first before proceeding further. This article assumes that readers have basic understanding of machine learning concepts like neural networks, backpropagation algorithm, loss functions, activation functions, etc.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
Before getting started, let’s understand few fundamental terms related to TensorFlow and Keras.

## Neural Network Architecture
A neural network architecture refers to the structure of a neural network. It typically consists of multiple layers interconnected between each other. Each layer has nodes or neurons that take input from previous layer(s) and produces output for next layer. There are several types of layers in a neural network, including Input Layer, Hidden Layers, Output Layer, Convolutional Layers, Pooling Layers, Recurrent Layers, Dropout Layers, Batch Normalization Layers, etc. 

The following diagram shows an example of a neural network architecture where there are three hidden layers connected to one input layer.


Each node in the neural network takes one or more inputs from the previous layer and computes an output value based on its weight values assigned during training. A weight is a numerical value that determines the strength of the connection between two nodes. As we feed forward the input through the network, weights adjust automatically to minimize error while maintaining generalization capability.

## Activation Function
An activation function is used at the end of every fully connected layer in a neural network to introduce non-linearity into the model. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid function, tanh function, rectified linear unit (ReLU), softmax function, exponential linear unit (ELU), leaky relu, ELU, and MaxOut. ReLU is most commonly used because it does not saturate when the input becomes negative. Other activation functions help the model learn complex relationships between variables in addition to smooth decision boundaries.

## Loss Function
Loss function measures the distance between the predicted output and the actual target output. When minimized, it helps us identify the parameters that give us the best fit among all possible parameter values. In supervised learning, we compare the predicted outputs against the true labels provided in the training set and calculate the difference between them. Different types of losses exist depending on the type of problem we are solving. For binary classification problems, we usually use cross entropy loss which represents the difference between the logarithm of probabilities of the positive class and the negative class. For multi-class classification problems, we use categorical cross-entropy which calculates the probability distribution across all classes and then compares the result with the ground truth label vector using a log likelihood function.

## Backpropagation Algorithm
Backpropagation algorithm is an optimization method used to update the weight values of the neural network during training process. At each iteration, the algorithm propagates the errors backwards through the network and updates the weights according to the gradient descent rule. The gradients represent the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to the weights. By updating the weights in reverse order, the network learns faster than traditional forward propagation algorithms due to less redundant computations.

## Gradient Descent Optimization Techniques
Gradient descent optimization techniques include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), mini-batch SGD, Adam optimizer, AdaGrad optimizer, RMSProp optimizer, Adadelta optimizer, etc. These methods work by iteratively moving towards the direction of steepest descent along the cost function surface. They use various strategies to adaptively control the speed and trajectory of the search process, reducing the chances of diverging or oscillating around local minima.

## Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques prevent overfitting of the model to the training data by adding additional constraints to the objective function. Common regularization techniques include L1 regularization, L2 regularization, dropout, early stopping, data augmentation, etc. L1 and L2 regularization add penalty term to the objective function that shrinks the absolute magnitude of the weights, allowing the model to generalize better to unseen data. Dropout randomly drops out some percentage of neurons during training to simulate a reduced capacity of the model. Early stopping stops the training process when the validation loss fails to improve after a certain number of epochs. Data augmentation generates new training samples by applying random transformations to existing ones, increasing the size of the training set.
