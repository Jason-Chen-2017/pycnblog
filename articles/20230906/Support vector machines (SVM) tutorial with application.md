# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this article we will explain the basic concepts behind SVMs, its working mechanism, how it performs in various situations, including text classification problems, and finally showcase an example application of SVMs on bioinformatics dataset. We hope that by going through this article you will have a clear understanding of what SVMs are, how they work, and why they are useful in certain fields such as bioinformatics.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the model is trained using labeled training data consisting of input features and corresponding output labels. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs based on known examples. 

In SVM, the input features are usually represented as vectors or matrices, while the output label is either “positive” or “negative.” 

Classification problem: SVM is used when the target variable has two possible outcomes (“Yes”/“No”, “True”/“False”, etc.) like binary classification problem. For instance, if we want to classify emails into spam or not-spam categories, then we would use binary classification SVM. 

Regression problem: SVM can also be used in regression problems where the target variable is continuous value such as predicting house prices. 

## Hyperplane 
A hyperplane is a flat curve in space that separates spaces into two parts. A hyperplane is one dimensional when it separates a plane into two parts; it can be visualized as lines, surfaces, or curves. It is typically described using the equation z = ax+b. 

In two-dimensional space, a hyperplane is often defined using a normal vector n which points outward from the boundary between the two classes. If x is any point inside the region defined by the hyperplane equation, then x can be assigned to one class if the sign of nx is positive, and assigned to another class otherwise.

The purpose of a hyperplane is to split the feature space into regions where each region belongs only to one class. The hyperplane with the maximum margin determines the decision boundary.

In higher dimensions, there may exist more than one hyperplane that perfectly separate the data into two classes, resulting in a complex decision boundary surface. However, in practice, SVM algorithms choose the most reliable hyperplane that fits the data closely, making them highly effective classifiers.

## Margin Maximization
Margin maximization refers to the process of selecting the best hyperplane among all possible ones that maximize the distance between the boundaries of different classes. This results in better separation between the classes and fewer errors during classification. 

To find the optimal hyperplane, we start by finding the line (hyperplane) that separates the data set into the largest number of classes. Next, we select the closest support vectors to this line, which form our margin boundary. Finally, we move along the direction perpendicular to the margin until we cross over a new support vector, creating a break in the margin boundary. At this point, we again update our margin by taking into account the newly formed gap and repeat the process until no further improvement can be made.

Once the margin boundary is chosen, we can easily assign new instances to their respective classes by computing their inner product with the normal vector of the hyperplane. If the result is greater than zero, then the instance belongs to one class, otherwise, it belongs to the other class.

## Support Vector
A support vector is a sample that lies within the margin of the hyperplane but does not lie on the boundary itself. These samples help define the desired margin around the hyperplane and act as the foundation for building the decision boundary. SVM uses these support vectors to construct the final decision boundary after performing margin maximization.

When SVM works well, the majority of the data points are support vectors and the rest are outside the margin boundary. Outside the margin boundary, the predicted values do not depend much on the input variables. As long as the support vectors are properly positioned, SVM can achieve high accuracy without being too sensitive to irrelevant features.

## Kernel Functions
Kernel functions allow us to map nonlinear relationships between input features into linearly separable hyperplanes. Kernel functions come in several forms, some of which are commonly used in SVM. 

1. Polynomial kernel: The polynomial kernel takes the dot product of the input vectors with a weight matrix W and returns k(x,y)=`(gamma*x^T y + coef0)^degree`.

2. Radial basis function (RBF): RBF kernel takes the Euclidean distance between the input vectors `x` and `y`, applies a Gaussian function, multiplies it by a parameter gamma, and adds a bias term `coef0`: `k(x,y)=exp(-gamma||x-y||^2)`

3. Sigmoid kernel: sigmoid kernel takes the dot product of the input vectors with a weight matrix W and applies the logistic function element-wise: `k(x,y)=tanh(gamma*(x^T y + coef0))`

Using kernel functions allows us to solve non-linearly separable problems by transforming the original input space into a higher dimensionality space where the data becomes linearly separable. While traditional SVM works well with relatively small datasets, kernel methods offer significant advantages when dealing with large and complex datasets.
