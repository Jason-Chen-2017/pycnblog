# 1.简介
  

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on training agents to perform complex tasks by interacting with an environment and receiving reward signals based on their actions. The most popular application of DRL is in playing video games like Atari or the classic game of Go. In this tutorial, we will use deep Q-network algorithm called Double DQN, which has proven its effectiveness in solving many real-world problems, such as computer games. We will also implement some advanced techniques for improving performance such as prioritized experience replay and dueling networks. Finally, we will evaluate our agent's performance using common evaluation metrics like average return, success rate, and episodic length. This article assumes that readers have basic knowledge about reinforcement learning algorithms and are familiar with Python programming language. If you need any clarification, please let me know!

2.环境依赖
This tutorial uses OpenAI Gym library, which provides pre-built environments for testing RL algorithms. You can install it by running the following command: 

```bash
pip install gym
```

We will also use Pytorch library for implementing neural network models and data processing pipelines. Please make sure you have installed both libraries before proceeding further. 

3.关于本教程的目标读者
This tutorial is intended for intermediate-level developers who want to learn how to apply deep Q-learning algorithm to solve challenging real-world problems. It requires at least a basic understanding of reinforcement learning concepts and terminology, familiarity with Python programming language and machine learning libraries like Pytorch. Some knowledge of deep neural networks and Q-networks would be beneficial but not necessary. For people who already have good skills in these areas, they should find everything else easy enough to understand.
