## 2.1 Neural Networks
In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts published their “Perceptron” model which was one of the earliest neural networks based on threshold logic gates. The work followed by Minsky and Papert gave birth to the famous “Hopfield Network”, which learned complex patterns over time through unsupervised training. Later on, Hebbian-based learning rule was introduced alongside the Backpropagation algorithm for solving supervised classification problems using neural networks. The importance of neural networks increased exponentially in the following decades, as they were able to perform tasks such as image recognition and speech recognition. However, they still suffered from several limitations including vanishing gradients, slow convergence speed and no theoretical justification of how they worked. As a result, various alternative models were proposed and emerged in the past few years, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, etc. These models allowed deep learning to achieve impressive performance on many challenging tasks, such as object detection, natural language processing, speech recognition, and game playing. Despite these advances, there is still much room for improvement in terms of efficiency and computational resources required for large scale applications. 

## 2.2 Reinforcement Learning 
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent interacts with its environment and learns to select actions based on rewards and penalties. It works by repeatedly interacting with the environment until it reaches a goal state, at which point it stops learning. RL algorithms often use deep neural networks to represent the agent’s decision-making process. The most popular class of RL algorithms includes Q-learning, actor-critic methods, policy gradient methods, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). These algorithms can tackle a wide range of problems, including robotics, games, healthcare, finance, and trading. While DRL offers significant improvements over traditional RL algorithms, they require specialized hardware and expertise, making them hard to deploy in real-world applications. 

In conclusion, while there is still much to explore in the realm of AI algorithms, recent progress highlights the need for efficient and accurate techniques that combine powerful mathematical tools with practical implementation constraints. By introducing fundamental concepts, defining terminology, reviewing cutting-edge research, and demonstrating concrete code examples, this article provides a comprehensive look into what AI can do today and how it might evolve in the future.

## 3.1 What Is a Neural Network?
A neural network is a set of interconnected nodes that are designed to recognize patterns within data and make predictions or decisions. Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected neurons, where each neuron receives input from other neurons in the previous layer, passes the information through activation functions, and then produces output for the next layer. Neurons in later layers typically take multiple inputs from earlier layers to produce complex outputs. 

## 3.2 Types of Neural Networks
1. Perceptrons: Introduced by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943, perceptrons are the simplest form of neural networks that consists of only one hidden layer consisting of binary weighted summation units called "neurons". Each neuron takes multiple inputs, sums them up with weights, applies an activation function like sigmoid, and finally gives out the final output value. This simple structure makes them very intuitive to understand and implement but can't handle non-linearity well due to the limit on number of possible connections between neurons. 

2. Multilayer Perceptrons: Developed by Rosenblatt in 1957, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are a generalization of perceptrons, allowing for multiple hidden layers. MLPs allow us to express non-linear relationships between input features and the target variable by adding additional layers of neurons that learn to extract higher level features from the lower levels. They are widely used in modern computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing tasks.

3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNNs are a special type of neural network specifically designed for handling visual imagery. They exploit the spatial nature of images by applying filters to local regions of the input image instead of individual pixels. This allows the network to identify relevant patterns and relationships throughout the entire image without relying solely on single pixel comparisons. Popular architectures include LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, etc., and they have achieved high accuracy on various image recognition tasks. 

4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): RNNs are a type of neural network inspired by the sequential behavior of natural languages and text. RNNs apply the same weight updates to all elements in the sequence simultaneously, enabling them to maintain contextual information over time. One of the most popular types of RNNs is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cell, which is capable of capturing longer term dependencies in sequences. Applications of RNNs include music generation, speech recognition, translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering. 

5. Autoencoders: An autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture that comprises of encoder and decoder components. The purpose of the autoencoder is to compress the input data and generate the output data in the exact same format as the input data. Autoencoders are commonly used in image compression, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. 

## 3.3 Key Techniques in Neural Networks
1. Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is a method used to minimize the error in the output predicted by the neural network during training. During backpropagation, the errors are propagated backwards through the network to adjust the weights and biases of each neuron. Weights and biases are adjusted iteratively to reduce the error and improve the prediction accuracy. Gradient descent is applied to train the weights and biases of the neural network by minimizing the loss function between actual and predicted values. There are several variants of gradient descent, including stochastic gradient descent, mini batch gradient descent, momentum, and adagrad.

2. Dropout Regularization: Dropout regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting of the neural network. During training, some percentage of the neurons in each layer are randomly dropped out, effectively eliminating their contribution to the overall output. This helps prevent the neural network from memorizing specific samples and can lead to better generalization performance.

3. Batch Normalization: Batch normalization is another technique used to normalize the input data to accelerate the convergence of the neural network. The idea behind batch normalization is to center and scale the input data so that it has zero mean and unit variance across each feature. This helps avoid vanishing/exploding gradients problem, improves model stability, and reduces the chance of saturation.

## 3.4 How Does a Neural Network Learn?
The primary objective of training a neural network is to modify the parameters of the neurons in order to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the true output. This involves updating the weights and biases of the neurons in the network according to the error made by the prediction. Different strategies are employed to update the parameters depending on the problem being solved. Here's a breakdown of common optimization strategies:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent: SGD stands for stochastic gradient descent, which involves computing the gradient of the cost function on a subset of the training data rather than the whole dataset at once. The subset of data is sampled randomly and updated using the computed gradient.

2. Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Mini-batch GD is similar to standard GD but uses batches of samples instead of the full dataset. Batches are subsets of the training data that are processed sequentially and updated after each iteration.

3. Momentum: Momentum adds an acceleration parameter to the velocity vector associated with each weight. When two consecutive steps of gradient descent move towards opposite directions, momentum can help avoid oscillations and dramatically improve the rate of convergence.

4. Adagrad: Adagrad is a variation of SGD that adaptively scales the learning rates for different weights based on their historical gradients. The effectiveness of AdaGrad depends on the ratio of the magnitude of the gradients to their accumulation in the denominator of the adaptive scaling factor.

## 3.5 Challenges in Neural Networks 
1. Vanishing Gradients Problem: In deep neural networks, vanishing gradients occur when the gradients get smaller and smaller as the weights pass through deeper layers. This results in slower convergence and poor performance. To address this issue, we can add skip connections between layers, increase the size of the network, use dropout regularization, and use techniques like batch normalizations.

2. Exploding Gradients Problem: The exploding gradients problem occurs when the gradients grow bigger and bigger as the weights pass through deeper layers. This happens especially when the initial weights are close to zero. Common ways to address this issue are initialization schemes, gradient clipping, and gradient noise. 

3. Computational Cost: Deep neural networks require significant amounts of computation power to train and run efficiently. This means that cloud-based platforms like Amazon AWS are not suitable for running these models in real-time. Instead, there are dedicated hardware platforms like NVIDIA GPUs and TPUs available that can significantly speed up the training process.
