# 1.简介
  

Chatbots or conversational agents are one of the most interesting and innovative technologies that have emerged over the past few years. They help people interact with machines as if they were human beings and can provide a lot of value by answering their questions or taking care of tasks that need automation. However, building a chatbot from scratch requires expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, and integrating APIs for data access and processing. In this article, we will show you how to build your own chatbot using Dialogflow API and Rasa Stack.

Rasa is an open-source software framework for building assistants and chatbots on top of AI frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, and scikit learn. It provides tools such as dialogue management, natural language understanding, and integration with messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, and WhatsApp. We will also use Google Cloud Platform's Dialogflow API which is used for creating natural language conversation models, intent recognition, entity extraction, and response generation. 

In summary, we will create a simple chatbot application that allows users to ask about current weather information based on user input. The tutorial will include installation instructions, step-by-step guidance, sample code snippets, and deployment details. Let’s get started! 

# 2.相关技术概念
To understand what a chatbot is and why it’s useful, let’s briefly review some related technology concepts:

1. Conversational User Interface (CUI): A CUI is a type of interface where the system communicates with the user through text-based speech or typing. Examples of CUI systems include phone calls, SMS messages, web chat interfaces, and virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Cortana. 

2. Natural Language Understanding (NLU): NLU refers to the process of extracting meaning from human language. This involves identifying words, phrases, and sentences that represent the underlying concept(s). To perform NLU, chatbots leverage machine learning algorithms such as statistical analysis, pattern matching, and deep learning techniques. For example, AWS Lex provides a fully managed NLU service that makes it easy to build natural language understanding into applications. 

3. Dialog Management System: A dialog management system is responsible for handling conversations between the user and the chatbot. It keeps track of the context and state of each conversation, ensuring that responses are relevant and personalized. There are many types of dialog management systems, including rule-based systems, statistical systems, and neural networks. 

4. Machine Learning Algorithms: Chatbots rely heavily on machine learning algorithms for natural language understanding and other capabilities. These algorithms use labeled training data to train themselves to recognize patterns and extract meaningful features from unstructured text data. Popular machine learning algorithms include support vector machines, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. 

5. Deep Learning Frameworks: Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras allow developers to implement complex artificial intelligence algorithms without worrying too much about low-level implementation details. These frameworks make it possible to build sophisticated machine learning models at scale. 

6. APIs for Data Access and Processing: Most modern chatbot architectures involve interfacing with various external services and databases to store and retrieve data. To handle these requirements, chatbots often integrate with RESTful APIs provided by external providers. 

Now that we know what a chatbot is, let’s move on to building our own chatbot application using Rasa and Dialogflow. 

# 3. Building Our Chatbot Application

Before getting started, you should ensure that you have the following dependencies installed before continuing:

- Python version >= 3.6
- pipenv package manager 
- GCloud CLI installed and configured properly

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Set up a new project directory for your chatbot app: `mkdir mychatbot` 
2. Initialize the virtual environment and install all required packages using pipenv: `pipenv --python=3.7 && pipenv install rasa_sdk google-cloud-dialogflow`
3. Create a new file called `app.py` inside your project directory and add the following imports:

``` python
from flask import Flask, request
import logging

from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.forms import FormAction


logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

4. Next, define a basic class named `WeatherForm` that inherits from `FormAction`:

``` python
class WeatherForm(FormAction):
    def name(self):
        return "weather_form"

    @staticmethod
    def required_slots(_tracker: Tracker) -> list:
        return ["city"]
```

5. Now, define two actions that inherit from `Action`. One action should fetch the weather forecast given the city entered by the user, while another action should say something helpful when the user inputs invalid input:

``` python
class FetchWeatherForecast(Action):
    def name(self):
        return "action_fetch_weather_forecast"
    
    async def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: dict):
        
        # Get the slot values
        location = tracker.get_slot("city")

        try:
            url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={location}&appid=<YOUR OPENWEATHERMAP APPID>"
            response = requests.get(url)

            # Parse JSON data
            data = json.loads(response.text)
            
            # Extract temperature and humidity info
            temp = round(float(data["main"]["temp"]) - 273.15, 1)   # convert Kelvin to Celsius
            humidity = data["main"]["humidity"]

            # Format output message
            message = f"{location} weather today is {temp}°C with {humidity}% humidity."
            
            logger.info(f"Sending message: '{message}'")
            
            await dispatcher.utter_message(text=message)
            
        except Exception as e:
            error_msg = str(e)
            logger.error(f"Error fetching weather forecast for {location}. Error Message: {error_msg}")
            await dispatcher.utter_message(text="Sorry, I couldn't find any weather data for that location.")
            
        return []
        
class HandleInvalidInput(Action):
    def name(self):
        return "action_handle_invalid_input"
        
    async def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: dict):
        utterance = tracker.latest_message.get('text')
        logger.info(f"Received utterance: '{utterance}'. Replaying prompt...")
        
        await dispatcher.utter_template('utter_ask_for_city', tracker)
        return [SlotSet("city", None)]
```

6. Finally, create a configuration file called `config.yml` inside your project directory and paste the following contents:

``` yml
language: "en"

pipeline:
  - name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  - name: "RegexFeaturizer"
  - name: "CRFEntityExtractor"
  - name: "DucklingEntityExtractor"
  - name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
  - name: "EmbeddingIntentClassifier"

policies:
  - name: MemoizationPolicy
  - name: TEDPolicy
    epochs: 100

endpoints:
  nlu:
  - url: http://localhost:5055/webhook
```

Make sure to replace `<YOUR OPENWEATHERMAP APPID>` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. Note that the endpoints section defines the URL of the HTTP endpoint that will receive incoming messages from the chatbot. Currently, this URL points to the local server running within the same process. If you want to deploy your chatbot, you'll need to set up a separate HTTP server for it. 

7. Start the bot using the command: `pipenv run start`, which starts the HTTP server and initializes the pipeline components defined in `config.yml`. You should see log messages indicating successful initialization.

8. Test the bot by sending the message "What's the weather today?" and entering a valid city name like "London". After a short delay, the bot should respond with the weather forecast for the specified location.
