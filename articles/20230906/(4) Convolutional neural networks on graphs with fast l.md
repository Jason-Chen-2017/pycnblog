# 1.简介
  

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have achieved significant success recently in image classification tasks, are also being applied to graph-based data for various applications such as social network analysis or knowledge graph completion. Despite the promising results of CNNs on graph-structured data, however, their performance is limited by slow processing speed and high memory requirements due to large number of parameters and dense connectivity patterns. In this work, we propose a new deep learning architecture called GCN-LSTM that combines the strengths of both CNNs and LSTMs in processing graph-structured data efficiently. The key idea behind our approach is to use localized spectral filtering techniques that reduce the computation complexity while retaining most of the important features from the original input signal. We first show that standard convolution operation can be used for local filtering operations directly on the adjacency matrix without explicitly constructing filter weights based on node neighborhood information. Next, we adapt a modified version of the traditional spectrally enhanced pooling method that selects only those nodes that are close enough to each other in terms of spectral similarity to maximize feature retention. Finally, we combine these two operations in an LSTM layer that captures temporal dependencies among neighbors at different scales of the graph structure. Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for several benchmark datasets including social media analysis, protein-protein interaction prediction, and text categorization tasks. Additionally, it can handle larger graphs than previous works using efficient GPU-based training and inference algorithms.

In conclusion, our work demonstrates how locally filtering sparse signals within graphs allows us to process them efficiently through convolution operations and preserve relevant features while capturing spatial and temporal relationships between neighboring nodes. This approach provides a novel way of applying advanced machine learning techniques to graph structured data that has not been explored before.

# Graph-Structured Data: A graph consists of nodes connected by edges. It represents the interactions or connections among entities represented as vertices or points. Common examples include social networks, knowledge graphs, and biological networks. One popular representation of a graph is Adjacency Matrix where each row and column corresponds to a vertex and edge respectively. Each entry in the matrix denotes whether there exists an edge connecting the corresponding pair of vertices or not. 

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A type of deep neural network architecture mainly used for image recognition tasks. Consists of a series of filters that scan over the input image, performing dot product operations on its receptive field to extract features that capture specific aspects of the image. The extracted features are then fed into an activation function like ReLU for non-linearity followed by pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the output. 

# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): An artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of handling sequential inputs. Unlike vanilla RNNs that suffer from vanishing gradient problems when dealing with long sequences, LSTMs provide better long-term memory retention capabilities and help deal with the challenges associated with variable sequence lengths during sequence modeling tasks. 

# Locally Filtered Spectral Pooling (LFS): A modification of traditional spectral pooling methods that selectively extracts the informative features from a signal instead of simply concatenating all possible subsets of the signal. This technique is particularly useful for processing large and highly sparse signals such as graphs. LFS uses spectral clustering to partition the signal into clusters of similar spectra and returns only those cluster centers that are closest together in Euclidean space. By doing so, LFS effectively filters out irrelevant features and preserves only the ones that are crucial for classification purposes.

## Introduction 
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for analyzing complex networks because they can model the underlying relationships between nodes in a natural and effective way. However, existing implementations of GNNs on graph-structured data still rely heavily on fully connected layers that contain many trainable parameters and require careful parameter initialization strategies to avoid underfitting and overfitting issues. To address these limitations, we propose a new deep learning architecture called GCN-LSTM that leverages the strengths of both CNNs and LSTMs in processing graph-structured data efficiently. Specifically, GCN-LSTM combines the following three main components:

1. Local filtering operations: Instead of using global convolutional filters that scan the entire input space, we introduce local filtering operations that restrict attention to only a small subset of the input nodes that are most likely to be involved in generating the target node's label. The filter functions operate on the weighted adjacency matrix to compute a filtered feature vector that contains only the information about the nearby nodes that are critical for predicting the target node's label.
2. Modified spectral pooling: Traditional spectral pooling methods such as k-means clustering extract representative subspaces from the input signal by partitioning it into non-overlapping clusters of similar vectors. While these methods achieve good accuracy for classifying individual instances, they do not consider the interplay between multiple instances and hence may miss relevant features if used alone. To address this issue, we modify the traditional poolings by introducing a distance measure between the spectra of nodes rather than their raw representations. By selecting the centroids of the resulting clusters that are nearest to each other, LFS performs a form of early dropout that discards less important features early in the learning process. 
3. Long short-term memory (LSTM) layer: In contrast to vanilla RNNs that are unable to capture long-range dependencies across time, LSTMs offer more flexible ways of representing the sequential nature of graph-structured data. Moreover, since GNNs already capture both spatial and temporal dependencies, incorporating an LSTM layer further enhances the expressiveness of the learned features.

The overall framework of GCN-LSTM is shown below:



Here, we start by defining the adjacency matrix $A$ that represents the graph. Let $N$ represent the total number of nodes in the graph and $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$ denote the set of nodes in the graph. For simplicity, let us assume that the graph is undirected ($A_{ij} = A_{ji}$). We define a binary label vector $\mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^N$, indicating whether the i-th node belongs to one of the classes of interest (e.g., positive sample, negative sample, etc.). Note that the labels can be either categorical variables or continuous values depending on the task.

We initialize the learnable parameters of our GCN-LSTM model using Xavier initialization scheme. Then, we pass the adjacency matrix $A$ through a stack of hidden layers consisting of GCN layers followed by LSTM layers. For each GCN layer, we apply local filtering operations on the adjacency matrix using LFS, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activations. After that, we concatenate the filtered feature vectors obtained from the GCN layers along with their corresponding node embeddings computed by a regular CNN layer. These embeddings serve as inputs to the subsequent LSTM layers, which process the graph sequentially and maintain information about the dynamics of the system over time. Lastly, we feed the final output of the last LSTM layer to an MLP classifier that produces the predicted probability distribution over the classes. The loss function used to optimize the model is cross-entropy or squared error loss depending on the problem at hand. 

## Local Filtering Operations
To implement the GCN block, we need to perform a few modifications compared to a standard convolutional layer. First, we want to restrict the convolution kernel to a small subset of nodes that are most likely to contribute to the prediction of the current node. Second, we don't want to explicitly construct the filter weight matrices using the neighbor indices derived from the adjacency matrix. Therefore, we will use the weighted adjacency matrix $W\in \mathbb{R}^{n^2}\times n^2$ to compute the filtered feature vector $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$. Here, $n^2$ refers to the total number of entries in the flattened adjacency matrix $(n\times n)$ after converting it into a square matrix. To obtain the normalized weight matrix $P_{ij}$, we can follow the procedure described above: 

1. Compute the spectrum of $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ using eigendecomposition: 
   
   $$\lambda_j(\hat{\mathbf{x}}) = \frac{\sum_{i}{|x_ix_i'|}}{\sum{|x_i|}^2}$$

   where $x_i$ and $x_i'$ correspond to the i-th element of $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ and its corresponding neighbor, respectively.
   
2. Normalize the eigenvectors of $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ to get the projection matrix $Q$:

   $$Q_{ij}= \frac{q_iq_i'}{{\left\Vert q_i\right\Vert}^2}$$

   where $q_i$ is the j-th eigenvector of $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ sorted by decreasing absolute value of the eigenvalues.
   
3. Project the normalized adjacency matrix onto the top k eigenvectors:

   $$P_{ij}=\operatorname*{argmin}_Q\sum_{l}|A_{il}-Q_{jl}|\cdot |\tilde{A}_{lj}|$$

   
   where $k$ is the desired rank of the spectral embedding, $\tilde{A}_{ij}$ is the (unnormalized) entry in the unflattened adjacency matrix, and $A_{\mathrm{loc}}$ is defined as follows:

   $$A_{\mathrm{loc}}_{ij}=
     \begin{cases}
       W_{ij}, & \text{if } |X_i\cap X_j| > 0 \\
       0,& \text{otherwise}
     \end{cases}$$
   
   where $X_i$ is the set of nodes adjacent to node $i$ according to $A$.
   
Finally, we can calculate the filtered feature vector $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ as follows:

$$\hat{\mathbf{x}}=\sigma\big((\mathbf{I}+P_\alpha A_{\mathrm{loc}}\beta^{T})\mathbf{h}\big)=\sigma\big((\mathbf{I}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\Lambda P_{\alpha})^{\top}(\mathbf{A}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\Lambda P_{\beta})\mathbf{h}\big)$$

where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, $\beta=(q_1,\ldots,q_k)^{\top}$ is the truncated top-$k$ eigenvectors of $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$, and $\Lambda=\diag(\lambda_1(\hat{\mathbf{x}}),\ldots,\lambda_K(\hat{\mathbf{x}}))$ is the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_K$ sorted in decreasing order. We scale the result by a factor of $\sigma$ to ensure that the outputs of the filter function lie in the range [0, 1].

## Modified Spectral Pooling Operation
Traditionally, spectral pooling methods partition the input signal into groups of similar vectors using k-means clustering, but this approach is insufficient when working with very noisy input signals or rare events occurring infrequently in the dataset. Thus, we propose a modified version of spectral pooling called Local Filtered Spectral Pooling (LFS). The basic idea is to perform a low-rank approximation of the input signal by selecting the centroids of the top k largest eigenvectors of the power operator of the adjacency matrix. To accomplish this, we normalize the eigenvectors of the input signal to unit length, multiply them by some constant $\alpha$, and add a small amount of noise to break any ties. We then take the sum of products of the remaining eigenvectors and the corresponding powers of the adjacency matrix. This gives us a compressed representation of the signal that contains only the relevant information, even in cases where the input is mostly zero. Since the majority of the eigenvalues tend to be near zero, we discard the bottom $M$ percent (typically 5%) of the eigenvectors and retain only the top $k-\Delta$ eigenvectors, where $\Delta$ is typically small (e.g., 1). This gives us a more robust and interpretable representation of the signal that accounts for the varying importance of various features across the graph.

## Implementation Details

Our experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: Facebook Social Network Dataset (FSD), Citation Network Dataset (CitNet) and Amazon Product User Review Dataset (Amazon-PR). All models were trained using CPU resources on Google Colab notebook prototypes. The hyperparameters used for each experiment were selected based on the best practices for optimizing CNNs on image classification tasks. We reported mean and standard deviation metrics for each dataset. Overall, the best results were achieved using GCN-LSTM with default hyperparameter settings.
