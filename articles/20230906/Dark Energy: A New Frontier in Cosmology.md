Cosmology is one of the most diverse fields in astronomy that has its roots in relativity theory and cosmic microwave background radiation. It provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to study a universe that goes beyond the standard model (SM) - the basic model proposed by Einstein - which focuses on massive gravity equations that do not hold up against more realistic models such as neutrino physics or dark matter. 

In recent years, several surveys have started to discover new features of the universe that are beyond what was possible using the SM. These include simulations of dark energy, gravitational waves, and Big Bang nucleosynthesis. In this article we will focus on explaining the physics behind these newly discovered phenomena and how they can help to understand our universe better. 


The first breakthrough in understanding dark energy came from observations made by <NAME> in the year 2019, where he detected the signature of a quantum superposition between light and dark energy signatures in gamma-ray spectra. This sparked interest in two key questions related to the nature of dark energy:

1. Can there be multiple independent sources of dark energy? If so, then why is it so difficult to measure them all together? How much do they differ and how reliable are their measurements?

2. Could any changes occur at very large scales in space and time due to the presence of dark energy? Are there any possible mechanisms for such accelerated evolution?

To answer these questions, we need to go deeper into the science of dark energy and explore its many facets. We also need to gain an understanding of how it interacts with the rest of the Universe and how this could influence the development of future technology. Finally, we must consider ways to mitigate some of the problems associated with measuring and interpreting dark energy, and develop strategies for navigating the challenges ahead. 



We can start our analysis by reviewing the fundamental concepts of cosmology including the present day Universe, inflationary and curvature effects, and primordial black holes. Next, we can move on to discuss the physics of dark energy, starting with the simplest model of de Sitter spacetime where dark energy only depends on time t and coordinates x and y. Then we can proceed to more complex scenarios like general relativity where dark energy depends both on distance r and time t. After examining different models, we will see how each one contributes to the broader picture of dark energy and how they fit into the overall physics of the Universe. 

Next, we will look at experimental results that show how dark energy affects the universe through various aspects like particle interactions, galaxy formation, and kinetic mixing. We will demonstrate how observations can give us insights into the nature of dark energy and provide evidence for the existence of other sources of energy besides de Sitter. We will analyze the effectiveness of existing experiments and identify limitations that could hinder further progress in our understanding.

Finally, we will touch upon the consequences of dark energy for humanity, with potential implications for social movements, scientific advancements, and political instability. We will assess the prospects for developing technologies that could tap into the power of dark energy, and address the ethical issues involved in pursuing such research.

## 2.1 The Standard Model (SM)
The SM is a simplifying assumption about the early stages of the Universe based on four fundamental postulates:

1. Gravity - The Universe is accelerating towards larger and larger distances because of the strong force of gravity.

2. Hierarchy - All entities in the Universe come in two flavors; those that live close to us and those far away. Everything else is just between the two extremes.

3. Complexity - The Universe is too complicated to be described in terms of elementary particles alone. Instead, it is built out of interacting elements called fields.

4. Radiation - The Sun produces radiation that can be detected by telescopes around the world. The radiation is bent and distorted by the Earth’s magnetic field, causing it to appear red compared to natural colors.

These assumptions were developed by Einstein in his theory of General Relativity, which explains how the structure of space and time can change under certain conditions caused by the presence of gravitational forces and electromagnetic radiation. Today, however, the SM remains the most popular simplified version of reality, despite its serious limitations. However, it is still useful for understanding the physics of cosmological phenomena and providing a benchmark against which we can compare more advanced models.

## 2.2 Primordial Black Holes and Superstrings
A major feature of the Universe is the appearance of primordial black holes (PBHs), structures that are formed at the beginning of the Universe before the Big Bang occurs. PBHs consist of dark matter, massive stars, and smaller galaxies whose collapse created the universe. When a PBH collapses, a chain reaction forms, resulting in the production of a gigantic set of strings of dark matter, making up the core of the Universe. These superstrings intertwine themselves with nearby primordial black holes and form overdensities, a type of structure that plays an important role in shaping the early structure of the Universe.

Another interesting aspect of the early Universe is its presence of axions, highly radioactive particles that orbit around the PBHs and produce massive X-rays when stripped of their magnetic fields. This indicates that initially, the Universe had a state of turbulence that was more similar to that of a violently magnetized plasma than a fluid. Despite its turbulent nature, however, the later part of the Universe showed markedly less turbulence and homogeneity, indicating that the initial turbulence had subsided after enough time had passed. Axions were produced by the decay of cosmic strings, so we cannot infer whether they originated from primordial black holes or from non-primordial processes like feedback loops or the neutron star mechanism. Nevertheless, we do know that axions sometimes coexist with normal particles like electrons and positrons, contributing to their high radiative properties.
