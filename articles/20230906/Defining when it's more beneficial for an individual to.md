Product Managers (PMs) are responsible for leading product development efforts at various stages throughout the lifecycle of software development: requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and support. However, there is often confusion between product managers who manage entire product teams or those who focus on specific parts of the process such as engineering or quality assurance. This article will provide some background information about what constitutes a PM and how they perform these various functions across a range of companies and industries. We will then discuss how having multiple roles within a single function can help optimize your product manager’s performance at all levels of the product development lifecycle while remaining relevant and accountable for the overall success of the company. Finally, we'll touch on ways you can measure if this approach has had positive impacts on your organizational efficiency and effectiveness, and considerations you should make before making changes to your current team structure.
# 2.什么是产品经理(PM)?
A product manager is an individual tasked with ensuring the successful implementation of high-quality digital products and services. They play a crucial role in shaping business strategy, defining product roadmaps, prioritizing feature requests, monitoring progress, and providing feedback to stakeholders. Product managers work closely with engineers, designers, researchers, and others involved in developing the product, including clients, partners, and users. 

Product managers typically lead one or more product development teams, working together to ensure that features, functionality, and customer needs are met according to timelines and budgetary constraints. Their primary goal is to improve the end-user experience through the creation of beautiful, engaging, and functional digital products and services. In recent years, the term “product manager” has become increasingly associated with specific skill sets and roles within organizations, sometimes being used interchangeably with “project manager,” but ultimately still representing distinct individuals with a wide range of responsibilities and abilities.

In summary, product management is essential to building a successful product, service, or program. A product manager brings together a diverse set of skills and knowledge from different areas such as engineering, user experience, marketing, sales, finance, and more, to deliver the best possible results. While not every product manager necessarily leads a dedicated product development team, most do bring valuable expertise and insights into the decision-making processes around new product initiatives and releases. Additionally, product managers have the authority to define product roadmaps, ensure prioritization of feature requests, monitor progress, and provide clear communication with stakeholders. By supporting and guiding other members of the team, product managers can help develop long-term strategic plans and anticipate potential issues before they arise.

Now let's move onto discussing why we need to consider having multiple roles within a single function as a product manager.
# 为什么需要考虑多个角色在单个职务下作为产品经理？

As mentioned earlier, product managers often have several responsibilities that span the product development cycle, ranging from planning to launch. Although this creates flexibility and allows them to take on more tasks, it can increase complexity and difficulty in managing the full scope of activities. 

For example, a typical product manager may be responsible for product strategy, business development, customer relationship management, and measurement of metrics. At the same time, another member of the product team might be responsible for technical feasibility studies, user interface design, and back-end programming. Without a well-defined separation of duties, it can be difficult for someone to make meaningful contributions to the entire product life cycle without becoming overwhelmed or stressed. Furthermore, not only does this create unnecessary overhead, but it can also cause conflicts of interest and distract other members of the team from contributing positively towards achieving product objectives.

To optimize product manager performance, however, it helps to understand the different types of responsibilities involved in product management. Here are four main categories of product management responsibilities:

1. Strategy & Planning: Product managers determine the direction and priorities of the product, establish product goals, define milestones, and review company objectives to inform strategies and priorities. They also conduct market analysis, competitor comparisons, and industry trends to formulate ideas and solutions. 

2. Engineering: Engineers contribute to the technical feasibility of product concepts, designs, and implementations, ensuring that technology meets user expectations and meeting compliance regulations. They also guide technical decisions related to scalability, security, accessibility, and maintainability.

3. Design: Visual designers create compelling visual representations of the product, helping to communicate its brand, tone, and purpose. They also collaborate with engineers and content writers to identify and address usability issues and ensure consistency across the product suite.

4. Marketing: Marketers promote the product to customers, driving awareness and traffic to the website or app. They analyze social media activity, audience behavior, and usage data to gain insight into consumer preferences and loyalty. They also manage social media accounts, blog posts, newsletters, and promotions to maximize reach and engagement.

Each of these functions has unique qualifications and talents needed to achieve product goals effectively. To ensure optimal performance, product managers should assign themselves multiple roles to balance their workload across all aspects of product management, rather than trying to fill multiple job descriptions simultaneously. This will allow them to stay focused on one area of responsibility while managing complex product development activities. For instance, if an engineer is also responsible for creating UI mockups, they could be assigned additional duties related to testing, debugging, and optimization during early development cycles. Overall, taking on multiple roles can help optimize product manager’s performance at all levels of the product development lifecycle while remaining relevant and accountable for the overall success of the company.
