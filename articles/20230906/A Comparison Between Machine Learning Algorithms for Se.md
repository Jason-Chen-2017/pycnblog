# 1.简介
  


Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to classify the polarity of a text based on its emotional content. The sentiment classification can be applied in various fields such as customer feedback analysis, opinion mining, brand reputation management, product review analysis, and market research. Despite their importance, there are several machine learning algorithms available for this task with different performance metrics. This paper compares popular machine learning algorithms used for sentiment analysis of short texts using benchmark datasets.

There have been many studies focused on sentiment analysis of short texts using machine learning techniques. However, most of them did not compare multiple algorithms or evaluated them based on specific metrics. In general, sentiment analysis consists of four main tasks: lexicon-based approach, rule-based approach, neural network approaches, and hybrid models. We will discuss these approaches separately. 

## Lexicon-Based Approach
The first approach uses predefined lexicons which consist of positive words, negative words, neutral words etc. These lexicons are typically trained by linguists or experts who analyze large corpora of text data to identify the contextual meaning of each word and classify it into one of these categories. One of the commonly used lexicons is the Vader lexicon which contains over 7,500 English stopwords and emoticons annotated with their respective polarity scores. It has shown promising results but requires careful preprocessing steps like stemming and tokenization before applying it to new unseen data.

## Rule-Based Approach
Rule-based approaches use simple rules to classify the polarity of text. They simply count the number of positive, negative and neutral terms present in a sentence. For example, if a sentence contains more than two negative words, then it is classified as negative. Another common method is the bag-of-words model where we represent each sentence as a vector of word frequencies and apply some machine learning algorithm like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM). Some other rule-based methods include sentiment analyzer libraries like TextBlob and NLTK.

## Neural Network Approaches
Neural networks have proven to perform well when dealing with complex pattern recognition problems. There are three types of neural network architectures that are commonly used for sentiment analysis: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based models. 

### CNN Based Model
CNN-based models involve convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to extract features from the input text. The output of the last layer is passed through a fully connected layer to get predicted sentiment score. Commonly used pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe can also be used in conjunction with CNN-based models to improve accuracy.

 ### RNN-based Models
RNN-based models use sequential inputs and rely on hidden states to capture temporal dependencies between consecutive tokens. An LSTM cell is usually used as the basic unit of computation and passed through multiple layers. The final output is obtained after passing the sequence through an attention mechanism or weighted average of outputs from all time steps. Examples of popular sentiment analyzers that use RNN-based models include Keras’s built-in LSTM implementation and TensorFlow’s own SequenceWrapper API. 

 ### Hybrid Models
Hybrid models combine both lexicon-based and neural network-based approaches to achieve better results. They train a classifier that combines the outputs of multiple feature extraction models like LSTMs and CNNs along with lexicon classifiers like SVM.

# 3.Benchmark Datasets
We need appropriate benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of different algorithms. Several widely used datasets exist for sentiment analysis:

 - IMDb Movie Review Dataset: Consists of movie reviews collected from IMDB website. Each review is labeled as either Positive, Negative or Neutral.

 - Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset: Consists of product reviews collected from Amazon websites. Each review is labeled as either Positive, Negative or Neutral.

 - Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset: Consists of tweets annotated with their corresponding sentiment labels. It is widely used for training and evaluating NLP models since it contains both short and long text messages, including social media posts.

 - Yelp Review Polarity Dataset: Consists of restaurant reviews collected from Yelp. Each review is labeled as either Positive, Negative or Neutral.
 
In our experiment, we will use the above mentioned dataset for comparison purposes only. Additional evaluation datasets should also be considered for real world scenarios. 
 
# 4.Experimental Setup
For each dataset, we will implement five different algorithms and measure their performance using F1-score metric. Here is the experimental setup:

 ## Algorithm 1 : VADER
 
 VADER is a rule-based system which involves a series of lexical rules designed to pick up negations, booster words (i.e., phrases indicating positivity or negativity) and punctuation marks expressing emotions, respectively. The algorithm detects emotions expressed in sentences and assigns scores ranging from -3 to +3.
 
 
 
 
 
VADER is implemented in Python and open sourced under Apache license. You can find it at https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment.

Implementation Steps

1. Import vaderSentiment library


```python
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
```


2. Initialize the Analyzer object 

```python
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
```


3. Define a function to calculate sentiment score

```python
def calc_sentiment(text):
    return analyzer.polarity_scores(text)['compound']
```

Example Usage

```python
>>> calc_sentiment("This app is amazing!") 
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.429, 'pos': 0.571, 'compound': 0.5283}

```

## Algorithm 2 : Count-based Classifier

Count-based algorithms assign polarities directly to individual words based on their frequency. Two popular count-based algorithms are Bag-Of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency). BoW considers the presence or absence of words while TF-IDF weights words based on their occurrence within the entire corpus.

 ### Bag-Of-Words Method

Bag-Of-Words represents each sentence as a vector of word frequencies. The counts of each unique word in the vocabulary are counted and added together to form a feature vector. After normalization, the resulting vectors are fed into a linear classifier like logistic regression to obtain the sentiment score. 

 ### TF-IDF Method

TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. The weight assigned to each word is inversely proportional to its frequency within the given document but proportional to the total number of documents in the corpus. The formula for computing TF-IDF is:


where tf(t,d) denotes the number of times term t appears in document d, |D| denotes the total number of documents in the corpus, and ||\{ d \in D : t \in d\}|| denotes the number of documents containing term t. Finally, the computed TF-IDF values are mapped onto a probability distribution and fed into a support vector machine or another kernel-based classifier to obtain the sentiment score. 


Algorithm Implementation

1. Convert the dataset into numerical format suitable for calculating the features.

2. Perform feature scaling or dimensionality reduction to reduce the dimensions of the feature space.

3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Train the chosen classifier using the training set.

5. Evaluate the classifier on the test set using the F1-score metric.
