# 1.背景介绍


“Artificial Intelligence (AI)” is becoming one of the most hottest topics in computer science recently. More and more companies are investing a lot into this technology, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, etc., to develop their products or services based on AI algorithms. 

In order for people understand how powerful AI can be, it’s necessary to have some basic understanding about what AI really means and what technologies are involved behind it. In this article, we will talk about artificial intelligence as an art form that combines computing with creativity and human thinking. We also aim to explore the applications of AI in various fields such as medicine, finance, robotics, and social sciences.

Artificial Intelligence is defined as “intelligence displayed by machines or systems rather than humans”. The key concepts underlying AI include machine learning, natural language processing, knowledge representation, reasoning, vision, perception, decision making, and planning.


The first step towards building any AI system involves selecting the appropriate algorithm(s). Machine Learning refers to the process where computers learn from experience to improve performance on tasks. There are several types of machine learning algorithms: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Supervised learning involves training the model using labeled data, while unsupervised learning learns without any labelled data. Reinforcement learning enables agents to interact with the environment and achieve goals through trial-and-error learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to perform complex tasks.


Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the area of AI research focused on enabling computers to understand and communicate with humans via text and speech. It includes techniques like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modeling, and dialogue generation. These techniques enable chatbots, speech assistants, personal digital assistants, and other artificial intelligent devices to understand and respond to user input effectively. Knowledge Representation is the core technique used in NLP to represent structured information in the form of graphs and trees. Reasoning involves reasoning skills required by an agent to make decisions. Vision involves analyzing visual inputs to identify objects and recognize patterns. Perception involves interpreting physical signals to extract meaningful insights. Decision Making involves evaluating multiple options to choose the best course of action. Planning involves predicting future states and actions in response to current situations. All these steps together constitute an AI system that can perform tasks like translation, navigation, question answering, scheduling, customer service, and recommendation systems.


There are many different applications of Artificial Intelligence in various domains such as medicine, finance, politics, security, transportation, healthcare, e-commerce, entertainment, industrial automation, and others. Some of them use only traditional programming languages like Java or C++, while others use advanced programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or Rust. To build an AI system in a specific domain, one has to take care of integrating all the components mentioned above properly. One example is Amazon's Alexa, which uses voice recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms to provide voice commands and interactive interfaces to customers. Another example is Snap Inc.'s Rasa, which uses machine learning models to automate business processes across different channels like messaging apps, email, SMS, and social media platforms. This kind of integration requires a good degree of expertise in each field and years of development experience. Overall, the use of AI technologies in society has become increasingly widespread over time, with numerous benefits such as improved efficiency, reduced costs, increased productivity, better compliance, and enhanced safety. Despite its importance, there remain many challenges facing the tech industry today, including ethical considerations, legal issues, regulatory concerns, and privacy risks. However, it’s essential to continue advancing the state-of-the-art and focusing on addressing these challenges to ensure the long-term success of our country’s economy and societies.
