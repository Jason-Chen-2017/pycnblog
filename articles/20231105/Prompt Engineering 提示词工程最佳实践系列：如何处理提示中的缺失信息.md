# 1.背景介绍


 prompting is a common problem in natural language processing (NLP). Prompt engineering is the process of automatically generating texts that are intended to prompt humans for additional information or to create new knowledge. One way to generate prompts with missing information is by adding text replacement entities such as {X}, where X represents a type of entity. However, this approach can result in incomplete and inconsistent prompts that do not provide enough context for users to complete them accurately. In addition, some prompts may include multiple text replacement entities, which makes it more challenging to find examples from the corpus that match all possible combinations of these entities. This leads to reduced system performance and poor user satisfaction. To address these issues, we propose a methodology for processing prompts with missing information using transfer learning based on pre-trained language models.

 Transfer learning refers to the use of pre-trained neural networks as feature extractors for fine-tuning task specific deep learning models. It has been shown to improve model accuracy on various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and topic modeling. Here, we will explain how to apply transfer learning to prompt generation.

 The main components of transfer learning are:
  - Pre-trained model: A large language model trained on a large corpus of text data, typically containing tens of millions of sentences. These models have learned general linguistic features such as syntax, semantics, and sentence structure, which help improve the quality of generated output when finetuned on specific NLP tasks.

  - Fine-tuned head(s): Additional layers added to the pre-trained model for the specific NLP task at hand. Typically, there is one layer for classification, another layer for regression, and so on. Each layer outputs logits corresponding to each class/label or score. 

 We will use BERT, an effective transformer-based model pretrained on large amounts of unlabelled text data, as our pre-trained model. The fine-tuned head used here is a simple linear classifier, but other approaches like multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers could also be used depending on the nature of the NLP task at hand.
 
 Text replacement entities ({X}) represent types of entities that need to be identified and filled in the prompt before being fed into the pre-trained language model. For example, if we want to generate a news article about Apple Inc., we might use the following prompt template: "Today, {company} announced its quarterly earning report and forecasted revenue growth." Without providing actual values for company, the prompt would not make sense. Hence, we can add text replacement entities to indicate what kind of entity should be present in the prompt. 

 Another challenge with existing methods for handling missing information in prompts is that they often rely heavily on keyword matching algorithms that require accurate annotations and are prone to errors. In contrast, transfer learning provides us with powerful representations that capture complex relationships between words and can guide the model towards generating appropriate responses without relying on explicit annotations. We can leverage pre-trained language models and fine-tune their heads to learn to predict missing entities based on input sequences without any annotation.

 Using these techniques, we can train a generative model to produce high-quality prompts even when given partial information. This will enable us to handle scenarios where users forget details during conversation or need additional clarity around certain concepts. Finally, we hope that our work contributes to better human-computer dialogues through improved efficiency and accuracy.

  Let's now go over the algorithmic steps involved in applying transfer learning to prompt generation with missing information.

 ## Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
  First, we collect a dataset consisting of pairs of incomplete prompts and their respective completed versions (with correct fill-in slots marked). These pairs can come from different sources, such as FAQ pages, product reviews, or conversations logs. After preprocessing the textual data, we split it into training and testing sets.

 ## Step 2: Training Language Model
  Next, we use the pre-trained language model BERT to tokenize the training set and convert them into numerical representation called embeddings. We then fine-tune the pre-trained model on our specific NLP task using the labeled data. Specifically, we replace the final layer of the network with a linear classifier and train it to classify the inputs as either having missing information or not. During training, we keep the weights of the original network fixed while adjusting the parameters of the newly added layer.

 Once the training is done, we evaluate the fine-tuned model on the test set to get metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. We aim to achieve a good balance between accuracy and coverage, i.e., ensuring that the model covers a wide range of examples and achieves high precision and recall scores. If the model does not meet the desired levels, we may need to increase the size of the dataset or try other hyperparameters to improve its performance.

 ## Step 3: Generating Prompts with Missing Information
  Now that we have a well-trained language model, we can use it to generate prompts with missing information. We start by filling in the text replacement entities with the most likely candidates according to the model's predictions. We can calculate the probability distribution for each entity using softmax function. Then, we feed the modified prompt sequence into the pre-trained language model and generate an output sequence. We extract the last hidden state vector from the output sequence and pass it through a linear layer to obtain the predicted entity label.

 Based on the predicted entity labels, we select the most probable candidate word or phrase for each entity and replace the placeholder token with it. At the end, we concatenate the remaining tokens with spaces and return the resulting string as a prompt.

 ## Step 4: Post-Processing
  Finally, we post-process the generated prompts by performing several checks to ensure consistency and completeness. For instance, we check whether all required entities are present, eliminate redundant prompts that share similar content, and filter out irrelevant and offensive prompts. We may remove those who fail any of these checks because they cannot be easily discriminated against and do not contribute meaningfully to the dialog system.
  
  Overall, this algorithm guarantees that we produce high-quality prompts despite incomplete or ambiguous input contexts and reduces both cognitive load and workload on the user side.
