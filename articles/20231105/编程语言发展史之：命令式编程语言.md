# 1.背景介绍


Command-oriented programming (COP) is a style of programming in which the program describes a sequence of commands to be executed by an interpreter or compiler. The most popular COP language is Lisp, which was created by John McCarthy in 1958 and remains one of the most widely used languages today. It supports functional programming paradigm, dynamic typing, first-class functions, tail call optimization, lexical scoping, closures, and high degree of modularity through macros. In contrast, imperative programming styles are based on state machines, mutable variables, control structures such as loops and conditionals, and data structures like arrays and records. Although command-oriented programming offers many benefits over more traditional programming paradigms, its popularity has been undermined by recent trends that promote declarative programming paradigms like functional programming, logic programming, and constraint satisfaction problems.

In this article, we will discuss the history of command-oriented programming from its beginnings in the 50's to its present day status in modern programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript. We will also review some key concepts related to command-oriented programming, including function composition, recursion, higher order functions, type systems, and memory management techniques. Finally, we will compare and contrast command-oriented programming with other popular programming paradigms and analyze their strengths and weaknesses for specific use cases.

## 2.1 命令式编程的历史
Command-oriented programming (COP) was originally defined in 1958 by <NAME>, who noted that existing procedural programming styles were not sufficient to handle complex programs with multiple dependencies and side effects. Instead, he proposed using structured programming techniques along with procedures that manipulate the contents of data structures. He then developed Lisp, a multi-paradigm programming language that combines features from several different programming paradigms:

1. Functional programming: allows creating expressions without relying on side effects and avoids mutating global variables.
2. Dynamic typing: enables handling values of different types during runtime.
3. First-class functions: enable passing functions as arguments and returning them as results. 
4. Tail call optimization: reduces stack usage when recursive calls occur.
5. Lexical scoping: maintains separate namespaces for local variables and parameters. 
6. Macros: provide powerful metaprogramming capabilities.

However, early attempts at implementing Lisp proved too slow for practical use because it relied heavily on garbage collection. To address these issues, Carlsson introduced two new ideas to improve performance: continuations and implicit thunking. Continuations allow saving the current execution context and resuming later, while implicit thunking delays the creation of intermediate objects until they are actually needed. This reduced the overhead associated with object allocation and improved overall efficiency.

During the late 1970's and mid 1980's, imperative programming gained prominence as the dominant paradigm within mainstream programming environments. These languages included ALGOL, Pascal, Modula-2, Cobol, and PL/I. Each had its own set of features, making it difficult to compare them directly. However, many commonalities emerged, including the ability to work with explicit data structures and control flow constructs such as conditional statements, loops, and subroutine calls.

By comparison, command-oriented programming represents a radical departure from procedural programming. Procedural programming involves writing code sequentially, line by line, executing each statement once the previous ones have completed successfully. In contrast, command-oriented programming treats instructions as messages that instruct the system to perform certain tasks. In addition, COP uses a message passing model instead of the top-down sequential model typically found in imperative programming. 

In summary, throughout the years, the concept of command-oriented programming has matured into a full-fledged programming paradigm that leverages both structured and unstructured programming techniques. Initially inspired by Algol and Lisp, the term "command-oriented" has come to denote a particular way of thinking about computing, but its principles can still be applied to a wide variety of applications across domains such as artificial intelligence, database management, bioinformatics, robotics, and graphics rendering.
