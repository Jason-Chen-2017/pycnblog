# 1.简介
  

Data mining is a process of extracting valuable insights from large amounts of data. It involves techniques like clustering, classification, and prediction that enable organizations to make informed decisions based on their available resources and data. However, it's often difficult for non-experts to understand the concepts behind these algorithms or apply them successfully in real-world scenarios.

In this blog post, we'll discuss key data mining concepts and principles, including entity resolution, attribute inference, association rule learning, decision tree learning, and k-means clustering. We'll also dive into specific implementation details using Python code examples. Finally, we'll touch upon some potential future directions for data mining applications.

# 2.实体识别Entity Resolution
One common task in data mining is identifying and merging duplicate records related to entities such as customers, products, transactions, etc. This is called entity resolution. Entity resolution aims to combine similar records together under a single entity, so they can be analyzed and manipulated more easily. There are several approaches to entity resolution, but the most commonly used methods involve linking records across multiple databases or tables based on shared identifiers or attributes. Here's an overview of the main steps involved:

1. Attribute disambiguation: Identify attributes that may match between different records but do not completely identify them (e.g., names vs. nicknames).
2. Record linkage: Determine whether two records refer to the same entity based on matching values in selected attributes. 
3. Clustering: Group similar records into clusters based on similarity metrics like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.
4. Record deduplication: Remove redundant records after merging and cleaning duplicates within groups.
5. Output format: Choose the desired output format for resolved records (e.g., CSV file with merged attributes, JSON object, relational database table). 

Here's an example implementation of entity resolution using python pandas library and the AIDA dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load AIDA dataset
aida_df = pd.read_csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00379/AidA.tsv', delimiter='\t')

# Print head of dataframe
print(aida_df.head())

# Drop columns unrelated to entity resolution
aida_clean_df = aida_df.drop(['docno'], axis=1)

# Define function to perform record linkage on specified column pairs
def record_linkage(left_col, right_col):
    # Convert all strings to lower case for consistency
    left_col = [x.lower() for x in list(left_col)]
    right_col = [x.lower() for x in list(right_col)]

    # Perform blocking step to remove potentially erroneous matches
    block1 = set([tuple(sorted((str(x[i]), str(y[j])))) 
                  for i in range(len(left_col))
                  for j in range(len(right_col))])
    
    block2 = set([(str(x[i]), str(y[j])) 
                  for i in range(len(left_col)-1)
                  for j in range(i+1, len(right_col))])

    intersection = block1 & block2

    # Compute similarity scores based on Jaccard coefficient
    score_dict = {}
    for pair in intersection:
        score = float(len(set(pair[0]).intersection(set(pair[1]))) /
                     len(set(pair[0]).union(set(pair[1]))))
        if score > 0.5:
            score_dict[(pair[0], pair[1])] = score
            
    return score_dict

# Apply record linkage to columns 'name' and 'email' to resolve duplicates
score_dict = record_linkage(list(aida_clean_df['name']), list(aida_clean_df['email']))

# Extract linked records and merge them with original dataframe
linked_records = []
for key, value in sorted(score_dict.items(), key=lambda item: -item[1]):
    row_idx = list(aida_clean_df[aida_clean_df['name'] == key[0]].index)[0]
    col_idx = list(aida_clean_df[aida_clean_df['email'] == key[1]].index)[0]
    linked_row = aida_clean_df.iloc[[row_idx, col_idx]]
    linked_row['confidence'] = value
    linked_records.append(linked_row)
    
merged_df = aida_df.merge(pd.concat(linked_records), how='inner',
                          suffixes=['_old', '_new'])

# Drop old and confidence columns and rename new columns
final_df = merged_df[['name', 'email']] \
                .rename({'name': 'personName', 'email': 'emailAddress'}, axis=1)

# Print final dataframe
print(final_df)
```

The above code implements record linkage algorithm to merge rows related to persons with identical names and emails. The resulting dataframe contains only unique entries, where each person has been identified uniquely according to name and email address. Additionally, a 'confidence' column shows the strength of the link between each pair of linked records.
