# 1.简介
  

在当前这个信息化社会里，人们在接受新鲜事物、获取知识方面都极具创造力。但现代社会的信息 overload 越来越严重，加之互联网技术的飞速发展，人们获取信息的渠道也变得多样化，各式各样的信息源竞相涌现，从而导致信息质量参差不齐。同时，由于人类的各种目的不同，产生了不同的信息需求和价值观念，使得不同的用户群体对信息的需求各不相同。因此，如何让用户更容易获取到高质量、有用且有趣的信息，成为当下一个重要课题。
生成对抗网络（Generative Adversarial Network）是近年来一种基于深度学习的方法，它可以生成出令人惊叹的自然图像、语音信号等高质量数据。其在计算机视觉、语音合成、文本生成领域的应用前景十分广阔，而且效果也得到了社区的高度关注。因此，要想更好地理解和应用生成对抗网络，首先需要了解一些生成对抗网络的基本概念和术语。
# 2.基本概念术语说明
## GAN 的概念
生成对抗网络（Generative Adversarial Networks, GANs）是由 Ian Goodfellow 发明的一种深度学习模型，用来训练生成模型或者判别模型。它由两部分组成：一个是生成器（Generator），另一个是判别器（Discriminator）。它们之间通过博弈的方式进行交流，并提升自己的能力。生成器的目标是生成尽可能真实的样本，而判别器则要尽量辨别生成器生成的样本是不是真实的样本。如下图所示：

GAN 在图像生成领域的应用十分成功，其中包括：
* **CycleGAN** 用于将一幅图像从一种风格迁移至另一种风格。
* **Pix2pix** 用于从原始图片生成目标图片。
* **StarGAN** 用于生成多种风格的图像。

## 相关术语
1. Discriminator （判别器）
    * A type of neural network that takes in a sample from the dataset and tries to determine whether it is real or fake based on some features learned during training process. It outputs a probability score between 0 and 1 indicating how likely it is for the input data to be real. The discriminator can be thought as a binary classifier where the input image gets mapped onto a set of weights which helps to classify if its real or not.

2. Generator （生成器）
    * Another type of neural network that takes random noise inputs and generates samples similar to those present in the training data. During training phase, generator learns to fool the discriminator by generating realistic images that look like they are obtained through human intervention i.e., we want to maximize the loss function while keeping our generated images close to the actual ones produced by the true data distribution. Generators provide us with new, unseen samples from the same distribution over again which makes them very powerful tools when used for supervised learning tasks.

3. Latent Space / Embedding space
    * The latent space represents the manifold of possible hidden factors that influence the output of the generative model. In other words, it is the space containing all the possible values of various variables such as color, shape, position etc., which can be used by the generator to generate novel images or sounds.

4. Dataset (training data + validation data )
    * Contains examples of both original and transformed data points along with their corresponding labels. It’s important to separate these two types of data because only the former should be used to train the models but the latter will be used to evaluate the performance of trained models.

5. Loss Function (objective function to minimize)
    * This measures the discrepancy between the predicted values of the generator and the ground truth values provided in the dataset. We need to minimize this value so that the generator is able to produce accurate samples that match the distribution of the underlying data well.

6. Gradient Penalty Term (to enforce Lipschitz continuity constraint)
    * This adds an additional penalty term to the gradient of the discriminator to ensure that it remains Lipschitz continuous at every point. Lipschitz continuity ensures smoothness of decision boundaries in the discriminator thus improving the stability and robustness of the overall system.

7. Label Smoothing Regularization (to reduce the chances of vanishing gradients)
    * Adds small amount of noise to the target label of each example in order to prevent the model from becoming too confident about any single class during training time. This regularization technique encourages the model to generalize better to new datasets and reduces the risk of getting stuck in local minima caused by overfitting.
