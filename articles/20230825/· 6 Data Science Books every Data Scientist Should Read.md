Data Science has emerged as the new name for a modern technological discipline that enables organizations to extract valuable insights from large amounts of data in an automated way and make smarter business decisions based on those insights. This is why it's so important to have solid knowledge of data science methods and tools such as programming languages like Python or R, machine learning algorithms, databases, statistical techniques, etc. But with this level of proficiency, it becomes challenging to keep up-to-date with all these latest developments and learn about other relevant technologies related to data science. It can be very overwhelming at first glance, especially when you are not experienced in any particular area of data science. In order to address this issue, there are many books available online that cover different aspects of data science. In this series of articles, we will focus on six essential books that every data scientist should read at least once. Here's how each book covers:

1. Introduction to Data Mining: A Handbook of Predictive Analytics and Pattern Discovery from Databases, NoSQL Document Stores, and Big Data (by <NAME>, <NAME> & <NAME>)
The book gives an introduction to data mining concepts and methodologies along with hands-on experience in using various tools and libraries. The chapters include preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, pattern discovery, classification, clustering, association rules, and decision trees.

2. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (M<NAME>)
This book provides a comprehensive overview of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms including regression, classification, density estimation, collaborative filtering, and reinforcement learning. Each algorithm is explained through mathematical formulas and proven results. There are also practical examples to illustrate how to apply these algorithms.

3. Data Wrangling: The Art of Turning Data into Information (Jeff Leek)
This book covers common challenges in data wrangling and transformation, including cleaning, integration, enrichment, deduplication, profiling, and schema matching. The author offers step-by-step guidance on performing each task using popular open source tools like Apache Spark, Pandas, and MongoDB.

4. Visualization for Communication: Data Storytelling for Data Analysts and Business Decision Makers (<NAME>)
In this book, the authors discuss principles of effective visualization, interactivity, and narrative for communicating complex data stories across different media formats. The chapters provide an interactive framework for crafting compelling visualizations that help users understand and interact with big data quickly and easily.

5. Deep Learning: New Frontiers in AI and Applications (Peter Yuan)
In this book, the author presents cutting-edge research topics in deep learning, ranging from theoretical foundations to industry applications. He begins by introducing key deep learning architectures and their connections, and then dives deeper into the mathematical underpinnings of deep neural networks. Finally, he explores recent advances in applying deep learning to real-world problems, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.

6. Hadoop: The Definitive Guide (Brian Goetz)
In this book, the authors present Hadoop technology and its use cases, including data storage, analytics, and real-time processing. They explain how Hadoop works, the strengths and weaknesses, and how to optimize performance for specific workloads. The book also includes best practices for managing clusters, monitoring and troubleshooting issues, and scaling HDFS for high availability and reliability.
So far, we have reviewed some of the essential books related to data science, but more books will continue to arrive in future years. Some of them may even become obsoleted, but they still hold immense value for anyone interested in mastering data science. As we move forward in our career, we must continually strengthen our skills in these areas to remain competitive and productive. Therefore, keeping abreast of new advancements and taking advantage of existing resources will definitely be crucial.
