# 1.简介
  

Word embeddings (WE) have emerged as a popular technique to represent natural language concepts in vector form. Despite their prevalence, they are often evaluated using standard metrics such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation coefficient. However, these measures ignore important aspects of word embedding evaluation that reflect its ability to capture semantic information and model the contextual dependencies between words. To address this, we propose two alternative automatic evaluation metrics based on WE: 1) Variation of Information (VI), which captures the intrinsic trade-off between the distribution of predicted probabilities assigned by the model vs. the actual ground truth distribution; and 2) Entropy Reduction (ER), which is a metric that quantifies how much uncertainty in the predictions decreases over time due to incremental updates to the model’s parameters. We evaluate both VI and ER on eight widely used benchmarks for NLU tasks including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, text classification, machine translation, and dialogue systems. Our results show that WE significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art baselines with respect to both metrics and provide valuable insights into improving WE performance.
In addition to providing new insightful evaluations, our findings can be useful for practitioners seeking to improve the accuracy and efficiency of their models. Specifically, we suggest several directions for future research, including developing techniques to generate more diverse and realistic training data, better tuning algorithms for WE learning, leveraging additional knowledge about the task at hand to further enhance WE representations, and exploring other deep neural network architectures specifically designed for NLU tasks. Finally, it may also help develop robustness mechanisms against adversarial attacks that seek to manipulate or mislead WE-based models. Overall, our work provides solid foundation for addressing challenges related to evaluating natural language understanding (NLU) models based on WE.

Word embeddings have been an active area of research since their introduction by Bengio et al. (2013). Early approaches included continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and skip-gram models, which predict target words from surrounding contexts. Later works focused on generating distributed representations of words that could capture syntactic and semantic relationships across sentences. Current state-of-the-art methods include GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017), and ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) among others. These methods use deep neural networks to learn the underlying relationship between words and obtain vector representations that capture rich linguistic features. In contrast, our proposed metrics operate directly on top of learned vectors without requiring any fine-tuning or additional supervision beyond what was provided during training.

3.方法论
We aim to compare three types of word embedding evaluation metrics – variation of information (VI), entropy reduction (ER), and the harmonic mean of VI and ER. The first two metrics measure the difference between the distributions of predicted probability assignments and true labels, while the third combines them in a holistic manner. For each type of evaluation, we consider three common benchmark datasets for NLU tasks, namely Sentiment Analysis (SA), Topic Modeling (TM), Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification (TC), Machine Translation (MT), Dialogue Systems (DS), and Conversational Recommendation (CR). Each dataset consists of examples annotated with human judgments on various attributes like polarity, aspect, emotion, etc. Each example contains one or multiple sentences along with corresponding annotations. Based on these datasets, we train and evaluate baseline models (e.g. logistic regression, decision trees, and nearest neighbor classifiers) using standard classification metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Then, we fine-tune our models with WE-based feature representations obtained using either CBOW or SkipGram models implemented through TensorFlow API. Once trained, we apply all three evaluation metrics to compute their respective scores for each test example. We repeat this process for every combination of dataset and baseline model to obtain sufficient statistical power to make meaningful comparisons. We then analyze the results to identify trends, gaps, and correlations among the different evaluation metrics and report recommendations for future improvements in WE evaluation.

4.具体实施
For simplicity, we will assume that the reader has prior experience in building neural networks, working with TensorFlow library, and has some familiarity with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. If not, it might be beneficial to read relevant papers and resources before proceeding with this paper. We will focus on implementing VI and ER metrics, their mathematical background, and their implementation details using Python programming language. All experiments will be conducted on Google Colab platform.

4.1 数据集准备
First, we need to prepare the datasets for each NLU task. SA, TM, NER, TC, MT, DS, and CR are publicly available datasets that contain labeled samples of text. Here, we just give a brief overview of the general structure of each dataset.

Sentiment Analysis (SA): This dataset contains movie reviews where users rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and provide their feedback comments. The goal of SA is to classify the overall rating given by the user as positive, negative, or neutral. 

Topic Modeling (TM): This dataset contains unstructured texts such as news articles, blog posts, and product descriptions that should be automatically grouped together into topics. The goal of TM is to discover latent topics that characterize a set of documents, making them easier to organize and search. 

Named Entity Recognition (NER): This dataset contains raw text with named entities marked with tags like PERSON, ORGANIZATION, DATE, LOCATION, MONEY, and so on. The goal of NER is to extract and tag all these entities in the text so that downstream applications can understand and interact with them.

Text Classification (TC): This dataset contains text documents classified into predefined categories. The goal of TC is to assign each document to one of the predefined classes.

Machine Translation (MT): This dataset contains parallel texts in different languages that require translation to another language. The goal of MT is to translate source text into target language with high accuracy.

Dialogue Systems (DS): This dataset contains dialogues between two or more participants, typically with varying styles and levels of formality. The goal of DS is to provide an automated system that can handle complex conversations under different circumstances.

Conversational Recommendation (CR): This dataset contains records of customer interactions with products or services, including ratings and review comments. The goal of CR is to recommend appropriate items to customers based on past behavior and preferences. 

4.2 模型准备
Next, we need to create and train the baseline models required for comparison. We will implement five commonly used classification models: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), Nearest Neighbors (NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We start by importing necessary libraries and defining hyperparameters for each model. 

```python
import tensorflow as tf 
from sklearn import linear_model, tree, ensemble, neighbors, svm
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, roc_auc_score, average_precision_score
```

4.3 训练模型并评估性能
Now, let's define functions to train and evaluate the baseline models. Note that for each model, we convert the input data into dense tensors using `tf.keras.layers.Input` layer followed by `tf.keras.layers.Dense`. We then compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric. During training, we fit the model on the training data and evaluate it on validation data. After training is complete, we print the final performance statistics. 

```python
def train_and_evaluate(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, clf):
  # Define input layers
  inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(maxlen,), dtype='int32')
  embedded = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size+1, output_dim=embedding_dim)(inputs)
  
  if 'nn' in clf.__class__.__name__.lower():
    # Pad sequences for NN input format
    padded_seq = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(x_train, maxlen=maxlen)
    outputs = clf(padded_seq)
    
  else:
    # Flatten embedding output for non-NN models 
    flattened = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(embedded)
    outputs = clf(flattened)

  model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=[inputs], outputs=[outputs])
  
  # Compile model with binary crossentropy loss and evaluation metric 
  model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

  # Train model on training data and validate on validation data
  history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_data=(x_valid,y_valid))

  # Evaluate model on testing data
  _, acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
  
  return {'acc': acc}


def lr_performance(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, x_test, y_test):
  # Create LR classifier object 
  clf = linear_model.LogisticRegression()

  # Train and evaluate model on training and validation data 
  perf_dict = {}
  perf_dict['lr'] = train_and_evaluate(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, clf)

  # Test model on testing data
  pred_prob = clf.predict_proba(x_test)[:,1]
  auc_roc = roc_auc_score(y_test, pred_prob)
  ap = average_precision_score(y_test, pred_prob)
  f1 = f1_score(y_test, [round(p) for p in pred_prob])

  return {**perf_dict['lr'], **{'AUC-ROC': auc_roc, 'AP': ap, 'F1-Score': f1}}


def dt_performance(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, x_test, y_test):
  # Create DT classifier object 
  clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()

  # Train and evaluate model on training and validation data 
  perf_dict = {}
  perf_dict['dt'] = train_and_evaluate(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, clf)

  # Test model on testing data
  pred_prob = clf.predict_proba(x_test)[:,1]
  auc_roc = roc_auc_score(y_test, pred_prob)
  ap = average_precision_score(y_test, pred_prob)
  f1 = f1_score(y_test, [round(p) for p in pred_prob])

  return {**perf_dict['dt'], **{'AUC-ROC': auc_roc, 'AP': ap, 'F1-Score': f1}}


def rf_performance(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, x_test, y_test):
  # Create RF classifier object 
  clf = ensemble.RandomForestClassifier()

  # Train and evaluate model on training and validation data 
  perf_dict = {}
  perf_dict['rf'] = train_and_evaluate(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, clf)

  # Test model on testing data
  pred_prob = clf.predict_proba(x_test)[:,1]
  auc_roc = roc_auc_score(y_test, pred_prob)
  ap = average_precision_score(y_test, pred_prob)
  f1 = f1_score(y_test, [round(p) for p in pred_prob])

  return {**perf_dict['rf'], **{'AUC-ROC': auc_roc, 'AP': ap, 'F1-Score': f1}}


def nn_performance(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, x_test, y_test):
  # Create NN classifier object 
  clf = neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier()

  # Train and evaluate model on training and validation data 
  perf_dict = {}
  perf_dict['nn'] = train_and_evaluate(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, clf)

  # Test model on testing data
  pred_prob = clf.predict_proba(x_test)[:,1]
  auc_roc = roc_auc_score(y_test, pred_prob)
  ap = average_precision_score(y_test, pred_prob)
  f1 = f1_score(y_test, [round(p) for p in pred_prob])

  return {**perf_dict['nn'], **{'AUC-ROC': auc_roc, 'AP': ap, 'F1-Score': f1}}


def svm_performance(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, x_test, y_test):
  # Create SVM classifier object 
  clf = svm.SVC()

  # Train and evaluate model on training and validation data 
  perf_dict = {}
  perf_dict['svm'] = train_and_evaluate(x_train, y_train, x_valid, y_valid, clf)

  # Test model on testing data
  pred_prob = clf.decision_function(x_test)
  auc_roc = roc_auc_score(y_test, pred_prob)

  return {**perf_dict['svm'], **{'AUC-ROC': auc_roc, 'AP': ap, 'F1-Score': f1}}
```

4.4 使用词嵌入表示
After creating and training the baseline models, we move on to evaluate them on WE-based feature representations. We again import necessary libraries and load the previously prepared datasets. As mentioned earlier, we will compare VI, ER, and their holistic evaluation metrics H-VI and H-ER. Therefore, here, we only need to modify the previous code slightly by adding few lines of code to preprocess the dataset and obtain the WE-based representation. 

```python
import numpy as np
import nltk

nltk.download('stopwords')
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from collections import Counter
from gensim.models import KeyedVectors

# Load pretrained word embeddings
word_vectors = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format("GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin", binary=True)

# Prepare stopwords list
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Helper function to remove punctuation marks and numbers
def clean_text(text):
    text = "".join([char.lower() for char in text if char.isalpha()])
    tokens = text.split()
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
    return " ".join(tokens)

# Preprocess text data
def preprocess(dataset, maxlen):
    processed_docs = []
    for doc in dataset['text']:
        cleaned_doc = clean_text(doc)
        tokenized_doc = nltk.word_tokenize(cleaned_doc)
        filtered_doc = [w for w in tokenized_doc if len(w)>1 and w in word_vectors]
        vec = sum([word_vectors[w] for w in filtered_doc])/len(filtered_doc)
        processed_docs.append(vec)

    X = pad_sequences(processed_docs, maxlen=maxlen)
    
    return X
```

4.5 计算信息熵
The following step involves computing the entropy of the learned vector representations. The entropy measures the level of disorder or randomness in the learned vector space. The higher the entropy value, the more unordered or noisy the vectors are. Lower entropy indicates that the vectors follow more regular patterns. In order to calculate the entropy, we first normalize the learned vector values to lie within the range [-1, 1]. Next, we compute the conditional probability density function of the normalized vector components using kernel density estimation. Finally, we take the negative logarithm of the estimated densities to get the entropy. 

```python
from scipy.stats import gaussian_kde
import math

def entropy(X):
    # Normalize data to [-1, 1]
    min_val, max_val = X.min(), X.max()
    norm_X = -1 + 2*(X - min_val)/(max_val - min_val)
    
    # Compute KDE estimate of density of individual components
    kde = gaussian_kde(norm_X.T)
    bw = kde.factor*np.power(norm_X.shape[0], -1./(kde.d+4))
    kde_vals = kde.evaluate(norm_X.T, bw)
    kde_vals += 1e-9 # add small constant to avoid division by zero errors
        
    # Calculate entropy using formula for entropy of Gaussian variable
    entropies = [(v/math.sqrt((2*math.pi)**kde.d*bw))*(-np.log(v)) for v in kde_vals]
    
    return sum(entropies)/len(entropies)
```

4.6 计算熵减少量
The next step is to compute the amount of entropy that reduces over time as the model learns over time. We do this by keeping track of the entropy calculated on the latest batch of training data after each epoch of training. We plot the entropy reduction curve to visualize the progression of entropy over training iterations. While ideally, entropy should eventually decrease towards a minimum value of zero, there is no guarantee that this will occur unless we choose suitable hyperparameters and optimize the learning algorithm. Therefore, we must ensure that our evaluation criteria are well-defined and achievable over time. 

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def calc_entropy_reduction(history):
    entropy_list = []
    for i in range(1, epochs):
        val_loss = history.history["val_loss"][i-1]
        hist_pred = model.predict(x_hist)
        hist_entropy = entropy(hist_pred)
        curr_pred = model.predict(x_curr)
        curr_entropy = entropy(curr_pred)
        entropy_diff = abs(curr_entropy - hist_entropy)
        entropy_list.append(entropy_diff)
    return entropy_list
```

4.7 测试结果
Finally, we wrap everything up by combining the above steps into main function called `eval_embeddings()`. It takes four arguments: `task`, `clf_type`, `embedding_type`, and `embedding_path`. The `task` argument specifies the NLP task being tested (`sa`, `tm`, `ner`, `tc`, `mt`, `ds`, or `cr`). The `clf_type` argument specifies the type of classifier used for baseline performance evaluation (`lr`, `dt`, `rf`, `nn`, or `svm`). The `embedding_type` argument specifies whether WE or GloVe embeddings were used (`we` or `glove`). The `embedding_path` argument specifies the path to the downloaded embedding file. The function returns the evaluation results computed using all three metrics – VI, ER, and H-VI/H-ER. Additionally, it plots the entropy reduction curve if applicable. 

```python
def eval_embeddings(task, clf_type, embedding_type, embedding_path):
    global maxlen, vocab_size, embedding_dim, epochs, batch_size
