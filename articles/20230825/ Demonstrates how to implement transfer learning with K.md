Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model is used as the starting point for training a new task. Transfer learning enables us to leverage the knowledge learned in a related but different task and apply it directly to our target task without having to train from scratch. It can significantly reduce the amount of data required to train a deep neural network. The key idea behind transfer learning is that features learned by a pre-trained model on a large dataset can be transferred effectively to a smaller dataset or tasks. 

In this article, we will demonstrate how to use transfer learning using the popular open source deep learning library - Keras. We will specifically focus on image classification problems, covering both binary and multi-class scenarios. This tutorial assumes familiarity with basic deep learning concepts like convolutional networks, pooling layers, activation functions etc. If you are not familiar with these topics, please refer to other resources before proceeding further.

Before we begin, let’s quickly refresh ourselves on some fundamental terminology:

1. **Pre-trained models:** A set of weights obtained after training on a large dataset for solving a variety of tasks such as image classification, object detection, speech recognition etc. These models have already learned an abstract representation of the visual world and can be fine-tuned for a specific problem. Pre-trained models usually achieve high accuracy on a wide range of tasks but they require a lot of computational power and time to train.

2. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuning refers to retraining a pretrained model on a small subset of the original training data while keeping all the remaining weights fixed. In contrast to traditional training procedures which typically involve training an entire network from scratch, fine-tuning allows us to adapt a pre-trained model to better suit the requirements of the current task at hand. 

3. **Dataset:** A collection of labeled images containing input data along with their corresponding output labels (i.e., class labels).

4. **Training set:** A subset of the overall dataset used to train the model during the initial stages of training. Typically, this would comprise a significant portion of the total dataset.

5. **Validation set:** A subset of the training set used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the performance of the model during training.

6. **Test set:** A subset of the overall dataset used to measure the final performance of the trained model once the training process has completed.

Now, let's dive into the actual implementation of transfer learning in Keras!

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminologies
We'll now briefly review the basics of CNNs and transfer learning and learn about the steps involved in implementing them in Keras.
## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
A convolutional neural network (CNN) consists of several interconnected convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. Each layer applies filters over the input data to extract relevant features and then feeds those features to the next layer for processing. The architecture of each layer comprises of multiple feature maps generated by applying kernel filters across the input volume. The resulting feature maps can be thought of as hierarchical representations of the input data based on the patterns captured by individual kernels. The last fully connected layer is often removed and replaced with one or more additional fully connected layers depending on the complexity of the problem being addressed. Here's a basic overview of the structure of a typical CNN architecture:



The above diagram depicts a simplified version of the CNN architecture. Each rectangle represents a single layer, including its type (convolution, pooling or dense), its number of neurons and the size of the filter used in the convolution operation. 

## Transfer Learning
Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model as the starting point for a new task. The pre-trained model has been trained on a large dataset, such as ImageNet, which contains millions of labeled images. When training a new model on a similar task, the pre-trained model can act as a good starting point since it has already learned an abstract representation of the visual world and has extracted relevant features that may help improve the performance of the new model. By freezing the weights of the lower layers of the pre-trained model and only updating the higher level layers, we can ensure that the lower level layers do not get corrupted by the new task. During training, we can also adjust the learning rate of the higher level layers so that the updates made to the weights do not affect the lower levels too much.

There are two common types of transfer learning:

1. Feature extraction transfer learning: This involves extracting meaningful features from the pre-trained model and using them as input to the new model. For example, if we want to classify animals instead of vehicles, we might take advantage of the powerful feature detectors in a pre-trained CNN that are useful for recognizing vehicles. 

2. Finetuning: This involves continuing the training of the pre-trained model on a new task, sometimes even training the entire model from scratch on a slightly larger dataset. While this approach does provide improvements in performance compared to randomly initializing the weights, finetuning still requires a large amount of annotated data.

## Steps to Implement Transfer Learning with Keras

Here are the general steps to implement transfer learning using Keras:
1. Load and preprocess the original dataset. 
2. Load and preprocess the small subset of the dataset used for fine-tuning.
3. Create the base model (the pre-trained model).
4. Freeze the layers of the base model.
5. Add custom layers for the target task.
6. Compile the model.
7. Train the model on the small dataset.
8. Evaluate the model on the test set.
