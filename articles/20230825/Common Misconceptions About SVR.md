# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Regression (SVR) 是一种机器学习分类方法，它利用超平面将数据集中的样本分类。该模型可以很好地解决非线性的数据集、分类任务具有复杂的特征空间以及存在噪音等问题。然而，由于算法本身的特性，SVR 有着一些常见的误区。因此，本文试图通过对 SVR 的一些典型误解进行剖析，从而帮助读者更好地理解其工作原理及其局限性。

## 2.1 支持向量机（SVM）
支持向量机(Support vector machine, SVM)是一种二类分类器，它通过找到一个决策边界来最大化距离支持向量和其他数据的最小距离，目的是使两类之间的分割尽可能粗糙。它是通过求解一个优化问题来实现分类的，其中目标函数是定义在特征空间上并且对偶问题是凸的。这种优化问题可以通过内核技巧转换成合页损失或软间隔问题。


## 2.2 支持向量回归（SVR）
支持向量回归(Support vector regression, SVR) 是一种机器学习回归方法，它利用超平面将数据集中的样本回归到连续的输出值上。SVR 可以很好地解决回归任务中存在的噪声以及数据集中存在的异常点等问题。SVR 使用核函数将输入空间映射到高维空间，并通过最小化误差的平方和作为目标函数来训练。对于给定的测试输入 x，SVR 会计算它与训练数据集中最近的点的距离，然后基于此距离预测输出 y 。

# 3.Core Algorithm and Operation Steps:
## Core algorithm:
The core idea behind SVM is to find the best separating hyperplane between classes of data points using a kernel function or explicit feature mapping. The distance from the closest point on one side of this hyperplane to each point determines its classification as belonging to that class (+1), or it belongs to the other class (-1). This works well for most datasets where there are clear boundaries that can be drawn in the input space, but not all datasets can be well represented by such an interpretation. To address this limitation, support vector machines use regularization techniques like penalty terms or constraints to force the decision boundary to stay close to the training examples. These approaches make the model less sensitive to small variations in the training data and improve its generalization performance. 

In SVR, we want to predict a continuous output variable instead of a discrete class label. We don't need a hyperplane to separate classes in this case, so we optimize a cost function directly over the training data. Our loss function penalizes misclassifications and also tries to minimize the difference between predicted values and actual values within certain error bounds. For example, we might choose a squared error loss with a tolerance parameter that controls how far our predictions can deviate from their true values. Unlike standard linear regression, SVR does not assume any functional form for the underlying relationship between inputs and outputs, making it more flexible than traditional methods. 


## Specific steps involved:To train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, we follow these specific steps:

1- Collect a dataset containing labeled samples, X and corresponding target values, Y, e.g., medical test results or sales prices.

2- Choose a suitable kernel function or set of features to map the input space into a higher dimensional space, which will enable us to solve non-linear problems if needed. 

3- Normalize the data to have zero mean and unit variance, if needed, so that the different scales of variables do not affect the solution quality too much.

4- Split the dataset into training and validation sets, if necessary, to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data later on.

5- Train the SVM/SVR model using the chosen optimization method and parameters. The choice of optimization technique depends on the nature of the problem at hand, but commonly used algorithms include gradient descent based methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, etc. Other optimization techniques include Quadratic Programming (QP) and Bayesian Optimization. In addition, modern deep learning techniques such as neural networks or convolutional neural networks may also be used depending on the size and complexity of the data.

After the training process, we should evaluate the accuracy of the trained model on both the training and validation sets. If the validation accuracy is not significantly improved compared to the initial training phase, we may try different choices of optimization technique or hyperparameters, increase the number of iterations, or try a different kernel function or feature mapping. We repeat this process until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.

6- Once we are satisfied with the performance of the model, we can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. For SVM models, we can simply apply the learned transformation to new instances, effectively projecting them onto the high-dimensional feature space and finding the nearest support vector along the margin to assign the instance to the appropriate class. Alternatively, for SVR models, we could use a similar approach, but take into account the uncertainty associated with the prediction using confidence intervals or probability distributions rather than just assigning the output value to the nearest support vector alone.
