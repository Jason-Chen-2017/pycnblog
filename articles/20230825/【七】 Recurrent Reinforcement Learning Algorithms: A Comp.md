# 1.简介
  

> Recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) refers to a class of deep learning models that incorporate both sequential and non-sequential information in the reinforcement learning task, where sequential information refers to temporally consecutive states and actions, while non-sequential information refers to auxiliary observations or contextual information. These models can learn complex dependencies among multiple variables over time by encoding both historical and current events into hidden representations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNN-based methods have shown impressive performance in solving various control tasks, such as robotic control, speech recognition, language modeling, and recommendation systems. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in RRL algorithms and their key features, including memory management mechanisms, state representation learning techniques, exploration strategies, and off-policy evaluation methods. We also discuss how these advancements contribute towards addressing some of the challenges in RRL research and development, such as scalability and sample efficiency. Finally, we conclude with future directions for research in RRL areas.

Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RRL)方法（如LSTM、GRU等）是一种深度学习模型，可以融合强化学习任务中同时包含顺序信息和非顺序信息的信息。顺序信息指的是时间序列连续的状态和行为，而非顺序信息则包括辅助观测或上下文信息。这些模型通过使用循环神经网络（RNNs）将历史事件和当前事件编码到隐藏表示中，从而能够在时间维度上对多种变量进行复杂的依赖关系建模。基于RNN的方法已经证明了在解决各种控制任务方面有着卓越的性能，例如机械臂控制、语音识别、语言建模、推荐系统等。本文重点探讨了近年来RRL领域的最新进展及其关键特征，包括记忆管理机制、状态表示学习技术、探索策略、离线评估方法。同时也谈论了这些进展如何推动RRL研究与发展的某些方面，如可扩展性和采样效率等。最后，我们给出了RRL领域的未来的方向。

# 2.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is capable of processing sequential data like sequences, text, audio signals, etc. It has three main components - input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. The inputs pass through the first hidden layer, then through each subsequent hidden layer before finally being passed on to the output layer. This process occurs repeatedly until the desired output is achieved. 


An illustration of an RNN architecture showing the flow of information from input to output. An RNN takes a sequence of inputs $x_t$ at every step along with its previous hidden state $\hat{h}_{t-1}$ and outputs the predicted value $y_t$. The equation for calculating the new hidden state is given below:

$$\hat{h}_t = \text{tanh}(W_{xh} x_t + W_{hh}\hat{h}_{t-1} + b_h) $$

where $W_{xh}, W_{hh}, b_h$ are weights and bias vectors used to transform the input vector $x_t$, previous hidden state $\hat{h}_{t-1}$, and bias term respectively. The tanh activation function is applied on the sum of weighted inputs and biases after which it becomes the new hidden state $\hat{h}_t$.

# Types of RNNs
There are several types of RNN architectures based on different levels of complexity in the model structure and implementation. Some common ones include:

1. Basic RNN - This basic form of an RNN consists of one hidden layer only, which receives the same input at all steps. It does not use any feedback connection between the hidden units and therefore cannot capture long-term dependencies between past values of the input signal. The equations for updating the hidden state $\hat{h}_t$ and generating the output prediction $y_t$ remain the same as in regular feedforward neural networks. However, the memory of the last input depends on the previous state rather than the actual input itself, resulting in vanishing gradients problem when training large RNNs. 

2. LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a variant of the basic RNN that includes a feedback loop inside the cell that helps to remember long-term dependencies. It maintains two gates - forget gate and input gate - that control the amount of information that flows from the input to the hidden state, and the output gate controls what gets exposed outside the cell. The equations for updating the hidden state $\hat{h}_t$ and generating the output prediction $y_t$ are similar to those of the basic RNN, but with additions to handle the gating mechanism.

3. GRU - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is another variant of the basic RNN that removes the hidden-to-hidden connections that allow long-term dependencies within the RNN cells. Instead, it uses update and reset gates to regulate the flow of information across the hidden state. It involves less computational resources compared to LSTMs, but achieves comparable performance under most circumstances.

# Training an RNN Model
Training an RNN requires minimizing a loss function during backpropagation, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the true target label. There are several ways to train an RNN depending on the size and complexity of the dataset. Some popular approaches include:

1. Vanilla Backpropogation - This is a standard approach for training RNNs without any modifications. During training, the algorithm propagates backwards through time and adjusts the parameters of the model to minimize the error between predictions and targets.

2. Truncated BPTT - In truncated backpropagation through time (BPTT), the gradient calculation stops at a certain point in time, typically set to be half of the total length of the sequence. This reduces the risk of vanishing gradients and helps prevent exploding gradients issue during training. Additionally, it allows us to split the entire sequence into smaller batches and optimize the model more efficiently.

3. Gradient Clipping - Another technique to avoid exploding gradients is to clip the gradients of the loss function to a specific range during optimization. This prevents the updates from becoming too large and causing numerical instabilities during training.

4. Dropout Regularization - Dropout is a technique that randomly drops out a fraction of neurons during training to prevent co-adaption of neurons. It helps improve generalization capability of the model.

# 3.Memory Management Mechanisms
Memory management is essential in RRL, especially when dealing with sequential decision making problems where agents need to make decisions on a stream of incoming sensory data. Three common memory management mechanisms are:

1. Eligibility traces - Eligibility traces help the agent selectively retain or discard relevant memories in response to changes in the environment. When an action leads to positive outcome, eligibility traces increase; otherwise they decrease. At each timestep, the eligibility trace decays by a factor $\lambda$. Once the eligibility trace reaches zero, the memory is forgotten.

2. Replay buffer - A replay buffer stores a fixed number of experiences that the agent can access at random. At each iteration, the agent samples a batch of experiences from the buffer and performs an update operation on them, thus imitating the behavior of the learner from a history of past experiences.

3. State abstraction - Similarly to human cognitive processes, abstracting the underlying state space enables the agent to focus on parts of the state that are important for making decisions. This can be done using handcrafted features or learned embeddings.

# 4.State Representation Learning Techniques
Learning good representations of the state is critical in RRL, particularly for tasks that involve high dimensional continuous spaces like image classification and motion planning. Four commonly used state representation learning techniques are:

1. One-hot Encoding - This method maps each possible state in the domain to a unique binary vector. For example, if there are 10 possible colors and 5 objects present in the scene, the encoded state would contain 15 elements, with each element representing whether a color or object is present or absent in the scene.

2. Embeddings - This method represents each state as a dense embedding vector in a low-dimensional space. Unlike one-hot encoding, this method captures spatial relationships and correlations between features.

3. Deep Autoencoders - Deep autoencoder consists of two stacked fully connected layers, each consisting of multiple layers. The encoder decomposes the input into a lower-dimensional latent space, and the decoder generates a reconstructed output close to the original input. By forcing the encoder to extract meaningful features from the raw state, we can achieve better state representation learning.

4. Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs are well suited for handling temporal or spatial variations in the input data. They operate on local patches of the input and produce a single feature map per patch. Therefore, CNNs are suitable for capturing long-range interactions and dependencies in the input space. 

# 5.Exploration Strategies
In an interactive system like a game or robotics, exploratory behavior plays an essential role in improving learning speed and acquisition of optimal policies. Several exploration strategies are available for RRL, including:

1. Random Actions - This strategy selects a random action uniformly at random from all possible actions.

2. Epsilon-Greedy Strategy - This strategy chooses a random action with probability epsilon, whereas the remaining probability mass is allocated to the best known action according to the policy. Epsilon starts high, which means the agent takes random actions frequently. As the agent’s experience increases, epsilon gradually decreases, allowing the agent to take more confident and explorative actions.

3. UCB1 Exploration Strategy - This strategy assigns higher probabilities to uncertain regions of the action space, since the expected reward of choosing an action from an uncertain region is greater than picking a random action.

4. Bayesian Optimization - This method searches the parameter space for the maximum of a black-box objective function, while taking into account the uncertainty in the model's predictions. Bayesian optimization builds a probabilistic model of the objective function based on prior evaluations of the function, and suggests points for evaluating the objective function in order to find the global maximum.

5. Thompson Sampling - Thompson sampling is a Bayesian inference algorithm that works by assuming a Gaussian distribution for each action parameter, and randomly selecting actions based on a sampled mean estimate and variance estimate. It can often outperform other exploration strategies because it takes into account both the uncertainty in the policy and the likelihood of performing good actions.

# 6.Off-Policy Evaluation Methods
Offline evaluation is essential for verifying the accuracy and reliability of RRL policies. While online evaluation provides real-time insights, offline evaluation is crucial for measuring the true performance of the trained agent. Offline evaluation methods include:

1. Importance Sampling - Importance sampling is a way to modify the returns calculated by the agent so that the estimated Q values converge to the true return. It creates a weight for each observation based on the ratio of the immediate reward to the maximum possible return that can be obtained by following the current policy.

2. Doubly Robust Estimation - Double robust estimation attempts to simultaneously consider both the observed reward and the unobserved noise introduced due to stochasticity in the dynamics. It combines the estimates of the best-case outcomes and worst-case outcomes and accounts for the correlation between the noisy transitions.

3. Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) - CEM is a heuristic search algorithm that trains a controller by optimizing the cross entropy between the current policy and a newly generated rollout policy that improves over time. CEM leverages Monte Carlo methods to generate candidate policies, and iteratively updates the best found policy until convergence.

4. Per Step Adjustment - Per step adjustment modifies the importance sampling algorithm to treat each transition independently instead of combining all the transitions together. This makes the estimate more accurate, but slower and less efficient than importance sampling.

# 7.Scalable Recurrent Reinforcement Learning Systems
The power of RRL lies in its ability to learn complex dependencies among multiple variables over time by encoding both historical and current events into hidden representations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). To scale RRL systems, four key factors should be considered:

1. Distributed Computing Frameworks - Distributed computing frameworks enable parallel computation of large datasets across multiple computers, leading to faster training times and reduced hardware costs. Popular examples include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache Spark, and Ray.

2. Large Scale Storage - To store large amounts of data, cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage can be used.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning - Hyperparameters like learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate should be fine-tuned using methods like grid search or randomized search to optimize the performance of the system.

4. Parallel Architecture - To exploit multi-core CPUs and GPUs for parallelization, advanced distributed computing technologies like message passing interfaces (MPI) or asynchronous programming models like Actor-Critic can be used.
