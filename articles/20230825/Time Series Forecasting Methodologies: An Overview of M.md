Time series forecasting is a process of predicting future values of time-dependent variables based on past observations. It plays an essential role in various industries such as finance, energy, transportation, and manufacturing, where accurate predictions are crucial for making business decisions or taking preventive measures. 

The objective of this article is to provide an overview of several methodologies used for time series forecasting. We will discuss the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of each approach before highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we will explain how these approaches can be combined together to improve forecast accuracy. Finally, we will give some suggestions about when to use which methodology depending on different factors such as data size, frequency, seasonality, etc. This article is targeted at advanced technical professionals who have expertise in machine learning, statistical analysis, algorithms development, and programming languages. 

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the specific details of each methodology, let’s first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to time series forecasting. 

## 2.1 Data Types and Contextualization
Time series data typically consists of two types of information:

1. **Univariate**: Each observation corresponds to one variable. For example, in stock market prices, there may be multiple univariate time series corresponding to different stock symbols. 

2. **Multivariate**: There may be more than one variable measured over time. For instance, in weather data, temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, etc., all contribute to creating multivariate time series. 

In addition to these two types of data, there could also exist contextual information that impacts the time series data itself. For example, if we are analyzing sales trends for a retail store, it might include information like holiday seasons, promotional campaigns, industry trends, and economic indicators that affect sales volume. These additional features can greatly influence the behavior of the time series and lead to non-stationarity in the data.

## 2.2 Stationarity
Stationarity refers to a property of time series where the statistical properties of the data do not change over time. Specifically, stationarity requires three conditions:

1. The mean (average) value of the time series does not change with respect to time.

2. The variance of the time series does not change with respect to time.

3. The covariance between any pair of adjacent times in the time series remains constant.

For most time series datasets, condition #3 alone cannot guarantee stationarity. Therefore, other tests need to be applied to identify and remove any temporal patterns from the dataset. 

## 2.3 Seasonality
Seasonality refers to the periodic fluctuations in time series data that occur every year or month or week or day. In many real-world scenarios, seasonality occurs naturally due to external forces such as weather variations, natural cycles, or human behaviors. However, it can also arise through deliberate manipulation of system dynamics. 

Seasonal components can cause challenges for time series models because they require special attention during model training and prediction. When seasonal effects dominate the time series, it becomes difficult to separate the signal from the noise and make accurate predictions.

## 2.4 Trend and Level
Trend and level components describe the overall direction and amplitude of changes in time series data respectively. While trends capture long-term relationships between variables, levels capture short-term shifts in those relationships. By understanding both trends and levels, we can better forecast future values in terms of underlying mechanisms rather than purely by measuring changes. 

However, since trends and levels themselves tend to vary over time, traditional regression methods cannot capture them effectively unless they are decomposed into individual components. ARIMA and STL methods offer effective ways to extract and analyze trends and levels separately. 

# 3. Methodologies
Now that we know what kinds of data we are working with and why we care about it, let’s dive deeper into the various methodologies used for time series forecasting.

## 3.1 Naïve Model
The naïve model assumes that the next observation in the series will be equal to the current observation. This means that we simply repeat the previous observation without considering its own historical relationship. As a result, the forecasted values are highly dependent on the quality of our initial guess, making it less useful in practice. Despite being simple and intuitive, the naïve model has been shown to perform well in certain cases but fails to generate reliable forecasts under other circumstances.

## 3.2 Simple Average
Simple average method computes the average of the last few observations in order to predict the next one. It provides a good starting point for predicting future values but suffers from several drawbacks. First, it can be sensitive to sudden changes in the series that may not reflect actual trends. Second, it tends to overestimate the variability of the series. Third, it cannot account for complex seasonal patterns in the series.

## 3.3 Moving Average
Moving average method uses a weighted average of the recent observations to predict the next value. More specifically, it takes a moving window of fixed width, consisting of the latest observations, and calculates the average using the weights assigned to each observation. It addresses some of the drawbacks of the simple average method by smoothing out the noise caused by small variations in the series and capturing the general shape of the curve. It can handle short-term oscillations but doesn't take into account longer term trends and volatility.

## 3.4 Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
Exponential smoothing (ETS) is a popular family of methods designed to estimate a time series' parameters by iteratively updating estimates with new data points. ETS techniques follow the same principle as the simpler methods discussed above – start with some intial guesses for the parameter values and then iteratively update them based on the relative closeness of the predicted and observed values. The key difference is that exponential smoothing allows us to control the weight given to each previous data point in the calculation of the updated parameter values. 

ETS models allow us to capture short-term and medium-term trends in the series while still accounting for seasonal patterns. They are very robust to extreme values and non-linearities in the data. They can produce impressive results even on relatively small datasets and are often suitable for applications requiring fast response times or high accuracy. However, they can also overfit to noise in the data and perform poorly when the seasonal periodicity is too large or the irregular nature of the data makes inference challenging.

## 3.5 Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is a powerful class of methods used for modeling univariate time series with seasonal effects. It builds upon the principles of differencing and moving average techniques to model the dependency between observations within the series. The main idea behind ARIMA is that the correlation structure of the error terms is stable over time, so we should be able to model the dependencies by specifying the number of past errors (lags) to consider.

The major advantage of ARIMA is that it can automatically select optimal lag lengths and coefficients based on a set of performance criteria, reducing the likelihood of overfitting or underfitting the data. It also handles missing data and leverages prior knowledge of the data's distribution to detect and correct structural breakpoints. 

Despite its efficiency, ARIMA falls short in handling complex multivariate time series with multiple seasonal periods or non-linear dynamics. In these cases, the ETS and Holt-Winters methods come to the rescue.

## 3.6 Holt-Winters
Holt-Winters (HW) models extend the ARIMA framework by incorporating a second-order trend component along with four optional seasonal components. The primary advantage of HW models is that they can better capture both long-term trends and short-term oscillations while also taking into account the presence of seasonal patterns.

While HW models offer greater flexibility than ARIMA models, they are also more computationally expensive to train and infer compared to simpler models. Thus, they are only suitable for larger datasets with fewer seasonal cycles. 

## 3.7 Structural Time Series Models
Structural Time Series Models (STS) represent a novel type of algorithm that combines state space models with deep neural networks (DNNs). Unlike traditional ML algorithms, STS models learn the latent space representation of the time series directly from the raw data, bypassing the requirement for preprocessing or feature engineering.

STS models can capture non-linear dynamics and seasonality in the data by explicitly modelling the causal relationships between the variables over time. DNNs are then used to estimate the parameters of these causal structures from the data itself. These hybrid models combine the benefits of DNNs and SSMs while avoiding their respective drawbacks.

## 3.8 Ensembles
Ensemble methods attempt to combine the outputs of multiple independent models to create a single output that is more robust against individual failures. Common ensemble methods include bagging, boosting, stacking, and averaging. Bagging involves randomly sampling subsets of the data and combining the resulting models to reduce variance. Boosting involves incrementally building models that focus on areas that are misclassified by the existing models, leading to improved performance. Stacking involves combining the outputs of multiple base models and adding a meta learner that combines their outputs. 

Overall, the choice of appropriate model depends on the amount of available data, the complexity of the problem, and the desired tradeoff between bias and variance. The simplest and easiest-to-use model(s) such as naïve or simple average can be sufficient for many tasks.
