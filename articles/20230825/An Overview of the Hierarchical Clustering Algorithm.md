Hierarchical clustering is a popular technique in data mining and machine learning that groups similar objects into clusters. It has been used to analyze large datasets such as gene expression or market segmentation for years. In this article, we will give an overview of hierarchical clustering algorithm using the example of image segmentation.

Image segmentation refers to dividing an image into regions based on visual features such as color and texture. These regions are then labeled with semantic information such as foreground/background or object boundaries. The goal of image segmentation is to identify individual elements within an image by creating coherent areas. With the development of deep learning techniques, it becomes more important than ever to develop algorithms capable of handling complex images and extracting relevant features. 

The hierarchical clustering algorithm is one type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm that helps cluster similar objects together. The key idea behind this approach is to build a hierarchy of clusters from bottom-up, where each cluster contains only members of its own level or parent node. At each iteration, a new cluster is created by merging two neighboring nodes until all objects have been assigned to their respective leaf nodes. This process continues recursively until all clusters reach the desired depth or minimum size limit. 

In addition to grouping similar objects together, the hierarchical clustering algorithm can also reveal interesting patterns in the data that may not be immediately obvious. For example, if there is a high density of white pixels in an image, these could indicate distinct regions of interest. Similarly, if there is an imbalance between the number of objects across different levels of the hierarchy, this indicates some underlying structure or organization that needs further investigation. By analyzing the resulting dendrogram (a tree-like plot), experts can gain insights into how the data should be segmented. Finally, the ability to visualize the results through clustering plots makes the process easier to understand for non-technical users.

This article provides a brief introduction to the hierarchical clustering algorithm, focusing on the image segmentation application. We hope you find this article helpful! Let's get started...


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before we move on to the actual algorithm, let’s discuss some basic concepts and terminology related to hierarchical clustering. If you already know these terms, feel free to skip ahead. 


## 2.1 Dendogram
A dendrogram is a graphical representation of the hierarchical clustering produced by the algorithm. It shows the relationships between clusters at different levels of granularity. Each branch represents a merge operation performed during the clustering process, while the length of the branches show the similarity between the corresponding clusters. A vertical line drawn upwards along a branch denotes the threshold value used to form the child nodes. The height of each branch shows the degree of membership of each point to the corresponding cluster.


## 2.2 Distance Measurements
To perform hierarchical clustering, the distance measurement method must be chosen carefully. There are several commonly used methods: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, cosine distance, etc. All of them measure the dissimilarity between two points, which is essential for defining the proximity among clusters. Choosing the appropriate distance metric depends on the problem being solved and the available data.

For the purpose of image segmentation, Euclidean distance and mean squared error (MSE) are usually used because they work well with pixel intensity values. Another option is to use RGB color space distances instead of grayscale intensities. However, since RGB colors can capture more complex variations, color space distances might produce better results depending on the specific dataset.

## 2.3 K-means Initialization
K-means initialization is a common strategy for initializing the centroid positions when performing k-means clustering. In contrast to other clustering approaches like agglomerative clustering, hierarchical clustering does not require pre-defined parameters such as the number of clusters or predefined initial centroid locations. Instead, a top-down approach is used where the dendrogram is constructed iteratively by merging adjacent clusters until the required number of clusters is reached. During each step of the clustering process, the nearest neighbors of the current centroids are found and used as starting points for the next iteration.
