Voice assistants have become an essential part of our daily lives. They can perform various tasks such as making phone calls, answering emails, searching for information on the internet and playing music without having to use a keyboard or touchscreen. As technology advances, voice assistants will become more advanced in terms of accuracy, speed, functionality and interactivity. However, building your own voice assistant requires expertise in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, deep learning algorithms and software development. In this article, we will walk you through building your very own personalized voice assistant using Python and some popular libraries like SpeechRecognition, PyAudio, TensorFlow etc. We will also see how to deploy it into production level. This is definitely not an easy task but we'll make it worth while by guiding you step-by-step. Let's get started!
## 2.1 What are voice assistants? 
A voice assistant is any application that provides an interface between humans and computers via speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion and interaction with a user's device. Some examples include Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri and Baidu DuerOS. Among these applications, there is a trend towards third-party integrations which allows users to add their favorite apps and services to interact with them using voice commands.

## 2.2 Why build a personal voice assistant?
Building a personal voice assistant has many benefits. Firstly, it helps people to be independent from their devices. Secondly, it enhances communication skills. Thirdly, it makes life easier and improves productivity. Moreover, companies often hire personal voice assistants to provide customers with a conversational experience over traditional interfaces. Finally, building your own voice assistant opens up many doors for personalization and customization. You can tailor it according to your preferences and needs. For example, if you want to listen to a particular genre of music, you can customize your assistant to play only that type of music. Similarly, if you want your assistant to integrate with specific appliances and technologies, you can easily modify its code to achieve those functionalities.

## 2.3 How does the building process work?
The first step would be understanding what voice assistance involves. The second step would be choosing a programming language suitable for building the voice assistant. Once you've chosen the right language, you need to research NLP, machine learning, deep learning algorithms and audio processing libraries. Next, you need to gather data sets containing examples of user input and expected output. Then, you can start developing your AI model based on the collected data. Finally, you can test your assistant and deploy it into production for further testing and usage. 

In general, the following steps should be followed:

1. Choose a programming language
2. Research NLP, ML and DL algorithms
3. Collect training data sets
4. Build an AI model using relevant algorithms
5. Test the AI model
6. Deploy the AI model into production

Let's go ahead and dive deeper into each step one at a time. 

## Step 1: Choosing a Programming Language
Choosing a programming language is a critical decision since it determines how complex your project becomes. There are several languages available that support different requirements including Java, C++, Swift, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby and GoLang. Python seems to be the most popular choice among developers due to its simple syntax, ease of readability, well-documented libraries and extensive community support. Additionally, Python supports both NLP and ML libraries that simplify the process of building the voice assistant. Here's how to set up a virtual environment for Python:

1. Install virtualenv - pip install virtualenv
2. Create a new virtual environment - virtualenv myenv
3. Activate the environment - source myenv/bin/activate

Now that you have a working virtual environment, let's move forward to installing required packages. These include SpeechRecognition, PyAudio, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow and Flask. We recommend using the latest versions of all the above mentioned packages because they contain important updates and bug fixes. Here's how to install the required packages:

```python
pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio numpy scipy scikit-learn keras tensorflow flask
```

With all the necessary prerequisites installed, we're ready to begin building the voice assistant.
