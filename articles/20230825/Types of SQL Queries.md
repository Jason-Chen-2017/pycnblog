# 1.简介
  

SQL（Structured Query Language）是用于管理关系数据库的语言。该语言由美国计算机科学家、数据库专家尼尔·E.布劳恩斯于1986年提出。它是一种声明性语言，即用户只需指定需要进行什么查询或数据更新即可，而不需要编写复杂的代码或命令。由于其易用性和灵活性，使得SQL被广泛应用在各种各样的数据库系统中，包括Oracle、MySQL、PostgreSQL、Microsoft SQL Server等。本文将尝试从最基本的SELECT语句开始，通过深入分析SQL中的各类查询方法，理解其背后的逻辑机制和优缺点，从而帮助读者更好地理解SQL及如何有效使用SQL。

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terms
## 2.1 Data Definition Language (DDL)
Data definition language (DDL) is used to define database objects such as tables, views, indexes, etc. It includes statements like CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP INDEX, etc. These commands are executed by the system administrator or programmer who has created the database instance. The DDL allows us to create a new table, modify an existing one, drop unnecessary objects from the database schema, and rename tables or columns without affecting their data. 

Here's an example:

    CREATE TABLE employees (
        emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(50),
        age INT
    );
    
    ALTER TABLE employees ADD salary DECIMAL(7,2);
    
The above code creates a "employees" table with three columns - emp_id, name, and age. We've specified that the emp_id column must be unique and the other two are non-null. Additionally, we've added a new column named salary which can store decimal values up to seven numbers after the decimal point. This command doesn't actually insert any data into the table yet. To do so, we need to use another statement called INSERT.

## 2.2 Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Data manipulation language (DML) is used for inserting, updating, and deleting data from the tables in the database. It includes statements like SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE FROM, etc. Here's an example:

    INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30, 50000.00);
    UPDATE employees SET age = 31 WHERE emp_id = 1;
    DELETE FROM employees WHERE emp_id = 2;
    
In the first line of the above code, we're adding a new row to our "employees" table with emp_id=1, name='John Doe', age=30, and salary=50000. In the second line, we're updating the age of employee number 1 to 31. Finally, in the third line, we're removing the record of employee number 2 from the table. Note that these changes won't persist unless we commit them to the database using another command called COMMIT.

## 2.3 Transaction Control Language (TCL)
Transaction control language (TCL) provides commands for managing transactions. Transactions allow multiple SQL commands to be executed together within a single transaction. If all the commands succeed, then the transaction is committed; otherwise, it's rolled back. Here's an example:

    BEGIN TRANSACTION;   -- start a transaction
   ...
    COMMIT;              -- end the transaction if everything goes well
    OR
    ROLLBACK;            -- discard all the changes if something goes wrong.

The BEGIN TRANSACTION statement starts a new transaction block. All the subsequent SQL commands will become part of this transaction until either they complete successfully or there is a problem. Once the transaction is complete, you should either commit the changes using the COMMIT statement or rollback them using the ROLLBACK statement.

## 2.4 Data Control Language (DCL)
Data control language (DCL) is used for controlling access to the database resources. It includes statements like GRANT, REVOKE, etc., which grant or revoke privileges on database objects to users or roles. Here's an example:

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO'myuser'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;      -- update user permissions immediately.

This code grants all the privileges on all the databases to the user "myuser". Make sure to flush the privileges once you make any changes to the user permissions.

# 3.Queries Introduction
Now that we have some basic understanding about the various components of SQL, let's dive deeper into different types of queries. Below are the common types of SQL queries along with examples and explanations:

1. SELECT Statement : A SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from the database. It consists of four main parts - the SELECT keyword, columns list, table reference, and optional conditions. Here's an example:

        SELECT emp_id, name, salary 
        FROM employees 
        WHERE dept = 'Marketing'; 
        
	In the above query, we're selecting the emp_id, name, and salary columns from the employees table where the department is Marketing. 

2. INSERT Statement : An INSERT statement is used to add new rows to the database. It takes three main parts - the INSERT keyword, table reference, and a set of values to insert. Here's an example:

        INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name, age, salary) 
        VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 35, 60000.00);
        
	In the above query, we're inserting a new row into the employees table with emp_id=2, name='Jane Smith', age=35, and salary=60000.00.

3. UPDATE Statement : An UPDATE statement is used to modify existing rows in the database. It takes three main parts - the UPDATE keyword, table reference, and a set of values to update. Here's an example:

        UPDATE employees 
        SET age = 36 
        WHERE emp_id = 3;
        
	In the above query, we're modifying the age of employee number 3 to 36 in the employees table.

4. DELETE Statement : A DELETE statement is used to delete rows from the database. It takes two main parts - the DELETE keyword and the table reference. Here's an example:

        DELETE FROM employees 
        WHERE emp_id > 3;
        
	In the above query, we're deleting all the records from the employees table where the emp_id is greater than 3.

5. INNER JOIN : An INNER JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It uses the keyword INNER JOIN followed by the names of both tables, join condition, and optionally the alias of each table. Here's an example:
        
        SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_number 
        FROM customers 
        INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
	In the above query, we're joining the customers and orders tables on the customer_id column.

6. LEFT OUTER JOIN : A LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all the rows from the left table, even those whose matching rows don’t exist in the right table. It uses the keyword LEFT OUTER JOIN followed by the names of both tables, join condition, and optionally the alias of each table. Here's an example:

        SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_number 
        FROM customers 
        LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

7. RIGHT OUTER JOIN : A RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all the rows from the right table, even those whose matching rows don’t exist in the left table. It uses the keyword RIGHT OUTER JOIN followed by the names of both tables, join condition, and optionally the alias of each table. Here's an example:

        SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_number 
        FROM customers 
        RIGHT OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
8. UNION Operator : A UNION operator combines the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. It uses the keyword UNION followed by the second SELECT statement to merge with the first one. Here's an example:
        
        SELECT emp_id, name, salary 
        FROM employees 
        WHERE dept = 'Marketing' 
        UNION 
        SELECT emp_id, name, salary 
        FROM employees 
        WHERE dept = 'Sales';

9. DISTINCT Keyword : A DISTINCT keyword removes duplicate rows from the result set. It's often used in combination with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM() or AVG(). Here's an example:

        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dept) 
        FROM employees;
        
	In the above query, we're counting the number of distinct departments present in the employees table.


With these basics down, let's move onto some more advanced topics.
