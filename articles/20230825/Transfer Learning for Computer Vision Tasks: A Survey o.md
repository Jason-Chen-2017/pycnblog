Transfer learning is a popular technique in deep learning where pre-trained models are fine-tuned to the target task of interest using labeled or unlabeled data, which significantly reduces the amount of training data needed and accelerates model convergence. The key idea behind transfer learning is that large datasets can be leveraged to train powerful models that perform well on various tasks without requiring extensive retraining. This survey presents an overview of techniques, practices, and applications of transfer learning in computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. It also highlights the advantages and challenges of transfer learning and outlines future research directions. 

In this paper, we will focus on three main areas of transfer learning in computer vision tasks, namely finetuning, feature extraction, and self-supervised learning. In each area, we will first discuss its background and motivation, then present how it works and why it may work better than standard supervised training methods. We will then move onto more specific details about how these techniques are applied in practice, such as selecting suitable architectures and optimizing hyperparameters. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of different transfer learning methods using benchmark datasets and compare their results with other state-of-the-art approaches. These evaluations will provide insights into the tradeoffs between various techniques and enable practitioners to make informed decisions when choosing a method for a given application scenario.

# 2. Background Introduction
Deep neural networks have achieved impressive progress in recent years due to their ability to learn complex relationships between features from input data. However, these models often require massive amounts of annotated training data to generalize well to new domains, making them challenging to deploy in real-world applications. Transfer learning provides a way to address this issue by leveraging large pre-trained models trained on large datasets like ImageNet, which have been shown to achieve exceptional performance on many computer vision tasks. By fine-tuning these models to solve the new task, we can adapt them to the specific characteristics of the target domain and improve their accuracy over time. With transfer learning, we can train models that perform well on a variety of tasks with minimal annotations and potentially reduce the need for expensive labeling efforts.

 # Transfer learning in computer vision tasks
To understand transfer learning better, let’s briefly go through some common computer vision tasks and the types of transfer learning techniques used in them. 

 ## Image Classification
 Image classification refers to classifying images into one of several predefined categories, such as animals, vehicles, fruits, etc. One example of a simple image classifier could involve taking an image as input, passing it through multiple convolution layers followed by pooling layers, and finally performing fully connected layer computations to produce a probability distribution over all possible classes. Here, we want to use a pre-trained model such as VGG or ResNet as the starting point instead of training the entire network from scratch. During the initial stages of training, the weights of the pre-trained layers would still be frozen so that they do not change during subsequent iterations of backpropagation.
 
 There are two main approaches to apply transfer learning in image classification:
   - Fine-tuning: Since the dataset used for fine-tuning typically contains fewer examples per category compared to the original dataset, we only adjust the last few layers of the network rather than retraining everything from scratch. For instance, if we have a dataset with 100 examples per class vs. the original ImageNet dataset containing 1 million images per class, we might only fine-tune the top layers of a pre-trained VGG16 network, leaving the lower layers untouched.
   
   - Feature extraction: Instead of fine-tuning the full network, we extract useful features learned by the pre-trained layers and feed them directly into our own final classification layer(s). This approach can help us save both computation time and storage space since we are only training a small set of parameters to classify our target objects. One example of this approach is called "bottleneck" feature extraction, where we freeze the weights of all layers except the very last one(s), collect the output of those layers, and pass them through a linear classifier head for prediction. Another option is to use pre-trained models as fixed feature extractors and train additional layers on top of them, similar to fine-tuning.
 
## Object Detection 
Object detection involves locating and identifying multiple instances of the same object in an image. It requires handling the variability in shape, size, and location of objects, as well as the complexity of occlusion and clutter. To handle this challenge, we usually use a sliding window approach to propose candidate bounding boxes around potential objects and filter out the false positives based on confidence scores assigned to each box. Once we have a list of filtered candidates, we can apply non-max suppression (NMS) to select the true positive boxes with high confidence scores. After filtering, we can use ROI pooling to extract features from each region of interest and send them through a fully connected layer for classification.

One type of transfer learning commonly used in object detection is called "fine-tuning". In this case, we start with a pre-trained detector such as YOLO v3 or SSD, remove the final detection layer(s), and replace them with custom layers tailored to our specific problem. We keep all other layers of the network frozen and train just these custom layers to recognize the objects of interest in our dataset. Unlike image classification, the detector layers remain part of the overall architecture and are continually updated throughout training. We can also use transfer learning to speed up training by initializing the detector weights from a pre-trained model and freezing all other layers.


## Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation refers to dividing an image into semantic regions defined by specific colors or patterns. An example of a classic semantic segmentation task is autonomous driving where we want to identify individual road boundaries, obstacles, and other vehicle parts in real-time. To accomplish this task, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that take an RGB image as input and produce a pixelwise annotation map indicating the presence or absence of certain semantic classes such as road, car, pedestrian, etc. Our objective is to minimize the difference between predicted and ground truth annotations by updating the CNN weights iteratively. While the process of training a CNN to perform semantic segmentation can seem daunting, there are several techniques and strategies that can be employed to optimize the learning process. Some of the most common include:

   - Fully convolutional networks (FCNs): These networks consist of stacked convolutional layers followed by transposed convolutional layers that resize the output of earlier layers back to the original spatial dimensions of the input. They offer great flexibility in terms of design and parameter count, enabling efficient processing of large inputs.
   
   - U-nets: These networks consist of an encoder and decoder structure, where the former extracts higher-level features from the input image, and the latter merges them with low-resolution representations extracted from the corresponding output of the previous layer. U-net's properties make it ideal for dealing with highly irregular shapes or large distances between objects.
   
   - Encoder-decoder networks: These networks have two components separated by skip connections that allow information to flow seamlessly from one component to the next. Each block consists of several convolutional layers, activation functions, and pooling operations. Encoder networks downsample the input image and capture global contextual information, while decoder networks upsample the encoded representation and reconstruct the original image pixels. Encoder-decoder networks combine the benefits of convolutional networks with the capabilities of decoders for predicting the desired outputs in an end-to-end manner.
