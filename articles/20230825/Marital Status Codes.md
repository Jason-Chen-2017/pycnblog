# 1.简介
  

Marital status codes (MSC) are a commonly used code system for recording marital status in countries around the world. The MSC covers various categories such as single, married, divorced, widowed, separated and legally recognized cohabitation arrangements between spouses or other family members with marital affairs being held separately but together. In addition to covering multiple cultures and contexts, there is an international standardization initiative that has brought these codes into common use by governments, industry organizations and healthcare professionals. In this article we will explore how MSC work and their importance in human biology.
# 2.Conceptualization and Terminology
Marital status refers to the legal relationship between two people, typically referred to as husband and wife, who have been married or otherwise legally recognized for life. There can be different types of relationships, including:

1. **Single**: This means both individuals are not currently living together. 
2. **Married**: This means that the spouses are currently living together but have relinquished any form of traditional marriage. 
3. **Divorced**: This occurs when one spouse objects to the other's decision to separate from them due to a breakdown in communication, separation, or financial difficulty. 
4. **Widowed/Deceased**: This indicates that one of the spouses has passed away and lost all contact with their partner. They may be remembered by one or more surviving spouses through letters, religious texts, or personal memories. 
5. **Separated**: A legal contractual arrangement between the spouses exists but they have agreed on temporarily dividing their relationship until further notice. 
6. **Legally recognized cohabitations**: These include cases where one spouse lives with another sponsored child, spouse-parent combination or some other shared living arrangement within a family unit. However, it is important to note that these types of arrangements are usually regulated differently than traditional marriages and require special permission.

To communicate effectively using codes related to marital status, it is essential to establish a consistent framework. Many countries use different coding systems depending on culture, ethnicity, and historical context. In North America, the most widely used coding system is CDC’s Multicultural System (MSS). Here is a brief summary of the MSS: 

1. Single = S
2. Divorced = D
3. Separated = L
4. Widowed = W
5. Legally recognized cohabitation = C
6. Married = M
7. Other/Unknown = X
 
The concept of gender and sex does not apply equally across cultures. Some cultures may consider male and female identities distinctly while others may regard genders as neutral and unisex. Thus, codes often involve labels like “man” and “woman” rather than just specifying “male” and “female.” Additionally, culturally specific rules regarding what counts as a man and woman might differ greatly from country to country. For example, in France, feminine names are not considered given names unless explicitly included in the birth certificate or social security card. Overall, while codification of marital status remains a critical component of many interpersonal interactions, differences among individual cultures and contexts still influence the quality and consistency of marital status communications.  

One issue that needs to be addressed is the requirement to distinguish between persons with similar roles in marital relations and persons with separate identities. For instance, a person who presents as a daughter could also show up in the list of cohabitants alongside her parents if she goes through a legal cohabitation arrangement with either parent. To address this issue, there has been increasing attention recently to expand legal recognition beyond traditional marriage for certain categories of cohabitation, particularly those involving children or grandchildren. While current laws may vary significantly from country to country, progress towards greater transparency and flexibility in dealing with legal cohabitation arrangements is likely to continue over time.
