# 1.简介
  

近年来，随着医疗影像领域的蓬勃发展，以“神经”网络模型为代表的深度学习技术也越来越受到医疗影像科研人员的重视，并在多种领域展现出了强大的能力。目前，深度学习技术主要应用于计算机视觉、自然语言处理、生物信息等方面，但在医疗影像领域却还有很长的路要走。随着AI技术在医疗影像领域的发展，新型的医疗影像诊断系统、精准医疗跟踪系统、机器智能手术治疗等等将成为未来医疗影像领域发展的重要方向，因此，我们认为这是一个极具挑战性的课题。 

# 2.Terminology and Concepts
## 2.1 Machine learning terms and concepts
- **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the machine is trained with labeled data to learn a mapping function from input variables (features) to output variables (target variable). For example, a computer program can be trained on labeled images of handwritten digits to recognize new samples of handwriting as digit 1 through digit 9.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Unlike supervised learning where we have both input features and target labels, unsupervised learning models only receive input features and are tasked to identify hidden patterns or clusters within the data. Clustering algorithms like K-means or DBSCAN help to group similar data points together into clusters.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning enables agents to interact with an environment to maximize rewards based on their actions. It's often used for robotics and autonomous driving systems, but it has also been applied in finance and social sciences such as market trading.
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)** : A deep neural network (DNN) is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of connected neurons. Each layer receives inputs from the previous layer, which allows information to flow throughout the network and makes the model more powerful. DNNs are commonly used in applications such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** : CNNs are specifically designed for analyzing visual imagery, consisting of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers at the end of the network. They are well suited for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- **Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks** : LSTM networks are recurrent neural networks that are capable of learning long-term dependencies between elements in sequences. These types of networks are particularly useful in medical imaging because they can capture contextual relationships among different regions of interest in an image.


## 2.2 Medical Imaging terminology and concepts
Medical imaging refers to the use of various techniques to acquire and interpret information about the internal structure and functions of the human body. There are many modalities involved in this process including X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, PET scans, ultrasounds, and computed tomography (CT) imaging.

**Anatomical Structures** include the skin, bones, soft tissues, nerves, muscles, blood vessels, heart, and lungs.

**Tissue Types** include white matter (the gray matter inside the cells), gray matter (the solid parts of the bodies), and cerebrospinal fluid. Tissue properties such as thickeness, opacity, size, shape, and alignment can provide additional information about its composition and function.

In the field of medical imaging, there are several common data formats used:

- Analyze (also known as ANALYZE or NIFTI format): This is the most common file format for medical imaging analysis. It contains header information, the raw pixel values for each voxel, and optional meta-data associated with the scan.
- DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine): DICOM stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and is the de facto standard for storing, transmitting, printing, and storing medical images and related clinical information.
- nrrd (Nearly Raw Raster Data): nrrd is another popular format used for medical imaging analysis due to its simplicity and ease of use. It stores the same type of data as analyze files, but uses a simpler syntax for writing header information.
- mhd/mha (Meta Image Header/Meta Image Advanced): Similar to analyze files, these two file formats store the raw pixel values for each voxel alongside metadata. However, unlike analyze, these formats allow for compression of large datasets and support streaming.

In addition to these common formats, researchers are developing new imaging technologies such as 3D printed breast prosthetics, smart glasses, and fetal monitoring devices that require novel imaging methods and software tools.

## 2.3 AI Challenges and Opportunities in Healthcare
- Efficiency and cost optimization: With advances in hardware technology and cloud computing, healthcare providers now have access to high-performance machines that can perform complex tasks such as image analysis quickly and easily. As AI continues to expand its impact, it will play a significant role in reducing costs and improving efficiency.
- Accessibility and integration: Because patients have access to numerous devices and services, consumers expect easy accessibility and integration across all aspects of their personal and medical journey. With advancements in IoT, AI can enable patients to monitor and manage their conditions via mobile apps, which further enhances patient engagement and improves overall health outcomes.
- Personalized medicine and care: Along with advances in IoT and big data analytics, AI can offer personalized medicine by tailoring treatments to individual patients' unique needs using algorithms developed over time. With AI-powered virtual assistants, physicians can streamline procedures, reduce errors, and improve patient satisfaction.
- Cancer diagnosis and treatment: Artificial intelligence can help diagnose and treat cancer early enough so it doesn't spread to other organs or cause harm to patients. Using radiology imagery, AI can spot abnormal patterns that suggest cancer before it spreads to deeper organs and causes serious damage.
