# 1.简介
  

Dynamic programming (DP) is a powerful technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems and solving each one independently using the solutions to the smaller sub-problems. DP can be applied in many fields such as optimization, planning, and machine learning. This article will provide an introduction to dynamic programming through examples written in Python. We'll cover basic concepts, algorithms, code implementation, and some common pitfalls of DP. At the end, we'll also touch upon some possible future directions and challenges in DP research. Let's dive right in!
# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## The Problem Setting
Let's say you have been given two lists `L` and `M`, both consisting of positive integers up to `n`. You need to find all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` such that `L[i] + M[j]` equals a given target value `t`. Formally, let `dp[i][j]` denote the minimum number of operations required to reach `target` from integer `nums[i:j+1]`. That is, for any index `i` between `0` and `j`, `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to get from index `i` to index `j` within the list `nums`. 

For example, if we are given `[2, 7, 9, 3]` and `[1, 4, 8, 5, 6]` as input and want to achieve a sum of `12`, then there exist pairs `(0, 2)`, `(0, 4)`, or `(1, 3)` where we can make the sum equal to `12`: `{2 + 9}, {2 + 5 + 6}, or {7 + 3}`. In this case, the optimal solution involves adding `9`, so `dp[0][2] = dp[0][4] = dp[1][3] = 1` while `dp[0][3] = dp[2][4] = infinity` since it does not involve the last element of either list. Therefore, our answer would be `1`. Similarly, if we were asked to add `14`, then no pair exists except `(0, 2)` and `(0, 3)`. Thus, the output for these inputs would be `-infinity`.

We refer to finding all pairs `(i, j)` with non-negative values of `i` and `j` as "finding all valid combinations". Another way to look at this problem is to use dynamic programming to fill out the table `dp` iteratively starting from smaller indices until reaching the final cell `dp[-1][-1]` representing the entire range. We start filling out the cells diagonally, working towards the top right corner. For each cell `(i, j)`, we iterate over all possible previous cells `(p, q)` such that `p < i` and `q < j` and update `dp[i][j]` accordingly based on the following recurrence relation:
```
dp[i][j] = min(dp[p][q] + abs(nums[p] - nums[q]))
            #     ^         ^                   ^
            #     |         |                   |
            #   Sum of    Minus difference      Absolute difference
          adjacent elements       without considering position
```
Here, `abs()` function returns the absolute value of the difference between the two elements being considered. Note that the term `min()` here refers to taking the minimum among all valid previous cells instead of selecting just one path. Specifically, when updating `dp[i][j]`, we take the minimum value obtained by considering all valid previous cells. Finally, note that we assume that `dp[-1][-1]` corresponds to the empty set {} and thus its value cannot depend on any other entry in the matrix. To handle this edge case, we simply return zero in this case as any operation has already taken place before reaching the first cell.
