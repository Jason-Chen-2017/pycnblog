Natural language generation (NLG) is a crucial aspect of artificial intelligence that allows machines to produce human-like text output in various domains such as chatbots, search engines or voice assistants. However, the quality of generated natural language is rarely evaluated systematically beforehand, leading to limited insights into its reliability and relevance for downstream applications. This paper aims at providing an empirically grounded framework for measuring NLG quality by comparing abstractive and conversational summaries. We also present two novel methods for evaluating NLI performance based on metrics from generative models and explore their impacts on summarization evaluation results. Our experiments show that existing techniques can be extended further to cover abstractive summarization tasks and that generative model-based evaluations may offer improved flexibility over standard ROUGE-style metric design. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities for NLG quality measurement.

Quality assessment has been extensively studied in the field of machine learning. Researchers have focused on automatic evaluation methods like classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc., which evaluate the generalizability of trained models. Other popular approaches include rule-based systems and statistical analysis using data mining algorithms. However, these techniques are often domain-independent and do not take into account specific linguistic features of input and output texts, making them insufficient for assessing NLG quality accurately. On the other hand, manual annotation of high-quality text pairs or test suites for benchmarking purposes requires expertise and time consuming process, limiting its use in real-world scenarios where large scale quantitative studies are required. 

Existing works study how different components contribute towards the overall performance of an NLG system but do not consider individual aspects such as sentence structure, coherence, fluency, lexical density, rhetorical approach, usage intentionality etc. In contrast, our work focuses on developing an objective framework to measure NLG quality by examining the differences between abstractive and conversational summaries. The current state-of-the-art technique is ROUGE, which evaluates summary sentences against reference sentences according to syntactic and semantic similarities. Nevertheless, ROUGE does not capture specific linguistic features and challenges when it comes to evaluating abstract concepts, rhetorical style and fine-grained control over the length of the summary. Therefore, our proposed approach involves comparing multiple levels of abstraction while incorporating factors such as sentiment, emotional tone, perspective and diversity. 

Generative models, especially GPT-2, have shown impressive results in natural language processing, particularly in text generation tasks. These models generate diverse outputs with clear coherence and fluency. However, they tend to mimic rather than create new ideas and hence cannot reflect the same level of complexity and nuance seen in humans' writing styles. Moreover, generating text without any context or purpose reduces its usefulness as an aid for decision-making processes. Nonetheless, recent advancements in generative modeling make possible some interesting ways to evaluate the quality of generated natural language.

We use the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus dataset [1] consisting of movie scripts and conversations for training and testing our models. We train a baseline summarization model on the entire dataset and compare its performance against an abstractive summarization method trained only on the abstractive summarization task. We evaluate both models using two main metrics - ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 F1 scores. We also propose a third metric that captures important properties of natural language, namely divergent attention and topic shifting, and uses it as a complementary factor in comparison with ROUGE-F scores. For detailed information about the experimental setup, please refer to section 4.2. 

In addition, we perform additional experiments to compare the impact of different generative models on summarization performance. Specifically, we compare three popular pre-trained language models – BERT, RoBERTa and T5. We examine the correlation between the model's ability to generate well-structured, grammatically correct and informative text and the final ROUGE scores obtained on each of the datasets. To this end, we experiment with combinations of parameter settings to find the best balance between computational efficiency and summarization quality.
