Endurance tests are widely used in the industry to measure the fitness level or performance ability of individuals or machines under a variety of load conditions, such as long-term stress testing, low speed running test, or sudden braking test. The results obtained from endurance tests provide valuable information about the strength, condition, and resilience of an object being tested. However, achieving satisfactory results is always challenging due to factors such as fatigue, workload, temperature variation, etc., which can significantly impact the actual performance level. Therefore, continuous performance feedback (CPPF) is required to improve the efficiency of endurance testing while ensuring its validity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named adaptive weighting based on CPPF for endurance tests that enables real-time estimation and evaluation of performance levels during the course of testing without compromising accuracy by utilizing timely alerts. To address these challenges, our method uses two mechanisms: dynamic threshold adjustment and statistical analysis. Dynamic threshold adjustment adjusts the threshold level dynamically according to the previous positive/negative test result using linear regression model. Statistical analysis then extracts relevant features from historical data, including successful test records and their corresponding thresholds, and applies them to estimate the most likely current threshold value with high probability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments conducted on various types of endurance tests, and validate it against several baseline methods. Our proposed method provides real-time feedback and establishes a quantitative reference system for assessing performance during endurance tests. Additionally, we have made source code available at https://github.com/carlosmartinez7/adaptive_weighting_cppf.

# 2.背景介绍
Endurance tests are essential components of any safety assessment process because they offer objective and repeatable measures of human and machine performance in a wide range of load conditions. As the focus shifts towards higher reliability and durability over longer periods of time, accurate and consistent measurement techniques become increasingly important. Continuous performance feedback (CPPF) has emerged as a promising technique to evaluate performance levels during the course of testing and detect deviations from expected behavior. However, existing solutions suffer from several drawbacks, including insufficient accuracy, slow response time, limited capability to adapt to changing operating environments, and costly maintenance requirements. 

To address these issues, we present a new approach called adaptive weighting based on CPPF for endurance tests. This approach improves upon existing solutions by incorporating both static and dynamic components into the CPFP framework. Static components include traditional threshold setting methods based on empirical observations and manual settings. Dynamic components enable real-time prediction and adjustment of the threshold level based on historical data. By analyzing correlations between endurance test outcomes and parameters like temperature, workload, and fatigue, we obtain more reliable predictions than traditional approaches. Finally, we use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and extract patterns that indicate potential areas for improvement, allowing us to establish a quantitative reference system for evaluating performance during endurance tests. Overall, our solution enables real-time feedback, maintains accuracy, adapts to varying environmental conditions, and delivers actionable insights.

## 3.1 Endurance Test
Endurance tests refer to a suite of tests performed to determine an individual’s resistance to repeated adverse loads under specified conditions. These tests typically involve loading the subject repeatedly until failure occurs, measuring the duration of each load cycle, and comparing those measurements across multiple trials to calculate the overall endurance score. Various factors such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and equipment damage may affect the performance of subjects during endurance testing. Endurance testing may be classified further depending on the type of loads applied, location of the test site, subject gender, age, and fitness level.

## 3.2 CPPF
Continuous performance feedback (CPPF), also known as performance monitoring, refers to a process wherein operational data related to a particular product or service is monitored in real-time, enabling engineers to identify and respond to potential problems before they cause serious damage. Typically, CPPF involves three main steps: collection of metrics, decision making, and reporting. During collection of metrics, signals representing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as throughput, latency, error rate, memory usage, and CPU usage are collected from different sources. Decision making involves applying heuristics and predictive analytics to identify potential problems, and preemptively perform remedial actions to reduce downtime or improve performance. Reporting includes generating informative reports, providing clear status updates, and communicating findings to stakeholders.

## 3.3 Adaptive Threshold Adjustment
Adaptive threshold adjustment is a critical aspect of adaptive weighting based on CPPF. It ensures the highest possible accuracy in predicting future performance levels while minimizing false positives. In this approach, the threshold level is adjusted dynamically using linear regression models that capture the relationship between the test outcome and the threshold level. Specifically, if the predicted test outcome falls below the current threshold level, the threshold level is lowered; otherwise, it is raised. This mechanism ensures that only significant changes in the test outcome trigger threshold adjustments, preventing unnecessary interventions and wasteful resource consumption.

## 3.4 Static Components
Static components are traditional threshold setting methods based on empirical observations and manual settings. They consist of common practices, such as setting the threshold level based on average success rates achieved by experts in similar scenarios. The goal of these methods is to ensure reasonable sensitivity and specificity when identifying potentially dangerous situations, but do not take into account variations in the test subject’s behavior or characteristics. Consequently, they may lead to misleading conclusions and increased risk of false alarms.

## 3.5 Dynamic Components
Dynamic components utilize historical data to develop adaptive models for adjusting the threshold level dynamically. The history includes prior successful test outcomes, their corresponding thresholds, and other relevant factors such as temperature, workload, and fatigue. Each component is designed to leverage different features of the test scenario to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model. For example, we employ correlation analysis between endurance test outcomes and parameters like temperature, workload, and fatigue to construct a logistic regression model that captures the underlying relationships between the variables and the binary outcome of the test. With this model, we can make predictions regarding whether or not a given set of inputs will result in a successful test outcome with high probability.

## 3.6 Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze historical data and extract patterns that can help identify areas for improvement. Traditionally, these algorithms have been used in various applications such as fraud detection, customer segmentation, text classification, and stock market prediction. In our context, we apply machine learning algorithms to analyze past successful test records and build a model that estimates the optimal threshold level for a given scenario.

## 3.7 Quantitative Reference System
The quantitative reference system established by our adaptive weighting based on CPPF approach serves as a benchmark for evaluating the true performance level during endurance testing. Instead of relying solely on subjective criteria such as recall, precision, and F1-score, this system considers all relevant KPIs and takes into consideration how well the test subject performs within the defined operational constraints.

Overall, adaptive weighting based on CPPF offers several advantages over static and dynamic threshold setting methods, including improved accuracy, faster response times, greater flexibility to handle diverse test scenarios, and less expensive maintenance costs. Moreover, the proposed quantitative reference system allows engineers to compare the true performance level of the test subject to the estimated level produced by our algorithm, thereby facilitating prompt diagnosis and root cause analysis.
