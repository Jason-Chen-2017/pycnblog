# 1.简介
  

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently attracted a lot of research interests due to its ability to solve complex problems that are typically considered intractable by traditional optimization-based methods. However, the training process for DRL agents can be very time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially when dealing with large scale environments or high dimensional observations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient approach called Competitive Evolutionary Training (CET), which combines multi-agent reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation techniques to train agent policies in parallel without compromising sample efficiency. The key idea behind CET is that it utilizes the strengths of both approaches to design a new approach that combines their advantages while also avoiding some drawbacks. Specifically, CET uses two types of evolutionary algorithms - Genetic Programming (GP) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) - together with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning frameworks such as MuJoCo or Unity ML-Agents, to optimize agent policies in parallel within different environments. This approach enables scalability to massive state-action spaces and allows for robust exploration during training. We evaluated our proposed method on several continuous control tasks and found that it outperformed other baselines significantly and trained faster than conventional single-agent methods. Our code implementation is publicly available on GitHub.
In summary, we propose a novel approach for efficiently training deep reinforcement learning agents in parallel using competitive evolutionary training. We combine the strengths of GP and PSO based evolutionary algorithms alongside various multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks like MuJoCo or Unity ML-Agents to develop a framework that is capable of solving large-scale and challenging continuous control tasks with significant improvements over existing baselines. Additionally, we provide detailed analysis and experimental results showing that CET achieves better performance than alternative approaches despite being more computationally expensive.

## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
Multi-agent reinforcement learning involves multiple independent agents interacting with each other to achieve goals simultaneously. In MARL, there could be any number of agents (including human players) acting concurrently in the environment. These agents share the same observation space but have separate action spaces, allowing them to select actions independently from one another. The goal of MARL is to learn a joint policy that maximizes the long-term reward of all agents in the environment. 

## Evolutionary Algorithms
Evolutionary algorithms are a class of heuristic search algorithms inspired by biological evolution. They use a population of candidate solutions to find the optimal solution. Population members evolve iteratively according to fitness functions defined based on the current best candidates. Two common examples of evolutionary algorithms used in MARL are genetic programming and particle swarm optimization. 

Genetic programming is a type of metaheuristic algorithm where individuals represent programs and fitnesses are determined by their behavior in simulated environments. A program tree consisting of primitive operations is initialized randomly, and then mutations and crossovers are applied to create offspring. Each generation represents an increasingly diverse set of programs, and the best ones continue to propagate and improve until convergence.

Particle swarm optimization is a mathematical optimization algorithm based on theories of swarm intelligence. It consists of a group of particles representing potential solutions, and movement directions are updated in response to the positions of nearby neighbors and their velocities. Similar to genetic programming, PSO takes advantage of diversity in initial conditions to converge towards global optima.

## Unity ML-Agents 
Unity ML-Agents provides a software library for developing and training artificial intelligent agents in virtual environments using machine learning algorithms. With Unity ML-Agents, users can create reinforcement learning agents in a virtual world and have them interact with objects and other agents. The provided API exposes a variety of functionality, including:

* Environment simulation and rendering: Allows users to simulate arbitrary environments with obstacles, lights, and other physical entities. Users can configure the visual appearance of the agent by specifying colors and shapes.
* Sensor APIs: Provides a range of sensor components that allow users to obtain information about the surrounding environment, including raw images, vector observations, and depth maps. Sensors can also include position, velocity, and rotation information.
* Action output APIs: Defines interfaces for controlling the agent's motors and movements, enabling users to specify desired actions directly in code. For example, motor torques or desired end effector poses.

ML-Agents includes implementations of popular reinforcement learning algorithms, including DQN, DDPG, and PPO. These algorithms take into account factors such as noise injection and curiosity-driven exploration, making them suitable for applications involving uncertain environments or hierarchical decision-making among teammates.

## Continuous Control Tasks
Continuous control refers to the problem of teaching an agent how to move around an environment using only continuous input signals (e.g., forces and torques). Typically, these controls are given by simple motor commands rather than precise trajectory specifications. Continuous control tasks involve tasks such as robotic grasping, locomotion, navigation, and manipulation. There exist many variations of continuous control tasks ranging from easy to difficult depending on the complexity of the task and the agent's capabilities. Some commonly used continuous control tasks include:

* Balancebot: Learn to balance a lightweight pendulum on a cart while avoiding obstacles.
* Bipedal walker: Train a bipedal walking robot to traverse terrain smoothly while avoiding obstacles.
* Cartpole: Learn to swing a pole from rest while balancing it on top of a cartpole.
* Walker: Train a legged creature to walk forward while avoiding collisions with obstacles.
