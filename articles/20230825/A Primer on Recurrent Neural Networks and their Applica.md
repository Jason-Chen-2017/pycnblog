# 2. 背景介绍
Natural language processing (NLP) is an important sub-field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to understand human speech or text as input data and generate output based on it. It has become an essential component of modern applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, search engines, etc., where the analysis of language plays a crucial role. 

In order for machines to recognize and understand language accurately, we need to build models that can capture both the statistical and contextual relationships between words and phrases within sentences. This requires building deep neural networks that have been successfully applied in numerous tasks including image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

One type of model that has shown great promise in these tasks is recurrent neural network (RNN). In this article, we will explore RNNs by starting from basic concepts like regression, activation functions, and how they are used in RNNs for language modeling. Then, we will move into advanced topics such as LSTMs, bidirectional RNNs, and sequence-to-sequence models that can be used for machine translation, sentiment analysis, and other natural language processing tasks.

## 3.1 Regression vs Classification
In supervised learning, there are two main types of problems: classification and regression. In classification, the goal is to predict a discrete class label while in regression, the goal is to predict a continuous value. The output variable is usually labeled y and takes values in a set C={c1, c2,..., cn}. For example, in binary classification, there are only two possible classes {+ve,-ve} and in multiclass classification, there are more than two classes. We use linear regression to solve regression problems with one target variable, logistic regression to solve binary classification problems with multiple target variables, and softmax function followed by cross entropy loss to solve multi-class classification problems.

## 3.2 Activation Functions
Activation functions play an essential role in determining the behavior of neurons in a neural network. There are many different types of activation functions, but most commonly used ones include sigmoid, tanh, relu, leaky relu, and elu. Sigmoid and tanh are widely used activation functions that produce outputs in the range [-1, +1] which makes them useful for training feedforward neural networks, whereas relu is often preferred over others because it saturates less in deeper layers and produces better gradients during backpropagation. Leaky relu solves the dying gradient problem of traditional relu by adding a small slope when the input is negative. Elu also solves the dying gradient issue by adding a constant amount when the input is negative, making it computationally efficient compared to traditional activation functions.


## 3.3 Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
Backpropagation through time is a technique used to train recurrent neural networks efficiently by reducing memory requirements. BPTT involves passing the hidden state at each timestep back along with the error signal calculated at that step using truncated backpropagation. By doing so, errors can propagate backwards through all previous steps without increasing memory usage beyond the length of the chain.

For instance, suppose we have a three-layered RNN with inputs x_1,...,x_t and outputs h_1,...,h_t computed recursively as follows:

h_(i)=g(Wx_i+Uh_(i−1)), i=1,..,t

where g() represents an activation function such as tanh or relu, W and U represent weight matrices for computing the new hidden state and the updated weights respectively, and ∅ denotes zero vectors. The total number of parameters required by this model is O(txn^2), where n is the dimensionality of the hidden states and x_i is the vector representation of the word at position i.

To perform BPTT, we compute the derivative of the loss function w.r.t. the weights using truncated backpropagation. Starting from the last layer l, we calculate the partial derivatives dL/dU_l, dL/db_l, and then pass these results downwards to the second layer l-1 until we reach the first layer l=1. At each layer, we update the weights using stochastic gradient descent using mini-batches of examples.

## 3.4 Sequence-to-Sequence Models
Sequence-to-sequence models are among the most powerful tools for natural language processing. They allow us to map sequences of symbols to sequences of symbols in a way that preserves some form of meaning. One common application of sequence-to-sequence models is machine translation, where we translate a sentence from one language to another. These models are typically trained using teacher forcing, where the decoder uses its own predictions instead of those generated by the encoder to generate the next symbol in the output sequence. In practice, sequence-to-sequence models work well even when the source and target languages have different vocabularies, as long as the alignment between them is sufficiently accurate.
