Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with an environment through trial-and-error learning from its experience. It allows agents to select actions that maximize long-term rewards over time in complex environments such as games or robotics. In this article, we will be discussing the two popular reinforcement learning algorithms — Q-learning and deep Q-networks (DQN), which are widely used in industry for solving complex problems. We will also discuss some key terms and concepts involved in these algorithms so that you can understand them better.

The purpose of this article is to provide beginners who have never worked on RL before with hands-on examples and intuitive explanations of how RL works under the hood. Additionally, it provides experienced developers with clear insights into the working principles behind these algorithms and their potential applications in real-world scenarios. 

By the end of the article, you should feel confident about applying RL techniques to your problem-solving endeavors and understand why they work the way they do. This knowledge can help you make more informed decisions when designing and building next-generation AI systems.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most exciting fields in modern Artificial Intelligence (AI). Yet there is no shortage of books, courses, lectures, and tutorials out there explaining what it is and how it works, especially to those who have not taken up this field before. However, even advanced users often find it challenging to wrap their head around all the terminology and equations involved in understanding RL algorithms. The aim of this article is to simplify the process of understanding RL algorithms by breaking down the underlying ideas and maths into simple and easy-to-understand language while providing code examples alongside.

There has been significant research and development done in recent years towards developing intelligent agents that learn to act optimally in different tasks using various methods such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each method has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages, but at present, several variants of RL algorithms are being developed to suit different types of situations. Some commonly used algorithms include:

1. Q-Learning: A model-free, off-policy, value-based algorithm used in discrete action spaces and MDPs.
2. Policy Gradient Methods: A family of model-free, gradient based optimization techniques used in continuous action spaces and PPO.
3. DQN: A variant of Q-learning that uses neural networks to approximate Q values instead of tabular representation.
4. A2C: Another actor-critic method that combines policy gradients and deep reinforcement learning.
5. DDPG: A deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm used for continuous control tasks.

In addition to these, other variations like GAIL, SAC, TD3, etc., exist. All these algorithms share certain common traits such as dealing with sequential decision making, using models to learn, and utilizing exploration. Understanding each of these algorithms requires a thorough understanding of basic mathematical concepts and understanding of reinforcement learning terminology.

Before diving into any specific RL algorithm, let's first review some fundamental topics related to RL that are essential to grasp the basics. Then, we'll explore how Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks work in detail. Finally, we'll demonstrate how to implement these algorithms in Python.

Let’s now talk about some important terms and concepts that we need to know before we dive deeper into the world of RL algorithms. These concepts will help us get a better understanding of how these algorithms operate. Let's start with defining the Markov Decision Process (MDP):

A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a tuple $(S, A, R, P)$, where:

1. $S$ is a state space, consisting of all possible states our environment could be in.
2. $A$ is an action space, consisting of all possible actions that our agent could take given a state.
3. $R$ is a reward function that gives the agent a numerical reward for taking a particular action in a particular state.
4. $P(s'|s,a)$ is the probability distribution of transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$ after taking action $a$.

Here is an example MDP: Consider a simplified version of Blackjack (known as Twenty-One). Suppose the player starts with $100$, has a deck of cards and wants to hit or stand. Depending on the result of his/her turn, the game ends either due to busting ($-1$) or hitting blackjack ($+1.5$) or going above $21$ without exceeding $21$. There are three actions - “hit” ($h$), “stand” ($s$), and “double” ($d$). Initially, the dealer has hidden a card, and initially both players receive one card each.

To represent this MDP mathematically, we would use a State Transition Matrix $T$ and Reward Vector $r$:

State Transition Matrix
$$ T = \begin{bmatrix}
& & h_{21}\ &\\ 
& s_{0}&\ &s_{1}\\ 
\end{bmatrix}$$

where $h_j$ represents the probability of moving from state 0 to state 1 after hitting and receiving j points. Similarly, $s_k$ represents the probability of staying in state k if the player decides to stick. 

Reward Vector
$$ r = \begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ +1.5 \\ +1\end{bmatrix}$$

This defines the MDP for twenty-one. Now that we have defined the MDP, let’s move onto the core concept of Q-learning. 

5. Q-Learning
Q-Learning is a model-free, off-policy, value-based RL algorithm used in discrete action spaces and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Unlike other algorithms, Q-Learning does not require explicit modeling of the environment. Instead, it estimates the quality of every possible action in each state and explores the optimal policy based on this estimate. Here are the main steps involved in Q-Learning:

1. Initialize Q-table: A table containing initial values for all $(s,a)$ pairs. 
2. Initialize parameters: $\alpha$ controls the step size and determines the rate at which the Q-table is updated during training. $\gamma$ controls the discount factor, which helps us decide how much future rewards matter relative to immediate ones. 
3. Select an action: Use epsilon-greedy policy to choose an action with probability $1-\epsilon$ and explore new actions with probability $\epsilon$.
4. Take action: Execute the selected action in the environment and observe the resulting reward and new state.
5. Update Q-table: Use the Bellman equation to update the Q-value for the current $(s,a)$ pair based on the observed reward and estimated maximum future reward. 
6. Repeat until convergence: Iterate steps 3 to 5 until convergence is achieved (i.e. the Q-values converge to their true value).

Now that we have covered the basics of Q-Learning, let’s go back to the beginning of the article and see how DQN works. 

6. Deep Q-Networks
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is another variant of Q-learning that replaces the tabular representation of Q-values with a deep neural network trained using deep reinforcement learning. Like Q-learning, DQN relies on estimating the expected return of performing an action in a given state, and updates its approximation of the Q-function iteratively to improve performance. However, whereas traditional Q-learning approaches rely on parameterized function approximators such as linear functions, DQN uses convolutional neural networks to process input observations directly from pixels and abstract spatial relationships between objects. Hence, it is capable of processing high-dimensional inputs with less computational complexity than traditional methods. 

Here are the main steps involved in DQN:

1. Initialize replay buffer: A circular buffer that stores tuples of transitions $(s,a,r,s')$. Random sampling from the buffer is used for updating the network.
2. Initialize target network: An identical copy of the online network that is periodically synced with the weights of the online network.
3. Sample mini-batch of transitions: Sample uniform random mini-batches of transitions from the replay buffer to train the network.
4. Compute loss: Use the Huber loss function to compute the temporal difference error between the predicted Q-values and the actual returns.
5. Perform gradient descent: Backpropagate the error through the network to adjust the parameters in order to minimize the loss.
6. Sync target network: Periodically update the target network to match the weights of the online network.

It is worth mentioning here that DQN is able to achieve high sample efficiency compared to other reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that use function approximation. By trading off some flexibility in terms of action selection and exploratory behavior, DQN may perform well in certain domains where exact value evaluation is critical, such as board games or Atari video games. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of DQN remains limited because of the necessary trade-off between exploration and exploitation, as well as data efficiency required to train large neural networks. Nonetheless, DQN has become a standard benchmark for evaluating RL algorithms and remains a promising candidate for real-world deployment.
