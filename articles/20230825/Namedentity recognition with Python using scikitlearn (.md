## 概述
Named entity recognition (NER), also known as entity extraction or named entity identification, is the task of identifying and classifying key information in a text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, times, quantities, and percentages. In natural language processing tasks, NER plays an important role because it helps to understand meaning and contextualize words. By extracting entities from unstructured text data, organizations can gain valuable insights by analyzing what people are looking for, how they search for information, where they need to go, when they want to be contacted, and more. This article will discuss the basics of NER and explain its working principles, followed by implementation using Python and scikit-learn library. Finally, we will discuss the challenges faced during this process and possible solutions to them. 

## 命名实体识别(NER)
在自然语言处理中，命名实体识别（NER）也称为实体提取或命名实体识别，它是从文本中提取并分类关键信息的任务，将其划分成已定义的类别——如人物、组织、地点、时间、数量、百分比等——来进行标识。通过对无结构化数据中的实体进行提取，组织能够从中获取丰富的信息，能够分析消费者寻求什么、搜索信息的方式、到达何处、联系方式如何等等，从而帮助他们做出决策、作出明智的判断。本文将讨论命名实体识别（NER）的基础知识，并详细阐述其工作原理。之后，我们会展示如何使用Python和scikit-learn库实现该过程，并讨论在此过程中面临的挑战和可能的解决方案。

## NLP与NER技术概述
Natural Language Processing, often abbreviated as NLP, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand human languages and communicate with each other. It covers various fields including speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, question answering systems, etc., and is widely used in different applications including social media analytics, online customer service, chatbots, content understanding, knowledge management, and many others. NER, on the other hand, is one of the core techniques in NLP which helps machines identify and classify named entities mentioned in texts into pre-defined categories like persons, organizations, locations, times, quantities, and percentages. These extracted entities can then be processed further by models like machine learning algorithms to extract useful insights and help organizations make better decisions based on their requirements. The below figure shows a high level view of NLP technology:


## 命名实体识别技术
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a technique that identifies and categorizes individual words, phrases, or sentences that represent things such as persons, organizations, locations, times, quantities, and percentages within unstructured text data. The main goal behind NER is to enable computer programs to understand and interact with language properly while taking advantage of relevant structured data available in text documents without requiring additional context or external sources. 

There are two common approaches to perform NER, namely Rule Based Approach and Statistical Approach. The former involves creating rules manually and applying them to input text. In contrast, the latter relies on statistical modeling techniques to train machine learning models that learn patterns and correlations between words, called features, and corresponding tags or labels, called labels, indicating whether each word belongs to a particular category. Commonly used feature sets include bag-of-words model, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition.

In this article, I'll focus on implementing the Statistical Approach using Python's scikit-learn library. Scikit-learn is a popular open source machine learning library that provides a range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more. We'll use its Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package for performing tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal, but you could substitute these steps with your own custom code if desired. The rest of the article assumes some familiarity with NLP concepts and libraries, so please refer to existing resources if needed.
