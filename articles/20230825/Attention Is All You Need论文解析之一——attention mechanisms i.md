Attention Mechanisms have been proposed as a fundamental aspect of Deep Learning architectures in recent years, especially for Natural Language Processing tasks such as Machine Translation or Question Answering. This paper presents an overview of the attention mechanism, its applications to NLP problems, and discusses various approaches towards using it in modern models. 

In this blog post we will cover two important aspects of the attention mechanism: (i) Background Introduction on Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs), and (ii) The concept of attention-based decoder that is used by several popular neural machine translation systems including Google Translate, Neural Monkey, Baidu Translator, etc. We will also discuss how the approach can be applied effectively to different types of NLP tasks. Moreover, we will go through examples of applying attention to other common NLP tasks like named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, semantic parsing, and text classification among others. Finally, we will explore the effectiveness of attention-based models in achieving state-of-the-art results for these tasks while being less computationally expensive than RNN based models.

Deep Learning models are widely used in solving complex tasks like image and speech recognition, question answering, etc., but their success has not extended far beyond the realm of NLP due to challenges faced with sequence modeling. One of the key challenges encountered while building a neural model for NLP is figuring out which part of the input sentence/document is most important at each time step. In traditional RNN-based models, recurrency is implemented implicitly by passing information from previous steps to the current one through hidden states. However, recurrency explicitly involves significant computational overhead. The explosion of layer sizes in deep RNN networks adds further complexity. There exists another approach known as “Long Short Term Memory” (LSTM) cells that enable efficient recurrent processing without much memory overhead, but they still rely heavily on gating mechanisms for maintaining long-term dependencies between inputs. To address these limitations, several works have focused on exploring new ways of implementing attention mechanisms within the context of RNNs. These include Luong et al.(2015) who introduced the dot product attention mechanism, Gregor et al.(2016) who discussed several approaches towards addressing the vanishing gradient problem with LSTM cells, and Vaswani et al.(2017) who presented a novel attention-based transformer architecture with significantly improved performance over vanilla transformers. All these papers agree that attention mechanisms play a crucial role in improving the accuracy and efficiency of deep models for NLP tasks, leading to significant improvements in many areas ranging from speech recognition to sentiment analysis.

The goal of an attention mechanism is to assign greater focus on specific parts of the input during training and decoding time. It takes into account both the content of the input as well as the history of the output generated so far to generate the next output. The basic idea behind attention mechanisms lies in representing the importance of each element of the input at every time step during encoding. At decoding time, the network uses these representations to selectively focus on certain elements of the input that are relevant to predicting the next output token.

Let us consider an example scenario where we want to translate "Hello World" from English to French. Suppose our encoder consists of an RNN with four layers and each layer contains five neurons. The final state vector produced after passing the word "hello" to the first layer of the RNN would look something like $\hat{h}_1 = [e_{1}, e_{2}, \ldots, e_{5}]$. The same process is repeated for all words in the source sentence until the entire sequence is processed and encoded.

Now, suppose we want to generate the corresponding French word for the encoded "hello" state vector. A naive approach might be to simply feed the state vector directly to a softmax classifier that maps each possible French word onto a probability distribution, with weights learned from some supervised task like translation data. But this approach would lead to unrealistic translations because even though the "hello" state vector encodes useful information about the meaning of the original word, it may not capture the necessary relationships between adjacent words in the sentence. For instance, if the phrase "hello world" is translated as "bonjour le monde", then it seems plausible that the intention was to say "world hello", but the simple concatenation of vectors does not take into account the fact that "hello" should come before "world". 

To tackle this issue, researchers came up with the concept of attention mechanisms. The intuition behind attention mechanisms is to learn to allocate more attention to relevant parts of the input when generating the output at each time step. Let us now assume that instead of just producing the final state vector of the last layer of the RNN, we produce a set of intermediate state vectors along with the final state vector. Each of these intermediate vectors could represent a weighted combination of the hidden states of the RNN at each time step. By choosing the appropriate weights for each state vector, we can control the level of attention allocated to each part of the input sequence. The resulting weighted sum of the intermediate state vectors is fed back to the RNN to obtain the next output token.

Based on the above approach, let's briefly review some of the essential concepts associated with attention mechanisms in NLP tasks:

1. Encoding: In order to apply attention mechanisms to NLP tasks, we need to encode the source sentences into fixed size vectors representation. Typically, we use an RNN-based encoder that produces a single fixed length vector for each sentence. Common choices for encoding strategies include BiLSTMs, CNNs, or Transformers depending on the nature of the task. 

2. Decoding: During decoding, we use an attention-based decoder that combines the target sequence with the internal states of the encoder at each time step. Here, the internal states correspond to the output vectors produced by the encoder, and the target sequence represents the expected output tokens. An attention mechanism decides which parts of the input to attend to at each time step and how much attention to give to them. Two common attention mechanisms used in NLP are Content Based Attention and Query-Key Value Attention. 

3. Alignment Models: Some NLP tasks involve aligning the target sequences with multiple source sequences. Typical alignment techniques include Dynamic Programming algorithms, Maximum marginal likelihood estimation techniques, or Integrated gradients methods. While exact alignment cannot always be achieved, approximate alignment can help reduce the number of alignment errors required to train a robust system. The attention mechanism helps achieve approximate alignment by focusing on the aligned portions of the input sequences during decoding.

Let us now discuss the details of the attention mechanisms involved in the paper.
