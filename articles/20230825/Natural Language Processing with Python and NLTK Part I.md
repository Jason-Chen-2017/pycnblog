# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to a sub-field of artificial intelligence that involves the use of computational methods to analyze and interpret human language. In this tutorial series, we will cover the basics of natural language processing using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), which is an open source library for natural language processing in Python. The tutorials are designed for beginners who want to learn how to process text data from various sources like social media feeds or scientific papers, extract insights from it, and build smart applications based on them. 

In Part I of our tutorial series, we will focus on fundamental concepts, algorithms, and techniques used in NLP using NLTK library, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. We will also demonstrate how to apply these technologies on real world datasets like Twitter sentiment analysis dataset and news article dataset. Finally, we will introduce some advanced topics such as neural networks, deep learning, and attention mechanisms, etc., and discuss their potential impacts on NLP. This first part provides a gentle introduction to NLP and its practical application using Python and NLTK.

# 2. 基本概念、术语说明及相关算法
Before diving into technical details, let's go through the basic concepts, terminologies, and related algorithms used in NLP. These will be helpful to understand the context and flow of our tutorials later.

2.1 Tokens
Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sentence or paragraph into individual words or tokens. It is commonly done using space delimiter or specific punctuation marks such as period (.), comma (,), semicolon (;), colon (:), exclamation mark (!), question mark (?), etc., depending on the requirements. For example, if the input string is "I love playing soccer.", then after tokenization it becomes ["I", "love", "playing", "soccer"]. 

2.2 Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming is the process of reducing each word to its base or root form, while removing any unnecessary suffixes. It helps to identify similar but different words by converting all words to their root form so they can be grouped together. For example, "eating" and "eat" become "eat". On the other hand, lemmatization is more powerful than stemming because it considers not just the endings of words but the entire vocabulary to determine the correct lemma for a word. It uses dictionaries to look up possible morphological variations of each word and chooses the most appropriate one. Both stemming and lemmatization are important preprocessing steps in NLP. 

2.3 Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging)
Part-of-speech tagging is the task of assigning a category label to every word in a given sentence according to its role within the sentence. There are several tagsets defined for POS tagging, such as Penn Treebank POS tags, Universal Dependencies POS tags, Brown Corpus POS tags, and Google Ngram Pos tags. Each tagset defines a unique set of labels that categorize words into syntactic roles. Examples include noun (NN), verb (VBZ), adjective (JJ), pronoun (PRP), preposition (IN), adverb (RB), conjunction (AND), interjection (UH), numeral (CD), determiner (DT), etc.

2.4 Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and categorizing named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, times, etc. These categories can help in better understanding the meaning of sentences and facilitates tasks like information retrieval, machine translation, and question answering. NER requires multiple stages, including training a model using labeled data, evaluating the performance of the model, and fine-tuning the model parameters until optimal results are obtained.

2.5 Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the task of classifying the underlying polarity of a piece of text towards positive, negative, or neutral. It often focuses on analyzing opinions expressed in text, rather than factual statements. Some popular techniques include lexicon-based approach, rule-based approach, machine learning approach, and hybrid approach.

2.6 Topic Modeling
Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling for discovering topics in a collection of documents. Topics describe the overall structure of a corpus of documents, and are represented as probability distributions over words in the vocabulary. By looking at groups of co-occurring words, topic models identify latent structures in the data that correspond to meaningful themes or ideas. Unsupervised clustering techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) can be used for topic modeling.

2.7 Other Algorithms
Besides the above algorithms mentioned here, there are many others that can be applied to NLP tasks, including keyword extraction, text summarization, automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language generation (NLG), question answering system, etc. All these require specialized libraries or frameworks to implement them.
