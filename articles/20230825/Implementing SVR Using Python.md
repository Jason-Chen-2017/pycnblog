Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of regression analysis that utilizes support vectors to predict continuous outcomes. In this article we will implement Support Vector Regression algorithm using Python and perform some prediction on the given dataset.

Support vector machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification or regression tasks. They can handle both categorical and numerical data and work well even with small datasets. However, they have some drawbacks such as high computational complexity and lack of interpretability. Therefore, many researchers have proposed kernel functions which enable them to use non-linear relationships between features while still being able to capture complex patterns in the data. 

One of these popular kernel functions is Radial Basis Function (RBF), which provides a way to separate nonlinearities within the input space by mapping it into a higher dimensional feature space through the usage of Gaussian kernels. The main idea behind SVM is to find the best hyperplane (decision boundary) that maximizes the margin around the training samples. Additionally, regularization techniques like Lasso and Ridge can be applied to improve the model’s generalization performance. 

Support Vector Regression (SVR) builds upon the ideas of SVMs but applies it to the problem of predicting a continuous outcome rather than classifying instances. It works similarly to other types of regressions where an estimated target variable is computed based on known predictor variables. Instead of finding the optimal decision boundary, SVR finds the optimal hyperplane that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual values, giving more weight to observations that fall close to the hyperplane. This means that SVR fits the model to the datapoints while also taking account of their uncertainties and outliers. Moreover, SVR has been proven to perform better than traditional linear models when faced with highly nonlinear problems.

In summary, SVMs provide a flexible framework for modeling complex relationships among features, while SVR focuses on fitting smooth curves or surfaces to the data points while taking uncertainty and outliers into consideration. By implementing SVR using Python, we will gain insights into how SVMs can be used for regression problems.

This section briefly describes related background concepts including linear algebra, multivariate calculus, probability theory, statistics, and optimization methods. These topics are not necessary for understanding SVR implementation but may prove useful in further reading and reference.

## Linear Algebra
Linear algebra refers to a branch of mathematics that deals with geometric transformations, systems of equations, and matrices. Here are some key concepts:

1. Vectors: A vector is an ordered collection of numbers called coordinates that specify the position, direction, magnitude, or motion of a point in space. 

2. Matrices: A matrix is a rectangular table of numbers arranged in rows and columns that form a grid. Each element of the matrix corresponds to one value taken from the row and column indices.

For example, consider the following two-dimensional system of equations:

x + y = 7
y - x = 3

We could represent this equation in matrix form as:

[1  1] [x]   [7]
[0 -1] [y] = [3]

where each row represents one equation and each column represents one unknown variable. We can solve for the coefficients in the first equation by multiplying the right-hand side by the inverse of the coefficient matrix:

[a b]^-1 * [7]
           [3]

The resulting solution gives us the slope and intercept of the line passing through the origin:

slope = (-b/a) = 3/(-1) = -3/1 = -3

intercept = c = (b^2 / (4*a)) - ((ax+by)/(2*a))/((ay+bx)/(2*a))
            = (-1*7)/(-3/-1) + (1*3)/(1/-1)
            = 4

Therefore, the line equation passing through the origin in Cartesian coordinate system is y = mx + c, where m=-3 and c=4.

## Multivariate Calculus
Multivariate calculus is concerned with studying functions of multiple variables. One common operation involved with SVMs involves calculating partial derivatives. Here are some important concepts:

1. Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is a method for finding the local minimum of a function by iteratively moving towards its steepest descent until convergence. It uses a step size determined by a learning rate parameter η to determine how far to move in the negative gradient direction at each iteration. For convex functions, the sequence of steps converges to a global minimum.

2. Hessian Matrix: The Hessian matrix of a scalar function F(x) represents all possible second-order mixed partial derivatives of F relative to its inputs. Its determinant quantifies whether the function is positive definite, negative definite, or indefinite. If the Hessian matrix is positive definite, then there exist unique positive-valued eigenvectors corresponding to decreasing eigenvalues; otherwise, if it is negative definite, then there exist unique negative-valued eigenvectors corresponding to increasing eigenvalues.

## Probability Theory
Probability theory is the mathematical framework for making predictions about the likelihood of different events occurring. Some key concepts include:

1. Random Variables: A random variable X takes on discrete or continuous values according to certain probabilities assigned to different outcomes. Common examples include coin flip outcomes, dice roll outcomes, stock prices, etc.

2. Probability Distribution Functions: A probability distribution function assigns probabilities to different outcomes of a random variable. Common distributions include normal distribution, binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, etc.

## Statistics
Statistics consists of techniques for analyzing data collected from experiments and observations. It covers various statistical tests, measures of central tendency, measures of spread, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. Some key concepts include:

1. Mean: The mean of a set of data is simply the average value calculated by adding up all the individual values and dividing by the total number of values.

2. Variance: The variance of a set of data represents the degree of variation or dispersion around the mean. A low variance indicates that the data tends to cluster closely around the mean, whereas a high variance indicates that the data tends to scatter widely around the mean.

## Optimization Methods
Optimization methods involve solving for the most optimal solution to a variety of problems such as finding the maximum or minimum of a function, assigning jobs to workers, and scheduling delivery vehicles. Some key concepts include:

1. Gradient Method: The gradient method is a first-order optimization algorithm used to minimize a function that maps n variables onto a single scalar value. At each iteration, it computes the gradient of the objective function, which points in the direction of greatest increase, and updates the variables in the opposite direction.

2. Newton's Method: Newton's method extends the gradient method to unconstrained optimization problems, which allows it to escape saddle points and reach optimum solutions in fewer iterations compared to gradient method.
