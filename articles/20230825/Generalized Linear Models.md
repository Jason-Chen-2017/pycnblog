# 1.简介
  

Generalized linear models (GLMs) are a class of statistical models that allows for response variables to be predicted using a linear combination of predictor variables while accounting for the presence of other factors or influences on the response variable(s). GLMs provide an elegant and flexible way to handle both continuous and categorical predictors and can capture non-linear relationships between response and predictor variables. In this article we will discuss one of the most commonly used types of GLM known as the logistic regression model which is widely used in various fields such as biology, economics, and finance. We will first briefly explain what a generalized linear model is and then focus our attention on the logistic regression model, which is popular due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships and modeling binary responses. Finally, we will go through some common issues with logistic regression and suggest possible solutions to overcome these challenges. Overall, this article aims to offer an accessible introduction to generalized linear models and highlight how they have revolutionized statistics and machine learning by enabling us to analyze complex patterns in real world data sets.

## 2.1. Overview
A generalized linear model (GLM) is a statistical model that relates the expected value of a dependent variable to a set of independent variables. It assumes that there exist an underlying function that generates the dependence, called the link function, which links the mean of the normal distribution to the parameter vector of the GLM. The resulting relationship depends on several parameters that need to be estimated from a dataset of observed values of the independent and dependent variables. There are three main components to a GLM:

1. Link Function: This specifies the mathematical relationship between the expected value of the dependent variable and the mean of the normal distribution. Common choices include the identity function, the logit function, and the probit function. Logistic regression uses the logit function, whereas Poisson regression uses the logarithm function.
2. Error Distribution: This determines the shape of the error term, which captures any systematic differences between the actual and expected values. Common choices include Gaussian errors, binomial errors, and gamma errors.
3. Random Effects: These represent any confounding effects caused by factors that may not be measured directly but influence the outcome indirectly through their impact on the independent variables. They allow for interactions among variables to be captured, leading to improved performance compared to simple fixed effects models.

In addition to the above components, each GLM also has specific assumptions about the structure of the error term, including homoscedasticity (variance does not change across observations), normality of the error terms, and independence of the errors. Together, these components determine the strengths and weaknesses of different GLMs, making it important to carefully consider the nature of the problem at hand before selecting the appropriate model.

## 2.2. Terminology
Before moving into more detailed discussions of logistic regression, let's define some terminology related to GLMs and logistic regression specifically:

**Response Variable**: A variable whose goal is to be explained by the predictors. For example, if we want to predict the price of a house based on its features like number of bedrooms, area, and location, then the response variable would be the price. It could be a continuous variable (e.g., sales amount), a categorical variable (e.g., whether someone likes ice cream or chocolate), or even multiple outcomes separated by time (e.g., stock prices at different times). 

**Predictor Variables**: Independent variables that affect the response variable. If we had two predictor variables x1 and x2, then the equation of the regression line becomes y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2. Multiple predictors can be included in this equation, allowing us to account for interactions and higher order effects. Predictor variables can be continuous or categorical, and sometimes they can be time series. 

**Link Functions**: Mathematical functions that map the mean of the normal distribution to the parameter vector of the GLM. Common choices include the identity function, the logit function, and the probit function. In logistic regression, the link function is usually the logit function because it provides a nice smoothness property of the probability estimates. However, there are other options available depending on the nature of the problem being solved. 

**Error Distributions**: Distributions of the errors in the model. Common choices include Gaussian errors, binomial errors, and gamma errors. The choice of error distribution affects the type of likelihood function that needs to be used in the estimation procedure. 

**Logistic Regression Model**: An extension of the linear regression model where the dependent variable is binary (i.e., either 0 or 1). When the response variable takes only two values (such as "success" vs. "failure"), logistic regression is a natural fit because it maps the probabilities directly to the output range. In the simplest form, the logistic regression model involves estimating the coefficients of the regression equation using maximum likelihood methods such as gradient descent or Newton’s method. Other variations of logistic regression add additional constraints to the model, such as regularization or penalties to prevent overfitting.

## 2.3. Assumptions of Logistic Regression
There are several assumptions associated with logistic regression that must be satisfied in order to make valid inferences from the model. Some of the key assumptions are listed below:

1. Binary Dependent Variable: The dependent variable should take only two values. 

2. Normal Distribution: Errors follow a normal distribution. 

3. Conditional Independence: Observations do not affect each other except through the predictors. 

4. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and predictor variables is linear. 

5. Large Sample Size: The sample size should be large enough to accurately estimate the population parameters. 

6. No Multicollinearity: Correlation between independent variables should be small. 

7. Nonparametric Tests: P-values obtained from nonparametric tests such as the Likelihood Ratio Test or the Wald Test should be interpreted with caution. 

When making predictions with logistic regression, it is important to keep in mind certain limitations. One potential issue is the vanishing gradient problem, which occurs when the partial derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to the coefficients approaches zero. Another potential issue arises when using high dimensionality datasets, where the variance of the coefficients may become very large and may cause numerical instability in the algorithm. Various techniques such as ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net regression can be used to address these problems.
