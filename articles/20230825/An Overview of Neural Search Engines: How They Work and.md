# 2. Basic Concepts & Terms
Before diving deeper into the details of neural search engines, let’s first get familiarized with some basic concepts and terms used in this field. These concepts will be essential to understanding how neural search engines work and make sense of many advanced features provided by them. 

 ## 2.1 Datasets & Corpus
A dataset consists of a collection of documents which typically contains both textual and non-textual data. A corpus, on the other hand, refers to all the available information from different sources. The corpus may include multiple datasets combined together. For example, Wikipedia is considered as a large corpus containing thousands of articles.

 ## 2.2 Query Language
The query language allows users to input natural language questions and commands that describe what they are looking for. It specifies the purpose of the request and includes keywords, phrases, or even sentences. There are various ways to represent a query in the query language including structured queries (e.g., SQL), unstructured queries (e.g., plain text), and logical forms (e.g., SPARQL). Different query languages have their unique syntaxes and usage rules. Some common query languages are Google’s search engine query language known as “GoogleQuery” or the Structured Query Language (SQL) used in databases.

 ## 2.3 Document Representation
Document representation refers to the method or technique used to encode the document content in numerical vectors or tensors. This process involves converting raw text into a machine-readable form that can be fed into neural networks. Common document representations include Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, etc. Some examples of pre-trained word embeddings include GloVe and Word2Vec.

 ## 2.4 Ranker & Retriever
Rankers and retrievers are two main components of a neural search engine. A ranker takes a set of candidate documents produced by a retriever, scores each document according to predefined criteria, and returns the top K results. The retriever produces a set of candidate documents by extracting relevant content from the database using the query and document representation techniques described earlier. Various approaches exist for retrieving candidates, such as semantic similarity search, nearest neighbor search, or deep learning-based ranking models.

## 2.5 Embedding & Vectorization
Embedding and vectorization refer to the transformation of words into numerical vectors or tensor format. One approach to embedding is to use word embeddings where similar words tend to appear closer to each other in vector space. Another approach is called BoW or bag-of-words where every document is represented as a sparse matrix containing counts of words occurring in the document. Lastly, there are other ways of representing documents such as term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or image representations obtained through convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## 2.6 Indexing
Indexing is the process of creating a searchable index for efficient querying. Typically, indexing involves processing the entire dataset to extract necessary information such as the location of each document within the dataset and encoding the document content using suitable techniques such as tf-idf or word embeddings. Additionally, indexing also involves storing metadata such as document titles and descriptions for quick access during searching.

## 2.7 Relevance Feedback
Relevance feedback is a feature offered by modern neural search engines that enables users to modify their original queries to receive more accurate results. This feature usually works by taking user clicks or feedback about the relevance of retrieved documents and adjusting the query accordingly. Examples of relevance feedback mechanisms include collaborative filtering or boosting algorithms.

# 3. Core Algorithmic Principles
Now that we have covered some fundamental concepts and terminology, let’s dive into the actual working mechanism of neural search engines. To simplify things, let’s assume that we only need to retrieve documents given a single query string. We won't talk about multi-query or batch processing here since those topics require additional computational resources and focus on optimizing performance rather than efficiency. Let's continue with the following algorithm steps:

1. Preprocessing: First, the query is processed to remove any stop words, convert the query into lowercase, and perform stemming or lemmatization if needed. 

2. Query Expansion: Next, the query is expanded by adding synonyms, hypernyms, or other related terms to increase recall rate. This step increases the number of possible matching documents without requiring extra computation. 

3. Query Escaping: If the query matches special characters or reserved words, these must be escaped before being passed to the tokenizer. Otherwise, the tokenizer might interpret certain symbols differently causing incorrect tokenization.

4. Tokenization: The query string is split into individual tokens or "terms". Common tokenizers include whitespace, character n-grams, and word n-grams. Each token is assigned a weight based on statistical or rule-based methods. 

5. Term Selection: After generating the list of tokens, terms that match predetermined patterns or constraints are selected and removed. For instance, terms shorter than three characters are removed, numbers are skipped, and acronyms are replaced by their longer forms. 

6. Term Weighting: After selecting the final set of tokens, weights are assigned to each token based on their importance in context. Methods include log-likelihood measure, probabilistic ranking functions, and variations of PageRank. 

7. Document Retrieval: The remaining set of tokens is used to retrieve relevant documents from a pre-built inverted index. Documents are sorted by their score generated by the previous steps and returned to the user along with their respective scores. 

This is a general overview of the core algorithmic principles involved in neural search engines. Now let’s move onto some practical tips and tricks to avoid common mistakes while implementing your own neural search engine.

# Tips and Tricks
There are several aspects of neural search that go beyond simply applying machine learning algorithms. Below are some commonly encountered issues and best practices to consider while implementing a neural search engine.


### Handling Noisy Data
One of the biggest challenges in dealing with noisy data is ensuring that training samples are representative of the target domain. This is crucial because neural search engines rely heavily on similarity metrics to suggest relevant results. Therefore, if the training data is biased towards specific categories or users, the system will become less effective. This issue can be addressed by carefully balancing the amount of training data collected across different categories or users, augmenting the data with synthetic data created by noise injection, or introducing regularization techniques such as dropout or early stopping to prevent overfitting. 


### Model Bias
Another challenge faced by neural search engines is the existence of model bias. Model bias occurs when the training data does not accurately reflect the true distribution of the real world. As a result, the model tends to produce misleading or unexpected results. One way to address this problem is to collect additional data to cover different perspectives or populations and train separate models for different segments of the population. 


### Overfitting
Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts memorizing the training data instead of generalizing well to unseen data. This issue can be mitigated by increasing the size of the training data, reducing the complexity of the model architecture, or employing regularization techniques such as dropout or early stopping. 


### Caching
Caching is another important optimization technique to reduce the computational cost of repeated predictions. Whenever a prediction is made, the input query and retrieved documents can be cached so that subsequent requests can be served faster without having to recompute them.


### Non-stationary Queries
Neural search engines must adapt quickly to changes in user behavior and preferences. In addition to adapting to changing queries and documents, the engine must learn to handle non-stationary queries such as ones resulting from time-sensitive interactions or rapid shifts in user intentions. This requires continuous monitoring of user actions and interactions, constant retraining of the engine, and careful handling of outliers or unexpected events.
