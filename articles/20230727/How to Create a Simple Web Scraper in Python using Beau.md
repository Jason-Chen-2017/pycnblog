         Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites that are stored on the internet. It has many applications such as building datasets for machine learning or data analysis purposes, automating repetitive tasks, gathering real-time information, and much more.
         
         In this article, we will create a simple web scraper using Python's Beautiful Soup library and the Requests library. We'll use these libraries to fetch HTML content from an online website and extract specific elements from it using CSS selectors. Finally, we'll save the extracted data into a CSV file.

        ## 2.1 What is Web Scraping?
        
        Web scraping, also known as web harvesting, refers to the process of extracting large amounts of data from websites by programmatically interacting with them through automated software programs. The collected data can be used for various purposes including database creation, data mining, business intelligence tools, sentiment analysis, etc.

        Web scrapers typically employ several techniques such as crawling, parsing, filtering, and storing the obtained data. Crawling involves browsing the website’s pages and finding links leading to new pages. Parsing involves reading the HTML code of each page and identifying the relevant data based on predefined rules. Filtering involves removing unwanted data or duplicates from the dataset. Storing the data is usually done in a structured format like a relational database or a flat file.

        Some common uses of web scraping include:

        1. Data Extraction: Extracting data from websites for further processing and storage (e.g., financial data, social media insights).
        2. Content Collection: Collecting articles, videos, images, audio files, and other multimedia content from multiple sources (e.g., news agencies, blog aggregators).
        3. Data Mining: Analyzing the patterns and trends within large sets of data (e.g., customer behavior, market research reports).
        4. Personalization: Customizing user experiences (e.g., product recommendations) based on individual preferences or behaviors.
        5. Legal Aid: Collecting government documents related to natural disasters, crimes, or human rights violations (e.g., to prevent abuse of power).
        6. Business Intelligence: Building dashboards and data visualizations to analyze company performance and make better business decisions (e.g., sales forecasting, marketing campaign effectiveness).


        ## 2.2 Why Should I Care About Web Scraping?

        There are numerous reasons why you should care about web scraping. Here are just some examples:

        1. Gathering Data: If your goal is to collect data, then web scraping offers an efficient way to do so. You don't need to spend time manually searching for data sources, nor do you have to worry about formatting issues or outdated information. Simply point the scraper at any webpage and let it go!
        2. Replacing Deprecated APIs: With the advent of cloud computing and serverless architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to access reliable data sources directly. As a result, businesses are relying heavily on API integration platforms that provide high volumes of data. However, not all APIs update regularly and may become deprecated over time. Using web scraping, companies can retrieve updated data without having to rely solely on their API integrations. 
        3. Enhancing User Experience: Your customers might appreciate faster response times, higher conversion rates, and personalized products. Additionally, the presence of up-to-date information could lead to improved search engine rankings, which ultimately leads to increased traffic to your website. 
        4. Compliance Reporting: Companies often need to report on publicly available data to comply with legal requirements. However, companies cannot always afford the resources required to maintain their own infrastructure or hire staff to monitor constantly changing data feeds. By utilizing web scraping, you can automate the retrieval and reporting of necessary data, making compliance easier than ever before.
        5. Market Research: Analysing the buying habits of different demographics and geographical locations can provide valuable insights into brand personality and consumer interests. Web scraping allows businesses to quickly collect data on hundreds of thousands of people across the globe and store it securely for later analysis.
