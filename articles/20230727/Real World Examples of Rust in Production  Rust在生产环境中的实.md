          ## Ownership Semantics（所有权语义）
          One of the most important principles in Rust’s design is its ownership system. Understanding ownership helps you understand many aspects of Rust, including borrowing, mutability, lifetimes, and shared references. We first need to understand what ownership means in Rust.
          
          ### Variables and Data Structures
          In Rust, variables and data structures have an owner. An owner determines who manages the resources associated with the variable or data structure, and when those resources should be freed. When a value is assigned to a variable (or passed into a function), it is given to the variable's owner, which may decide to either copy or move the value based on the specific type and size involved.
          
          #### Copyable Types
          A copyable type has a simple memory layout where all fields occupy a single contiguous block of memory. These types include scalar values like integers, floating point numbers, booleans, characters, and tuples. They also include aggregate types like arrays and structs, but only if they do not contain any uncopyable fields. For example:
          
              struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }
              
              let p1 = Point{x: 1, y: 2}; // p1 has an owner
              let p2 = p1;              // p2 now owns p1's resources
                                          // since both p1 and p2 use the same Point instance
          
          Here, `p1` and `p2` own different instances of the `Point` struct. Since `Point` does not contain any uncopyable fields, copying them requires no additional memory allocation beyond their sizes combined. Therefore, these two lines create two separate points with distinct properties (`x` and `y`).
          
          #### Movable Types
          A movable type is one whose memory representation consists of multiple disjoint pieces of memory. Move operations can be much faster than copies due to optimized memory reclamation techniques. Examples of movable types include vectors, strings, hash maps, and trees. Because of this property, moving large values between functions can often avoid unnecessary allocations and deallocations, improving performance. For example:
          
              fn make_vec() -> Vec<i32> {
                  vec![1, 2, 3]
              }
              
              
              fn main() {
                  let v1 = make_vec();          // moves elements from the vector into a temporary buffer
                                              // creating a new empty vector in this process
                  
                  println!("{:?}", v1);           // prints [1, 2, 3]
                  
                  let v2 = std::mem::take(&mut v1);    // transfers ownership of the original Vector back to v2
                                              // using mem::take method instead of manually dropping each element
                  
                  println!("{:?}", v2);      // prints []
                  
                  drop(v2)                   // explicitly drops the remaining elements in the Vector
                                              
              }
          
          Here, the `make_vec()` function returns a `Vec<i32>`, which contains three integer values. However, after calling `make_vec()`, ownership of its resources has been transferred to a local variable named `v1`. Once the contents of `v1` have been printed, `v2` takes ownership of those resources by taking control over the vector via the `std::mem::take()` method. Finally, we call the `drop()` function to release the remaining resources owned by `v2`, which are just a zero-length vector at this point.
          
          Note that the above code uses the `println!()` macro to print the values stored in the vectors. If there were any pointers inside the vectors, printing them would result in undefined behavior because the vector might contain dangling pointers. To prevent this, Rust enforces certain rules around referencing pointers contained within vectors. You can read more about these restrictions in the Rustonomicon book.
          
          #### References
          While ownership refers to a particular resource, Rust also supports references, which allow you to refer to another value without transferring ownership. These references can be immutable or mutable depending on whether they're declared with `&` or `&mut`. For example:
          
              fn double(x: &[i32]) -> Vec<i32> {
                  x.iter().map(|n| n * 2).cloned().collect()
              }
              
              fn main() {
                  let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];     // creates a vector with some initial values
                  let doubled = double(&nums);   // passes a reference to the vector to the function
                                                   // note that the reference must be declared with &
                  assert_eq!(doubled, [2, 4, 6]);
              }
          
          Here, the `double()` function takes a slice of integers (`[i32]`) as input, and returns a new vector containing twice each number. We pass a reference to the original vector to the function using `&nums`, which causes it to bind to the existing storage location rather than making a copy. Then, we iterate through the slices using `.iter()`, map each value to twice itself using `.map(|n| n * 2)`, clone the resulting iterator into a new vector using `.cloned()`, and collect the results using `.collect()`. The resulting vector is then returned by the function. After being passed a reference, `nums` remains accessible until the end of the program, allowing us to modify it safely even though we don't actually own it anymore.
          
          ### Borrowing vs Mutable Borrowing
          In Rust, you can borrow a variable temporarily to perform an operation while retaining access to the underlying resource. The borrow lasts for the duration of the scope in which the borrow is active. There are two kinds of borrows: immutable borrows (`&T`) and mutable borrows (`&mut T`). Immutable borrows allow you to read the value of the variable, while mutable borrows allow you to read and write to the value. For example:
          
              fn add_one(nums: &[i32]) -> Vec<i32> {
                  let mut output = Vec::new();
                  for num in nums {
                      output.push(*num + 1);
                  }
                  output
              }
              
              fn main() {
                  let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];
                  let added = add_one(&nums);       // immutable borrow of nums during iteration
                  assert_eq!(added, [2, 3, 4]);
                      
                  let mut nums_mut = vec![1, 2, 3];
                  let mutated = add_one(&mut nums_mut[..]);   // mutable borrow of nums_mut
                                                  // cloning the entire array before modifying it
                  assert_eq!(mutated, [2, 3, 4]);
              }
          
          
          Here, the `add_one()` function takes a slice of integers as input, clones the input slice into a new vector, and iterates through the elements adding 1 to each. It uses an immutable borrow to ensure that the original values remain accessible throughout the loop. On the other hand, the second part of the code uses a mutable borrow to increment each element of the cloned array before assigning it back to the original array. By doing so, we can modify the input array safely.

          ### Lifetimes
          Another important concept in Rust is called lifetimes. A lifetime indicates how long a reference is valid. It helps prevent dangling references and memory leaks, among other things. Specifically, every borrowed value has a corresponding lifetime parameter specified after its type name. Lifetime parameters follow the declaration of the referenced variable, and indicate how long the reference should be considered valid. The compiler checks that all borrows are valid at runtime, and issues errors if they go stale. For example:
          
              fn longest<'a>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
                  if s1.len() > s2.len() {
                      s1
                  } else {
                      s2
                  }
              }
              
              fn main() {
                  let string1 = "Hello";
                  let string2 = "World!";
                  let longest_str = longest(string1, string2);
                  println!("{}", longest_str);   // prints "World!"
                  
                  // uncommenting this line would cause a compile time error:
                  // let invalid_str = longest("foo", "bar");
              }
          
          
          Here, the `longest()` function takes two strings as arguments, compares their lengths using the `.len()` method, and returns a reference to the longer string. We specify the lifetime `'a` for both inputs and return value, indicating that both strings live at least as long as the current stack frame. When we try to take a mutable reference to one of the inputs, say `string1`, outside of the function body, the compiler complains because the reference goes out of scope too soon. Similarly, trying to declare a reference with a shorter lifetime than its corresponding input would cause a compilation error.
