         ## 3.1. Indexing Strategies: How Databases Organize Data with Indexes
         ### What are indexes?
         Indexes in databases are a mechanism for storing information about the location of where each piece of data is stored on disk or other media such as memory or tape drives. Indexes make it easier to find specific pieces of data by allowing you to quickly locate them based on their values or order without having to search every row in a table. In other words, indexes speed up database queries by providing an additional layer of organization that allows the system to more easily retrieve the relevant rows from storage rather than reading through all of the data sequentially. 
         ### Why use indexes?
         Without proper indexing, a relational database management system (RDBMS) would have to scan every row of a table before finding the relevant data. This can take much longer than simply searching through a few indexed columns. Additionally, if one column is updated frequently, then its corresponding index may need to be updated, which could also cause performance issues. Therefore, using efficient indexing strategies is critical to optimizing database performance. Here are some reasons why using effective indexing is important:

         * Reduced Disk I/O operations: Indexing makes it possible to reduce the number of disk accesses required when retrieving data. By reducing the amount of data that needs to be searched, accessing the necessary data becomes faster.
         * Increased query performance: Indexes allow the RDBMS to optimize searches and retrieval times by organizing tables into a manner that facilitates quick retrieval of data without scanning every record.
         * Improves insert and update performance: As changes made to the table are committed, the corresponding indexes will be automatically updated ensuring that any future searches for those records are properly found.

         #### Types of indexes
         There are three types of indexes used in databases:

            1. Primary key index: The primary key of a table should always be included in the primary key index, so that searching for data by this unique identifier is easy and fast.
            2. Clustered index: A clustered index is similar to a B-tree index, but it must contain only unique values and is usually created when the table is defined. It has several advantages over B-trees because of its better cache locality compared to traditional B-trees.
            3. Non-clustered index: A non-clustered index is like a separate table containing references to the original table's keys. These indices do not guarantee uniqueness and they can include duplicate entries, whereas clustered indexes cannot.

          ### When to create indexes?
          To ensure maximum efficiency, it is recommended to create indexes whenever possible while designing the schema. However, creating too many indexes can slow down the database and require unnecessary overhead, especially for smaller datasets. Therefore, the right balance between optimization and complexity lies within the realm of deciding what to index and how to handle large datasets. 

          Furthermore, there are certain cases where indexing may actually degrade performance:
          * Highly selective queries: If a single instance requires multiple scans to return results, adding an index might not improve performance. Instead, consider optimizing the application code or server configuration to avoid these scenarios.
          * Unique values: Creating an index on a unique value may significantly increase space usage and decrease query performance due to excessive fragmentation. In general, try to avoid creating indexes on columns that contain mostly duplicates.
          
          ### Conclusion
          Understanding the basics of indexes and how they work under the hood is crucial for optimizing database performance. Knowing when to add and remove indexes is essential to balancing optimization and performance. Overall, good indexing practice involves careful planning and monitoring, keeping your indexes current and optimizing your SQL statements to minimize data transfer.

        ## 3.2. Query Planning Strategies: How Database Systems Generate Query Execution Plans
         ### Overview
         A query execution plan is a set of steps that the database management system takes to execute a SQL statement. Each step represents either a physical operation performed on data structures, such as loading pages into main memory or performing a hash join, or a logical operation performed on intermediate results obtained from previous steps, such as filtering out unwanted rows or applying aggregate functions. The goal of a query optimizer is to generate the most efficient query execution plan given the structure and content of the data being queried. 
         
         Different database products use different algorithms to generate query plans, ranging from simple heuristics to complex machine learning models. In general, query planners focus on optimizing the cost of executing individual operators and making sure they are executed efficiently. They also aim to identify common patterns in queries and exploit them to simplify the overall execution plan.
         
         Some of the core principles involved in generating query plans are as follows:
         
             1. Cost Based Optimization: Among the various factors affecting query execution time, costs play a significant role. A query plan generated using a cost model predicts the cost of running each operator and chooses the ones with the lowest expected cost to run first. This approach helps prevent suboptimal plans that result in long waits during query execution.

             2. Adaptive Query Processing: In adaptive query processing systems, the database continuously adapts to changing workload characteristics. For example, if new data is added to the database or an existing index is no longer useful, the database dynamically reorganizes the data and creates a new query execution plan accordingly.

             3. Pushdown Optimizations: Pushdown optimizations involve moving parts of a query computation earlier in the query execution process, closer to the source of data. This approach enables the database engine to perform the computations needed to produce the requested output directly on the data itself, saving memory and network bandwidth.

             4. Vectorization: Vectorization refers to the process of converting scalar calculations into vectorized operations, improving computational performance and utilizing modern hardware features.
              
             5. Multi-threading and Parallelism: Query planners can parallelize expensive operations, reducing wall clock runtime, by dividing the workload among multiple threads or processes. While multi-threaded approaches offer improved throughput, parallelism comes at increased complexity and resource consumption, requiring specialized hardware and software infrastructure. 

            6. Plan Reuse: Once a query execution plan has been chosen, the same plan can be reused for subsequent queries with the same pattern of data access. This technique can help save valuable resources and improves query response time.

           7. Common Table Expressions: Common table expressions (CTEs) provide a way to encapsulate subqueries inside a parent query, allowing the database to reuse their results instead of recomputing them. This technique reduces redundant computations and saves memory.


         ### Example Query Plan
         Consider the following SQL statement:

         ```
         SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name 
         FROM orders o 
         JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
         ```

          This query joins two tables, "orders" and "customers", on the customer ID field. Depending on the size of both tables and the available resources, a suitable query plan can be generated that includes multiple join operations and filters to extract the desired data. Below is an example query plan for this statement:


        
        ### Conclusion
        Understanding how query execution plans are generated is critical for optimizing database performance. Good query optimization techniques include using cost-based optimization to generate accurate estimates of the relative costs of different operators and identifying potential bottlenecks or hotspots. Taking advantage of pushdown and vectorization optimizations can further enhance performance and reduce memory footprint. By leveraging multi-threading and parallelism, query plans can be optimized further by distributing compute across multiple cores or nodes, leading to greater scalability and reduced latency.
