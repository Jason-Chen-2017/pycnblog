 As a software architect and AI expert with more than 7 years of experience in the field, I feel it is my duty to write an engaging technical blog article on this topic that will attract great attention from various readers who are interested in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. 

          The main goal of writing such articles is to share insights and knowledge about NLP techniques and applications, which can help developers, researchers, and companies alike improve their products and services by better understanding how AI works and why it's important for different industries like healthcare, finance, social media analysis, and others.

          Therefore, as one who has many years' experience in the industry, I am sure that I have all the necessary skills and abilities required to write such articles without any hesitation or hesitancy. In this article, we'll discuss using filtering options for controlling what gets generated during NLP tasks. We'll explore three common types of filters used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS tagging), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Sentiment Analysis. 

          Let's get started!
          
          # 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
         ## 2.1 POS tagging:
            Part-of-speech (PoS) tagging refers to assigning a part of speech to each word in a sentence, where parts of speech include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, determiners, conjunctions, and prepositions. It helps in identifying the role of words in a sentence and classifying them according to their syntax. 

            For example, consider the following sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

            After applying PoS tagging, the output would be:

                [(The, DETERMINER), 
                 (quick, ADJECTIVE), 
                 (brown, NOUN),
                 (fox, NOUN), 
                 (jumps, VERB), 
                 (over, PREPOSITION), 
                 (the, DETERMINER), 
                 (lazy, ADVERB), 
                 (dog., NOUN)]

         ## 2.2 Named entity recognition (NER):
             Named entity recognition (NER) identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, and dates. It uses statistical methods and rules to identify these entities based on their characteristics such as capitalization, punctuation marks, or presence of digits. These entities often play crucial roles in building structured data sets.

     For example, consider the following sentences:

        Sentence 1: "Apple Inc. was founded by Johnson and Johnson"
        Sentence 2: "Barack Obama visited France yesterday and lived happily ever after."
    
     Applying NER, the output would be:
     
       Sentence 1: [('Apple', 'ORGANIZATION'),
                    ('Inc.', 'ORGANIZATION')]
       Sentence 2: [('Barack', 'PERSON_NAME'),
                    ('Obama', 'PERSON_NAME'),
                    ('France', 'LOCATION'),
                    ('yesterday', 'DATE'),
                    ('happily', 'ADVERB'),
                    ('ever', 'ADVERB')]

 ## 2.3 Sentiment analysis:
    Sentiment analysis involves analyzing the opinions expressed in texts and determining whether they express positive or negative sentiments towards specific topics or aspects of the text. It relies heavily on lexicons, dictionaries, and machine learning algorithms to detect sentiment polarity and mood in text.

    For instance, given the statement “I love ice cream”, sentiment analysis would classify it as having a positive sentiment. On the other hand, if it were instead stated as “I hate monday blues” sentiment analysis might categorize it as negative. Sentiment analysis has been widely used in marketing, customer service, political discourse analysis, and opinion mining domains due to its ability to extract valuable information from large volumes of unstructured text.
    
    Here is some sample code in Python demonstrating how to perform sentiment analysis using NLTK library:


```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Create an instance of the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer object
sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Define the input text
input_text = "I love ice cream"

# Analyze the sentiment of the input text
sentiment_score = sid.polarity_scores(input_text)

# Print the sentiment score
print(sentiment_score)
```

Output:

```python
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.297, 'pos': 0.703, 'compound': 0.5897}
```

In this case, the compound score indicates a strong positive sentiment towards ice cream. A score closer to +1 represents a very positive sentiment while a score closer to -1 represents a very negative sentiment. A score close to 0 means neutrality.
