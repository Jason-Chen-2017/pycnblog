# 1.简介
         
　　Rust is a systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety without garbage collection or other runtime mechanisms that cause slowdowns or crashes in large applications. It's been gaining popularity due to its low-level control and memory safety guarantees compared to other languages, making it particularly well suited for writing operating system kernel code and embedded software. In this article, we'll cover the basics of Rust by walking through some sample code snippets, discussing how they work under the hood, and highlighting key features like ownership and borrowing. We'll also present exercises for students who want to learn more about Rust through hands-on projects.
         　　In addition to introducing the reader to Rust, we will also discuss what computer science concepts are relevant to Rust and teach them using examples from real world problems such as sorting algorithms and web development frameworks. By the end of this article, readers should have an understanding of fundamental principles of Rust alongside practical knowledge on how to apply these concepts to solve real-world problems efficiently.

         　　Let’s start our discussion of Rust by exploring some basic terminology and concepts.

         ### Ownership

         “Ownership” refers to the way Rust handles memory allocation and deallocation. When you declare a variable in Rust, Rust allocates space for that variable on the heap, but not necessarily contiguously in memory. Instead, it keeps track of which variables currently own each piece of data so that when one variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the memory used by that variable. This makes it easy to reason about memory usage and avoids many common memory management errors. 

　　     For example:

         ```rust
         fn main() {
             let x = String::from("hello"); // x owns "hello"
             println!("{}", x); // prints "hello"
             
             let y = &x; // y points to the same string as x
                      // y does NOT own anything new here
             println!("y: {}", y); // prints "hello"

             drop(y); // explicitly free up the memory owned by y
                      // now both x and y go out of scope
                      // Rust automatically frees up the memory used by x
         }
         ```

　　　　　　

         Here, `String` is a built-in type in Rust that represents textual data. The `let mut x = String::from("hello")` statement creates a new `String` object named `x`, and sets its value to `"hello"`. Since strings can be mutable, `x` takes ownership of this data and controls its lifetime. The first line then uses the `println!` macro to print out the contents of `x`. Since `x` still has a valid reference to its data, it prints the correct output. However, if we try to use `x` after it goes out of scope, we get a compiler error:

         ```rust
         fn main() {
             let x = String::from("hello");
             println!("{}", x);
                 
             let y = &x; 
             println!("y: {}", y); 
             
             drop(y);
             println!("{}", x); // error: use of moved value
                              // println!("{}", y) would also fail 
         }
         ```

         　　The second block assigns another variable (`y`) to point to the same string data as `x`. As mentioned above, references do not take ownership of any underlying data, so `y` only holds onto the pointer itself. Once again, we attempt to print out the content of `x`, even though it's already gone out of scope, which results in a compile-time error because we're trying to access a variable whose memory was freed earlier. If we wanted to keep accessing the original string once it had been dropped, we could use an interior immutable reference instead:

         ```rust
         fn main() {
             let x = String::from("hello");
             println!("{}", x);
             
             let y = &&x; // note double ampersands
             println!("y: {} (address: {:p})", *y, y); // dereference y to get the actual string

                 // alternatively, we could assign &mut x to z
                 // then we could modify z directly instead of relying on pointers
                 // e.g., z[0] = 'H';
             println!("z: {} (address: {:p})", *(y).clone(), y); // clone the ref before dereferencing to keep the original alive

                  // note that y is technically a shared reference, meaning multiple owners could exist at the same time
                  // however, since Rust prevents dangling pointers by default, it's usually better to avoid sharing references across threads/tasks
             drop(y); // drops the last reference to the string data inside `x`
                     // the remaining owner of the string data is `x`, so Rust doesn't need to worry about cleaning up memory
             println!("{}", x); // prints "hello", no error occurs
         }
         ```

         这里，我们创建了一个新的字符串变量`x`，并打印出其内容。然后，我们使用`&`运算符创建一个不可变引用(`&str`)指向`x`。该引用只是一个“别名”，不属于任何特定的变量或数据。换句话说，`x`在创建后仍然有效。最后，我们调用一个名为`drop()`的函数，释放掉`y`对字符串数据的引用，但是`x`仍然拥有它的数据，因此不能被释放。但是，通过克隆`y`，并强制解引用得到它的副本，我们可以获取到原始数据，并对其进行修改。如果我们想要直接修改`x`，而不需要克隆一个引用的话，可以使用`&mut x`创建一个可变引用。

          ### Borrowing
          
          Another important concept in Rust is borrowing, whereby one part of your program temporarily gives up ownership of something while working with it. Borrowing allows two different kinds of borrows: shared and mutable borrows.

          Shared borrows allow you to read from a resource, whereas mutable borrows allow you to write into it. To create a shared borrow, you simply use the `&` operator. To create a mutable borrow, you use the `&mut` operator. You cannot mix and match shared and mutable borrows within the same scope.

          For example:

          ```rust
          fn main() {
              let x = vec![1, 2, 3];

              // creating a shared borrow
              let y = &x;
              println!("shared borrow: {:?}", y); // prints "[1, 2, 3]"

              // creating a mutable borrow
              let mut z = &mut x;
              z[0] = 4; // mutate the element at index 0
              println!("mutable borrow: {:?}", z); // prints "[4, 2, 3]"
          }
          ```

          Here, we've defined a vector `x` containing three integers. We then create a shared borrow (`&y`) and a mutable borrow (`&mut z`) to it. Because vectors are allowed to grow or shrink dynamically, this means that the length of `x` can change during the execution of the program, leading to undefined behavior if we try to create references to nonexistent elements. Therefore, we generally prefer to minimize the amount of mutable data that we hold onto whenever possible.

          Using shared borrows ensures that our code is immune to data races. Data races occur when two or more threads or tasks concurrently access the same memory location, resulting in unpredictable and incorrect behavior. Mutable borrows prevent data races because they guarantee exclusive access to the data being borrowed.

          Finally, we call the `drop()` function to release the shared borrow (`y`). When all the references to `x` have been dropped, Rust automatically releases the memory associated with `x`, ensuring thread-safety and preventing undefined behavior.

          ### Traits and Generics

          　　Traits and generics are powerful features of Rust that make it easier to write safe, maintainable, and reusable code. Let’s explore them in more detail.

           **Traits**

         　　A trait specifies a set of methods that a particular type must implement. Types that implement traits are said to satisfy the contract specified by the trait. Among other things, traits are used to define functionality that can be reused across unrelated types. Examples include cloning objects (`Clone` trait), printing values (`Debug` trait), and random number generation (`Rng` trait). Here's an example of defining a custom trait called `Hello`:

          ```rust
          trait Hello {
              fn say_hello(&self);
          }
          
          struct Person;
          
          impl Hello for Person {
              fn say_hello(&self) {
                  println!("Hello, person!");
              }
          }
          
          fn say_hello<T: Hello>(h: T) {
              h.say_hello();
          }
          
          fn main() {
              let p = Person;
              
              say_hello(p); // Output: Hello, person!
          }
          ```

          The `Hello` trait defines a single method called `say_hello()`. The `Person` structure implements this trait by providing an implementation for `say_hello()`. The `fn say_hello<T: Hello>` declaration states that this function expects a parameter of a type that implements the `Hello` trait. We call this function with an instance of the `Person` structure and see that it correctly outputs "Hello, person!"

          **Generics**

         　　Rust supports generic functions and types, allowing us to write functions and types that can work with different types of input parameters. One example of a generic function is the `iter()` method on collections like vectors and slices. This method works with any type that implements the `Iterator` trait. Here's an example of implementing a `max_element()` function that finds the largest element in a given slice of integers:

          ```rust
          fn max_element<T: PartialOrd + Copy>(slice: &[T]) -> Option<&T> {
              if slice.len() == 0 {
                  return None;
              }
              
              let mut max = &slice[0];
              for i in 1..slice.len() {
                  if slice[i] > *max {
                      max = &slice[i];
                  }
              }
              
              Some(max)
          }
          
          fn main() {
              assert_eq!(max_element(&[]), None);
              assert_eq!(max_element(&[1]), Some(&1));
              assert_eq!(max_element(&[3, 2, 1]), Some(&3));
              assert_eq!(max_element(&[3, 2, 5, 1, 4]), Some(&5));
          }
          ```

          The `max_element()` function takes a slice of generic type `T`, which satisfies the constraint that it must be `PartialOrd` and copyable. The function initializes a variable `max` with the first element of the slice, and then iterates over the rest of the slice, comparing each element to `max`. If it finds an element larger than `max`, it updates `max`. Finally, the function returns an optional reference to `max`, or `None` if the slice is empty. Note that we don't need to specify the concrete type of the result because it matches the type of the arguments. Also note that the `assert_eq!` macro is used to test the function.
