         In-Memory Caching is a fundamental part of application development where we store frequently accessed data in memory for fast access. However, when the server or database fails due to hardware or software issues such as power failure, kernel crash etc., it can cause serious business impacts like data loss or system downtime. To address this issue, Spring Framework provides an abstraction called "Spring Cache" which allows developers to use various caching providers such as EhCache, Memcached, Redis, Cassandra etc. Developers can configure caches at different levels, including method level, class level, or even global level using annotations provided by Spring framework. This article will explain how to use CacheInterceptor interceptor to intercept and handle cache events, so that applications can be notified about cache related events.
         
        # 2. 基础概念术语说明

         Before going into detail on CacheInterceptor implementation let’s first understand some important concepts used in the context of Spring Cache. The following are some basic terms:
         
         - `CacheManager` : It is a factory class responsible for creating and managing multiple cache instances. 
         - `Cache`: An interface representing a cache. Each cache instance contains key/value pairs and can have different expiration policies, e.g. time based, eternal, size based etc. A cache may contain one or more regions.
         - `Region`: Represents a named grouping of keys within a cache. Different regions provide separation between cached objects, making it easier to manage the cache. For example, if you want to cache users separately from orders, then you can create two separate regions with respective names and associate them with corresponding cache instances.
         - `CachingProvider`: Provides APIs for accessing underlying caching systems. There can be multiple implementations depending upon available libraries and dependencies.
         - `CacheKey`: Wrapper object containing all the necessary information needed to uniquely identify a specific cache entry.
         - `CacheEntryProcessor`: Interface providing functionality to manipulate cache entries atomically using a single callback function.
         - `CacheOperationContext`: Stores additional metadata associated with a cache operation request. It includes details like name, arguments, result, and any exception encountered during execution.

        When working with a distributed system there are many ways to handle failures and ensure consistency across nodes. One common approach to achieve high availability (HA) is to use replication. Replication involves copying data across multiple nodes to maintain redundancy. Additionally, caches can also be replicated to prevent complete cache miss scenarios. But maintaining replication mechanisms across nodes can become complex especially when dealing with complex multi-layered architectures.
        
        As mentioned above, Spring Cache uses a pluggable architecture where each provider implements its own logic to replicate data between multiple nodes. So instead of building a new replication mechanism, Spring Cache relies on external infrastructure to handle replication. While this approach works well in most cases, it does not always guarantee strong consistency because of network latency and other factors.
        
        So what makes Spring Cache stand out? One advantage of Spring Cache over traditional caching solutions is that it provides event driven programming model that enables applications to react to certain cache events. These events include creation, update, invalidation and deletion of cache entries. Application developers can write custom code to handle these events and take appropriate actions like updating their local state or sending notifications. This feature eliminates the need for explicit cache synchronization mechanisms reducing the risk of inconsistency.
        
        Let's look at how CacheInterceptor works under the hood. The following figure shows a simplified view of how the CacheInterceptor interacts with the Spring Cache API while processing incoming requests.

        ## Intercepting and Handling Cache Events
        
        During initialization phase, CacheInterceptor registers itself as a BeanPostProcessor and gets injected with reference to the actual CacheManager object. At runtime, whenever the application needs to retrieve or modify data in cache, it triggers a cache lookup process. Once the required value is found in cache, it is returned directly without hitting the target resource. If the value is missing from cache, CacheInterceptor intercepts the call and forwards it to the actual target resource, which fetches the data from backend storage, populates the cache and returns back to client. Here's how it looks internally:

       ### Cache Operation Context
           
           Whenever a cache operation occurs, a new CacheOperationContext object is created to store all the relevant metadata. Below are some commonly used attributes of CacheOperationContext:
           
             - Name : Identifies the cache operation being performed.
             - Arguments : Contains all the input parameters passed to the annotated method.
             - Result : Contains the output produced by the cache operation.
             - Exception : Indicates whether an error occurred during the cache operation.
            
             
        ### Creating New Entries
            
        When a new item is added to the cache, a CREATE event is triggered. When this happens, CacheInterceptor sends a notification to the registered listeners along with the CacheOperationContext containing all the necessary metadata. Listeners receive this notification and perform any desired operations based on the received event type. In our case, we are interested only in CREATED events since we want to synchronize our local state whenever a new entry is created in the remote cache.
        
        
        ### Updating Existing Entries
        
        When an existing item is updated in the cache, an UPDATE event is triggered. Similarly, CacheInterceptor sends a notification to the registered listeners along with the CacheOperationContext containing all the necessary metadata. Now, here comes the interesting part. Since the value has already been fetched and populated in cache beforehand, both local and remote values exist simultaneously. Therefore, when an update event is received, we need to check if the value in the local cache is older than the value in the remote cache. If yes, we should overwrite the local cache with the latest version and send a notification to clients. Otherwise, we ignore the event since we assume that the remote change has already propagated through and our local copy represents the latest value.
        
              
         ### Invalidating Cache Entries
                 
                 When an item is removed from the cache, an INVALIDATE event is triggered. Again, CacheInterceptor sends a notification to the registered listeners along with the CacheOperationContext containing all the necessary metadata. On receiving the invalidate event, we remove the corresponding key-value pair from the local cache immediately. We don't need to notify clients since they would have no way of knowing that the entry was removed unless explicitly asked to do so. However, note that removing the entry from local cache alone doesn't guarantee that the same entry still exists in remote cache. Hence, we must wait until the next cache refresh cycle to update our local cache accordingly.
                      
                     
                     
                       
         
        ### Deleting Cache Entries
                    
                When an entire region or cache is cleared, a DELETE event is triggered. Similarly, CacheInterceptor sends a notification to the registered listeners along with the CacheOperationContext containing all the necessary metadata. Unlike invalidate event, delete event affects the whole cache region rather than just individual items. As a result, we must clear our local cache entirely and start fetching fresh data from backend storage.
