# 1.简介
         
　　Reactive programming is a modern paradigm that focuses on responding to events as they occur rather than waiting for some predetermined event or time interval to elapse. It can be thought of as an extension of traditional imperative and object-oriented programming concepts where instead of executing instructions step by step in sequence, reactive programs react to changing inputs by emitting new outputs over time. Within the context of Java, reactive programming allows developers to build applications that are scalable, resilient, responsive, and fault-tolerant. In this article we will cover practical uses of the Java 8 Stream API within reactive programming.

         　　The Java 8 stream API offers a simple yet powerful way to implement reactive programming patterns such as functional composition, backpressure handling, flow control, and error handling. This article aims to provide clear examples of how these techniques can be used together to create efficient, modular, and testable reactive systems.

         # 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
         ## Functional Composition
         Functional composition refers to combining multiple functions into one cohesive unit of functionality using higher order functions like map(), reduce(), filter() etc., which operate on collections of data items in a declarative manner. For example:

            // Merge two arrays
            Integer[] array1 = {1, 2, 3};
            Integer[] array2 = {4, 5, 6};
            
            List<Integer> mergedList = Arrays
               .stream(array1)
               .map(i -> i * 2)     // Double each element in the first array
               .distinct()           // Remove duplicates from second array
               .collect(Collectors.toList());
            
        The code above demonstrates how functional composition works by chaining various operations on streams (arrays in this case). Each operation returns a new stream instance, so method calls are chained to form a chain of responsibility, creating a pipeline of transformations applied to the input data.
        
        ## Back Pressure
        Back pressure refers to a mechanism implemented in systems that limit the rate at which messages can be processed or transmitted through channels between components. When the receiver cannot process the incoming message fast enough, it stops sending more messages until the buffer becomes empty. To handle back pressure effectively, reactive systems must be designed with proper management of buffers and their eviction strategies.

        One approach to manage back pressure efficiently in reactive systems is to use the Publisher/Subscriber pattern. Publishers generate messages asynchronously and publish them to subscribers who request access to those messages. If the subscriber cannot consume messages quickly enough, the publisher can apply back pressure to slow down the rate at which messages are generated. On the other hand, if consumers are consuming too much memory or CPU resources without processing them, the publisher can stop generating new messages to avoid overflowing its output queue.
        
        ## Flow Control
        Flow control refers to managing the throughput of data in large-scale distributed systems. It involves controlling the volume of data being processed by individual nodes or services in response to varying demand levels. To achieve good performance under heavy loads, reactive systems need to throttle the number of requests sent to external services, especially those that may not scale well due to resource constraints.

        To manage flow control effectively, reactive systems should incorporate automatic throttling mechanisms based on metrics such as response times, error rates, and load levels. These metrics should be collected and monitored regularly to detect potential bottlenecks early on and adaptively adjust the system's behavior accordingly.

        ## Error Handling
        Error handling is essential to ensure reliable and robust systems. In general, errors in reactive systems result from failures in communication links, remote services, databases, and third-party libraries. Therefore, error handling plays a crucial role in ensuring that the system recovers gracefully and continues functioning.

        There are several ways to handle errors in reactive systems, including retry policies, fallback strategies, circuit breaker patterns, and logging mechanisms. Retry policies specify when and how frequently a failed operation should be retried, while fallback strategies specify what action should be taken in case of failure. Circuit breaker patterns monitor the health of downstream dependencies and automatically switch off problematic components to prevent cascading failures. Finally, logging mechanisms help identify and diagnose problems, allowing developers to trace application behavior and troubleshoot issues.

        ## Asynchronous vs Synchronous Processing
        Despite being considered a fundamental concept in reactive programming, asynchronous and synchronous processing still have different meanings in terms of the level of interaction required between components.

        In contrast to synchronous processing, where components wait for responses before proceeding with subsequent tasks, asynchronous processing allows components to perform concurrent activities without blocking each other. Components communicate asynchronously by exchanging messages using messaging middleware technologies such as RabbitMQ or Kafka. Additionally, the use of non-blocking I/O APIs such as Netty allow developers to write high-performance reactive systems that can take advantage of multi-core processors, improve concurrency, and optimize resource usage.

        However, although async processing provides advantages, there is also a cost associated with it, specifically latency and increased complexity in dealing with parallelism. To mitigate these costs, reactive systems typically employ schedulers to regulate the frequency at which elements of a stream are executed, enabling reactive pipelines to execute complex logic and workloads across multiple threads.
