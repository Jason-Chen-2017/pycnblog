# 1.简介
         
1997年，一位美国学生发明了一种基于网络的视频游戏。这项创新引起了一场全球性竞争，因此各方都把目光投向了另一个市场--互联网游戏。然而，随着电子游戏的普及，缓存策略也逐渐成为影响用户体验的一大因素。众多游戏厂商为了获得更好的用户体验，提出了各种不同的方案，比如客户端缓存、服务端缓存、数据库缓存等等。目前在游戏领域内，流行的缓存策略主要有两种：

1. 客户端缓存(Client-side caching):浏览器本地磁盘或者内存中缓存静态资源文件如图片、音频、视频等。优点是客户端缓存节省了数据传输时间，提升了页面打开速度；缺点是用户访问缓存的内容时可能导致数据的不一致性。

2. 服务端缓存(Server-side caching):服务器端缓存提高了服务器响应能力，减少了网络延迟，并减少了服务器负载。优点是可以在不改变源服务器代码的情况下进行缓存设置；缺点是更新缓存需要重新部署应用。

游戏开发者往往会选择两种或以上的方式一起工作，这样既可以实现服务端缓存又可以实现客户端缓存，从而达到最佳的用户体验。但是当多个缓存层出现冲突时，就会发生缓存策略冲突的问题。本文将介绍两种不同缓存策略之间的冲突，以及如何处理冲突，给出解决这些冲突的方法。

         # 2.基本概念
         ## 2.1.What is cache?
         A cache is a temporary storage that stores data temporarily so that future requests for the same data can be served faster than if it were to be retrieved from its original source. The cached data remains stored on the cache until it expires or is invalidated. 
         The word "cache" comes from the practice of storing food before cooking it and serving it quickly when requested later. 
         In computing, caches are used extensively in computer systems where frequently accessed data must be rapidly retrieved. Examples include disk drives, printers, and internet browsers. 

         Caches can improve system performance by reducing the need to access expensive resources such as hard disks or databases. Instead, they serve commonly used data more efficiently by retrieving it from fast memory locations (such as RAM) instead of slow slower media such as magnetic hard drives. Caching also enables applications to respond more quickly to user queries because common data is not always recalculated each time it is required.

         ## 2.2.Cache Strategies:
         Two popular cache strategies are client-side caching and server-side caching. Client-side caching involves caching static files like images, videos, audio etc., which are stored locally in the browser's cache folder or in the browser's memory. This strategy improves page loading times and reduces network traffic by allowing previously downloaded content to be reused without having to download it again. However, this strategy has drawbacks as well. User may see outdated content while using the game since new updates have not been pushed to the clients yet.

         On the other hand, Server-side caching occurs at the application level rather than relying solely on the web browser. This means that changes made to the application's code will affect how the cached data is generated and updated. For instance, if an update to the game version affects how some parts of the game are rendered, then all users who play the game after the change will experience visual disruption. Additionally, implementing server-side caching requires careful planning, implementation, and maintenance, especially when dealing with complex games with many moving parts.

         It's important to note that there are multiple ways to implement both client-side and server-side caching within the context of a game. Some developers might choose to use one approach over another depending on their requirements and priorities. Others may decide to combine different types of caching strategies to achieve optimal performance.

         # 3.Core Algorithmic Principle and Specific Operation Steps
         Let’s say we are trying to retrieve a piece of information “X” from our cache layer and unfortunately, due to various reasons such as cache expiration, conflict issues or unavailability of necessary resource like database connection, etc. We are in a situation where we don't know what type of cache strategy was used, whether it's either client side or server side. So, how can we handle these kind of scenarios effectively?

         To address this problem, here are the general steps that needs to followed in order to resolve any conflicts in cache layers:

         1. Understand the purpose of your caching layer: Determine whether you want to cache highly volatile data like session variables or account details or less volatile data like static file assets. 
         2. Identify potential bottlenecks: Look into your code to identify possible areas where caching could potentially lead to slow downs or degradation of overall system performance. Try identifying places where you might be able to reduce the number of calls to external services or remove unnecessary calculations.  
         3. Evaluate conflicting cache policies: Go through your existing codebase and evaluate whether the cache policy being used by different modules overlaps with each other causing them to interfere with each other. You should look into adding further checks to ensure only appropriate cache entries are being utilized.  
              - Example: If two modules utilize the same key to store/retrieve certain data but they do not have a shared locking mechanism preventing simultaneous writes to the same entry, then they could overwrite each other's cache values leading to inconsistent results.  
         4. Implement retry mechanisms: Adding error handling mechanisms during cache retrievals ensures that stale or incorrect data does not get returned in cases where the initial retrieval fails due to various reasons such as connectivity issue, timeout errors, etc. By implementing retries, you can limit the negative impact that failures would cause on your system.  
         5. Use fallback mechanisms: Fallback mechanisms allow you to provide backup solutions in case your primary cache is unavailable. In such situations, you can check against alternate sources or perform additional calculations to retrieve the relevant data.  
         6. Optimize caching logic: When working with large amounts of data, optimizing the way you're generating keys or hashing data can help minimize cache misses and improve response times. Especially when dealing with complex query structures or complex objects, carefully analyzing and testing your caching solution can yield significant improvements in terms of speed and efficiency.  

           Overall, resolving conflicts between cache policies requires a good understanding of the caching architecture, knowledge about the potential bottlenecks in your system, evaluating and identifying the root causes of conflicts, implementation of appropriate fallback and optimization mechanisms, and finally, measuring the effectiveness of your changes by monitoring the behavior of your system under load and comparing it with previous versions of the codebase.
