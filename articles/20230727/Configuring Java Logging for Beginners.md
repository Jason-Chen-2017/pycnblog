# 1.简介
         
 Configuring Java logging is a crucial aspect of any java application development process. By default, the Java platform provides only basic console output for log messages which is not useful in production environment or for analyzing logs to troubleshoot problems. To overcome this issue and optimize performance, it's essential to configure proper logging settings that can help identify issues and improve system efficiency. In this article, we will learn how to set up Java logging framework with various options such as Console Logger, File Logger, Log4j, etc., and also see what are some important considerations when configuring logging. 
          In addition to configuring Java logging, other areas like Debugging techniques, Unit Testing, Performance Monitoring, Profiling, Error Handling, and Deploying Java applications on servers/clusters are equally important. Therefore, if you have gone through these topics already, then this article might be helpful. 
          # 2.Java Logging Framework 
          The Java Logging Framework (JUL) was introduced in JDK version 1.4 and has been integrated into the standard library since Java 7. This framework defines a simple API for sending log records to various logging destinations such as files, sockets, and remote machines. JUL allows developers to easily create their own custom loggers by extending the base `java.util.logging.Logger` class and overriding its methods such as `log(LogRecord record)`, `info()`, `warn()` and so on. However, using the built-in loggers alone may not meet all requirements of an enterprise level application. Hence, there exist several popular logging frameworks that extend JUL functionality and provide more sophisticated features such as centralized configuration management, filtering, archiving, monitoring and auditing. Some of the most commonly used logging frameworks include Log4j, SLF4J, Apache Commons Logging, and Spring Boot Logging. 
          # 3.Console Logger 
          A common practice among developers is to use the Console logger to view application logs on the screen during development and testing. It's easy to setup and works out of the box without much configuration required. Below is an example code snippet to enable the Console logger:
          
          ```java
            import java.util.logging.*;
            
            public class Main {
              private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(Main.class.getName());

              public static void main(String[] args) {
                // Set up the console logger
                ConsoleHandler handler = new ConsoleHandler();
                formatter = new SimpleFormatter();
                handler.setFormatter(formatter);

                LOGGER.addHandler(handler);
                LOGGER.setLevel(Level.ALL);
                
                // Example usage
                LOGGER.fine("This is a fine message");
                LOGGER.warning("This is a warning message");
              }
            }
          ```
          
          When executed, the above program would print the following output to the console window:
          
          ```
            19:12:42.691 [main] FINE   c.e.Main - This is a fine message
            19:12:42.691 [main] WARNING c.e.Main - This is a warning message
          ```
          
      4.File Logger 
      
        Another critical component of effective logging is saving logs to a file. One of the simplest ways to do this is to use the `FileHandler` which writes log messages to a text file specified by the user. Here's an updated version of the previous code that adds a File Handler:
        
        ```java
            import java.io.IOException;
            import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
            import java.util.Date;
            import java.util.logging.*;

            public class Main {
              private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(Main.class.getName());
              
              private static String filePath = "logs/";
              
              	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
                	// Create directory if it doesn't exist
                  File dir = new File(filePath);
                  if (!dir.exists()) {
                    dir.mkdirs();
                  }
                  
                  // Set up the file logger
                  SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("dd_MM_yyyy");
                  String fileName = "myapp_" + sdf.format(new Date()) + ".log";

                  try {
                    FileHandler fileHandler = new FileHandler(filePath + fileName);

                    SimpleFormatter formatter = new SimpleFormatter();
                    fileHandler.setFormatter(formatter);

                    LOGGER.addHandler(fileHandler);
                    LOGGER.setLevel(Level.INFO);
                    
                    // Example usage
                    LOGGER.fine("This is a fine message");
                    LOGGER.warning("This is a warning message");
                    
                  } catch (SecurityException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                  } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                  }
                }
              }
            
        ```
        
        
        As shown above, we added two new lines of code to handle creating the `FileHandler`. We first create a `SimpleDateFormat` object to format the date string for the filename. Then, we concatenate the filepath and the formatted filename together to get the full path to our log file. Finally, we add the File Handler to the logger and set its logging level to INFO to avoid writing too many unwanted log entries.
        
        Running this modified program would produce log entries saved to a file named something like myapp_14_03_2022.log. Here's an example log entry:
        
        15:29:41.691 [main] INFO   com.example.Main - Hello World!
       
        Now, let’s take a look at some additional tips to make sure your Java logging solution is robust and efficient.
        
          # 4. Additional Tips 
          ## 4.1 Keep Logs Small and Cheap 
          You don't want to end up paying thousands of dollars just because you accumulated tons of data in your logs. Be conscious about the amount of disk space your logs consume, especially in production environments where disks can get expensive fast. Consider compressing your logs before storing them on the file system or sending them to external storage services like S3. Additionally, consider rotating your log files periodically instead of accumulating large amounts of data in one place. For instance, you could keep a week worth of logs in compressed form on your local hard drive and delete older ones after that time period expires.
          
      	  ## 4.2 Use Filters to Avoid Writing Unwanted Entries 
           While debugging an application, you may find yourself bombarded with millions of log messages from third party libraries, irrelevant information, or even redundant error messages. Filtering out unwanted entries helps you focus on relevant events and reduce clutter in your log files. There are multiple approaches to filter logs based on severity levels, regular expressions, thread names, and stack traces. Choose the right approach depending on your needs and experience. 
           
      	  ## 4.3 Understand Your Logging Infrastructure 
           Whether you're running locally on your developer machine or deploying your application onto a server cluster, knowing your logging infrastructure can save hours of troubleshooting and support costs down the road. Knowing the components involved in collecting and processing logs, including log aggregation systems, indexing tools, visualization tools, and dashboards, can help you manage your resources and ensure consistent and accurate logging. Understanding best practices for monitoring and alerting can go a long way towards reducing downtime and ensuring reliability across your entire application landscape.
