2019年是一个特殊的年份，因为它正是美国国家科学技术奖励委员会发布“最佳计算机科学和应用论文”的评选年。而作为计算机领域的杰出学者之一，斯坦福大学的李飞飞教授也被誉为当之无愧的“最佳计算机科学和应用论文”的评选家。不过，对于当前火热的AI机器学习、深度学习技术来说，让我们准备好迎接一个崭新的AI技术浪潮吗？本文将探讨如何使用Tensorflow和Keras搭建一款具备命名实体识别（NER）和情感分析（SA）功能的聊天机器人。
         
       NER (Named Entity Recognition)是自然语言处理中提取文字中的实体并进行分类的一种技术。例如，在文本中，“苹果公司”可以被视为一个“ORGANIZATION”实体。在对话机器人的上下文中，NER能够帮助机器人更好的理解用户的意图，进而做出相应的回复。

        SA (Sentiment Analysis)是指根据给定的文本或语句的观点、态度或情绪等特质，进行自动判断和分析，确认其情感极性的自然语言处理技术。例如，在对话机器人中，如果通过对话的文本或语句进行情感分析之后得出的结论是积极的，那么机器人可能就会给予积极的反馈；如果分析结果是消极的，则可能触发消极的反馈。

       在本文中，我们将展示如何用基于LSTM(长短期记忆神经网络)结构的RNN(循环神经网络)模型训练NER和SA系统，并用这些模型对用户输入的对话进行实体和情感的识别与分析，进而生成对应的回复。
       
       # 2. Basic Concepts & Terminologies
       ## 2.1 RNN
       Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), 是一种能对序列数据进行建模，并通过隐藏状态传递信息从而实现捕获时间相关特征的神经网络类型。这种网络由多个RNN单元组成，每个单元有一个输入、输出和隐藏状态。其中，输入通过前向传播网络计算得到输出，随后该输出会被用于下一次计算的隐藏状态。 

       The main advantage of this type of network is that it can learn to process sequential data by maintaining a state which captures information from the past sequence elements. This makes it particularly useful in tasks such as language modeling or speech recognition where there are dependencies between the input sequences. These networks have been successful in several applications ranging from natural language processing to stock market prediction. 

       In our chatbot application, we will be using LSTM-based RNN for NER and SA systems respectively. 
       ## 2.2 LSTM
       Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units are a type of recurrent neural network cell used in deep learning models to capture long term dependencies in time series data. It works by introducing three gates: input gate, forget gate, and output gate, that control the flow of information into and out of the cell. LSTMs maintain an internal state called the cell state, which can carry information over arbitrary distances in time. This makes them well-suited for tasks like language modeling and text classification.  

       We will use these cells to build our NER and SA systems.  
       ## 2.3 Embedding
       An embedding layer is typically used at the beginning of a neural network architecture to transform high dimensional inputs into lower dimensions, making the training more efficient. It involves mapping each word in a vocabulary to a dense vector representation. Word embeddings enable machine learning algorithms to understand words in context and improve their performance on challenging natural language processing tasks. We will use pre-trained GloVe word embeddings for our model.   
       ## 2.4 Transfer Learning
       Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for another task, improving its accuracy on the new task while keeping some of the learned features. We will transfer learn from pre-trained BERT model, which is known for its excellent performance in multiple natural language processing tasks such as question answering, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, etc.    
       # 3. Algorithmic Principle & Operations
       ## 3.1 NER System
      To train an NER system, we need labeled dataset consisting of both sentences containing entities and non-entities along with their corresponding labels. For example, given sentence "Apple Inc. is looking at buying a company for $AAPL", we should assign label 'ORG' to "Apple Inc." and 'MISC' to "$AAPL".

      We will first preprocess the sentences by removing special characters, numbers and converting all letters to lowercase. Then, we will split the sentences into tokens and create a vocabulory of unique tokens. Finally, we will convert each token to its corresponding index in the vocabulary and pad the remaining indices if necessary to make sure all sequences are of same length. Once we have converted all sentences into numerical form, we will feed them to the trained NER model and obtain predicted labels. For testing purposes, we will also provide unlabeled datasets to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

      ### Training Process
      To train an NER model, we follow the following steps:
      1. Preprocess the data - Remove special characters, numbers, convert to lowercase, tokenize the sentences, create vocabulory and encode sentences.
      2. Load pre-trained word embeddings - Download and load pre-trained GloVe embeddings.
      3. Define the model - Create an instance of BiLSTM-CRF model with pre-trained weights and custom embedding matrix.
      4. Train the model - Feed encoded sentences and corresponding labels to the model and fit the parameters to minimize loss.
      5. Evaluate the model - Evaluate the model's performance on test set and print metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
