        Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide and kills more than 700,000 women every year[1]. In order to diagnose breast cancer early and accurately, we need a fast and reliable method that can identify malignant tumors based on an accurate prediction. In this project, we are going to use genetic algorithms (GAs) to classify breast cancer cells based on their genetic features such as gene expression patterns. GAs are a powerful optimization algorithm used for solving complex problems with multiple variables. They have been successfully applied to various fields including image processing, engineering design, scheduling, routing, and finance [2-4]. By using GAs, we can develop a machine learning model that is capable of identifying malignant breast cancer cells with high accuracy without relying on expert knowledge or manual intervention. 
        
        In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying GAs to medical imaging applications like breast cancer classification due to its ability to handle large amounts of data and optimize models quickly. GAs have also been demonstrated to be effective in classifying animals with similar behavioral traits [5] and predicting economic indicators based on historical market data [6]. In our research, we will demonstrate how GAs can be applied to the task of breast cancer cell classification from gene expression patterns extracted from DNA sequencing data. This article provides an overview of breast cancer classification and introduces basic concepts about GAs, followed by an explanation of the specific implementation details of breast cancer classification using GAs. Finally, future directions and challenges in breast cancer classification using GAs are discussed.

        Before diving into technical details, it is important to understand some core terms and concepts related to GAs. The following list briefly describes these concepts:

        **Individual**: An individual represents one possible solution to the problem being optimized. Each individual contains a set of genes representing different aspects of the problem's decision space. For example, if we want to maximize the area under a curve, each individual could contain a set of x-y coordinates that define the curve. 

        **Population**: A population consists of a collection of individuals that represent potential solutions to the problem being optimized. Populations evolve over time through repeated interactions between individuals in the population, generating new offspring or selecting parents to produce descendants. Population size typically ranges from hundreds to thousands, making them ideal for complex optimization tasks that require many iterations to converge to a global optimum.

        **Fitness Function**: The fitness function measures how well an individual solves the problem at hand. It takes an individual as input and returns a numerical value indicating how good the individual's solution is. The goal of evolution is to find an optimal solution that maximizes the fitness function.

        **Selection**: Selection involves choosing parent(s) from a population based on their fitness values so that they contribute to the next generation of individuals. Parent selection strategies include roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, and rank selection.

         **Crossover**: Crossover refers to the process of combining two parent individuals to create a new individual, which may then undergo mutation. There are several crossover methods available depending on the desired properties of the resulting child individuals.

          **Mutation**: Mutation refers to random changes to an individual's genome during the course of evolving a population. Common mutations include swapping genes, randomly adding or removing genes, and flipping bits within a gene.

           **Recombination**: Recombination refers to the combination of two distinct parent individuals to form a single offspring. Common recombination techniques include uniform crossover, arithmetic crossover, and single point crossover.

           **Genotype**: The genotype of an individual refers to a particular representation of their chromosomes, which encode the genetic information of the individual. Typically, genotypes are represented as binary strings, but other representations like floating point numbers or real vectors are sometimes used.

            **Phenotype**: The phenotype of an individual refers to a physical manifestation of the individual that results when the genetic instructions in the individual's chromosomes are executed. Phenotypes differ from genotypes in that they do not always correspond directly to underlying biological processes. For instance, an individual with low levels of certain hormones might still display abnormalities in physiological functions.

            **Gene Pool**: A gene pool is a collection of all possible variations of a given genetic trait. Gene pools determine what types of solutions an organism is likely to encounter and how it responds to those environments.

            **Chromosome**: Chromosomes are segments of DNA that carry genetic information for each allele of a gene. Each chromosome belongs to only one individual, and they are composed of millions of genes arranged in pairs called loci.

            ## Introduction

           In this paper, we present a novel approach to breast cancer cell classification using GAs. We start with a general introduction to GAs and explain the basics of breast cancer classification. Then, we describe the data preprocessing steps involved in breast cancer classification, i.e., feature extraction, normalization, and feature scaling. Next, we explain the overall architecture of the proposed classifier and provide details of our algorithm. Lastly, we discuss the experimental results obtained from our experiments and highlight any limitations of our approach.
