# 1.简介
         
2017年3月，Espressif Systems推出了ESP32微控制器，据说其性能已达到800MHz，单核速率可达160MIPS，双核速率可达320MIPS，是目前最快的嵌入式系统之一。而ESP8266则是在同一时间发布的低功耗微控制器，虽然性能也很强劲，但不及ESP32。那么为什么今天我们才会越来越多的人越来越关心ESP32呢？这是因为很多时候在低功耗和高性能之间做权衡时，ESP32的优势就显现出来了。
        2019年初，市面上已经出现了各种基于ESP32芯片的产品，比如乐鑫的ESP-WROVER-B模块，阿里的LinkKit系列产品等等，可以说，ESP32已经成为主流MCU之一。通过对比这两种芯片之间的特性和性能差异，笔者认为以下两点原因是影响ESP32发展的关键因素：
        1、硬件变化：ESP8266是一款相对较旧的MCU，经历了多个版本迭代，功能也逐步完善，但由于内存较小，处理能力较弱，因此其市场份额并不足。然而随着人们对低功耗、低成本、高性能、易用性等各方面需求的增长，这种依赖于历史遗留技术的趋势正在消退，而嵌入式领域技术的创新、突破和革命正逐渐在全球范围内酝酿着。此时，新的设计方案将带动更多更便宜的组件进入市场。因此，从底层架构角度看，ESP32在以下三个方面都有较大的改进：主频提升至240MHz；新增外设接口支持（WiFi/蓝牙/802.11/Zigbee等）；整体尺寸减小，并增加可编程Flash存储空间。
        2、软件生态：相对于开源社区，国内社区的开发者较少，导致上手难度较高。特别是在MCU软微件生态如Arduino、ESP-IDF等方面，ESP32提供了更多的应用和示例，加速了硬件和软件的交叉融合，使得开发者可以在实际项目中尝试快速验证新想法、创造创意，同时还可以提升自己的知识水平。
        3、技术突破：ARM Cortex M3架构的优化、新指令集的加入、WLAN和无线电模块的升级、移动电信终端芯片的普及，都是促进ESP32技术创新的重要催化剂。
        4、制造工艺：ESP32芯片采用蕴含量更高的超轻量级封装工艺，无论是市场宣传还是生产过程，都更注重降低成本、提升性能、节约能源的效益。另外，国产IC设计企业联发科技近年来在国际竞争中取得了一定的领先地位，其芯片的设计往往更具针对性，打通电路板间的横切通信、优化封装结构等，充分满足客户的特殊需求。
        5、应用场景：微控制器的市场份额越来越大，而且开源社区的力量也日益壮大。所以，ESP32的应用场景有可能越来越广泛，包括机器视觉、物联网、智慧城市、物流配送、穿戴设备、AR/VR、安防监控等领域。
        # 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
        # 2.1 ARM Cortex-M3 Processor Architecture
        In general terms, the **ARM Cortex-M3** processor architecture is a multi-core, low power microcontroller (MCU) that integrates a high-performance Arm core with memory management unit (MMU), an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), serial peripherals, input/output peripherals (GPIO), real time clock (RTC), timers, watchdog timer, and interrupt controllers. The CPU has multiple cores with their own instruction sets and cache memory. Each core can run independently of the others allowing for parallel processing tasks or real-time requirements. Additionally, the dual-core architecture allows for faster performance by running two threads simultaneously on both processors. ARM's generous free software license enables developers to use open source development tools and libraries that support this architecture.

        # 2.2 Memory Management Unit (MMU)

        A memory management unit (MMU) controls virtual memory access between different address spaces in an embedded system. It takes as input a virtual address from the operating system and translates it into a physical address, which is used to access the desired data. An MMU also provides hardware protection mechanisms such as memory regions, caching, and buffering techniques. While most systems rely upon the operating system to manage memory, some systems may incorporate dedicated hardware MMU chips designed specifically for their needs.

        # 2.3 Programmable Real-Time Unit (PRU)

        The programmable real-time unit (PRU) is a specialized MCU designed to handle high speed digital signal processing operations at the cost of limited processing resources. PRUs are designed to be connected directly to the main application chip using industry standard interfaces like GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, etc., without requiring any external buses. PRUs offer extended capabilities for signal processing applications such as motion detection, voice recognition, and image capture.

        # 2.4 Flash Storage

       Embedded systems typically utilize flash storage to store code and other information needed during operation. The internal flash memory is organized into blocks of fixed size called sectors, which are erased individually when written to. Sectors must be erased before being written, so if they contain valuable data, care should be taken not to overwrite them accidentally. To further enhance security, some devices include built-in encryption features that allow only authorized users to read and write flash memory contents.

       # 2.5 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

       Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a wireless technology standardized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). BLE offers advantages over traditional Bluetooth technologies, including reduced power consumption, smaller size, increased range, lower latency, and wider acceptance among consumers. It uses short range radio waves, known as advertisements, to communicate between devices.

       # 2.6 WiFi

       Wi-Fi refers to a wireless local area network (LAN) protocol that operates on the 2.4GHz frequency band. It allows communication between devices within close proximity while avoiding interference from other networks. Devices use networking protocols like TCP/IP to establish connections and exchange data with each other.

       # 2.7 Wearable Technology

       Wearable technology involves designing electronics intended for wearable devices such as smartwatches, glasses, watches, or headphones. These devices often require low power consumption and small form factors that fit easily into pockets or bags. One example of a wearable device that leverages ESP32 is the Espruino Smartwatch, which combines functionality from a variety of sensors, displays, and actuators.

       # 2.8 Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

       The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is characterized by a wide array of intelligent machines and sensors that constantly collect and share data through networks. Examples of products that integrate IIoT components include smart factory automation systems, process control robots, medical equipment, machinery monitoring, and water treatment systems.

       # 2.9 Security Features

       Many modern MCUs have built-in security features that limit unauthorized access to sensitive data. This includes secure bootloader, encrypted flash memory, trusted execution environments, firewalls, intrusion detection, and vulnerability scanning.

       # 2.10 Microcontrollers vs. Microprocessors

       According to the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), microprocessor units (MPU) consist mainly of arithmetic logic units (ALU), registers, and caches, whereas microcontrollers (MCU) additionally feature peripheral circuits like memories, clock generators, and IO expanders. On the other hand, microprocessors, such as Intel Pentium, AMD Athlon, Motorola PowerPC, and Texas Instruments TMS320, are complex integrated circuit assemblies consisting primarily of central processing units (CPUs), floating point units, and cache memories. Despite these similarities, there are differences between microcontrollers and microprocessors that impact how they operate, such as memory capacity, peripherals available, and power consumption.

       # 2.11 MicroPython

       MicroPython is an implementation of Python that targets the minimalist subset of the Python language suitable for small embedded systems. It supports many modules, including the machine module that exposes primitive operations for pin manipulation, network connectivity, and more. MicroPython runs standalone on Linux and Windows computers, providing cross platform compatibility. Developers can port existing Python code to MicroPython or build new applications using familiar languages and tool chains.

       # 2.12 Microservices Architecture

       The microservices architectural style aims to develop a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP API. This approach allows for easier maintenance, scaling, and resilience. Common characteristics of microservices architectures include service discovery, API gateways, and event driven messaging. Popular implementations include Apache Kafka, Netflix OSS, and Amazon Web Services' Lambda.

       # 3. Core Algorithm and Operations

        # 3.1 Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

        The serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus is a synchronous serial communication bus that transfers data between master and slave devices. SPI consists of four signals: serial clock (SCK), slave select (SS), master out-slave in (MOSI), and master in-slave out (MISO). Data is transferred by driving SCK to toggle a series of bits along MOSI and reading back those same bits along MISO. SS is asserted prior to transfer and deasserted afterward to enable or disable the appropriate slave device.

        # 3.2 Integrated Circuits (ICs)

        ICs, sometimes referred to as integrated circuits, are electronic circuits that are packaged together and designed to perform specific functions. They can be designed to perform basic arithmetic calculations, but they are commonly used to control processes inside other devices, making them essential building blocks in modern electronics systems. Some common types of ICs are resistors, capacitors, diodes, op amps, and LCD screens.

        # 3.3 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)

        An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) converts an analog voltage signal into a digital value. It receives input voltages from a sensor or other input device and produces output values that represent the corresponding digital representation. ADCs differ from simple digital to analog converters (DACs) in that they work with analog signals rather than pure binary ones. ADCs convert raw electrical signals into digital values by comparing the amplitudes of incoming signals with reference levels established in the conversion table.

        # 3.4 Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

        PWM stands for pulse width modulation, and is a method of generating varying DC current by rapidly switching between alternating HIGH and LOW states of a digital signal. PWM is used to control the brightness of LEDs, motors, and other devices based on a variable duty cycle. The primary purpose of PWM is to reduce the rise and fall times of various components, resulting in higher linearity and less noise compared to alternative methods such as active buck converters.

        # 3.5 Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)

        Pulse code modulation (PCM) is a digital encoding technique where analog signals are digitized by representing them as finite sequences of pulses that occur at regular intervals. It encodes continuous analog signals by sampling and quantizing them into discrete values. PCM is used extensively in consumer audio codecs, video compression formats, and transmission media, and is particularly useful in audio applications because it minimizes distortion caused by non-linear nature of human hearing.

        # 3.6 Watchdog Timer (WDT)

        A watchdog timer (WDT) is a device that monitors another device's operation and initiates a reset if the monitored device fails to respond within a specified period. WDTs are used to detect abnormal behavior and prevent damage to the device, even if it is left powered off due to a malfunction.

        # 3.7 Timer Interrupts

        Timer interrupts, also known as tickless kernels or no-delay scheduling, involve programming the microcontroller to generate periodic interrupts without relying on the normal scheduler mechanism. The advantage of timer interrupts is that they provide better timing precision, especially in embedded systems where interrupts could potentially interfere with critical tasks.

        # 3.8 DMA (Direct Memory Access)

        Direct memory access (DMA) is a type of controller that manages memory transactions between a central processing unit (CPU) and peripheral devices. DMA avoids the overhead of CPU-driven data transfers and reduces overall system workload, increasing the overall system efficiency.

        # 3.9 CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)

        Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is a checksum algorithm that detects errors in data streams. It works by taking a set of bits, performing certain mathematical transformations on them, and then adding up all the results to produce a final number. If the original data and the calculated checksum match, the data is considered valid.

        # 3.10 Operating System (OS)

        An operating system (OS) is a software program that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for applications. It performs tasks such as resource allocation, process scheduling, file management, and error handling. Common OSes include Unix, Windows, and iOS.

        # 3.11 Bootloader

        A bootloader is a software component that initializes the system and loads the kernel, usually stored in read-only memory, into RAM for execution. During the initialization phase, the bootloader configures the system hardware, probes for available hardware, and locates and launches the kernel. Popular examples of bootloaders include U-Boot, GRUB, and systemd-boot.

        # 3.12 Real Time Clock (RTC)

        A real-time clock (RTC) keeps track of the date and time accurately. It is usually either battery-backed or connected to a network server for synchronization purposes. RTCs help ensure accurate timekeeping in distributed systems, ensuring consistency across devices and reducing uncertainty.

        * Cost savings - With ESP32’s reduced cost, boards can be affordably priced closer to what they were previously.

        * Lower Power Consumption - Both ESP8266 and ESP32 consume a much lower amount of power compared to older versions, enabling them to be powered from wall sockets or mobile batteries.

        * Flexible Platform - The ESP32 offers a lot of flexibility, allowing developers to optimize performance depending on their use case.

        * Scalability - The ESP32 is capable of handling large amounts of network traffic and processing big data quickly, thanks to its ability to scale horizontally.

        * Supported Chipsets - ESP32 supports numerous chips from different vendors, making it easy to switch between manufacturers without having to redesign your product.

        Now let us go deeper into the technical details of migrating your project to ESP32.

        # 4.2 Technical Details of Migration

        Below are the steps involved in migrating a project from ESP8266 to ESP32:

        ## Step 1: Choose Hardware Platform

        Choosing a hardware platform for your IoT project is crucial. There are different options available, ranging from small low-cost devices like ESP01, ESP-12E, and NodeMCU to larger expensive platforms like the popular development board like Lolin32. Make sure to pick the right platform for your requirements, budget, and project goals.

        ## Step 2: Install Development Environment

        Before starting your project, make sure to install the necessary development environment. For example, for ESP32, you need to download the official SDK from espressif.com and follow the instructions to setup the toolchain and IDE. For Arduino, you just need to install the required library and load your sketch onto the development board.

        ## Step 3: Port Your Project

        Once you have installed the development environment, you need to start porting your project to the ESP32 platform. Depending on your familiarity with the old codebase, you might need to refactor some parts of your code base to accommodate the new platform changes. After porting your code, verify that everything still works correctly by testing it thoroughly.

        ## Step 4: Optimize Performance

        Once your code is working well on ESP32, you need to optimize its performance to achieve the best possible result. As mentioned earlier, ESP32 offers many optimizations that can be made to improve the overall performance of your application. Some of the optimization techniques are:

        * Switch to Lightweight Wi-Fi Stack - Instead of using the heavy-weight lwIP stack provided by default, you can opt for a lightweight Wi-Fi solution like esp-wifi-lib, which comes pre-compiled and optimized for the ESP32.

        * Use Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) - NVM is a non-volatile memory that retains its contents even after power loss. Using NVM instead of ordinary RAM helps preserve important data like Wi-Fi configurations and credentials.

        * Add Multicore Processing Support - Adding multicore processing support to your application can greatly increase its throughput by distributing workloads across multiple CPUs.

        Once you have optimized your code, test it again to see if you have achieved the expected level of performance.

        ## Step 5: Deploy and Maintain

        After deploying your ESP32-based project successfully, you need to maintain it over time. This involves updating firmware, fixing bugs, optimizing performance, and responding to customer feedback. Monitoring your system closely and identifying bottlenecks can help identify areas that require improvement. Also, be aware of potential security threats, such as buffer overflow attacks, that could compromise the integrity of your system. Regularly patching your system with latest security updates and hardening it against vulnerabilities can help protect it from cyberattacks.

        Overall, migrating from ESP8266 to ESP32 is a significant undertaking, but it provides great benefits that can save you considerable effort and money. By following the above steps, you can get started with your project efficiently and enjoy a massive boost in performance!

        # 4.3 Testing Performance Gains

      When assessing whether to move from ESP8266 to ESP32, the first thing you need to do is benchmark your application to measure its performance. There are many ways to do this, but here are some examples:

      1. Compare Execution Speed: Test the response time of your application when running on ESP8266 versus ESP32. Do both platforms execute your application consistently? Does one take longer to respond to user inputs?

      2. Compare Memory Usage: How much RAM does your application consume on both platforms? What percentage increases in memory usage occurs as a function of the input payload size?

      3. Compare Network Bandwidth: How fast is your application able to transmit and receive data over the network? Is the bandwidth affected by packet losses or spikes in traffic?

      4. Compare Relative Error: Are your application's outputs consistent and reliable? Can you determine the cause of any discrepancies? Did any unexpected crashes occur?

      5. Compare CPU Usage: How much power does your application consume when running on both platforms? How long does it take for the platform to respond to user input, and how responsive is it?

      6. Repeat Tests with Different Input Patterns: Don't forget to repeat your tests with different input patterns and measure the impact on performance. Your application might behave differently depending on the kind of input it receives. For instance, JPEG images tend to compress more effectively on ESP32 compared to ESP8266, leading to higher throughput rates.
