 Transformers have revolutionized NLP in recent years by allowing them to learn long-term dependencies between words and sentences through self-attention mechanisms. However, it remains unclear how these models can better capture the spatial and temporal aspects of language structure and reasoning. In this work, we investigate into probing the space of attention distributions generated by transformer models for different types of sequential tasks such as text classification, machine translation, or speech recognition. We show that the attention distribution has a rich set of features including both locality and global patterns, and is highly correlated with linguistic regularities found in human language use. Based on our findings, we propose several research directions towards investigating the space of attention distributions in more detail. 
          The primary goal of this work is to provide insights into the expressive power and versatility of transformers' attention mechanism in modeling complex language structures and reasoning processes using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our proposed approach provides a new avenue for analyzing transformers' ability to comprehend abstract symbolic representations in multimodal data sets like videos, audio signals, and social media platforms. Finally, our results could serve as a foundation for future works focused on further advancing NLP techniques using deeper understanding of attention in transformer models.

         ## 2.1 Attention Mechanisms in NLP Models
        Despite their simplicity, deep neural networks are known to be powerful tools for natural language processing (NLP), especially when they come with attention mechanisms. Although there are many variants of transformers, most of which share similar architectures, all rely on multi-head attention layers to compute weighted averages across the input sequence for each output token. Understanding how these models make decisions regarding sentence semantics and reasoning requires us to understand its underlying mechanics at multiple levels.

        In this section, we will review some key concepts related to attention mechanisms commonly used in NLP models, such as query, key, value, self-attention, attention masking, additive attention, multi-headed attention, etc. These concepts are essential to understand the inner working of an attention layer in a transformer model.

         ### Query, Key, Value:
        An attention mechanism involves comparing a query vector q to a set of key vectors K, which represents the context information around the current position i. A similarity score is computed based on dot product between q and each element in K, producing attention scores αi. These attention scores indicate the importance of corresponding keys at positions j ≠ i. The values V associated with each key are then aggregated according to the attention scores to produce the final output. 

        To get a better understanding of these three components, let's consider the following example. Suppose we have a sequence of tokens X = {x1, x2,..., xn} and a query vector q. For each token xi, we want to extract relevant information from the surrounding tokens, so we define k(xi, xj) = q·wj where wj denotes the embedding of token xj. Then, for each position i, we calculate the attention scores alphai = softmax(∑k(xi, xj)) where j iterates over all possible positions. We also define v(xj) to represent the learned representation of token xj. Within the decoder step of transformer architecture, we apply the same operations as above but replace x by y and use y instead of h_i^enc for calculating the attention weights alpha.

        Now suppose we have another sequence Y = {y1, y2,..., ym}. Using the same definition of k(yi, xi) and applying attention weights calculated for X, we obtain a second set of attention weights βj for each position i of Y based on its relative location compared to elements of X. We then project this set of attention weights back onto Y to get the final outputs zij = ∑v(xj)*βj. Here, zij represents the weight assigned to token yj within the attention mechanism applied during decoding stage. By aggregating the relevant information from the two sequences X and Y, we achieve stronger computational efficiency than previous approaches using handcrafted feature engineering methods.

         ### Self-Attention:
        Self-attention refers to the type of attention applied inside a single layer of the transformer model, taking place before any subsequent fully connected layers. The general idea behind self-attention is to perform intra-modal comparison among different positions within a particular input sequence. Instead of looking at all the entire sequence at once, we only look at a specific part of it - the one just before the current position. This leads to faster convergence and improves robustness against noise. It takes advantage of a property called positivity introduced by Luong et al., who derived it from the theory of episodic memory. 

       In order to implement self-attention, we first split the input sequence into smaller subsequences corresponding to individual heads of the multi-headed attention layer. Each head performs attention independently and combines the resulting output vectors using a linear transformation followed by a softmax function. Finally, we concatenate the output vectors obtained from each head to form a fixed size output.

       One drawback of traditional self-attention is that it does not take into account inter-dependencies between different parts of the input sequence. Therefore, some important interactions may go unexplored. The solution to this problem was provided by the introduction of positional encodings, which allows the model to explicitly model the order of tokens in the input sequence. By adding these positional embeddings to the inputs, we are able to assign higher weights to the tokens appearing later in the sequence while discounting those that appear earlier.

        Another limitation of traditional self-attention is that it is limited to handling sequence data with a time dimension. In practice, we often encounter scenarios where we need to process sequential data that is non-temporal, such as videos, images, or graph structured data. A common strategy to address this challenge is to incorporate external information alongside the main input sequence. External information can be represented using additional variables that are fed into the network as side inputs, making it easier for the model to capture the contextual relationships present in the environment. 

         ### Masking:
         When dealing with sequences of varying lengths, it is crucial to ensure that the attention computation is consistent and accurate. Otherwise, incorrect attention scores might lead to errors down the line. In fact, attention masks are used to prevent attention beyond valid tokens. In other words, attention is masked out for invalid tokens, ensuring that the model cannot attend to any irrelevant tokens. For instance, if we have a batch of sequences containing different lengths, we must pad shorter sequences with special tokens indicating end of sequence, such as <EOS> or [PAD]. Similarly, we must also include padding in our attention computations whenever necessary. 

         ### Multi-Headed Attention:
         The popular attention mechanism used in NLP models is multi-headed attention. Multiple attention heads operate concurrently on different portions of the input sequence, allowing the model to exploit cross-modal connections and joint representations of different semantic areas. Intuitively, this mechanism approximates each position in the input sequence as being composed of different attention components, each responsible for focusing on a distinct aspect of the overall meaning.  

         There are two steps involved in implementing multi-headed attention. First, we divide the input sequence into multiple subsequences corresponding to separate attention heads. Each head computes its own set of attention weights based on the queries and keys computed from the original input sequence. Second, we combine the resulting output vectors from each head using a linear transformation followed by a softmax function to generate the final output. In summary, multi-headed attention exploits parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware to speed up training and inference times, whilst still maintaining interpretability due to its modular design.

         ### Additive Attention:
          Recently, Bahdanau et al. proposed a modification of attention called additive attention that encourages the model to focus solely on the relevant tokens without explicitly aligning them with the encoder states. Essentially, the attention weights are defined as a sum of four scalar functions f_a(h_i)^T W_s e_j + f_b(s_t)^T W_h d_i + f_c(e_{t-1})^T W_d h_i + f_d(h_t-1)^T W_e s_i, where h_i denotes the hidden state of the decoder at position i, s_t denotes the predicted word given previous predictions, e_j denotes the embedded target word t+j, d_i denotes the encoded source sequence up to position i, h_t-1 denotes the last hidden state of the decoder, and f() denotes non-linear activation functions. 

          Mathematically, this equation calculates the energy for each position i in the target sequence as a function of the current decoder state, the predicted word given previous predictions, the previously generated output, and the source sequence up to that point. These energies are passed through non-linear activation functions and combined using elementwise multiplication to obtain attention weights alpha_ij for each pair of positions i and j in the target sequence. The final output is produced by multiplying the attention weights with the corresponding target sequence elements and summing them together. The inclusion of the four scalar functions makes this modified attention mechanism less susceptible to gradient vanishing issues encountered in conventional attention mechanisms.  



        ## 2.2 Spatial and Temporal Representations
        While self-attention mechanisms have made significant progress in capturing important features of natural language, it remains unclear whether and how these models can model both spatially and temporally varying language structures and reasoning processes. To answer this question, we need to explore the relationship between visual cues and language structures in video-text alignment tasks such as action localization, object detection, or caption generation.   
 
         ### Action Localization 
        One of the early applications of vision and language complementary mechanisms is the task of action localization, which aims to identify the regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene and map them to their corresponding actions or events. In this scenario, the ROI labels should be accompanied by their descriptions captured by language annotations. Traditionally, existing approaches either rely on pre-defined templates or rule-based heuristics to match the description with the ROIs detected by visual sensors. To overcome this issue, we need to develop novel techniques that can leverage the collective knowledge of human experts to automatically annotate videos with semantic labels and descriptions.

        Complementary to this, we also need to explore ways to effectively utilize motion cues for action localization. Currently, most action localization algorithms rely heavily on image content and rely on predefined templates or weak supervision to handle dynamic objects and camera movements. By leveraging high-dimensional motion cues such as optical flow, we can build more comprehensive and informative ROIs that contain more detailed movement trajectories. Furthermore, we can adopt predictive coding-based neural networks to analyze motion dynamics and infer the underlying behavior pattern of moving objects and cars. Eventually, we can integrate these techniques with visual language modelling to achieve more reliable and comprehensive action localization systems.

 
         ### Object Detection 
         Another critical application area for language and vision complementarity lies in object detection. Object detection consists of identifying and localizing the instances of various entities in an image, such as persons, vehicles, or animals. As humans, we naturally use our vision system to interpret the world around us in real-time. Traditional computer vision systems typically require fine-tuning and manual labelling to accurately recognize objects of interest. However, utilizing visual language models can significantly enhance the performance of object detectors by providing a richer descriptive language representation of the objects. The models can efficiently encode the context and geometry of each entity, enabling them to localize, track, and classify objects even in challenging situations such as occlusions and cluttered environments.

        Interestingly, we can leverage the complementarity between language and vision by simultaneously generating captions and classifying objects together. Specifically, we can train a language model to generate compelling yet concise descriptions of the objects in the image while employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for object detection. During testing, we can feed the CNN with the extracted features and compare the corresponding bounding boxes returned by the detector with the ground truth bounding box annotations to measure the accuracy of the detector. The combination of language modeling and object detection can enable us to greatly improve the accuracy and robustness of computer vision systems while requiring minimal amount of human annotation effort.

         ### Caption Generation 
        The third field that benefits from incorporating language and vision is caption generation. Captions provide a dense and readable summary of what is happening in a scene or event, serving as crucial aid for visually impaired users to access the contents of a video. Typically, caption generators aim to create coherent and fluent language captions while avoiding lengthy repetitions or idiomatic phrases. However, successful caption generation relies on carefully crafted feature extractors, advanced post-processing techniques, and large amounts of labeled training data. Utilizing visual language models can help to automate the process by encoding the contextual information present in the video frames and converting them into meaningful language features.

       To summarize, developing effective solutions for action localization, object detection, and caption generation will require a thorough understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms of attention and language modeling. Visual language models that bridge the gap between language and vision can greatly advance the capability and effectiveness of computer vision systems by addressing several challenges associated with human language acquisition and representation.
