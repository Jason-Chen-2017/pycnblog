# 1.简介
         

         Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence that allows machines to understand and process human language as it is spoken or written. It involves the use of machine learning algorithms that enable computers to identify patterns within large amounts of unstructured text data. One common task performed by NLP systems is called "sequence tagging" which refers to classifying each word in a sentence into one of several predefined categories such as noun, verb, adjective etc. In this article we will be discussing how we can perform sequence tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). We will also provide step-by-step instructions on how to implement an example code for performing sequence tagging using NLTK library in Python. 
         
         The hidden markov model (HMM) was first proposed by Jaynes and colleagues in their paper entitled “A probabilistic model for speech recognition”. HMMs are used in various natural language processing tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition etc. The key idea behind HMMs is that they assume that the probability of transitioning from state i to state j depends only on the current state but not any information about what comes before. This leads to more efficient modeling compared to other models like n-grams. 
         Now let’s move on to our main topic: Sequence tagging using HMM.
         # 2.Core Concepts and Terminologies
         
         Before jumping into technical details, it is important to have a good understanding of some core concepts and terminologies involved in sequence tagging using HMM. Here's a brief summary:
         - Tokenization: Splitting raw text data into smaller units called tokens such as words, phrases, sentences etc.
         - Stopwords removal: Removing stopwords such as 'the', 'and' etc., which do not carry much meaning and add noise to the data.
         - Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing variations of words to their base form. For instance, converting words like 'running','runner','ran' to 'run'.
         - Bag of Words Model: A mathematical model that represents textual data as the frequency distribution of its constituent tokens.
         - Vocabulary size: Number of unique words present in the given dataset.
         - Feature vector representation: A numeric representation of a token based on certain features such as presence or absence of a particular word in the vocabulary. 
         - Train set: The subset of the input data that is used to train the model.
         - Test set: The subset of the input data that is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
         
         # 3.Algorithm
         
        Firstly, we need to preprocess the input data to remove stopwords, tokenize them and reduce their variations to their base form. Once we obtain clean, processed data, we convert each token into a feature vector where each element corresponds to a word in the vocabulary.
        
        Next, we create a training set by combining multiple examples per tag category. Each example consists of a list of feature vectors representing the words in a sentence along with their corresponding tags. The length of both lists should always match up so that we have feature vectors for every word in the sentence.
        
        After creating the training set, we initialize the probabilities of starting and ending at different states and then iterate over all possible tag sequences in the corpus until convergence. During iteration, we update the emission and transition probabilities between adjacent states based on the likelihood of observing these states given the previous states. Finally, we predict the most likely tag for each word in the test set based on the updated emission and transition probabilities.
        
       The complete algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:
       
       Preprocessing --> Conversion into Feature Vectors --> Building Training Set --> Initialization of Probabilities --> Iterative Update of Probabilities --> Prediction of Tags
       
       Let’s now proceed to implementing an example code using NLTK Library in Python. 
       # 4.Implementation
         
        To begin with, make sure you have NLTK installed in your system. If not, install it using pip command. Then import the necessary libraries:
        
         ```python
         import nltk
         from nltk.corpus import treebank
         from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
         from nltk.tag import pos_tag, hmm
         ```
        ## Loading Treebank Corpus
        NLTK has a built-in corpus called "Treebank". It contains tagged sentences sampled from the Wall Street Journal. You can load this corpus by doing the following:
         
        ```python
        # Load Treebank Corpus
        treebank_tagged = treebank.tagged_sents()
        ```
        ## Preprocessing Data 
        ### Tokenizing Sentences
        We will use `nltk` functions to tokenize the sentences in the corpus.
         ```python
        # Tokenize Sentences
        sentences = [word_tokenize(sentence) for sentence in treebank.sents()]
        ```
        ### Removing Stopwords
        We will use `nltk` function to remove stopwords from the tokenized sentences. We can define a custom list of stopwords or download a prebuilt list available through `nltk`. Here, we are removing stopwords defined in `nltk`:
        ```python
        # Define Custom Stopwords List
        custom_stopwords = ['The', 'And']

        # Remove Stopwords
        filtered_sentences = [[token for token in sentence if token.lower() not in custom_stopwords]
                             for sentence in sentences]
        ```
        ### Lemmatizing Tokens
        Since lemmatization requires wordnet to be downloaded separately, we will skip this step. However, here's the implementation for reference:
         ```python
        # Download Wordnet
        nltk.download('wordnet')

        # Lemmatize Tokens
        from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
        lemmatizer = WordNetLlemmatizer()
        lemmatized_tokens = [[lemmatizer.lemmatize(token)
                              for token in sentence] for sentence in filtered_sentences]
        ```
        ### Converting Tokens to Features
        Now that we have cleaned and lemmatized the tokenized sentences, we need to convert each token into a numerical feature vector. We will create a dictionary containing the count of occurrence of each word in the entire corpus. This helps us to assign a unique index to each word in the vocabulary.
         ```python
        # Create Dictionary of Counts
        freq_dist = nltk.FreqDist([token.lower() for sentence in lemmatized_tokens
                                   for token in sentence])
        vocab_size = len(freq_dist) + 1
        word2idx = {word: idx+1 for idx, word in enumerate(list(freq_dist.keys()))}
        feature_vectors = []
        ```
        We added 1 to account for padding value when generating batches later.
        ### Generating Batches
        We will generate batches of feature vectors for training the HMM model. The batch size determines how many examples we want to include in each batch.
         ```python
        def generate_batches(sentences, labels, batch_size=1):
            num_batches = int((len(sentences)+batch_size-1)/batch_size)
            for batch_num in range(num_batches):
                start_index = batch_num*batch_size
                end_index = min((batch_num+1)*batch_size, len(sentences))
                yield ([[word2idx.get(token.lower(), None)
                         for token in sentence]
                        for sentence in sentences[start_index:end_index]],
                       labels[start_index:end_index])
        ```
        We pass the cleaned and converted tokens and labels into this generator function to get batches of feature vectors.
        ## Training HMM Model
        We will use the labeled Treebank corpus to train the HMM model. We will split the corpus into two parts: a training set and a testing set.
         ```python
        # Shuffle Corpus and Split into Train and Test Sets
        shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(len(treebank_tagged))
        train_set_size = int(.9 * len(shuffled_indices))
        train_indices = shuffled_indices[:train_set_size]
        test_indices = shuffled_indices[train_set_size:]
        train_labels = [label for label, _ in treebank_tagged[train_indices]]
        test_labels = [label for label, _ in treebank_tagged[test_indices]]
        train_sentences = [sentence for _, sentence in treebank_tagged[train_indices]]
        test_sentences = [sentence for _, sentence in treebank_tagged[test_indices]]
        ```
        Note that since the Treebank Corpus has already been preprocessed, there is no need to apply preprocessing again during training time.
        ### Hyperparameters
        We will set some hyperparameters for the HMM model. These parameters determine the number of states and type of observations that our model can handle.
         ```python
        # Set Hyperparameters
        num_hidden_states = 5
        observation_types = ["noun", "verb", "adj", "adv"]
        initial_probabilities = [0.7]*num_hidden_states
        transition_probabilities = np.random.rand(num_hidden_states,
                                                    num_hidden_states)*0.1
        emission_probabilities = {}
        for obs in observation_types:
            emission_probabilities[obs] = np.zeros(vocab_size)
        ```
        The number of hidden states determines the complexity of our model. Choosing too few hidden states may lead to underfitting while choosing too many hidden states may lead to overfitting. The "observation types" parameter defines the classes that we want to classify the tokens into. The "initial probabilities" indicate the probability of starting in a particular state. The "transition probabilities" represent the probability of moving from one state to another. Lastly, the "emission probabilities" represent the probability of emitting a particular observation given a state.
        ### Updating Emission Probabilities
        Next, we update the emission probabilities based on the counts obtained earlier.
         ```python
        # Calculate Emission Probabilities
        for sentence in train_sentences:
            prev_state = START_STATE
            for token in sentence:
                curr_state = random.choice(range(num_hidden_states))
                if token.lower() in word2idx:
                    emission_probabilities[prev_state][word2idx[token.lower()]] += 1
                else:
                    continue
                prev_state = curr_state
        ```
        We randomly select a state for each token and increment the count of the emitted token in the corresponding row of the emission matrix. We ignore unknown words since their counts cannot affect the accuracy of the model.
        ### Re-Normalizing Probabilities
        Just like the Baum-Welch algorithm, we need to renormalize the probabilities after updating the emission probabilities.
         ```python
        # Normalize Emission Matrix
        total_counts = sum([sum(row)
                            for row in emission_probabilities.values()])
        for obs in observation_types:
            emission_probabilities[obs] /= float(total_counts)
        ```
        ### Calculating Initial and Transition Probabilities
        Based on the labeled training corpus, we calculate the initial and transition probabilities of the model.
         ```python
        # Calculate Initial and Transition Probabilities
        hmm_model = hmm.HiddenMarkovModel(n_components=num_hidden_states)
        hmm_model.add_state()
        for i in range(num_hidden_states-1):
            hmm_model.add_state()
            hmm_model.add_transition(hmm_model.states[-2],
                                     hmm_model.states[-1],
                                     0.01*(i+1))
        hmm_model.add_transition(hmm_model.states[-2],
                                 hmm_model.states[0],
                                 0.9)
        hmm_model.bake()
        ```
        Here, we add the required number of states to the model and connect them with the appropriate transition probabilities. The last state is connected to the beginning state with high probability to ensure that all paths end in the same final state.
        ### Predicting Labels Using Test Set
        Finally, we can use the trained model to predict the labels of the test set.
         ```python
        # Use Trained Model to Predict Labels
        predicted_tags = []
        for sentence in test_sentences:
            viterbi_path, score = hmm_model.viterbi(sentence)
            predicted_tags.append([(observation_types[p.state], p.prob)
                                    for p in viterbi_path[:-1]])
        ```
        We run the Viterbi algorithm on each test sentence and extract the path of highest probability leading to each final state.
        ## Evaluation Metrics
        Since we don't have access to the true labels of the test set, we cannot directly measure the accuracy of our predictions. Instead, we will use metrics such as precision, recall and F1 Score to evaluate the quality of our predictions.
         ```python
        # Evaluate Predictions
        correct = 0
        for pred_seq, true_seq in zip(predicted_tags, test_labels):
            if pred_seq == true_seq:
                correct += 1
        print("Accuracy:", round(correct/float(len(predicted_tags)), 2))
        ```
        We compare the predicted and actual sequences and check for exact matches.
