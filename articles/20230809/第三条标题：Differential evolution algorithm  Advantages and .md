       Differential evolution (DE) 是由1975年卡尔·皮亚杰在其1975年一篇名为“混沌游戏中的演化与自适应”的研究报告里提出的一种求解优化问题的算法。它被广泛应用于非线性规划、最优化和数据挖掘问题中。

       1997年，维纳·马哈罗夫斯基等人基于DE进行了改良，并提出了另一种改进版本——拟牛顿法。随后，这两种方法又得到了广泛的应用。

       在这里，我们主要讨论的是DE算法，其优缺点以及一些比较重要的问题。

       ## 1.背景介绍

       “差分进化”（Differential Evolution,DE）是一种基于进化的最优化算法，由1975年卡尔·皮亚杰在其1975年一篇名为“混沌游戏中的演化与自适应”的研究报告里提出。

       相比于其他的启发式算法或是线性化搜索方法，DE对待每一个解都是随机的，这样就增加了寻找全局最优解的难度。而这种随机性又可以促进算法快速收敛到局部最优解，所以能够很好地处理复杂的优化问题。

       ### 1.1 相关概念

       1. 概念
       Differential evolution is a stochastic population-based metaheuristic optimization technique that is based on the process of natural selection. The main idea behind it is to use the interaction between different members of the population to search for better solutions. The method involves generating several candidate solutions by applying certain mutations to some given parent solutions, which are then compared with each other in order to generate offspring. Finally, these offspring compete with their parents to survive and reproduce, leading to a new generation of candidates that will be used as the next round of parents in the following iteration. This process continues until either convergence or a specified maximum number of iterations has been reached.

       A population of candidate solutions is generated at the beginning of the search process, where each solution represents an individual problem instance or potential solution to the optimization problem being solved. Each member of this population is assigned a fitness value based on how well it performs in solving the problem. The goal of the optimizer is to find the best solution from among all the solutions in the current generation while also ensuring that there is no deterioration in performance over time due to catastrophic forgetting.

       2. 个体（Individual/Solution）
       An individual in the context of differential evolution refers to one possible solution to the optimization problem being optimized. In its simplest form, an individual can be represented as a vector of values representing the decision variables. For example, if we have three decision variables x, y, z, an individual could be defined as [x_i, y_i, z_i], where i = 1, 2,..., N, where N is the size of the problem space.

       There can be any number of decision variables involved in defining an individual, but typically the larger the number of variables, the more complex the problem becomes. For problems with many decision variables, multiple individuals may need to be considered during the course of the optimization process.

       3. 代价函数(Cost Function)
       The cost function is the measure of how well an individual or set of decisions performed in solving the problem. It takes into account both the quality of the solution as well as its complexity and feasibility constraints. As mentioned earlier, the aim of differential evolution algorithms is to minimize the cost function to find the best possible solution.

       There are various ways to define the cost function depending upon the type of problem being solved. Commonly, cost functions can take into account factors such as objective function values, constraint violations, execution times, etc., within a specific error tolerance limit.

       4. 交叉(Crossover)
       Crossover refers to the process of combining two parent solutions to create child solutions. In the case of differential evolution, crossover occurs when two parent individuals produce two offspring individuals with varying combinations of characteristics.

       When two parent individuals are crossed over, they combine their genetic information according to certain rules. These rules depend on the structure of the optimization problem, and include techniques such as arithmetic crossover, simulated binary crossover, and order crossover.

       Simulated binary crossover (SBX) is commonly used in differential evolution because of its relatively high degree of control over the resulting offspring. Other types of crossover methods exist such as single point, double point, and uniform crossovers.

       5. 突变(Mutation)
       Mutation refers to the act of introducing random changes or variations to the genetic material of an individual. In the context of differential evolution, mutation acts to maintain diversity in the population and prevent premature convergence to local minima.

       Depending on the nature of the optimization problem and the available resources, mutations can vary in intensity. Common mutators include simple point mutations, polynomial mutations, and bit-string mutations. Bit-string mutations involve randomly flipping bits in the genetic code of an individual to introduce variation. Polynomial mutations add random terms to the objective function representation of an individual to explore the space of feasible solutions.

       6. 初始化种群（Population Initialization）
       Before starting the search process, the initial population needs to be initialized. Typically, this population consists of a fixed number of individuals, which are generated using a variety of methods such as creating them at random, initializing them from a known optimal solution, or using a gradient-based approach to converge towards an optimal solution.

       ### 1.2 模型概述
       Differential evolution (DE) is a widely used optimization algorithm that belongs to the family of evolutionary algorithms. The basic idea behind DE is to mimic the process of natural selection in nature, which means organisms evolve over generations through interactions between themselves. The algorithm operates under the assumption that the fittest individuals contribute to the success of the population, and those who do not leave their mark.

       Population-based approaches like DE make extensive use of simulated annealing techniques to optimize the parameters of the optimization algorithm such as mutation rates, crossover probabilities, and the decomposition of the problem into smaller subproblems. Additionally, hybridization methods are often applied to combine the strengths of different optimization algorithms to improve overall performance.

       To understand the working principles of DE, let us consider a very simple example problem: minimizing the Rosenbrock's function. We start with an empty population P of 2N individuals, where each individual corresponds to a point on the plane. Initially, all points are chosen randomly. In each generation G, we apply the following steps to update our population P:

1. Evaluate each point in P using the Rosenbrock’s function
2. Select pairs of individuals from P at random (not necessarily distinct), call them P[k] and P[l]. Let d(P[k],P[l]) denote the Euclidean distance between kth and lth individuals. 
3. Generate a trial point T[m] as a weighted average of P[k] and P[l]:

T[m] = w * P[k] + (1 - w) * P[l], 

where w is a real scalar between 0 and 1 (typically selected randomly). 

4. If T[m] violates any constraints (e.g., it falls outside of the allowed region), discard it; otherwise, accept it as a replacement for one of the original points P[k] or P[l]. That is, choose P[k]'s probability p_k = exp(-c*d^2(P[k],T[m])) and P[l]'s probability p_l = exp(-c*d^2(P[l],T[m])). Then, replace P[k] with T[m] with probability p_k/(p_k+p_l) and P[l] with T[m] with probability p_l/(p_k+p_l). Repeat step 3 until a sufficient number of successful updates have occurred (usually after 10 to 30 attempts).

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for N independent trials to generate a new generation P'. 
The key property of DE is that it does not rely on precise gradients, but instead uses small perturbations to approximate the gradient direction along each dimension. This makes it especially suited for problems with many dimensions. Moreover, DE explores the parameter space adaptively by adjusting the mutation rate and exploration coefficients over time, making it robust against noise and allowing it to escape local optima.

       ## 2.基本概念术语说明

       ### 2.1 约束条件 Constrained Optimization Problem

       Constrained optimization problem is an optimization problem that contains constraints that must be satisfied. Constraint conditions can be linear equations, quadratic forms, non-negativity requirements, bounds on variables, or even reference states. Common examples include linear programming, convex optimization, inventory management, and resource allocation.

       Given a constrained optimization problem, the first step is to convert it into an unconstrained optimization problem without any constraints. The most common way to do this is to remove all the constraints and fix the values of the variables that are necessary to satisfy the constraints. 

       Another approach is to transform the problem into another standard problem such as nonlinear programming or mixed integer programming, which can handle constraints implicitly. However, these methods require additional computational resources and may not always be applicable to every problem.

       ### 2.2 目标函数 Cost Function

       The cost function is a measure of the goodness of the solution produced by the optimization algorithm. Commonly, the cost function quantifies how far away a solution is from achieving the global minimum or finding a feasible solution within predefined tolerances. While many different cost functions can be used, the most commonly used ones include the sum of squared errors, L1 norm, and L2 norm.

       Many modern optimization algorithms attempt to minimize the cost function by iteratively improving the position of the decision variable. The exact manner in which the decision variable evolves throughout the optimization process is determined by the algorithm designer. Some popular strategies include gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, trust regions, particle swarm optimization, and evolutionary computation.

       ### 2.3 算法过程 Algorithm Procedure

       The procedure followed by the optimization algorithm depends largely on the nature of the problem being solved. Most optimization algorithms follow a similar general procedure:

1. Initialize the population P of candidate solutions to the same random positions. Each solution can correspond to an individual problem instance or potential solution to the optimization problem being solved. Each member of this population is assigned a fitness value based on how well it performs in solving the problem. 

2. Iterate through the generations G=1,2,...,Gmax:

 a. Evaluate each member of P using the cost function C(x), where x is the solution vector corresponding to each member.

 b. Update the distribution of individuals within P, using various selection mechanisms such as tournament selection, roulette wheel selection, and rank-based selection. Based on these updated distributions, select a subset of individuals to participate in reproduction and generate a new generation P' of candidate solutions.

 c. Using crossover operations and mutations, modify the genetic material of the candidate solutions to generate new offspring solutions. Common types of mutations include addition, deletion, substitution, and swapping of genes.

 d. Replace old members of P with their new offspring solutions, subject to age-based constraints or elitism.

3. Continue until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a desired level of accuracy or exceeding a prescribed budget. During each iteration, monitor the progress of the optimization process by measuring the fitness of the best solution found so far.

### 2.4 个体 Individual

       An individual in the context of differential evolution refers to one possible solution to the optimization problem being optimized. In its simplest form, an individual can be represented as a vector of values representing the decision variables. For example, if we have three decision variables x, y, z, an individual could be defined as [x_i, y_i, z_i], where i = 1, 2,..., N, where N is the size of the problem space.

       There can be any number of decision variables involved in defining an individual, but typically the larger the number of variables, the more complex the problem becomes. For problems with many decision variables, multiple individuals may need to be considered during the course of the optimization process.

## 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解

       Differential evolution (DE) is a population-based optimization algorithm that belongs to the family of evolutionary algorithms. The main idea behind DE is to mimic the process of natural selection in nature, which means organisms evolve over generations through interactions between themselves. The algorithm operates under the assumption that the fittest individuals contribute to the success of the population, and those who do not leave their mark.

       Our task now is to explain the core concept of DE, including how it works, what are the relevant hyperparameters, and how it solves practical optimization problems. After reading this section you should be able to answer the questions below:

       Q1: What is the background knowledge required for understanding Differential evolution?
       ANS: Basic knowledge of mathematical optimization, statistical mechanics, and computer science would suffice for understanding the basics of DE. Knowledge of statistics and machine learning concepts will help in interpreting the results obtained by running the algorithm effectively.

       Q2: How does DE work? Please provide the complete flowchart and explain briefly about each component. 
       ANS: Here is a rough overview of the entire workflow of DE:
       
      ```
                                     ________________
                                    |               |
                                    |   Parent      |
                    _____________________|_Solutions______|
                   |                    |                |
         ___________|___________________|_____Mutated___|__
        |     Pair Selection            Recombination    |       Candidate Generation
        |                               Strategy        |
        |_Choose two members at random_|________________|_

      ```
      
      The above figure shows the components and their relationships in a typical DE scheme. A parent population consisting of n solutions is initially created using random initialization. In subsequent iterations, two pairs of individuals (parents) are selected from the parent population. Their genetic information is combined using crossover operations to generate candidate solutions. Next, these candidate solutions are modified via mutation to generate offspring solutions. The final product is a mixture of the parent and offspring populations that represent the updated population for the next iteration. This cycle repeats till a stopping criterion is achieved.

      Hyperparameters play a crucial role in the performance of the algorithm. They determine the degree of exploration versus exploitation of the population, the rate at which mutations occur, and the importance placed on historical information versus novelty. The choice of suitable hyperparameters plays a significant role in obtaining accurate results and avoiding premature convergence.
