As a result, FinTech offers significant economic benefits for both individuals and businesses, making it one of the fastest growing industries in the world.  
        
        Although FinTech was initially created to solve financial problems but now it is expanding its scope to include a wide range of applications across multiple industries. Some of the most popular FinTech companies include JP Morgan Chase Bank, Capital One, Amazon, Barclays, Wells Fargo, and PayPal. 
        
        ## 2.2 Healthcare
        Healthcare is the field of medical science dealing with the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, monitoring, and recovery of human beings through interventions designed to provide access to healthcare resources such as medication, hospital beds, nursing facilities, and diagnostic imaging equipment. In recent years, healthcare has seen immense changes as people rely increasingly on technology to meet the needs of patients.  
        
        Healthcare providers are already using FinTech tools to support their workflows, improving patient engagement, reducing costs, and enhancing the overall health outcomes for patients. Moreover, many of these providers leverage FinTech platforms to offer personalized wellness programs and access to fitness trackers that provide real-time feedback on physical activity levels and prevent falls. Furthermore, with advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), biometric devices, and machine learning algorithms, healthcare organizations can develop predictive analytics and risk assessment tools that help them make better decisions and achieve greater compliance. This approach, known as clinical decision support (CDS), provides valuable insights into patient behavior and pain points so that they can identify factors that contribute to poor outcomes and address them accordingly.  
        
        With the explosion of mobile-first apps and wearable devices, the demand for healthcare app developers has skyrocketed over the past few years. Many of these developers are leveraging FinTech platforms to create innovative healthcare experiences that connect users to relevant information instantly, even before going to the office. These platforms allow doctors and patients to search, compare, and book appointments with ease, enabling access to medical professionals who may not be physically present in the organization. 

        ## 2.3 Fintech Partnerships
        
        Fintech Partnerships refer to collaborations between different financial companies and organisations, which aim at leveraging their respective expertise in order to jointly develop new financial products and services with the goal of creating value for customers. In particular, fintech partnerships play a crucial role in achieving scalability and profitability in healthcare sector.
         
        
        Currently, there are numerous types of fintech partnerships that exist in the healthcare sector. Some of the commonly identified types of fintech partnerships include:
         
          
          1. Platform partners: These partners work closely together to build platform infrastructure for healthcare markets. For example, Uber Eats, Deliveroo, and Just Eat provide delivery services for restaurants, respectively, while Blood Orange, Starbucks, and Peloton provide payment options for customers.

          2. Application integrators: They integrate third party applications with the fintech ecosystem and provide secure APIs for accessing financial services provided by fintechs. Examples of application integrators include Egnyte, Stitch Fix, Transferwise, and Razorpay.

          3. Data aggregators: They combine large amounts of data from different sources to generate meaningful insights about customers' financial situation. For instance, PwC uses fintech data from 17 healthcare institutions to analyze and forecast financial performance for clients.

          4. Business development partners: They offer specific financial solutions such as insurance, pensions, mortgages, credit cards, etc., to smaller businesses.

          5. Digital transformation partners: They guide organizations towards optimizing existing systems and developing new ones by identifying bottlenecks and facilitating change management strategies.

          6. Payment gateways: They facilitate online payments by allowing merchants to receive payments directly from customers without having to collect cash first. Examples of payment gateways include Stripe, Square, Paypal, and PayU.

        


     

    
    
    
    # 3. Core Algorithm and Operations

    ## 3.1 Artificial Intelligence

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a subset of computer science that focuses on building machines capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. AI consists of three main components - reasoning, problem solving, and intelligent agents. Reasoning involves generating logical conclusions based on input data, while problem solving involves finding effective methods of completing tasks by considering available resources and constraints. Intelligent agents act independently and autonomously by exhibiting traits similar to humans, such as emotional intelligence, intuition, and rationality. 

    To implement this functionality, modern AI systems rely heavily on deep neural networks, which are composed of layers of connected neurons, where each neuron receives inputs from other neurons and sends outputs to others. A typical neural network architecture includes an input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Each neuron in the hidden layers process weighted inputs, apply activation functions, and transmit signals to the next layer. Output neurons send results back to the controller program, which performs additional processing and analysis to obtain the final output. 

    Overall, deep neural networks are particularly powerful because they can learn complex patterns in high dimensional data sets and produce accurate predictions on previously unseen examples. Applications of AI in healthcare include disease detection, cancer screening, and natural language processing. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in image classification tasks. 


    ## 3.2 Big Data Analytics

    Big Data refers to a volume of data generated from diverse sources, including social media, sensors, enterprise systems, cloud computing environments, and web portals. The size and variety of Big Data makes it difficult to extract useful insights without advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. 

    Traditional statistical techniques are often ineffective in handling Big Data due to the amount of noise and irrelevant information present in the dataset. In recent years, new approaches called “Big Data” analytics have gained momentum, involving distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark, database management systems like Apache Cassandra, and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn. By analyzing vast quantities of raw data, these techniques can discover patterns and trends that were impossible to spot with classical statistical techniques. 







    # 4. Code Example and Explanation 

    Here's an example code snippet written in Python that utilizes Google Cloud Natural Language API to detect entities in a given text document: 
    
    ```python
    import google.cloud.language_v1 as language
   
    def detect_entities(text):
        """Detects entities in the text."""
        client = language.LanguageServiceClient()
        encoding_type = language.EncodingType.UTF8
        document = {"content": text, "type": "PLAIN_TEXT"}
        response = client.analyze_entity_sentiment(document=document, encoding_type=encoding_type)
        return [e.name for e in response.entities]
   ```

   This function takes in a string `text` and returns a list of detected entity names. 

   The function creates a `client` object using the Google Cloud Natural Language API. It specifies the desired encoding type for the input text (`UTF8`). Then, it constructs a dictionary representation of the input text using the `"content"` and `"type"` keys. Finally, it calls the `analyze_entity_sentiment()` method of the client object to get sentiment and entity information for the input text. The function then loops through the `response`'s `entities` attribute and returns only the entity name for each entity found in the text. 

   Using this function, you can easily retrieve all the named entities mentioned in a text document or comment. You could also modify the function to extract other entity types, such as places, events, and organizations, if necessary.
