# 1.简介
         
 Random Forest (RF) is a powerful and widely used machine learning algorithm that can be applied to both classification and regression problems. It combines multiple decision trees into one model, which reduces the risk of overfitting and improves accuracy by aggregating the results from different decision trees with different subsets of data. In this article, we will introduce the basic concepts of random forest and how it works for solving supervised learning problems in detail.

          The key idea behind RF is to create many small decision trees on bootstrapped samples of the training set and then aggregate their outputs to get a final prediction. Each tree learns to isolate specific features or combinations of features that are important in classifying instances correctly, thus producing an ensemble of diverse models. This approach helps to reduce the variance of individual decision trees and improve overall predictive performance. 
          # 2. Basic Concepts And Terminology
           Random Forest is based on two main principles:
            - Bootstrap sampling: This involves creating multiple datasets using bootstrap resampling technique, where each dataset is obtained by randomly drawing n cases from the original dataset without replacement. The size of n is typically equal to the number of cases in the original dataset. Bootstrapping ensures that the same cases cannot occur more than once in any dataset, resulting in unbiased estimates of the true mean and variance.

            - Aggregate diversity: To make predictions, the random forest algorithm applies several trained decision trees to different versions of the input data sampled through bootstrapping. The output of these trees is combined into a single result using voting rules such as majority vote or averaging the probabilities predicted by each tree. This combination of diverse models often leads to better generalization error compared to a single model.

           There are three key parameters involved in random forest algorithms:
           - Number of Trees (NT): The total number of decision trees created during training. A higher value of NT typically leads to better generalization performance but also increases computational complexity and requires longer training time. An optimal value of NT may require experimentation across various problem domains and tuning techniques.

           - Tree Depth (TD): The maximum depth of each decision tree. A smaller value of TD limits the complexity of each tree and improves its ability to capture non-linear relationships between variables. However, too low a value of TD may result in underfitting and poor generalization.

           - Number Of Features To Consider At Each Split (NF): The number of features considered at each split point when splitting the feature space. A larger value of NF typically improves generalization performance but may lead to overfitting if set too high. The best value of NF depends on the intrinsic dimensionality of the input data and the level of noise present.

          We will now define some terminology that will help us understand the mathematics behind the random forest algorithm:
           - N: Total number of observations in the dataset. 
           - p: Number of input features (dimensions).
           - K: Number of classes in the target variable.
           - T: Total number of decision trees in the forest.
           - m: Maximum depth of each decision tree.
           - B: Number of bootstrap samples generated during training.
        # 3. Mathematical Details 
        ## 3.1 Probability Theory Background
        Before understanding the mathematical details of random forest, let's first recall some probability theory concepts.

        ### 3.1.1 Probability Distributions 
        A probability distribution is a function that assigns probabilities to possible outcomes of a random phenomenon. Common examples include binomial distributions, Poisson distributions, normal distributions, etc. In this section, we will discuss the most commonly used continuous probability distributions. 

        #### 3.1.1.1 Continuous Uniform Distribution 
        Let X be a continuous random variable with support [a, b], where a and b are real numbers. Then, the uniform continuous distribution U(a,b) on [a,b] assigns probabilities equally distributed over all intervals of length (b-a), regardless of whether they intersect the interval [a,b]. Specifically, U(a,b)(x) = 1/(b-a) if a <= x <= b, else 0.
        
        For example, consider a uniformly distributed temperature around room temperature in Celsius. Suppose the lowest possible temperature is 20°C and the highest possible temperature is 30°C. If we measure a temperature of 23°C, the probability distribution would assign 1/9 ≈ 0.111 probabiity to any values within [20,23] or [23,30], while assigning zero probability to the intervals outside those bounds. 

        #### 3.1.1.2 Normal (Gaussian) Distribution  
        The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is a common continuous probability distribution characterized by two parameters: the mean μ (also called the location parameter) and the standard deviation σ (also known as the spread or scale parameter). The pdf of the normal distribution is given by:   
        
        f(x|μ,σ^2) = (2π*σ^2)^(-1/2)*exp(-(x-μ)^2/(2σ^2))  
                
        where μ is the mean, σ^2 is the variance, and π (pi) is approximately equal to 3.14159. The normal distribution has many properties including symmetry about its mean, positive definiteness, and infinite variance in the limit of large enough sample sizes. 

        By default, the mean of a normal distribution is equal to its mode, which occurs when its probability density function peaks. Similarly, the median of a normal distribution is equal to its mean, except when the distribution has no integer multiples of its mean. Therefore, knowing either the mean or the median of a normal distribution provides information about its skewness and kurtosis.

        #### 3.1.1.3 Exponential Distribution  
        The exponential distribution describes the waiting times between events in a Poisson process. The pdf of the exponential distribution is given by:
        
        f(x|\lambda) = \lambda * exp(-\lambda * x)       

        where λ is the rate parameter, which determines the average frequency of events occurring in a given time interval. The exponential distribution can be thought of as a special case of the gamma distribution with alpha=1.
