# 1.简介
         

        　　Logistic regression is a widely used statistical method for predictive modeling and classification tasks. It is a type of binary classifier that outputs either one or the other of two possible outcomes based on input features. Logistic regression has been around since the early days of statistics and machine learning, with applications ranging from cognitive psychology to finance.

        　　In this article, we will learn how to implement logistic regression using scikit-learn library in Python programming language. We will also explore various techniques such as regularization and cross validation to improve model performance. Finally, we will evaluate our model's accuracy and compare its performance against other popular models such as decision trees and random forests.

        ```python
           import pandas as pd
           import numpy as np
           from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
           from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
           from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV

           # Loading data into Pandas dataframe
           df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')
       ```



       # 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
       
       Let us understand some basic concepts and terminology related to Logistic Regression before moving further.<|im_sep|>
       
   ## 2.1 Binary Classification

   In supervised machine learning, binary classification refers to a task where there are only two distinct classes (e.g., "Yes"/"No", "Male"/"Female") to be predicted given a set of independent variables. The goal is to classify new instances into one of these categories according to their characteristics.
   
   A typical example of binary classification is email spam detection: emails can be classified as "spam" or "not spam". Another common use case involves sentiment analysis, where text samples belonging to different categories are labeled by humans as positive, negative, or neutral. The target variable is usually binary, but it could also have multiple labels if each instance represents more than one aspect of interest. 

   Another type of binary classification problem is fraud detection, where financial transactions are labeled as fraudulent or genuine depending on whether they meet certain criteria such as transaction amount, frequency, pattern, etc. 
   
   ## 2.2 Sigmoid Function

   In logistic regression, the output prediction y is calculated using a sigmoid function, which maps any real value into an output between 0 and 1. This means that instead of predicting a continuous outcome like linear regression does, logistic regression produces probabilities between 0 and 1 indicating the likelihood of an instance being in each category.

   Specifically, the probability that an instance belongs to the first category is denoted as P(y=1), while the probability that it belongs to the second category is denoted as P(y=0). These probabilities are computed using the sigmoid function, which takes inputs z, which is obtained as the dot product of the feature vector X and the parameter matrix theta:  

   \begin{equation}
   \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} 
   \end{equation}

   Where e is Euler's number approximately equal to 2.718.

   When z equals zero, $\sigma(z)$ becomes approximately 0.5; when z is greater than zero, $\sigma(z)$ approaches 1, and when z is less than zero, $\sigma(z)$ approaches 0. Therefore, $\sigma(z)$ gives the probability that the instance belongs to the first category (in terms of our binary classification problem).

   To simplify notation and avoid confusion, let's assume that the label associated with the first category is represented by 1, and the label associated with the second category is represented by -1 in subsequent equations.


   ## 2.3 Cost Function and Gradient Descent Optimization

   During training, the cost function J is minimized using gradient descent optimization algorithm. The objective of gradient descent is to find the minimum value of the cost function J by iteratively updating the parameters Θ until convergence.

   Specifically, during training, the weights are updated using the following equation at each iteration t:

   \begin{align*}
   &\theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} - \alpha \nabla_{\theta}J \\
   &= \theta_{t} - \alpha [1/m \sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x^{i}) - y^{i}) x^{i}]
   \end{align*}

   Here, h_{\theta}(x) is the predicted score for the instance x, which is obtained by computing the dot product of the feature vector x and the parameter matrix theta. The term inside the square brackets is known as the gradient of the cost function J wrt to the parameter matrix theta.

   The size of the update step α determines the speed of convergence and affects the rate at which the cost function decreases. However, too large an update step may cause instability or overshoot the optimal solution, while too small an update step may slow down convergence or lead to suboptimal results. Commonly, a range of values for alpha is chosen through experimentation and tuning to optimize performance.

   By combining these three components together, the final hypothesis function can be written as:

   \begin{align*}
   h_\theta(x) &= \sigma(\theta^Tx) \\
              &= \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\theta^Tx)}
   \end{align*}

   With this definition, we now have all the necessary ingredients to start implementing logistic regression using scikit-learn.


   # 3.Implementation Using Scikit-Learn Library

   In this section, we will implement logistic regression using scikit-learn library. For simplicity, we will focus on binary classification problems where the target variable consists of two possible outcomes. 

   Let's begin by loading the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and exploring the structure of the data.

   ```python
       # Loading data into Pandas dataframe
       df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')

       print("Dataset shape:", df.shape)
       print("\nFirst few rows:\n", df.head())
   ```

   Output:

   ```
       Dataset shape: (891, 12)

       First few rows:
      PassengerId Survived Pclass ...     SibSp      Parch        Fare
   0           1      0      3 ...         1          0   7.2500
   1           2      1      1 ...         1          0  71.2833
   2           3      1      3 ...         0          0   7.9250
   3           4      1      1 ...         0          0  53.1000
   4           5      0      3 ...         0          0   8.0500
   ```

   From the above output, we see that the dataset contains information about 891 passengers along with several attributes such as age, sex, ticket price, cabin location, embarked port, etc. The target variable in this case is "Survived," which indicates whether the passenger survived or not after the sinking of the Titanic. Since the target variable is categorical, i.e., it can take on only two values ("0" or "1"), this is a binary classification problem.

   Next, we need to preprocess the data by dealing with missing values, handling categorical variables, and normalizing numerical columns so that they have similar scales. We will do this using scikit-learn pipelines.

   ```python
       from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
       from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
       from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler

       num_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
           ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
           ('scaler', StandardScaler())])

       cat_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
           ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
           ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))])

       preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[
           ('num', num_transformer, ['Age', 'Fare']),
           ('cat', cat_transformer, ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Embarked'])], remainder='passthrough')

       X = df.drop(['PassengerId', 'Survived'], axis=1)
       y = df['Survived']
   ```

   The code above defines two transformer objects: `num_transformer` and `cat_transformer`. Each object applies simple imputation and scaling operations respectively to numerical and categorical columns, respectively. The `ColumnTransformer` then combines these transformers along with a default passthrough strategy for non-transformed columns.

   Once we have defined the preprocessing pipeline, we apply it to both the features and targets using `.fit_transform()` method.

   ```python
       X_preprocessed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X)
       y_preprocessed = y
   ```

   Now, we split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split()` method.

   ```python
       from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

       X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_preprocessed, y_preprocessed, test_size=0.2,
                                                           stratify=y_preprocessed, random_state=42)
   ```

   The `stratify` argument ensures that the proportion of examples in both training and testing sets remains balanced across the two categories in the target variable. Setting `random_state` to a fixed integer ensures reproducibility.

   Then, we define the logistic regression estimator using `LogisticRegression()` constructor from scikit-learn's `linear_model` module. We specify the penalty (`'l1'` or `'l2'`) and solver (`'liblinear'` or `'saga'`) to control the sparsity of the solution and enable support for multi-class classification problems.

   ```python
       clf = LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', solver='liblinear', random_state=42)
   ```

   Note that setting `random_state` here ensures reproducibility, just like in splitting the data.

   Lastly, we fit the logistic regression model to the training data using the `.fit()` method and make predictions on the testing data using the `.predict()` method.

   ```python
       clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
       y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
   ```

   Here's the complete implementation:<|im_sep|>
