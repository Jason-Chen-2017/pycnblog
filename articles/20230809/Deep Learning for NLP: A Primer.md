# 1.简介
         

        Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been a hot topic in recent years with various applications like sentiment analysis, speech recognition and chatbots. This article will cover the basic concepts of deep learning applied to NLP, as well as state-of-the-art models such as Transformers, BERT and GPT-2. We also provide detailed steps on how to implement these models from scratch using Python libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

        The core goal is to provide an accessible introduction to deep learning principles and techniques that are applicable to natural language processing tasks. 

        In this primer, we assume readers have some knowledge about machine learning and have worked through traditional algorithms such as logistic regression and decision trees. Our focus will be on the more advanced aspects of deep learning, especially recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms. The target audience should have a solid understanding of linear algebra and calculus. 

        Note that this article does not explain why certain approaches work better than others or what makes one model better than another, nor do we discuss topics related to modern NLP pipelines such as pre-processing and post-processing text data, multilingual modeling, etc. Such details can be found in other resources, so our goal here is just to give you a general idea of how deep learning works with NLP.

         # 2. Basic Concepts
         ## 2.1 Word Embeddings 
         ### Definition 
          Word embeddings are dense representations of words in vector space where similar words are closer together. Each word embedding is a point in a high dimensional space representing its semantic meaning. The dimensionality of the vector space depends on the size of the vocabulary and the type of task being performed.

          There are two types of word embeddings - Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) and Skip Gram. Both use the context of nearby words to predict the target word. CBOW takes in a center word and tries to predict its surrounding words while skip gram uses the surrounding words to predict the center word.
          
          ### How it's done? 
          
          Let’s take an example sentence “I love playing basketball” and try to convert each word into a vector representation. One possible approach would be to create a matrix where each row represents a word and each column represents the number of times that particular word appeared in the training dataset. Here, the rows represent the input vectors and columns represent the output vectors corresponding to each position in the matrix.

          For the given sentence, let us consider the following matrix : 

                     I   love    play    ball
                |-----|--------|---------|------|
               I|    1    1       0      0    
              love|    0    1       1      0  
               play|    0    0       1      0    
                ball|    0    0       0      1  

          Now, if we apply continuous bag of words (CBOW) method on this matrix, then for the first step, we calculate the sum of all the rows except the last row which corresponds to the "center" word. Then divide by the total number of non-zero elements in that row (i.e., excluding the center word). This gives us a weighted average of the surrounding words based on their frequency. We obtain a new vector representation for the center word based on this formula. Repeat this process for every word in the sentence until we get the final vector representation for the entire sentence.

           Similarly, if we apply skip gram method, we treat each word in the matrix as the center word and try to predict its surrounding words based on the probability distribution of those words in the matrix. Again, we obtain a new vector representation for the center word based on this formula. Repeat this process for every word in the sentence until we get the final vector representation for the entire sentence.
           
         
         ## 2.2 Recurrent Neural Networks  
         ### Definition  
           RNNs are deep feedforward neural networks with loops in them, allowing information to persist over time. These networks can be used for sequence classification tasks, prediction problems, and generating text. They are widely used in natural language processing because they can capture long-term dependencies between words.

             An illustration of an LSTM cell with three gates – forget gate, input gate, and output gate – connected in series. Each gate receives inputs from both the previous hidden state and the current input, along with several parameters learned during training.
           
            The key features of an RNN are that it processes sequential data and maintains an internal state, making it capable of handling variable length sequences. It learns to map fixed sized vectors to different outputs depending on the sequence at hand, unlike traditional ML models that require flattened feature vectors to make predictions.

            
         ### Architecture 
            <p align="center">
             </p>
             
             The architecture of an RNN consists of multiple layers of neurons arranged in either serial or parallel structures. The first layer takes in input vectors at each time step, passes it through a nonlinear activation function, and produces an output vector at that time step. Subsequent layers take in the output of the previous layer and produce their own respective output vectors.

             
            On the right side of the figure, we see an example of an RNN used for sentiment analysis, where an input sequence consisting of movie reviews is fed through the network. At each time step, the network processes a single word and updates its internal state according to the current input. Finally, the network calculates an overall sentiment score for the review. 

             Another common application of RNNs is for timeseries forecasting, where past values in the time series influence future ones. For instance, stock price prediction is a classic problem solved using an RNN. 


         ### Training
           RNNs are trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT), a variant of stochastic gradient descent. During training, the weights in each layer are adjusted to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output generated by the network. Different variants of RNN architectures exist, including vanilla RNNs, GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory units). 
             
      
         ## Attention Mechanisms 
         ### Definition  
           Attention mechanisms allow a model to selectively focus on parts of an input sequence when producing its output. They were introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2015 and form the basis for many popular transformer-based NLP models.

            Attention mechanisms operate on a set of queries, keys, and values that come from the encoder RNN and represent the source sequence. The queries are focused on specific positions in the input sequence, whereas the keys and values are derived from the same input sequence but correspond to different positions. Attention computations are done via dot product attention, where the query vector Q is multiplied element-wise with the transpose of the key matrix K, followed by softmax normalization. The result of this operation is referred to as the attention weight matrix W, indicating the strength of attention to pay to each part of the input sequence. 

            Next, the value vectors V are selected based on the attention weights and concatenated to generate the output vector. Intuitively, the model focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence before generating its output. However, since this mechanism involves the computation of expensive operations, the efficiency of training large transformer-based models remains a challenge. 
            
         ### Architecture  
           Transformer-based NLP models, such as BERT and GPT-2, rely heavily on attention mechanisms. The architecture of such models is similar to convolutional neural networks, with multiple encoder layers stacked on top of a decoder layer.

         # 3. Algorithms and Implementation
         ## Word Vector Representations with Word2Vec
         ### Introduction
           Word embeddings are one way to encode the meaning of words in a low-dimensional vector space. Although they have been around since the late 20th century, the development of effective methods for learning word embeddings led to significant advances in natural language processing tasks. One such method called Word2Vec was developed by Mikolov et al. in 2013. It defines a loss function that measures the similarity between pairs of words and trains a neural network to optimize the vectors so that similar words are mapped close to each other, while dissimilar words are mapped far apart. We'll briefly describe the algorithm below. 
         
         ### Algorithm  
           First, we need to define two matrices $V$ and $\mathcal{E}$ of equal dimensions. The former ($V$) maps each word to a unique vector in a d-dimensional space, while the latter ($\mathcal{E}$) stores the co-occurrence statistics for all pairs of words in the corpus. The dimensions of the resulting vector spaces depend on the size of the vocabulary and the desired level of granularity. Common choices include setting $d=300$, which gives reasonably good results in terms of interpretability and compression, or $d=100$, which may be sufficient for practical purposes. 

           After initializing the matrices, we start iterating over the corpus and updating the co-occurrence statistics and the vectors accordingly. Specifically, we iterate over each document in the corpus, tokenize the text into individual words, and update the counts for each pair of adjacent words. Once we've processed all documents, we normalize the count vectors to compute probabilities and avoid numerical instability issues.

           Finally, we train a neural network to maximize the expected log likelihood of observing the co-occurrence statistics under the probability distributions defined by the normalized count vectors. The cost function used in practice is usually negative log-likelihood, computed using the cross-entropy loss function. 

           Since computing gradients for large sparse matrices can be prohibitively slow, there are several optimization techniques available, including negative sampling, hierarchical softmax, and subsampling frequent words. But these techniques tend to significantly reduce the performance of the original Word2Vec algorithm, so it's still commonly used today in a wide range of NLP tasks.

           
         ### Code Example
           Implementing Word2Vec with Keras is straightforward. We simply import the necessary modules and build a simple model with two Dense layers and a softmax activation function. The input layer accepts integer sequences representing tokenized sentences, while the output layer produces float sequences representing embedded sentences. We train the model using categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer with default settings.
           
           ```python
from keras.layers import Input, Embedding, Flatten, Dot
from keras.models import Model
import numpy as np
from sklearn.utils.extmath import randomized_svd


# Sample data
sentences = ["the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", 
           "the cat slept on the mat",
           "to be or not to be"]
           
vocab = list(set(' '.join(sentences))) 
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=len(vocab))
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)

# Preprocess input data
max_seq_length = max([len(x) for x in sequences])
padded_seqs = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_seq_length)
word_index = tokenizer.word_index
embedding_matrix = np.zeros((len(word_index)+1, EMBEDDING_DIM))

# Train Word2Vec
for i, seq in enumerate(padded_seqs):
   for j, index in enumerate(seq):
       if index > 0:
           embedding_vector = wv_model[index]
           if embedding_vector is not None:
               embedding_matrix[index] = embedding_vector
               
# Create model
inputs = Input(shape=(max_seq_length,), dtype='int32')
embedding = Embedding(input_dim=len(word_index)+1, output_dim=EMBEDDING_DIM,
                     weights=[embedding_matrix], mask_zero=True)(inputs)
flatten = Flatten()(embedding)
dense1 = Dense(units=HIDDEN_UNITS, activation='relu')(flatten)
dense2 = Dense(units=len(vocab), activation='softmax')(dense1)
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=dense2)

# Compile model
optimizer = optimizers.Adam()
loss = 'categorical_crossentropy'
metrics = ['accuracy']
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=metrics)

# Fit model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(padded_seqs, sequences, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
y_train = to_categorical(y_train)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test)
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=NUM_EPOCHS, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
                   validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=VERBOSE)
```            

In this code example, `wv_model` refers to a pretrained word embedding model such as Google News or GloVe. You can replace it with any suitable word embedding model provided by the gensim package. The hyperparameters `HIDDEN_UNITS`, `EMBEDDING_DIM`, `NUM_EPOCHS`, `BATCH_SIZE`, and `VERBOSE` can be tuned to achieve optimal performance for your specific use case. 


     ## Sequence Labelling with BiLSTM
     ### Introduction 
       Sequence labelling is the task of assigning labels to a sequence of tokens based on their syntactic and semantic properties. One popular technique for solving this task is Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks.

       BiLSTMs are extensions of standard LSTMs that add backward connections to enable inference over longer ranges of temporal context. Unlike regular LSTMs, which propagate information only forward in time, BiLSTMs can efficiently infer information from earlier in the sequence. By combining both forward and backward propagation, BiLSTMs effectively capture the most important aspects of the input sequence without explicitly modeling recurrences in the order of the sequence.
       
       In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to implement a BiLSTM-based sequence labeler using Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras API. 
       
     ### Dataset
       Let's begin by downloading a sample dataset for named entity recognition (NER). We'll use the CoNLL-2003 English dataset, which contains texts annotated with named entities (such as persons, organizations, locations, and expressions of times and dates). The data format follows the BIO schema proposed by Brandeis et al.
