Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest topics in modern technology. It has revolutionized various industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and energy. While its potential for impacting daily life has been shown by its applications in fields like virtual assistants and autonomous vehicles, it also poses a significant challenge for organizations that have not fully embraced AI technologies. One main reason for this gap is the lack of practical guidance on how to adopt and use machine learning (ML) tools effectively within organizational structures. 

To address this issue, several companies are developing new educational programs, such as AI Bootcamps or MOOCs, to train people with expertise in ML techniques. However, these courses only cover the basic concepts and algorithms used in ML. In reality, more complex problems require knowledge beyond what can be learned in traditional courses. Therefore, we propose an approach called "Practical Guide to Machine Learning" (PGTM). The PGTM will guide readers through step-by-step tutorials on applying specific ML methods to real-world scenarios from different domains. Each tutorial will provide clear explanations of the methodology involved, along with code examples and detailed analysis of performance metrics. Additionally, the PGTM will introduce common pitfalls and challenges faced when using ML in enterprise settings. This comprehensive resource should serve as a valuable reference for both experienced and novice data scientists alike who want to apply their skills to solving real-world problems using advanced ML techniques.  

This document is designed to be accessible to anyone with some background in computer science, statistics, mathematics, and business management. We assume readers already have some understanding of ML terminologies, theory, and implementation. Our goal is to help organizations better leverage the power of ML and become more data-driven. We hope our work inspires others to pursue AI careers while demonstrating their commitment to leveraging their collective intelligence to improve their organizations' performance. 


# 2. Background Introduction
In order to understand why AI is so transformative today, it helps to first understand the origins of human intelligence. Before machines could perform tasks like walking and talking, humans had to rely upon pattern recognition and memory. Linguistic cues were important to convey information between individuals, enabling them to communicate efficiently and organize thoughts into coherent sentences. To enable efficient communication, humans developed language structures and grammar systems that made sense to them at the time. Once people became comfortable with standard linguistic conventions, they started building mental models of the world based on observations and experiments. Knowledge was accumulated gradually over generations, until eventually there was enough to develop entire cultures with shared ideas, customs, and values.

The advent of the digital age changed everything. Computers were quickly becoming capable of performing mathematical calculations, text processing, and logical thinking. Companies began experimenting with new ways of harnessing computers to solve challenging problems. Early attempts included search engines like Google and World Wide Web, image recognition software like Amazon's photo tagging system, and speech recognition software like Apple's Siri. These products transformed the way we interacted with each other and with the internet. Eventually, businesses realized that these technologies could be applied to many areas beyond just searching and browsing, leading to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). 

Machine learning (ML) refers to a subset of AI where a program learns to recognize patterns and make predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Unlike traditional programming, which requires explicit instructions, ML focuses on analyzing large amounts of data automatically and improving accuracy over time. It enables a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, predictive analytics, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars. Today, ML is playing a central role in industry, providing tremendous value across all industries.

However, implementing effective ML solutions requires careful planning, design, and execution. Organizations need to carefully consider whether they actually need ML in their current situation before investing heavily in development efforts. If the project fails to deliver tangible benefits or results, then the investment may not be worthwhile. In addition, managing ML projects requires sophisticated technical resources, as well as dedicated subject matter experts in the relevant domain. For example, if you're working in the financial services sector, you'll need to have deep knowledge of economics, accounting, risk management, and finance, among other specialized disciplines. Similarly, if your organization deals with medical imaging, you may need specialist radiologists or pathologists to evaluate patient images. Overall, proper planning, coordination, and governance of ML projects is crucial to ensuring success.

Without a practical guide, organizations often face numerous challenges when attempting to implement ML solutions. They might spend years designing and testing an algorithm but ultimately give up because the implementation process is too complicated or expensive. Alternatively, they may embark on an ML project just to realize that the problem isn't really solvable by ML and turn it into a misunderstanding about the nature of AI. Despite these obstacles, AI continues to evolve rapidly and organizations must continually adapt and learn how to use its powerful capabilities to achieve the greatest possible value.
