        Natural language processing (NLP) is a field that involves computers understanding and manipulating human languages to perform tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval. In this article, we will be discussing different tokenization techniques used for natural language processing, including word-level tokenization, subword-level tokenization, sentence-level tokenization, and document-level tokenization. We will also provide an overview of the popular open source libraries and tools for performing these tokenizations in Python. 
        

        ## Understanding Terminology and Basic Concepts in NLP
        Before diving into technical details about tokenization techniques, it's important to understand the basic concepts behind them and their terminology. 

        ### Tokens 
        Tokens represent individual units of text such as words, punctuation marks, numbers, and other characters that make up natural language data. When we tokenize our input data, we split it into smaller parts called tokens which can then be processed by machines more easily. There are several types of tokens: 

          - Word level tokens
            These tokens correspond to the smallest meaningful unit of language. For example, "The" in English, "le" in French, and "la" in Spanish are all considered separate words and should each be treated separately when tokenizing a piece of text.

          - Subword level tokens
            These tokens are derived from larger word-like tokens. They may be shorter than full words but contain enough information to enable efficient modeling. Examples include byte pair encoding, which breaks down words into variable-length subwords based on character n-grams, transformers models using attention mechanism, and neural language models.
          
          - Sentence level tokens
            These tokens generally refer to complete paragraphs, independent clauses within a paragraph, or even individual phrases within a clause.

         - Document level tokens
           These tokens represent entire documents or texts. These could be represented as single strings concatenated together without any delimiters, or they could be saved in their original format alongside their corresponding metadata, allowing us to retrieve and process them later if needed. 


        ### Vocabulary Size vs Embedding Vector Length
        Another crucial concept in NLP is vocabulary size, which refers to the number of unique terms present in a corpus. As the size of our vocabulary increases, so does the dimensionality of our embedding vectors. It becomes difficult to learn relationships between pairs of words without introducing redundant dimensions, leading to increased computational complexity and reduced performance. However, high dimensional embeddings can capture more complex relationships between words, making them useful for downstream tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition. Hence, it's essential to balance the tradeoff between vocabulary size and vector length while training embedding models.

        ### Stemming and Lemmatization
        Both stemming and lemmatization are processes that convert words to their base form. The main difference between the two lies in how they handle suffixes and prefixes. While stemmers only remove common endings like 'ed' or 'ing', lemmatizers identify the root forms of words by following morphological rules and use them throughout the rest of the process. 

        For instance, consider the phrase "running", where both stemming and lemmatization could produce "run". On the other hand, lemmatization would correctly identify "runs" as the root form of the verb "run," while stemming might miss this important detail.


        ### Stop Word Removal
        Stop words are those commonly occurring words in most modern languages such as "the", "and", "of", etc., which do not carry much semantic meaning. These words can add noise to our data and distort our insights, so it's important to exclude them before further processing.

        ## Tokenization Techniques in Detail
        Now that we've covered the fundamental concepts behind tokenization, let's dive deeper into various tokenization techniques. We'll cover four primary techniques: word-level, subword-level, sentence-level, and document-level tokenization.

        ## Word-Level Tokenization
        In word-level tokenization, each input text is broken down into its constituent words, punctuation marks, and other symbols, resulting in a sequence of words. Common applications include information retrieval systems, topic modelling algorithms, and text summarization tools. Here's how it works step by step:

       **Step 1:** Splitting Text into Characters
       Firstly, we start by splitting the given text into its constituent characters. Let's assume we want to tokenize the following sentence: 
       `"I am learning NLP."`
       
       After converting it to lowercase letters and removing spaces, we get:
       `['i','', 'a','m','','l','e','a','r','n','i','n','g','', 'n','l','p','.']`

       **Step 2:** Identifying Word Boundaries
       Next, we identify where the boundaries between words lie. We can do this by iterating through the list of characters and checking whether the current character is alphanumeric. If it is, we move on to the next character until we reach another non-alphanumeric character. At this point, we mark the starting index of the current word and continue to check subsequent characters until we find the ending index of the current word. 

       Continuing our example, here's what happens during this process:
       
       1. Starting at index 0, we encounter 'i'. Since 'i' is alphanumeric, we set the starting index of the first word as 0 and continue to iterate. Our current state now looks like:

           `[('i', 0)]`

       2. We move on to the second character,''. Since this is not alphanumeric, we know the current word has ended and update our state accordingly. Our updated state now looks like:

           `[('i', 0), (' ', 2)]`

       3. We move on to the third character, 'a'. Since 'a' is alphanumeric, we add it to our current word and continue iteration. Our state now looks like:

           `[('i', 0), (' ', 2), ('a', 3)]`

       4. We keep going until we reach the last character '.' at index 16. Once again, since '.' is not alphanumeric, we update our state and record the current word. Our final state looks like:

           `[('i', 0), (' ', 2), ('a', 3), ('m', 4), (' ', 5), ('l', 6), ('e', 7), ('a', 8), ('r', 9), ('n', 10), ('i', 11), ('n', 12), ('g', 13), (' ', 14), ('n', 15), ('l', 16), ('p', 17)]`

       5. Finally, we return the list of tuples representing our tokenized output, where each tuple contains the token itself and its starting position in the original string. Our final output is:

           [('i', 0), (' ', 2), ('a', 3), ('m', 4), (' ', 5), ('l', 6), ('e', 7), ('a', 8), ('r', 9), ('n', 10), ('i', 11), ('n', 12), ('g', 13), (' ', 14), ('n', 15), ('l', 16), ('p', 17)]

        Note that this technique treats hyphenated words as separate entities. To treat them as part of the same word, we can modify the above algorithm slightly by checking for hyphens as well after identifying word boundaries.


       ## Subword-Level Tokenization
       Subword-level tokenization is a type of word segmentation method that aims to generate tokens that preserve the meaning of the original words. Unlike traditional methods that segment words into morphemes, subword-level tokenization generates multiple representations of the same underlying word based on constraints defined by n-gram statistics. One major advantage of this approach over standard n-grams is that it allows for greater flexibility in handling rare words and achieves better accuracy compared to simpler methods like bag-of-words or TF-IDF.

       Here's how subword-level tokenization works step by step:

       
       **Step 1:** Extract N-Grams 
       We begin by extracting n-grams from the input text. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n consecutive words in a sentence. For example, consider the sentence "machine learning" and k=3. Using this value, we extract the three-grams from the text, which are "mac", "ach", "che", "hem", "emi", "mil", "lin", "ing":

             mac   ach   che
             hem   emi   mil
             lin   ing  

      **Step 2:** Generate All Possible Segmentations 
      From the extracted n-grams, we create a candidate list of possible segmentations. Each candidate segmentation represents a subset of the extracted n-grams that can potentially form valid tokens. For example, given the candidates ["mac ach", "ach che"], we would generate possible segmentation sets:

           ["mac ach", "ach che"]
           ["mac ", "ach che"]
           ["ac ", "ch c"]



       **Step 3:** Score Candidate Segmentations Based on Constraints
       To decide which segments to keep, we score each candidate segmentation based on certain constraints. These constraints define certain patterns that we expect to appear in real-world text, such as affixation markers ("-ing" and "-ly") or inflectional affixes ("e", "s", "ing"). Scoring is typically done using statistical criteria such as mutual information scores or edit distance metrics.


       **Step 4:** Select Best Segmentation Set
       Depending on the specific application, we select a particular segmentation set that maximizes the overall metric score. In many cases, this means selecting the candidate set that produces the longest sequences of actual words with no overlap. Once selected, we assign labels to each segment according to their role in the original word, such as initial consonants, vowels, syllables, and digits.




       ## Sentence-Level Tokenization
       Sentence-level tokenization splits the input text into coherent sentences. The goal of sentence-level tokenization is to allow for efficient processing of large amounts of unstructured text by enabling efficient indexing and querying across sentences. Here's how sentence-level tokenization works step by step:

       **Step 1:** Split Input Text into Sentences
       We begin by breaking the input text into its constituent sentences. In order to achieve this, we typically follow simple rules that assume sentences are separated by periods (.), exclamation points (!), question marks (?), or interrogative particles like "however". For example, let's assume we want to tokenize the following multi-sentence paragraph:

              Sentence 1: Hello! How are you today?
              Sentence 2: Goodbye. Nice talking to you.
              Sentence 3: Thanks for coming to my talk. What was your favorite subject?

       We break it down into its sentences as follows:

               ['Hello!', 'How are you today?', 'Goodbye.', 'Nice talking to you.', 'Thanks for coming to my talk.', 'What was your favorite subject?']
       
       **Step 2:** Label Each Sentence
       We label each sentence as belonging either to the beginning, middle, or end of a document. Specifically, we tag each sentence with "start", "middle", or "end" depending on its position relative to the rest of the document.

       Continuing our example, the tagged sentences look like:

               [(Sent_1,'start'), (Sent_2,'middle'), (Sent_3,'middle')]
       

       **Step 3:** Concatenate Sentences to Form Documents
       Finally, we concatenate adjacent sentences with the same label to form the respective documents.

       Continuing our example, we obtain two documents:

                 Doc_1 = "Hello! How are you today?"
                 Doc_2 = "Nice talking to you. Thanks for coming to my talk. What was your favorite subject?"
                 
               
       ## Document-Level Tokenization
       Document-level tokenization is essentially concatenation of all sentences in a document. It retains the advantages of sentence-level tokenization while avoiding its limitations. Despite its simplicity, however, document-level tokenization can still offer significant improvements in efficiency and scalability due to the absence of sentence structure, stop words, punctuations, case differences, and abbreviations.
