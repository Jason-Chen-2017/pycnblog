# 1.简介
         
2019年，深度学习正在成为一个热门话题。而现有的深度学习框架种类繁多，对于初级到高级开发者来说选择合适的框架并不容易。这个时候，各大公司、研究机构都在探索更加科学、易用的深度学习框架，来提升研发效率、降低门槛、缩短项目周期等诸多优点。本文将介绍几种常用深度学习框架，并从功能、性能、应用三个方面进行评价，帮助读者了解这些框架背后的原理及其设计思想。
         
       # 2. Software Library Types: 
       1. Frameworks: These are typically high-level abstractions that encapsulate a variety of lower-level components like layers of neural networks or optimization algorithms. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Caffe, etc. Each framework has its own advantages and disadvantages, but they share some common principles and design patterns that can help improve their usability.
       
          A good example is Tensorflow’s ability to perform automatic differentiation using graphs and backpropagation. This feature allows developers to define complex mathematical computations as simple operations on tensors, which makes it easy to write complex machine learning models without having to worry about low-level details such as memory management or data parallelism. However, this feature comes at a cost since it adds overhead to computation time and requires special knowledge about how the system works. Other popular frameworks also offer similar features, such as PyTorch's autograd package, MXNet’s symbolic API, and Keras' built-in training loop.
          
       2. Libraries: These are low-level packages that contain specialized implementations of various machine learning algorithms. The main advantage of these libraries is that they allow developers to focus on higher-level concerns such as model construction, data preprocessing, and fine-tuning hyperparameters. However, the downside is that the user must implement all necessary primitives themselves, including linear algebra routines, numerical optimizations, and GPU acceleration. Common examples of machine learning libraries include Scikit-learn, TensorFlow-Slim, and Lasagne.
       
       3. Tools: These are command line tools or graphical interfaces designed specifically for developing and optimizing deep learning models. Examples include TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, and Netron. While these tools can greatly simplify the process of experimentation and debugging, they may not be suitable for everyday development tasks because they require expertise in machine learning and programming.
       
       4. Bots: Finally, there are chatbots that use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assist users with creating, deploying, and monitoring deep learning systems. Some examples include Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, and DialogFlow. These bots work by understanding spoken queries from end users, translating them into commands and parameters for a cloud service, then executing those commands to return results.
        
       5. Summary: There are many different types of software libraries, frameworks, and tools used to develop deep learning models. It’s essential to choose the right one based on your needs and preferences, while considering both functionalities and technical constraints. For instance, if you need highly customizable features, a low-level library might be better suited than an abstraction layer like TensorFlow. Similarly, if you prefer greater control over your hardware resources, consider writing directly against the underlying libraries instead of relying on higher-level APIs. Overall, the choice between frameworks, libraries, and tools depends on personal preference, team culture, and the specific requirements of the project.
