## 2.1 数据集
A dataset is a collection of related data items, usually stored in a computer system or database, which may include both categorical and numerical variables. A typical example of a dataset is a table of sales transactions, where each row represents a sale and columns contain details like date, customer name, product ID, quantity sold, etc. There are several ways to store and organize data in databases, ranging from flat files to hierarchical structures like relational databases, NoSQL databases, and object stores. A few important considerations while choosing a dataset for master data management include size, complexity, variability, and relevance.
## 2.2 属性（Attribute）
An attribute is a measurable property or characteristic of an item, which provides information about its identity, purpose, structure, behavior, or context. Attributes typically describe entities like people, organizations, products, places, events, or concepts, and are generally classified into two categories - descriptive attributes and quantitative attributes. Descriptive attributes capture characteristics such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email IDs, or job titles; while quantitative attributes measure values like age, salary, income, time elapsed since an event occurred, or amount spent on a transaction. Examples of descriptive attributes in a dataset could be “customer name”, “address”, “city” etc.; whereas quantitative attributes might be “age”, “revenue” etc.
## 2.3 观测值（Observations）
An observation refers to a single instance of data, represented in tabular form. Each observation contains multiple values corresponding to different attributes. For example, if we have a dataset containing information about customers, each observation would represent a specific customer and would consist of multiple values such as his/her name, address, phone number, email ID, purchase history, recent transactions, etc.
## 2.4 样本（Sample）
A sample is a subset of observations taken from a larger dataset. Sampling strategies involve selecting a random subset of records from a given population, stratified sampling, deterministic sampling, cluster sampling, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques like bag-of-words model. Sampling can be done either before or after cleaning the dataset, depending upon the requirements of the analysis at hand.
## 2.5 特征（Feature）
A feature is a variable that can affect the outcome of a predictive model. Features can be categorized into four main types - input features, output features, intermediate features, and hidden features. Input features define the independent variables involved in building a model, while output features specify the dependent variable(s) of interest. Intermediate features are produced during the training phase of the model, while hidden features are not directly observable but contribute indirectly to the prediction accuracy.
## 2.6 目标变量（Target Variable）
The target variable is the variable whose value needs to be predicted. Target variables can be discrete or continuous, ordinal or categorical, positive or negative, or monotonic or non-monotonic. Discrete target variables take a fixed set of values, whereas continuous target variables represent a range of values. Ordinal variables assign a ranking to the observed values, while categorical variables group similar values together. Positive and negative targets indicate the direction towards which the variable's values grow, while monotonic and non-monotonic targets impose constraints on the growth pattern.
## 2.7 类别（Class）
A class is a category assigned to a particular instance or set of instances based on certain criteria. Classes can be binary, multiclass, or multi-label. Binary classes only have two possible values, while multiclass classes have more than two possible values, while multi-label classes can have zero or more labels associated with them.
## 2.8 模型（Model）
A model is an algorithm that uses statistical techniques to estimate the parameters of a mathematical function that maps inputs to outputs. Models can be trained using labeled data to learn the underlying structure of the data and make accurate predictions. Popular models in master data management include logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks.

## 3.1 Text Analysis
Text analysis is a technique used to extract valuable insights from unstructured text data such as emails, social media posts, web pages, online reviews, customer feedbacks, survey responses, and other documents. It involves mining the content of texts and identifying patterns, relationships, and trends that can help determine whether an individual’s opinions or intentions align with organizational goals or brand perception. Common text analysis tasks include keyword search, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, document classification, concept tagging, topic modeling, and community detection. These techniques allow businesses to analyze and interpret mass amounts of unstructured data and generate actionable intelligence to improve decision-making processes and deliver targeted marketing campaigns.

### 3.1.1 Keyword Search
One of the most basic yet effective text analysis approaches is keyword search. Keyword searching involves finding relevant keywords or phrases in textual data by examining words or sentences and looking for matches against a predefined list of terms. Word embeddings are commonly used in keyword search applications because they enable the system to compare word meaning and identify semantic similarity between words. Once a match is found, additional metadata about the matched term, such as location, context, and importance, can be extracted through further analysis.

### 3.1.2 Spam Filtering
Another essential component of text analysis is spam filtering, which helps detect and remove unwanted messages or advertisements from incoming emails, social media feeds, and other messaging platforms. To achieve this goal, spam filters use advanced techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, and big data analytics. Filters train on a known set of spam messages and look for patterns in legitimate messages that correlate with spam messages. If there is a match, the message can be tagged as spam and removed from the platform. Other methods for spam filtering include regular expressions, signatures, and antivirus software.

### 3.1.3 Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is another crucial aspect of text analysis that measures the attitude or opinion of an individual towards a subject, product, service, or topic. Researchers have developed sophisticated algorithms to automatically classify sentiments of tweets, movie reviews, hotel reviews, and other user-generated text. Systems often employ lexicons or dictionaries of human-annotated data to map words and phrases to sentiment scores. Different approaches include rule-based systems, naïve Bayesian classifiers, deep learning models, and ensemble learning methods.

### 3.1.4 Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition is the task of identifying and categorizing named entities mentioned in text. Entities can be organizations, persons, locations, times, products, or other objects. NER algorithms recognize named entities by matching keywords to predefined lists of terms and establishing rules for identifying boundaries between different parts of speech. They then annotate text segments with appropriate tags indicating the type of entity identified.

### 3.1.5 Document Classification
Document classification involves assigning a label or category to a piece of text based on its contents. Classifiers train on a labeled dataset of pre-classified documents and apply learned patterns to new documents to infer their categories. Approaches vary widely across domains, including text classification, topic modeling, and spam filtering.

### 3.1.6 Concept Tagging
Concept tagging involves annotating text with descriptive terms that correspond to a particular topic, idea, or feeling. Techniques for concept tagging include keyword spotting, stemming, part-of-speech taggers, and dependency parsing. They help analysts to locate and capture important ideas and themes, allowing them to easily navigate and filter large volumes of unstructured data.

### 3.1.7 Topic Modeling
Topic modeling involves grouping related words and phrases into abstract topics that represent a conceptual unit of analysis. Technologies for topic modeling include Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM). LDA generates sets of latent topics that capture semantic relationships between words, enabling analysts to examine variations and trends across different groups of texts. DTM extends LDA by incorporating temporal and spatial contexts of the data points, enabling analysts to capture dynamics and nonlinearities.

### 3.1.8 Community Detection
Community detection is the identification of dense clusters of nodes in a network or graph, representing communities that share common interests or preferences. Techniques for community detection include spectral clustering, modularity optimization, graph partitioning algorithms, and probabilistic graphical models. Community detection enables analysts to identify and segment the attention areas of large social media audiences, opportunities for personalization, and recommendations for collaborative projects.

## 3.2 Social Media Analysis
Social media analysis involves gathering and analyzing data generated by users on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr. Analyses focus on identifiable patterns and trends that emerge from interactions between individuals and their followers. Techniques include social media scraping, sentiment analysis, persona profiling, and content analysis. Scraping involves collecting public data from websites or APIs and storing it in a central repository. Sentiment analysis identifies positive and negative aspects of text posted on social media, enabling businesses to gauge public opinion and respond accordingly. Persona profiling involves creating fictional characters to mimic popular personalities on social media platforms and engaging users with interactive content. Content analysis involves evaluating the tone, style, and quality of posts shared on social media, allowing businesses to identify friction points and optimize posting strategy.

## 3.3 Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms
Modern business intelligence and analytics platforms collect and organize large amounts of data, providing real-time access to critical business intelligence and decision-support tools. They offer integrated cloud-based dashboards, business intelligence reports, and analytics tools that empower organizations to leverage data for greater insight and control over their business. Popular platforms include Tableau, QlikSense, Microsoft Power BI, SAP BW, and Google BigQuery.

## 3.4 Event Extraction
Event extraction involves identifying significant occurrences in an unstructured text corpus and associating them with specific entities, activities, or actions. Algorithms for event extraction include rule-based systems, deep learning models, and sequence labeling techniques. Rule-based systems rely on manually defined rules or templates to find instances of potential events. Deep learning models use neural networks to automatically identify patterns in text and learn from annotated data. Sequence labeling assigns a label to every token in a sequence according to the sequential order, allowing analysts to identify sequences of related events such as cases and emails.

## 3.5 Relationship Extraction
Relationship extraction is the process of linking pairs of entities to form relationships among them. Applications of relationship extraction include question answering, entity resolution, and record linkage. Question answering involves resolving questions posed by users by identifying missing or ambiguous entities and connecting them to existing ones. Entity resolution involves identifying overlapping entries in different data sources and combining them to create consistent records. Record linkage involves comparing fields in different records to verify the authenticity of links.

## 3.6 Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection involves identifying abnormal behaviors in data that deviate significantly from expected patterns. Algorithms for anomaly detection include principal component analysis (PCA), isolation forest, and mean shift clustering. PCA explores the variance in data along dimensions and identifies outliers that do not fit normal distribution. Isolation forest builds an ensemble of decision trees and tests each point against all trees to isolate those that behave differently. Mean shift clustering partitions data into regions around centroids, reducing the need for specifying the number of clusters explicitly.

## 3.7 Graph Visualization
Visualizing graphs can provide rich visual representations of complex relationships among entities, events, and activities. Common visualization libraries for graphs include Matplotlib, NetworkX, and Gephi. Matplotlib is a simple plotting library that allows developers to customize plots and add annotations. NetworkX is a Python package designed for working with complex networks, supporting many standard graph algorithms. Gephi is an open source tool that supports importing and analyzing large networks and includes powerful layout algorithms for optimizing the display of large graphs.

# 4.主题模型（Topic Modeling）
Topic modeling is a natural language processing technique that automates the process of discovery of latent topics in text collections. Given a set of documents, topic modeling algorithms break down the documents into a small set of representative words called "topics", which highlight the salient features of the documents' content. Topics are organized in a hierarchy, with broader topics consisting of more fine-grained subtopics. By exploring the relationships between topics, analysts can derive insights into the structure and content of the corpus. 

## 4.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
LDA is a generative probabilistic topic model that interprets a collection of documents as a mixture of distinct topics, each with a probability distribution over a vocabulary of terms. The model starts by randomly initializing the distribution of topics for each document, and then iteratively updates the distributions until convergence. LDA applies a variational inference algorithm to approximate the joint probability of the document under consideration and the topic assignments. The algorithm takes advantage of the fact that each document can be seen as a mixture of topics and performs posterior inference efficiently.

## 4.2 Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
NMF is a decomposition method that factors a matrix into three components: the basis vectors (which are also referred to as "latent features"), the coefficients for the basis vectors, and the residual error. NMF tries to preserve the magnitude of the original matrix elements and minimize the Frobenius norm difference between the reconstructed matrix and the original matrix. NMF is widely used in image and audio processing, recommender systems, and bioinformatics applications.

## 4.3 Dynamic Topic Modeling (DPM)
DPM is a variation of LDA that captures both temporal and spatial dependencies in the data using dynamic modeling techniques. DPM treats each document as a trajectory over a time period, taking into account changes in topic proportions over time and space. The algorithm estimates the probability of observing new documents given past data and previous settings of the hyperparameters.

# 5.情感分析（Sentiment Analysis）
Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying the attitude or emotion behind a piece of text, typically expressed in a variety of forms such as freeform text, formal language, or social media comments. Traditional sentiment analysis techniques attempt to identify the underlying emotional valence of text by applying linguistic cues such as positive, negative, neutral, and strong modifiers. However, recent advances in deep learning have led to breakthroughs in sentiment analysis.

## 5.1 Rule-Based Systems
Rule-based systems fall under the traditional approach to sentiment analysis where rules or heuristics are defined to score the degree of positivity or negativity of a sentence. These systems work by defining a series of if-then statements that test for common patterns or idioms, followed by numerical scoring functions to calculate the likelihood of the sentence being positive, negative, or neutral.

## 5.2 Naïve Bayes Classifier
Naïve Bayes classifier is a classic algorithm for sentiment analysis that relies on Bayes’ theorem to compute the probabilities of different sentiments. Naïve Bayes requires prior knowledge of the frequency of certain words or n-grams appearing in a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. It is sensitive to rare or informative features, however, which makes it less suitable for microblogging data.

## 5.3 Deep Learning Models
Deep learning models have made major progress in sentiment analysis by introducing complex architectures that learn high-level features from raw text. Some popular deep learning models for sentiment analysis include convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM. CNNs perform text classification by scanning over the text sequentially and capturing local features using filters. LSTMs operate on sequences of data to capture temporal dependencies in the text and maintain a hidden state through backpropagation. Bidirectional LSTM can combine forward and backward pass features to capture longer-range dependencies.

## 5.4 Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods combine multiple models to produce better results than any single model alone. They can be combined using majority vote, weighted average, or stacking. Majority vote selects the mode of the predicted labels from all the models. Weighted average gives higher weight to the confident models, effectively aggregating their predictions. Stacking combines the outputs of multiple layers of base models by feedforward propagation, followed by backward propagation to adjust the weights of each layer.

# 6.命名实体识别（Named Entity Recognition）
Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and categorizing named entities in text. Entities can be organizations, persons, locations, times, products, or other objects. Traditional NER systems use dictionaries of common English words to identify entities, but modern NER systems leverage machine learning techniques to achieve higher precision.

## 6.1 Rule-Based Systems
Rule-based systems identify entities by testing for predetermined patterns or idioms in the text. Predefined patterns or idioms can be based on expert knowledge or linguistic features such as capital letters following nouns. Rule-based systems are fast, reliable, and easy to implement but lack inductive bias and sensitivity to domain-specific patterns.

## 6.2 Statistical Machine Learning
Statistical machine learning models such as CRFs, HMMs, and conditional random fields (CRF) exploit statistical regularities in the data to identify entities. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are specifically designed for sequence labelling problems and can handle arbitrarily complex entity structures. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) assume a markov chain of hidden states and transition probabilities to label tokens. HMMs can be used for POS tagging, chunking, and ner.

## 6.3 Neural Networks
Neural networks have been shown to be particularly effective in recognizing named entities. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be used for sequence labelling tasks, which require modeling of sequential dependencies in the data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in image classification tasks. Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used for structured data, such as relation extraction and sentiment analysis.

# 7.社群检测（Community Detection）
Community detection is the problem of finding dense clusters in complex networks or graphs. Clustering techniques like k-means or spectral clustering divide the vertices into clusters based on their similarity or distance. Communities refer to groups of vertices that tend to interact frequently, communicate frequently, and form tight connections within the group. Several algorithms exist for community detection, including spectral clustering, modularity optimization, and stochastic blockmodels.

## 7.1 Spectral Clustering
Spectral clustering is a popular unsupervised clustering algorithm that uses the eigenvectors of the normalized laplacian of the adjacency matrix of the graph to separate the data into different clusters. Eigendecomposition of the adjacency matrix reveals the dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which correspond to the largest and second largest eigenvectors respectively. These eigenvectors encode the structure of the graph, revealing the clusters and separating the vertices.

## 7.2 Modularity Optimization
Modularity optimization is an algorithm that finds the best division of the vertices into communities based on the module criterion, which measures the modularity of the split into modules. It balances the density of intra-community edges with the diversity of inter-community edges. The modularity score is calculated as the ratio of the increase in the objective function due to the split versus that caused by a null split.

## 7.3 Stochastic Blockmodel
Stochastic blockmodel is a probabilistic model for graphs where nodes belong to blocks that are assumed to be iid according to a membership block distribution. The community structure of the graph is inferred by maximizing the mutual information between node and block assignments. Variants of the model can include overlapping communities and nested communities.

# 8.事件抽取（Event Extraction）
Event extraction is the process of identifying significant occurrences in an unstructured text corpus and associating them with specific entities, activities, or actions. Techniques for event extraction include rule-based systems, deep learning models, and sequence labeling techniques.

## 8.1 Rule-Based Systems
Rule-based systems rely on manually defined patterns or templates to identify potential events. Rules for identifying events can be based on dictionary lookups or specialized linguistic constructs, such as passive voice constructions and copulas. Rule-based systems are slow and inflexible, requiring dedicated training and tuning for each application scenario.

## 8.2 Statistical Models
Statistical models such as CRFs, HMMs, and LSTM can identify events in text by modeling the relations between words and labels. CRFs are specifically designed for sequence labelling problems and can handle arbitrarily complex event structures. HMMs assume a markov chain of hidden states and transition probabilities to label tokens. LSTM can capture temporal dependencies in the data and retain a hidden state throughout the course of the event.

## 8.3 Deep Learning Models
Deep learning models have recently gained prominence in event extraction by introducing complex architectures that learn high-level features from raw text. Some popular deep learning models for event extraction include convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and tree-based models. CNNs perform event detection by scanning over the text sequentially and capturing local features using filters. LSTM can capture temporal dependencies in the data and retain a hidden state throughout the course of the event. Tree-based models build a parse tree representation of the text and propagate events upwards and backwards through the tree to obtain global semantics.

# 9.关系抽取（Relationship Extraction）
Relationship extraction is the task of identifying and describing the interconnectedness of entities and their relationships. Relationships can span across different sources, such as news articles, social media posts, medical documents, and scientific papers. Relationship extraction techniques can capture various levels of granularity, ranging from pairwise relationships to multi-relational events.

## 9.1 Text Mining Patterns
Text mining patterns involve general principles that can be used to mine relationships from unstructured text. Many techniques rely on patterns involving pronoun coreference, conjunctions, coordination, tense markers, and wh-phrases. Pronoun coreference refers to the occurrence of multiple mentions of the same entity in the same sentence. Conjunctions connect clauses and suggest a causal relationship between the clauses. Coordination suggests the existence of multiple entities linked by a coordinating verb. Tense markers modify verbs to indicate the time or cause of an event. Wh-phrases introduce questions or relative clauses and describe the properties of the preceding clause.

## 9.2 Structured Prediction
Structured prediction is a machine learning paradigm that consists of developing a model that produces a predicted sequence of symbols or labels for a given input sequence. Relationship extraction can be treated as a sequence labeling problem, where the input is a sequence of words and the output is a sequence of labels representing the roles played by entities in the relationship. Standard machine learning algorithms can be used for structured prediction, including neural networks, boosting, and maximum entropy.

## 9.3 Knowledge Bases
Knowledge bases contain structured information about entities, their attributes, relationships, and events. They serve as a reference resource for entity disambiguation, relation extraction, and event extraction. Knowledge bases can be queried to retrieve entity descriptions and their relationships, and rules can be written to identify event triggers and arguments.

# 10.异常检测（Anomaly Detection）
Anomaly detection is the task of identifying abnormal or suspicious observations or events in data. Anomalies can range from minor fluctuations or errors to intentionally malicious attacks. Traditional anomaly detection techniques use statistical measures such as z-scores or thresholding to identify sudden spikes or drops in the data.

## 10.1 Point Process Approach
The point process approach is a statistical framework for modeling point processes, which are processes that involve a stationary distribution of points and generating arrivals at any point within a certain time interval. Anomalous points can be detected using kernel density estimation, which calculates the probability density of the data at each point and returns a ranked list of the most anomalous points. Alternatively, methods like Granger causality can be used to identify causal relationships between signals and isolate the signal responsible for an anomaly.

## 10.2 Autoencoder Approach
The autoencoder approach is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the input data into a lower dimensional space and learns the intrinsic structure of the data. Anomalies in the data can be identified by identifying low-dimensional patterns that are hard to reconstruct. Similarity metrics such as cosine similarity and KL divergence can be used to evaluate the distance between low-dimensional embeddings and the original data.

## 10.3 DBSCAN Algorithm
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that infers clusters from the density of points surrounding a core point. Points that are closely packed together form a cluster, and points that lie far away from each other do not belong to any cluster. Outliers are points that cannot be assigned to any cluster.
