### 原文摘要
Personalization is critical to enhance the customer experience in e-commerce platforms. However, current recommendation systems for fashion are limited and do not consider personal preferences, such as clothing styles, patterns, colors, and textures. In this paper, we present Amazon Personalize, an end-to-end solution that uses machine learning techniques to provide personalized recommendations for customers based on their past purchase history, behavioral data, and demographic information. We conduct a case study to demonstrate how Amazon Personalize can be used to enhance the customer experience with fashion products. The results show that Amazon Personalize can generate personalized recommendations within seconds and improve the overall shopping experience by up to 17% compared to traditional methods. Overall, our work presents a novel approach to personalizing e-commerce applications using artificial intelligence (AI) and highlights the importance of considering individual customer preferences in designing recommendation systems for fashion retailers.

## ABSTRACT
With the increasing popularity of e-commerce platforms, customers' purchasing decisions have become more influenced by automated recommenders powered by machine learning algorithms. One of these famous examples is Amazon's "Personalized Fashion" system, which provides personalized recommendations for consumers based on their past purchases, ratings, and reviews, alongside contextual factors such as seasonality or product trends. This article will discuss Amazon's Personalized Fashion recommendation system through a case study to give readers a comprehensive understanding of its application in the field of personalized fashion. Specifically, we will first review key concepts and terminology related to recommender systems and personalization. Next, we will explain the basic architecture and principles behind Amazon Personalize, followed by detailed explanations of each component and algorithm used in Amazon Personalize. Finally, we will conduct a case study to evaluate Amazon Personalize's performance on enhancing the customer experience with fashion products, and compare it with traditional approaches like cold start and content-based filtering. Our findings suggest that Amazon Personalize can significantly improve both the speed and accuracy of providing personalized recommendations for customers, while also satisfying different user preferences based on their style preferences. By leveraging recent advancements in deep learning and natural language processing technologies, Amazon Personalize demonstrates its ability to accurately predict future behaviors of users and deliver accurate and relevant recommendations to them at scale. Lastly, we hope that our research will inspire other organizations to explore the potential of applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques towards improving the customer experience in e-commerce platforms, particularly when it comes to the fashion industry.
