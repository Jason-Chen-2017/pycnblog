Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful tool for solving complex problems by imitating the behavior of human learners or animals. Despite its importance, however, there has been relatively little work on developing effective methods for balancing exploration and exploitation within RL algorithms. With the increasing complexity of modern games and applications, challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and slow convergence are becoming more apparent. 

To address this problem, researchers have proposed several techniques, including:

1. Epsilon-greedy Policy: This policy selects random actions with probability ε (epsilon), while selecting optimal actions otherwise. It encourages exploration but limits overfitting due to the exploration-exploitation dilemma. 

2. Softmax Action Distribution: Instead of assigning equal probabilities to each available action, the agent assigns varying probabilities based on their value estimates received from the environment. The resulting distribution allows the agent to explore different parts of the state space independently and make better decisions. 

3. Prioritized Experience Replay: This algorithm stores samples encountered so far with high priority, which ensures they are sampled more often than low priority samples, leading to improved sample diversity. Additionally, this method can improve stability and decrease variance in deep RL algorithms.

However, all these techniques require careful consideration of hyperparameters, such as ε, beta, and alpha, to ensure good performance. Furthermore, they may not always lead to equally beneficial outcomes depending on the specific problem being solved. To further enhance the ability of RL agents to generalize and adapt to new environments, current approaches typically involve domain randomization, transfer learning, and meta-learning. However, none of these strategies have yet achieved widespread adoption. 

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for balancing exploration and exploitation by combining these three techniques, alongside other advanced techniques such as model-based RL and curiosity driven exploration. Our approach involves adaptive computation of exploration parameters, coupled with an ensemble of multiple diverse policies, which allow the agent to efficiently search the entire state-action space and exploit knowledge learned from previous experiences. We demonstrate our approach using experiments on Atari games, using state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms, and evaluate its effectiveness across a range of tasks.

Exploration and Exploitation (EE) is a fundamental concept in Reinforcement Learning (RL). It refers to the tradeoff between taking actions that result in high rewards versus actions that result in lower reward. During exploratory stages, the agent is free to take actions at any point in the state space, which leads to finding new information about the environment. Conversely, during exploitative stages, the agent relies heavily on previously acquired knowledge to choose actions that yield higher returns. While most RL algorithms rely heavily on exploration to find novel solutions, some techniques have proven successful in avoiding suboptimal policies, even though they still randomly select actions under certain conditions. 

Prior art includes various RL methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Thompson Sampling, and Bayesian RL. These methods use various techniques such as neural networks to estimate expected values of actions, simulated annealing, and heuristic functions to guide the search process. Some of these methods also incorporate features such as eligibility traces and temperature adjustment to encourage exploration. Nevertheless, most prior art either ignore the exploration/exploitation tradeoff altogether or only consider it indirectly through other mechanisms, such as MCTS' selection bias towards child nodes with high visit counts. 

Our technique combines the idea of exploiting what is known beforehand, with exploration to establish new knowledge and achieve superior performance. In particular, we focus on enabling efficient exploration of large spaces, where traditional methods struggle to scale up. Moreover, we aim to solve two related problems: exploration efficiency and slow convergence caused by catastrophic forgetting. To do this, we develop an ensemble of multiple policies that collectively formulate a probabilistic decision-making function. Each individual policy takes in the same input observation, but uses its own set of weights to compute Q-values, indicating both the quality of each action and the level of certainty in making a decision. The agent then chooses the action with the highest average confidence among all policies, leading to exploration that explores many different parts of the state space simultaneously. By doing this, we hope to enable the agent to converge faster, avoid suboptimal policies, and obtain better overall performance.
