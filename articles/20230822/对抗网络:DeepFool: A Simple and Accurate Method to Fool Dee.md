# 1.简介
  

Deep learning is a hot topic in recent years because of its ability to learn complex patterns from data. However, there are still many vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversarial examples generated using the learned models. One such vulnerability is called gradient masking or feature squeezing attacks, which tries to maximize the difference between the class scores on the true input and the corresponding class scores for perturbed inputs with small modifications. Gradient masking attacks have been proposed before, but most of them rely on iterative optimization methods and do not consider multiple layers or features simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new attack method called DeepFool, which takes into account both layers and features simultaneously during optimization process and yields accurate results even for non-convex objective functions. We also present an alternative approach called Random Targeted Adversarial Attack (RTA), which uses randomly selected target classes instead of aiming at specific misclassifications. Overall, our work provides a simple yet effective framework for deep neural network verification and has significant practical value.
# 2.基本概念术语说明
Adversarial example：an example that was specifically designed to fool machine learning algorithms, often intended as a negative training sample, but sometimes used as a positive test case when evaluating security. It consists of slightly modified images that are supposed to deceive computer vision systems.
Deep learning：a type of artificial intelligence technique based on neural networks, where multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and other feedforward neural networks are trained on large datasets to recognize patterns and classify inputs. These networks usually use backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm to adjust their weights to minimize loss function on each iteration. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are two famous types of deep learning models.
Gradient masking attack：the modification of the input image so that it maximizes the difference in classification probabilities between the original image and another image that is similar but slightly modified. This method targets specific sensitive features of the model and does not require any prior knowledge about the dataset distribution.
Feature squeezing attack：another attack method that modifies the image while trying to reduce the activation size of certain layer(s). This typically involves manipulating the pixels of an image until they activate a particular neuron in one or more layers, making it difficult for a classifier to discriminate between the original and perturbed images. The goal of these attacks is to exploit interference caused by noise or occlusion, and the attacker is assumed to have no control over the pixel values directly.
Gradient：the change in the output of a function with respect to small changes in the input. In the context of neural networks, gradients represent how much the output of the network's last layer depends on changing individual weight parameters.
ReLU Activation Function：rectified linear unit (ReLU) is a piecewise linear activation function that outputs the maximum of the input signal and zero for all negative inputs. It works well for handling vanishing gradients, allowing models to learn complex mappings without saturating hidden units.
Backpropagation Through Time（BPTT）：an algorithm used in training neural networks. It involves computing the gradients of error terms with respect to each parameter over several iterations of forward propagation and backward propagation. BPTT helps ensure that the model converges to a global minimum, which prevents it from becoming stuck in local minima.
Objective Function：a function that the neural network aims to minimize during training. For instance, cross entropy is commonly used in classification problems where the labels are discrete integers. Similarly, squared error is commonly used in regression problems where the output is continuous. During testing, the objective function should reflect the same metric being optimized during training, i.e., accuracy in classification tasks or mean square error in regression tasks.
# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
DeepFool is a simple and efficient iterative procedure that attempts to find the smallest number of gradient updates needed to fool a deep neural network. Here is a general outline of the steps involved in DeepFool:

1. Start with the original input x.
2. Define a set of candidate points c = {c_1,..., c_k} where k is the number of classes predicted by the model for the original input x. Let y_i denote the label predicted by the model for input xi after applying step 1. Therefore, c_i = xi + epsilon * sign(-gradient_i) if -gradient_i > 0, else xi - epsilon * sign(gradient_i); where sign() returns the sign of the scalar argument.
3. Evaluate the objective function g(c) defined as follows:
   g(c) = ∑_{i=1}^k ∑_{j=1}^m |f_i(x+c_i)-y_i|/|c_i|^2,
   where m is the number of feature maps in the final convolutional layer, and f_i() represents the output of the i-th filter bank at position j.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a fixed number of iterations is reached. Each iteration performs either constant step length updates or adaptive ones depending on whether the current estimate of the optimal update direction is correct.
5. Choose the candidate point that minimizes the objective function g(c) among the set of candidates constructed earlier. If the chosen candidate point differs significantly from the original input x, then call it a successful adversarial example; otherwise, call it a failure.

The key idea behind DeepFool is to optimize the objective function g(c) in a way that finds the closest point from the set of candidate points to the original input x while taking into account the structure of the deep neural network and considering the effectiveness of modifying different parts of the input simultaneously. Specifically, let δθ represent the vector of L-infinity norm of the differences between the predicted probability vectors p(θ(xi)) and the actual probability vectors p(θ(c)). Then, we want to minimize the following expression:

   g(c) = (1/2)||δθ||^2 + ∑_{l=1}^L ∑_{i=1}^{M_l} ||∇_{θ^{(l)}} J^{(l)}(z^(l))_i||^2 / M_l,
   
where z^(l) = W^(l)φ^(l-1) represents the weighted sum of the previous layer's output φ^(l-1) and the bias b^(l). We iterate over the layers l in reverse order and compute the derivative ∇_{θ^{(l)}} J^{(l)}(z^(l)), where J^{(l)}(.) is the cost function associated with layer l. The first term ensures that the perturbation ε satisfies the constraint ε ≤ η, where η is some small constant. The second term encourages the perturbations to lie inside the decision boundary of the model, thus ensuring that the perturbed image remains valid. 

We can show that this objective function corresponds to a quadratic program that can be solved efficiently using standard optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. Our implementation details will follow shortly.
