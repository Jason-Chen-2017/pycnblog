# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn how to make decisions or actions in response to its environment's feedback. In this article, we will explore some common RL algorithms and provide insights into the mathematical concepts underlying these algorithms. 

The goal of reinforcement learning is to enable agents to optimize their behavior by interacting with an environment while receiving rewards for doing so. The interactions between the agent and the environment can be modelled as Markov Decision Process (MDP), where states represent observations from the environment, actions take the agent from one state to another, and transitions lead deterministically to new states based on certain probabilities. Rewards are received at each step depending on the action taken and the resulting state. Agents then use their experience to update their policies such that they maximize their expected long-term reward over time.

In order to solve complex problems with high levels of complexity, modern deep reinforcement learning techniques have emerged, including AlphaGo, Dota 2, and OpenAI Gym. These advanced techniques leverage artificial neural networks (ANN) and other machine learning techniques to train complex decision-making models that interact with large environments without explicit programmed strategies. This makes them particularly effective for tasks such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, trading, and gaming.

2.RL Algorithm Types:
There are several types of reinforcement learning algorithms, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning to model-free learning to model-based learning. We will briefly discuss the different categories below.

Supervised Learning: Supervised learning involves training an agent using labeled data, i.e., examples of inputs along with their corresponding outputs, known as labels. For example, given images of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels of what digit was shown, an image classifier could be trained using supervised learning methods to recognize new instances of those digits in future images.

Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning involves training an agent using unlabeled data, typically just raw input data. Here, the algorithm learns patterns and correlations in the input data without any prior knowledge of the correct output. One popular application of unsupervised learning is clustering, where the algorithm identifies similarities among data points and groups them together into clusters. Another example is anomaly detection, where the algorithm detects unexpected events or patterns within the input data that do not conform to normal behavior.

Model-Free Learning: Model-free learning refers to reinforcement learning algorithms that don't require a model of the environment. Instead, the agent interacts directly with the environment through its experiences, taking actions and receiving rewards. Examples include Monte Carlo Methods, Temporal Difference Methods, and Q-Learning.

Model-Based Learning: Model-based learning is a hybrid approach combining elements of supervised and model-free learning. Traditional model-based algorithms rely heavily on probabilistic graphical models and mathematical analysis, whereas reinforcement learning algorithms such as Dynamic Programming are simpler but more efficient than traditional model-based approaches.

We will focus our discussion around basic policy gradient algorithms, which fall under model-free learning, such as REINFORCE, PPO, and A2C. Policy gradient algorithms improve upon traditional value function-based methods by incorporating direct interaction with the environment during training, allowing for more flexible exploration behaviors and handling stochastic environments better.

3.Basic Policy Gradient Algorithms
Policy gradient algorithms utilize gradients to update the parameters of the policy function. They work by evaluating the probability of taking actions in each state based on the current policy parameters and estimating the gradient of the logarithm of these probabilities with respect to the policy parameters. By updating the parameters in the direction opposite to the estimated gradient, the policy function can be optimized to maximize the expected return. Here is a brief overview of the main policy gradient algorithms:

REINFORCE: REINFORCE is an on-policy gradient algorithm that estimates the gradient of the discounted sum of rewards obtained when following the current policy. It uses an exponential approximation of the advantage function, making it computationally efficient compared to other off-policy methods like Q-learning. It also works well in high-dimensional environments and is relatively insensitive to hyperparameters. However, due to its dependence on the current policy, it may struggle in sample efficiency if the policy changes significantly from iteration to iteration.

PPO: PPO is a variant of REINFORCE that improves on its performance by introducing two modifications to reduce the variance of the advantage estimator. First, it clips the parameter updates to prevent them from becoming too large, improving stability. Second, it introduces a trust region constraint that encourages the policy to change slowly and avoid oscillations. Both of these measures help maintain stable convergence and accelerate the rate of convergence to good policies.

A2C: A2C is an asynchronous version of REINFORCE that addresses the problem of waiting for rollout episodes to complete before computing advantages. It splits the process of computing returns into two steps - computing the bootstrapped estimate of the advantage function, and updating the policy weights based on the estimated gradient. Since multiple actors can run asynchronously in parallel, A2C is able to achieve higher throughput and overall speed compared to synchronous versions of these algorithms. Additionally, A2C avoids bias introduced by collecting samples sequentially, since all actors contribute to the calculation of the loss function and the advantage function simultaneously.

4.Mathematical Concepts Underlying Basic Policy Gradient Algorithms
Before moving onto specific details about each of the algorithms mentioned above, let us go over some key concepts that are used throughout these algorithms.

Advantage Function: Let $J_t$ denote the total discounted reward received after performing an action at timestep t. The advantage function $\delta_t(s)$ measures the importance of a particular action a(s) relative to other available actions. Specifically, the advantage function gives credit or blame to a particular action for a state s, considering all possible future outcomes. Mathematically, the advantage function is defined as follows:

$$\delta_t(s) = J_t(s) + \gamma V^{\pi_\theta}(s') - V^{\pi_\theta}(s) $$

where $\gamma$ is the discount factor, $\pi_{\theta}$ represents the current policy being learned, and $V^{\pi_\theta}(s')$ represents the value function evaluated at state s' according to the current policy $\pi_{\theta}$. Intuitively, an advantage function greater than zero indicates that the action performed was likely to yield positive future rewards, while an advantage function less than zero indicates that it was unlikely to yield significant future rewards. The term $(s')$ corresponds to the next state, which acts as a baseline for comparing against the current state s.

Returns: Let $G_{t+1} = R_{t+1}+\gamma R_{t+2}+\gamma^2 R_{t+3}+\cdots=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\gamma^kR_{t+k+1}$, where $R_t$ is the reward received at timestep t. The return function $G_t$ provides a numerical representation of the total discounted reward received up to timestep t. More specifically, $G_t$ quantifies the cumulative effect of rewards obtained throughout the entire episode starting from timestep t, acting as a signal to the agent for optimizing its policy. Mathematically, the return function is defined as follows:

$$G_t = R_t + \gamma G_{t+1}$$

where $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $G_{t+1}$ represents the return function computed recursively. Return functions play an important role in policy optimization because they capture both immediate and delayed rewards, and allow the agent to differentiate between useful actions and non-optimal ones. For instance, if a given action leads to negative consequences for the agent, it may be desirable to avoid it, even if its expected return exceeds the utility derived from executing it.

Policy Gradients: Given the advantage function $\delta_t$, the policy gradient algorithm calculates the gradient of the logarithm of the policy probabilities at state s with respect to the current set of policy parameters $\theta$. The gradient tells us how much the policy would change if we moved towards increasing the likelihood of selecting actions that result in positive advantages. Specifically, the policy gradient update rule is defined as follows:

$$\theta = \theta + \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log\pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t)\delta_t(s_t)$$

where $\alpha$ is the step size parameter that controls the strength of the update, $a_t$ is the action selected at timestep t, and $s_t$ is the observation at timestep t. In other words, the policy gradient update adjusts the policy parameters to increase the probability of selecting actions that yield positive advantages by moving them in the direction of the estimated gradient.

5.Code Implementation: Finally, here are some code implementations of the three basic policy gradient algorithms discussed earlier:
```python
import numpy as np


class PolicyGradient:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env

    # evaluate policy for a single state
    def get_action_probs(self, theta, state):
        raise NotImplementedError

    # calculate the advantage function at a given state
    def get_advantage(self, theta, gamma, v, values, rewards):
        n = len(rewards)
        delta = []
        G = 0
        for i in reversed(range(n)):
            G = rewards[i] + gamma * G
            adv = G - values[i]
            delta.append(adv)
        delta = list(reversed(delta))

        return np.array(delta)

    # perform a full epoch of training
    def train_epoch(self, batch_size, lr, gamma):
        raise NotImplementedError

class REINFORCE(PolicyGradient):
    def __init__(self, env):
        super().__init__(env)
    
    def get_action_probs(self, theta, state):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_advantage(self, theta, gamma, v, values, rewards):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def train_epoch(self, batch_size, lr, gamma):
        raise NotImplementedError


class PPO(PolicyGradient):
    def __init__(self, env):
        super().__init__(env)
    
    def get_action_probs(self, theta, state):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_advantage(self, theta, gamma, v, values, rewards):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def train_epoch(self, batch_size, lr, gamma):
        raise NotImplementedError


class A2C(PolicyGradient):
    def __init__(self, env):
        super().__init__(env)
    
    def get_action_probs(self, theta, state):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_advantage(self, theta, gamma, v, values, rewards):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def train_epoch(self, batch_size, lr, gamma):
        raise NotImplementedError
```
