# 1.简介
  

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. In this post, we will learn how to build our own SVM library using the popular Python package `scikit-learn`. We will also discuss some key concepts such as margin maximization and kernel functions, which can help us understand how SVMs work better. By the end of this article, you will be able to implement your own SVM library from scratch in Python and have a good understanding of how it works. 

To get started, let's review what an SVM is and its basic terminology.


# 2.背景介绍
Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithms that are particularly useful for binary classification problems. The goal of SVMs is to find a hyperplane in higher dimensional space where the margins between different classes are maximized. These hyperplanes are called support vectors because they lie on the boundary of the margin. A sample is classified into one of these categories based on which side of the decision boundary it falls on. SVMs are commonly used for image recognition, text classification, and other applications.

Here are some common terms and abbreviations related to SVMs:

* **Hyperplane:** A linear decision surface that separates two or more classes. It is defined by a set of points that define a line equation, known as the normal vector, and a point known as the bias term. All data points belonging to one class must be above this hyperplane while all data points belonging to another class must be below the hyperplane. An SVM finds the best hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes.

* **Margin:** The distance between the hyperplane and the closest data point from either class. The larger the margin, the easier it is for a classifier to correctly classify new samples. Hyperplanes with smaller margins are considered simpler models than those with larger margins.

* **Support Vector:** A data point that lies within the margin and plays a crucial role in determining the separation between the classes. If any support vectors change their position, then the direction of the hyperplane changes, resulting in a different optimal solution. This makes them very important in training SVMs and influences the final accuracy of the model.

Now that we've reviewed some basic background information about SVMs, let's dive deeper into how they work and how to implement them in Python using the `scikit-learn` library.

## 3.1 Margin Maximization
The primary goal of SVMs is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes. Intuitively, the margin is the perpendicular distance from the hyperplane to the nearest point from each class. To maximize the margin, we want to move away from the hyperplane along the direction of the largest gap between the two classes until we reach the limit of feasible solutions. This means we need to minimize the following cost function:


where `xi` represents the coordinates of the i-th observation, `yi` represents the corresponding class label (`+1` or `-1`), and `w`, `b` represent the weights and bias parameters of the hyperplane.

Once we have found the values of `w` and `b` that minimize the cost function, we can use the following formula to calculate the margin for a given observation:


This formula gives us the minimum perpendicular distance from the hyperplane to the i-th observation. If this distance is greater than zero, then the i-th observation is far enough from the hyperplane to be assigned to one class, otherwise it belongs to the other class. Therefore, if we choose the class with the maximum margin among all observations, we would achieve a perfect classification.

However, calculating the actual margin for every observation can become computationally expensive when dealing with large datasets. One way to optimize this process is to only consider a subset of the observations at once during the optimization process. Specifically, we select a subset of the positive and negative examples that are farthest apart and form the initial support vectors. Then, we iteratively update the positions of the support vectors towards the center of the margin until convergence.

Overall, margin maximization is the core step of the SVM algorithm. It involves selecting a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes, finding the support vectors, and updating their positions until convergence. Once we have finished optimizing the margin, we can use it to make predictions on new instances.


## 3.2 Kernel Functions
Another key concept in SVMs is kernel functions. Roughly speaking, a kernel function takes a high-dimensional input and transforms it into a lower-dimensional feature space where a linear decision surface can be formed. This transformation is done by applying a non-linear mapping function that preserves certain properties of the original input data, such as similarity or distance relationships. 

Common kernel functions include radial basis functions (RBF), polynomial functions, and sigmoidal functions. Here's an overview of how kernel functions transform inputs:

**Linear kernel:** This is simply a dot product of the input features without any transformation. Mathematically, it corresponds to having no kernel function.

**Polynomial kernel:** This applies a degree `d` polynomial transformation to the input features. For example, if `d=3`, then the output is calculated as `(1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2)^3`. This allows the algorithm to capture non-linear dependencies between features. However, the time complexity grows exponentially with increasing `d`.

**Radial basis function (RBF) kernel:** This uses a Gaussian distribution over the input features, with a parameter `gamma` that controls the width of the distribution. The function becomes sensitive to small variations around the mean value of the input features, making it suitable for working with high-dimensional data.

**Sigmoidal kernel:** This uses a logistic sigmoid function to squash the outputs of the RBF kernel between -1 and 1. Mathematically, it looks like `tanh(gamma * exp(-x^2 / 2))`. This kernel function has been shown to perform well on a variety of machine learning tasks.

In general, choosing the correct kernel function depends on the structure of the input data and the requirements of the problem being solved. Some kernel functions may not be applicable depending on the size of the dataset and dimensionality of the input features. However, empirically, RBF kernels seem to work well across a range of domains and tasks.


## 3.3 Implementing the SVM Algorithm in Python Using scikit-learn
To implement the SVM algorithm in Python using the scikit-learn library, we first need to import the necessary modules and create some synthetic data to test out the implementation. Let's start by importing numpy and matplotlib:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_circles
```

Next, we generate some synthetic data using the `make_circles()` function provided by scikit-learn, which creates a circle-like pattern of data points in two dimensions:

```python
X, y = make_circles(n_samples=100, noise=0.1, factor=0.2)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y);
```

We plot the data using scatter plots, colored according to their true class labels. Note that there are two concentric circles of points, separated by a thin band of random noise added to simulate measurement errors.

Now that we have our data, we can train an SVM model using the LinearSVC class from scikit-learn. This class implements a linear kernel SVM with regularization:

```python
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC

model = LinearSVC()
model.fit(X, y)
```

After fitting the model to the data, we can visualize the decision boundaries learned by the model. Scikit-learn provides a convenient `decision_function()` method that returns the signed distances from the hyperplane to the input data points:

```python
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-1.5, 1.5, 50),
                     np.linspace(-1.5, 1.5, 50))
Z = model.decision_function(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)

plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.4, cmap="RdBu")
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, s=50, edgecolors='k');
```

We first specify a grid of x and y coordinates to evaluate the decision function on, and then reshape the result back into a 2D array using the `.reshape()` method. We then contour the decision function using the `contourf()` method, and plot the data points again using the same color scheme as before. Finally, we add annotations to show the predicted class labels.

As expected, the model identifies the two circular clusters of points quite accurately. However, note that since we did not preprocess the data (e.g., scaling, normalization), it might be difficult to identify the underlying patterns of the data just by looking at the decision boundaries. Depending on the specific scenario, additional preprocessing steps could improve the performance of the model.
