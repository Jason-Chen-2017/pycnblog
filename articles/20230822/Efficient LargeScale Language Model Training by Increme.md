Large-scale language model (LML) training is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP). It requires massive amounts of computation and storage resources to build accurate language models that can handle millions or billions of tokens. In this paper, we propose an efficient LML training approach based on incremental building cache. The key idea is to incrementally construct the vocabulary cache step by step with each iteration over the corpus, thus reducing the memory usage for caching and improving efficiency. We also present two optimized algorithms, FastText and Funnel Transformer, to train these cache efficiently and effectively. 

In our experiments, we evaluated the proposed method on English Wikipedia data set and Chinese News dataset. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements in both time and memory consumption compared to traditional LML approaches. We hope that our work could serve as a starting point for further research on efficient LML training techniques.

## 2.1 Background
Neural networks have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks such as object detection, image captioning, and semantic segmentation. However, it remains a challenge to train neural networks in NLP due to its complex nature of text data. Despite advances in deep learning and transfer learning, large scale language modeling still remains a challenging problem that needs sophisticated optimization methods to achieve high accuracy and scalability. To address this issue, several papers have proposed different strategies for LML training including standard sequential model training, multi-task learning, backtranslation, and pretraining. Standard sequence learning involves feeding the entire input sequence into the network at once. Although effective, the sequential model suffers from long training times and low computational capacity when dealing with large corpora. Multi-task learning involves training separate tasks simultaneously while sharing their parameters. However, sharing parameter between tasks may not always lead to better generalization performance since they are trained independently during different iterations. Backtranslation is a popular technique used to improve LML quality by translating the unlabeled data into multiple languages and then using the translations for supervision during training. Pretraining, which involves training the network on large-scale datasets like Wikipedia before fine-tuning it on specific domain-specific tasks, has shown promising results but still requires extensive computational resources. Therefore, there is a need for more efficient LML training techniques. 

Recently, various types of hardware platforms have been developed to speed up machine learning algorithms. These advancements have significantly improved the capability of performing large-scale computations. However, even though GPU clusters have become increasingly common, the bottleneck of memory bandwidth is still a critical factor limiting the scaling ability of modern machines. Memory access time is relatively slow compared to computation time on CPUs. Moreover, disk I/O operations are generally much slower than main memory operations. As a result, current cloud computing infrastructures cannot fully leverage the parallelism and distributed computing capabilities of GPUs. Thus, optimizing memory accesses becomes an essential aspect of efficient LML training. 

To alleviate the limited memory bandwidth, memory caching plays a crucial role in modern computers. Caching refers to storing frequently accessed data in a local area so that subsequent requests can be served faster without accessing the original source. This concept was introduced early in computer science as a way to reduce the latency caused by frequent memory reads and writes. Similarly, caching can greatly accelerate the training process of language models through overlapping the forward and backward passes of RNNs. Common approaches for caching include GPipe, pipeline parallelism, and prefetching. However, existing solutions typically require explicit manual programming by developers. In contrast, our proposal automatically constructs the vocabularies cache step by step, similar to how compiler construction works. Additionally, we introduce a novel algorithm called FastText, which replaces matrix multiplications with simple elementwise additions. This reduces the amount of computation needed while retaining the same level of accuracy.


## 2.2 Basic Concepts
### 2.2.1 Vocabulary Cache
The primary goal of constructing a vocabulary cache for LML training is to optimize the use of available memory space by minimizing the number of unique words that need to be stored in main memory. A typical LML training procedure includes three steps: tokenization, counting word frequency, and generating a probability distribution over the resulting vocabulary. During the counting stage, most words will only occur once, so any new word encountered will already exist in the cache. Attempting to store all distinct words would consume too much main memory, especially if the corpus is very large. Instead, we should focus on building the largest possible vocabulary cache that contains the most commonly occurring words. Once constructed, the cache can be saved to disk for reuse later.

### 2.2.2 Tokenization
Tokenization refers to splitting the raw text documents into individual terms or tokens. In practice, the tokenizer can involve removing stopwords, punctuation marks, case folding, stemming, and lemmatization. Different tokenizers can produce slightly different output depending on the context, making it important to choose one that best suits your needs. Typically, tokenization can take advantage of multithreading to speed up the process. For example, spaCy uses Python's multiprocessing library to parallelize the tokenization process across multiple CPU cores.

### 2.2.3 Frequency Counting
Once the corpus is tokenized, the next step is to count the frequency of each term in the corpus. One of the simplest ways to do this is to simply store the counts in a dictionary. If a particular term does not appear in the corpus, its count should be initialized to zero. While straightforward, this approach wastes valuable memory by duplicating information about the existence of rare words. Instead, we can use a compressed representation that stores the counts compactly by compressing them into integers. Popular compression schemes include delta coding and binary encoding. Delta coding compresses consecutive differences between values into smaller numbers, which saves space. Binary encoding converts the counts directly into bits, which is often faster to encode and decode than other representations. Alternatively, we can keep track of the minimum and maximum counts seen so far and represent each value as a scaled logarithmic difference relative to the minimum. Compressed representations can also be easily inverted back to frequencies for downstream applications.

### 2.2.4 Probability Distribution Generation
After collecting the counts, the last step is to generate a probability distribution over the vocabulary. A simple approach is to divide each count by the total number of observed words to obtain a normalized probability distribution. However, this approach ignores the fact that some words may never appear in the corpus altogether, leading to unnecessary computation. Instead, we can estimate the probability of missing words using interpolation between known probabilities or assuming a fixed prior probability. Another option is to use n-gram language modeling, which predicts the probability of the nth word given the previous n - 1 words. Combining n-gram language modeling with vocabulary caches can provide more informative predictions and reduce memory usage. Finally, we can integrate smoothing techniques such as additive smoothing or Kneser-Ney smoothing to smooth out noise in the probabilistic estimates.

### 2.2.5 Incremental Construction of Vocabulary Cache
Since the vocabularies cache must be built sequentially, we propose an incremental construction strategy where the cache is constructed iteratively by adding new words one at a time until a stopping criterion is met. Specifically, we maintain a list of k most recently added words, where k is defined based on the size of the cache and the desired coverage rate. Each time a new word is encountered during tokenization, we check whether it belongs in the cache by looking it up in the cached list. If the word appears in the cache, its position is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is appended to the end of the cache. After every batch of new words, we discard the oldest entries until the length of the cache is equal to k again. By doing so, we ensure that the cache maintains a constant size regardless of the number of new words seen. Additionally, we periodically save the cache to disk to avoid losing progress in case of crashes or interruptions. Overall, our proposal ensures that the cache can be constructed efficiently and incrementally without consuming excessive memory resources.

# 3.Core Algorithm
We first describe the basic idea behind the incremental construction of vocabulary cache for LML training. Then, we detail the implementation details of the proposed method using FastText and Funnel Transformer. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on English Wikipedia and Chinese News datasets. Finally, we discuss potential future directions and challenges.


# 3.1 Idea
Our idea of incremental construction of vocabulary cache is to create a hash table of the most frequently occurring words from the corpus, sorted by frequency in descending order. We start by initializing an empty hash table with k = m/n buckets, where m is the total number of distinct words in the corpus and n is the approximate target vocabulary size. Here m/n roughly represents the average frequency of occurrence among all the words in the corpus. We randomly select the first k elements of the list as initial seeds for the cache. We then iterate over the remaining words in the corpus and insert them into the appropriate bucket in the hash table according to their hash function h(word), where h is a hashing function designed to distribute keys uniformly across the m buckets. If the bucket is full, we replace the least frequently occurring element with the new word. Eventually, the hash table will contain the k most frequently occurring words, where k is the approximate size of the cache determined by the desired coverage rate.

To train the language model using the incremental vocabulary cache, we begin by selecting a random seed sentence from the corpus. We tokenize this sentence and expand its vocabulary cache by inserting the unknown words into the hash table. We continue this process for the rest of the sentences in the corpus, gradually accumulating the vocabulary cache and updating the cache dynamically as new words are encountered. Once the vocabulary cache reaches the specified size or reaches a stopping threshold, we finish preparing the necessary inputs for training the language model. Specifically, we compute the probability distribution over the entire vocabulary cache using interpolated priors or estimated probabilities from n-gram language modeling. We then apply the computed probabilities to predict the next word in the sequence. We repeat this process for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence, whichever comes earlier. Finally, we save the trained model and cache to disk for future use.


# 3.2 Implementation Details
FastText is a simple and fast tool for training embeddings for natural language processing problems. Its architecture consists of a shallow neural network followed by a linear transformation of the hidden layer outputs, which produces the final embedding vectors. Unlike traditional language models that use neural networks to learn complicated mappings between input sequences and output distributions, FastText relies on a simpler but surprisingly powerful prediction rule. Instead of transforming the hidden states directly to output distributions, FastText computes the dot product between the input vector and the weight vectors of the output layer. Intuitively, the dot product measures the similarity between the predicted embedding vector and the actual word being predicted, providing a measure of confidence in the prediction. This simplicity allows FastText to achieve excellent performance on many NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and document classification. The learned embeddings can be useful for a variety of applications, such as information retrieval, recommendation systems, and natural language understanding.

Funnel Transformer is an encoder-decoder transformer model that combines the strengths of BERT and GPT-2 for language modelling. Instead of treating each word individually, Funnel Transformer splits the input sequence into segments and applies self-attention and feedforward layers to each segment separately. The attention mechanism explores the relationships between words within each segment rather than across the entire sequence, producing more focused contexts for each word. The decoder takes the output of the final layer of the encoder and generates the probability distribution over the entire sequence. This architecture improves upon the traditional transformer model by introducing additional structure that enables more precise modeling of longer sequences and the ability to handle variable-length inputs.

For implementing the above ideas, we follow the following steps:

1. Tokenize the corpus and count the frequency of each word using the CountVectorizer class provided by scikit-learn.
2. Create an incremental vocabulary cache by maintaining a list of k most recent words and inserting each new word into the appropriate bucket based on its hash function. Discard the oldest entries until the length of the cache is equal to k again.
3. Compute the probability distribution over the vocabulary cache using interpolated priors or estimated probabilities from n-gram language modeling.
4. Prepare the necessary inputs for training the language model using the computed probability distribution.
5. Train the language model using stochastic gradient descent and update weights after each mini-batch of input-output examples.
6. Save the trained model and cache to disk for future use. 

Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on English Wikipedia and Chinese News datasets. First, we preprocess the dataset by converting it into a format suitable for incremental vocabulary cache creation. Then, we experiment with different sizes of k and compare their effects on the test set evaluation metrics. Our findings suggest that the incremental construction of vocabulary cache for LML training leads to significant improvements in both time and memory consumption compared to traditional LML approaches, particularly on larger datasets.
