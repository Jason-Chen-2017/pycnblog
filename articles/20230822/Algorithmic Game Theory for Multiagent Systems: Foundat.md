# 1.简介
  

The paper "Algorithmic game theory" is commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), especially for developing algorithmic strategies or decision-making systems for games that require complex interactions among multiple agents. However, its applicability to multiagent systems is limited because it only considers two-player games without considering the complexity of coordination problems arising from the presence of many interacting agents. In this work, we propose an overview on the basic concepts, terminologies, and algorithms of algorithmic game theory applied to multiagent systems. We then explore how these techniques can be combined with reinforcement learning techniques to develop agent-based decision-making systems capable of dealing with challenging coordination issues such as negotiation and cooperation between multiple autonomous agents. We conclude by highlighting potential future directions in applying algorithmic game theory to multiagent systems, including integration of deep neural networks into AI agents for efficient decision making in large-scale simulations.

# 2.前言
Multiagent systems are a fundamental challenge in Artificial Intelligence (AI). They involve multiple agents interacting within a shared environment, where they must coordinate their actions to achieve collective goals. Coordinating decisions among multiple agents requires considerable problem-solving skills, and there exists no single algorithm that can efficiently solve all types of multiagent problems. The key challenges include understanding the interactions between agents and coordinating them effectively; generating appropriate policies and action choices for each agent under different contexts; and handling adversarial behaviors and ensuring cooperative behavior among team members. 

In recent years, numerous researchers have proposed new methods based on algorithmic game theory to address these challenges. These methods enable the development of decision-making systems for multiagent systems through effective utilization of agents' knowledge and experience, while also exploring various scenarios beyond traditional one-shot games. Despite the significant advancement, however, algorithmic game theory remains far from being widely accepted in multiagent systems due to several reasons, including technical difficulties, lack of theoretical foundations, practical implications, and ethical concerns. This work aims to overcome some of those limitations and provide insights into the application of algorithmic game theory in multiagent systems. 

In this paper, we propose a general definition of algorithmic game theory, present basic terminology relevant to multiagent system applications, describe core algorithms, principles, and approaches for solving multiagent coordination problems, and recommend combining them with machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to design agent-based decision-making systems that are capable of dealing with complex coordination issues such as negotiation and cooperation. We also discuss further research opportunities involving combination games, policy design, adaptive learning mechanisms for changing environments, online learning, and other models based on deep learning.
