# 1.简介
  

Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as Karhunen-Loève transform or Karhunen-Löve decomposition, is a statistical procedure that reduces the dimensionality of data by creating new uncorrelated variables called principal components or directions in the feature space. It is widely used for analyzing and understanding high-dimensional data sets to identify patterns and extract underlying structures. PCA has many practical applications such as compression, denoising, clustering, pattern recognition, image processing, and recommender systems. 

In this article, we will explain what PCA is, how it works mathematically and conceptually, and provide step-by-step Python code examples using NumPy library. We'll cover all key concepts necessary for understanding the algorithm including covariance matrix, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). At the end of this article, you should be able to understand the basics of PCA and implement it on your own datasets with ease. If not, feel free to reach out to me for further clarification.  

# 2. Basic Concepts
## Covariance Matrix
The covariance matrix $C$ measures the pairwise covariances between the random variables in a dataset. The element $C_{ij}$ represents the covariance between variable $i$ and variable $j$. Mathematically, if two variables are measured at multiple points, their covariance can be calculated as:

$$ C_{ij} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_i^{(k)} - \bar{x}_i)(x_j^{(k)} - \bar{x}_j) $$

where $\bar{x}_i$ is the mean value of variable $i$, and $x_i^{(k)}$ is the measurement of variable $i$ at point $k$. 

If there are $m$ dimensions in the original dataset ($n$ samples, each with $p$ features/variables), then the covariance matrix would have size $m\times m$. However, most often, only some few principal components are retained after performing PCA on the data, so the covariance matrix becomes smaller than its full size.

## Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues
To compute the principal components of the dataset, we need to solve an optimization problem involving eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. Let's assume our data is represented by a set of observations $(X_1, X_2,..., X_n)$, where each observation is a vector of length p, i.e., $X_i \in R^p$. The objective is to find a projection matrix W that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the projected data and the original data:

$$ W^{*} = \argmin_{\textstyle W \in R^{mp}} ||X - WH||_F^2 $$

This means that we want to find the transformation matrix $W$ that projects the data onto a new subspace formed by a subset of the original features while minimizing the reconstruction error. One way to approach this problem is to use SVD (singular value decomposition), which factorizes the data matrix into three matrices: U (orthogonal), S (diagonal), Vt (transposed). By doing this, we obtain an equation that involves only the diagonal elements of S, which represent the variances along the different principal axes. Using these variance values, we can construct the corresponding principal components, which are just the columns of the U matrix multiplied by square roots of the respective singular values. These principal components capture the maximum amount of variance possible along each direction without having any redundancy or overlap among them. Here's the math behind it:


$$ X^T X = V S^T S V^T \\   U = XV \\   \Sigma = S^{-1/2} \\   PC = U \Sigma $$ 

Where $U$, $\Sigma$, and $PC$ are defined as follows:

- **U**: contains the left singular vectors of $X$. They are arranged from largest to smallest singluar values. Each column of $U$ corresponds to a principal component, and represents a direction in the feature space where data varies the most.
- **S**: contains the non-zero singular values of $X$. The first $r$ values correspond to the first $r$ principal components. Square root of the singular values give us the relative importance of each principle component.
- **PC**: contains the principal components of $X$. These are just the columns of $U$ scaled by their respective singular values. Thus, they constitute the best approximation of the data in terms of the directions with the highest variance. 


Now let's apply this method to the example dataset shown below:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Generate sample dataset
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=100, n_features=2, centers=2, cluster_std=1.5, random_state=42)

plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1])
plt.xlabel("Feature 1")
plt.ylabel("Feature 2")
plt.show()
```


Here, we generate a synthetic dataset made up of 100 instances, where each instance consists of two features randomly sampled from a normal distribution centered around two separate clusters. Since we know beforehand that the true number of clusters is equal to 2, we expect the resulting principal components to be perfectly separable. But lets try applying PCA to the same dataset and see what happens.
