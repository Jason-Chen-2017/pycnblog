Sentiment analysis is one of the most commonly performed tasks in natural language processing (NLP). The main goal of sentiment analysis is to identify and classify a text into different categories such as positive or negative based on its overall emotional tone. In this article we will discuss ensemble methods that can be used for improving sentiment analysis performance on twitter data. 

Ensemble methods are machine learning algorithms that combine multiple models together to improve their accuracy and efficiency. By combining multiple classifiers with various techniques and levels of complexity, ensemble methods provide better results than individual models alone. There are several types of ensemble methods, including bagging, boosting, stacking, and voting. This article will focus mainly on bagging and boosting ensemble methods. These methods are widely used because they have good generalization abilities and perform well even when there is limited training data. However, it’s worth noting that some researchers argue against using boosting methods due to the fact that they can lead to overfitting problems. Boosting also has other drawbacks like slow convergence speed and instability which makes it less efficient compared to simpler techniques such as bagging. Therefore, choosing the appropriate method depends on the specific dataset and problem at hand.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Bagging
Bagging is an ensemble method where multiple instances of the same model (base learner) are trained independently using bootstrapping. Bootstrapping involves sampling data points randomly from the original dataset without replacement, creating several subsets from the same distribution, and then using each subset to train separate models. During testing time, the predictions made by all base learners are combined to form the final output.

In bagging, the outputs of base learners are averaged or added to produce a new result that is more robust and accurate than any single classifier. The advantage of bagging over a single classifier is that it reduces variance and increases the stability of the prediction. Additionally, bagging allows us to create more diverse sets of classifiers by aggregating their individual errors. This helps to prevent overfitting and improves the overall accuracy of the model.

## Boosting
Boosting is another ensemble method where multiple instances of the same model (weak learner) are sequentially trained with different weights. Unlike bagging, boosting focuses on minimizing the error of the previous classifier rather than reducing the variance of the total ensemble. At each iteration, the algorithm trains a weak learner on the misclassified examples of the previous one. Each subsequent weak learner is weighted based on its accuracy and contributes less to the final output until all the learners have been combined.

The key idea behind boosting is to assign higher weight to examples that were incorrectly classified by the previous weak learner. This encourages the model to pay more attention to these samples during training and strengthen its relevance. Finally, after all iterations are complete, the predictions made by all learners are combined to form the final output.

Overall, both bagging and boosting provide ways to reduce variance and improve the accuracy of machine learning models. However, boosting may suffer from slower convergence speed and overfitting issues while bagging may lead to underfitting issues. It's important to carefully choose the best combination of ensemble technique(s) for your particular use case.

# 3. Core Algorithm: Random Forest and Gradient-boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)
Random forest is a type of ensemble method known for its high accuracy, low variance, and ability to handle large datasets and categorical variables. GBDT is similar but instead uses decision trees as base learners to build the ensemble. Both random forests and gradient boosting are popular tools for sentiment analysis. Let's go through the core steps involved in building these two algorithms. 


### Random Forests
A random forest is created by selecting k randomly chosen features from the input data and building a decision tree using only those selected features. Then, the top node of each decision tree is considered the root node of a new tree and the process is repeated recursively until k decision trees are generated. The resulting set of decision trees is called a forest and is used to make a final prediction.

To generate a random forest, we need to follow the following steps:

1. Select a bootstrap sample of size n (the entire dataset if n = m) from the training data.
2. For each feature i, select a random subset of values Vj from the corresponding feature column Xi. Create a binary split point at xi = xj.
3. Split the bootstrap sample into two partitions P1 and P2 based on whether the value of the feature i at the current split point is greater than or equal to the threshold xj.
4. Repeat step 2 and step 3 for every feature j and calculate the average impurity reduction obtained by each split.
5. Choose the feature j and split point xi that resulted in the highest average impurity reduction. Add the corresponding subtree to the growing forest.
6. Continue adding decision trees to the forest until we reach a maximum depth d or until no further improvements can be achieved.
7. Make predictions by combining the decisions made by each constituent decision tree in the forest.

Once we have built a forest, we can evaluate its performance on a test set by measuring the classification accuracy. We typically repeat the above steps with different combinations of bootstrap samples and features to obtain a range of performance metrics such as mean accuracy, standard deviation of accuracies, and ROC curve area.


### Gradient Boosting
Gradient boosting works by iteratively applying the learned gradient descent update rule to minimize the loss function. At each iteration t, a new regression tree is fitted to the negative gradients of the previous regression tree. The negative gradients indicate how much each example would contribute to making incorrect predictions relative to the expected loss if it was classified correctly. Together, the sequence of regression trees gives rise to a boosted decision tree.

Here are the basic steps involved in building a gradient boosting machine:

1. Initialize the ensemble with a constant estimator, which outputs the prior probability p_t = 1/n_t for each instance, where n_t is the number of instances in the training set at time t.
2. For each round t=1,2,...,T:
   * Fit a weak learner l(t) to the negative gradient g(y|x,t-1), where y is the target variable and x is the input vector, evaluated at the previous stage. 
   * Update the ensemble by computing the weighted sum of the estimators up to now, plus the newly trained estimator l(t): 
     f_t(x) = f_(t-1)(x) + eta*l(t),
     where eta is the learning rate hyperparameter.
3. Output the ensemble: 
    h(x) = sign(f_T(x))

When implementing gradient boosting, we usually start with small learning rates and gradually increase them until overfitting occurs. If overfitting does occur, we can try increasing the regularization strength or decreasing the number of rounds T to limit the amount of fitting done on each round. Another approach is to use early stopping, which monitors the validation error and stops training once the error starts increasing.
