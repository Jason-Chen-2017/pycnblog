# 1.简介
  

The field of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) is the study of how uncertain factors influence each other based on some common evidence or observations. One type of PGM called Bayesian Networks (BNs), model relationships between random variables using conditional probability distributions that take into account prior information. They are widely used for modeling complex systems with many interdependent variables. However, BNs can be difficult to understand and implement correctly. Therefore, there has been significant interest in developing practical tools for working with BNs, especially those designed for large-scale applications such as knowledge base construction and recommendation engines. In this article, we will provide an overview of the theory behind BNs and their practical applications. We will then demonstrate how these methods can be implemented using popular programming languages and evaluate them on real world datasets to show their effectiveness. Finally, we will discuss future directions and challenges for implementing effective BN methods in various domains.

In order to achieve this goal, this article will divide into four main sections: 

1. Background Introduction 
2. Core Concepts and Terminology
3. Implementation and Evaluation
4. Conclusion 

We hope that our explanations and examples help you gain a better understanding of Bayesian networks and enable you to start building more advanced analytics solutions with confidence. Do you have any questions? Feel free to ask! Good luck with your project!

# 2.核心概念及术语
Before we dive into the details of BNs, it's important to familiarize ourselves with the basic concepts and terminology they use. The following section provides a brief introduction to key terms used in BNs.

## 2.1 Random Variables (RV)
A random variable is a variable whose value depends on one or more unobserved variables or factors. For example, consider two coins which may land heads or tails randomly. This experiment would generate two independent RVs - Heads or Tails. Each coin is just another random variable, and we cannot observe its outcome directly without knowing what the other coin did. 

A set of RVs forms a joint distribution over all possible combinations of values. A complete graph of all possible pairs of RVs forms a BN.

## 2.2 Conditional Probability Distributions (CPD)
In BNs, CPDs define the probabilities of different outcomes for a given combination of RV states. These probabilities depend on both the current state of the system and any relevant evidence available at the time. CPDs consist of three components:

1. Parent nodes: These represent the conditions under which the node is active or influences the probability distribution. It could be thought of as the cause or explanation of the current state.

2. State (or Value): This represents the possible values that the RV can assume. For binary variables like head/tail, the state space consists of only two values - H or T.

3. Probabilities: These are the conditional probabilities of the state of the parent nodes given the current state of the child node. For binary variables, these probabilities correspond to the likelihood of observing either heads or tails if the corresponding parent node is in the specified state.

For example, suppose we have a student classroom where students attend lectures but also have projects to complete. Let us call the number of hours spent on projects a binary random variable X, while the grade obtained from the course affects the likelihood of completing the project successfully, y. We can construct a BN diagram for this scenario as follows:

 


 

Here, we have two binary RVs - X and Y. X denotes the amount of time spent on academic activities, which is affected by the attendance of the lecture attendee and their performance in the previous semester. Y denotes whether the student completes the project successfully, which depends on his/her grades in the course and the effort he/she puts in towards completing the task. 

Using this simple example, let us explain the structure and meaning of the above picture.

## 2.3 Structural Causal Model (SCM) 
A structural causal model (SCM) is a simplified representation of a BN where we do not explicitly model individual random variables. Instead, we only model the relationships among them. Structured SCMs capture dependencies between variables indirectly through their interactions with the parents and children of other variables. We need to identify the root cause(s) of events and learn how they interact to produce the desired effects. We can infer missing CPDs from the observed data. 

Scientific papers often present results using SCMs instead of explicit representations of BN. By simplifying the problem, SCMs make inference and reasoning easier and more intuitive. Additionally, SCMs simplify the process of learning CPDs from data since it involves inferring the most likely cause of the effect rather than considering all possible causes individually.


# 3.具体实现
Now that we have learned about the basics of BNs, let’s move on to the practical side of things. Here, we will demonstrate how to build and run a program that uses a Bayesian network to predict the likelihood of patients having diabetes based on their preexisting medical conditions. We will use Python programming language along with several libraries including Pandas, Numpy, and PyMC3 to accomplish this task.
