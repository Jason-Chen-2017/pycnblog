## 2.1 概念定义
### 2.1.1 Lasers
A laser is an interferometric radiation source that emits electromagnetic waves in the form of pulses at varying frequencies. These waves propagate in free space until they interact with another medium such as air or other objects causing scattering and attenuation. A laser scanner consists of two parts: an emitter, which produces the waves, and a receiver, which detects and interprets the reflected energy.


A solid-state laser typically consists of a cathode-ray tube (CRT), or light-emitting diode array. It has a large diameter that allows it to cover a significant distance without blocking any part of its surroundings, making it useful for short-range measurements. Other popular types of solid-state lasers include photoelectric lasers (PELs) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) lasers. A PEL is a single-mode laser that absorbs visible light and emits electromagnetic radiation, while an SEM is composed of many individual semiconductor mirrors that produce high-intensity focused electromagnetic fields.

Passive lasers, such as fiber-optic lasers and directional antennas, do not require a separate source of electricity to operate and emit light. Instead, they rely on either magnetic fields produced by moving charged particles or the absence of any electric fields inside them. Passive lasers offer high sensitivity and excellent resolution, but lack the flexibility of active lasers. Active lasers, however, require additional components like electronics to operate, consist of more modes than passive ones, and may consume larger amounts of power compared to passive ones.

Common types of active lasers include fluorescent lasers (FLRs), polarization filters, photoconductors, LEDs, and resonant crystal lasers (RCLs). FLRs convert infrared radiation into red-green-blue (RGB) light allowing them to penetrate materials and create color images. Polarization filters can direct the flow of polarity in the laser beam to increase the intensity of certain wavelengths while suppressing others. Photoconductors act as switches that turn on and off specific portions of the electromagnetic spectrum depending on the amount of incident sunlight. An LED provides higher current density than traditional lasers enabling faster response times and increased efficiency in outdoor environments. RCLs are designed to enhance the bandwidth of the transmitted light waveform by duplicating and reflecting the frequency components of incoming light. They are especially suitable for ultra-wideband applications where high resolution is required.

### 2.1.2 LiDAR
LiDAR stands for Light Detection And Ranging. It uses sonar technology instead of sound waves to measure distances, similar to radar. Unlike radar devices, LiDAR does not depend on magnetism to transmit and receive signals. Instead, it relies on changes in the reflection coefficient of the target object. To sense targets accurately, a LiDAR device generates a firing pattern that includes spaced apart beams at different angles. By analyzing the return echoes received at each point, the device calculates the distance between itself and the target object.
