# 1.简介
  

Stock market prediction is one of the most important problems in finance that has been studied for many years. Many machine learning models have been proposed to predict stock prices over time, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. In this article, we will focus on building an artificial intelligence model that can accurately predict future stock prices based on historical data using both elman and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We will use Python programming language and Keras library as our toolset.

# 2.基本概念、术语及定义
To begin with, let’s go through some basic concepts, terminologies and definitions related to stock market prediction:

1. **Stock price**: The current value of a company’s shares in its trading markets.
2. **Historical data**: Records of past stock prices usually recorded every minute or five minutes depending upon the frequency at which stock exchange transactions occur.
3. **Technical indicators**: A set of mathematical formulas used to identify key features of financial markets such as moving averages, bollinger bands etc. These technical indicators help analysts make decisions about potential trends and oscillations that may affect stock prices.
4. **Market trend**: An overall pattern or behavior exhibited by stock prices throughout different periods of time. For example, bullish market indicates that companies are earning good returns from their investment portfolios while bearish market indicates companies are losing money.
5. **Predictive modeling**: Process of training a computer algorithm on existing data so it can predict future outcomes based on new information provided. There are various algorithms used for predicting stock prices including linear regression, decision trees, random forests and neural networks.

Now, let’s dive deeper into elman and RNN architecture:

1. **Elman Neural Network**: This is a type of feedforward neural network that consists of input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. It processes inputs sequentially in the forward direction and updates the weights between neurons to minimize loss during backpropagation. Each unit in the hidden layer is connected to all units in the previous layer and also to all units in the next layer. Here is how each step works:

   - Input Layer: This takes input data in the form of vectors.
   - Hidden Layers: These receive input from the input layer and perform transformations on them before passing the transformed result on to the subsequent layer. In the case of ELMAN network, there is only one hidden layer. 
   - Output Layer: Finally, the outputs generated by the last layer are passed through a non-linear activation function like sigmoid or tanh to obtain predicted values.

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** : It is a type of neural network designed specifically for sequential data, i.e., data where order matters. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs process sequences of inputs without keeping track of state variables separately for each element in the sequence. Instead, they utilize memory cells that keep track of previously seen elements in the sequence and allow the network to take contextual dependencies into account when making predictions. The basic structure of an RNN looks very similar to that of an Elman neural network but contains additional memory cells within the hidden layers to store information across multiple iterations of the loop.

We will be implementing an RNN and an Elman neural network using Python and the Keras library. To start with, we need to install the required libraries and import the necessary modules. 


```python
!pip install keras pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, Dropout
```


# 3. Core Algorithm and Steps
In this section, I'll explain you briefly what are the steps involved in building a stock market predictor using an RNN and an Elman neural network. 

1. Data Preprocessing: First, we need to preprocess the dataset by cleaning up the data, scaling the features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. 
2. Model Training: Next, we train the RNN and Elman neural network models on the preprocessed data. 
3. Prediction: Once we have trained our models, we test them on unseen data to get accurate predictions of stock prices for the coming days.  
4. Visualization: Lastly, we visualize our results and compare the performance of the two models.  

Let's see these steps in detail.
