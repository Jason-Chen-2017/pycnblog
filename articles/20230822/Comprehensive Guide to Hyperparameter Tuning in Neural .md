Hyperparameters are the adjustable parameters that determine the behavior of an algorithm or model and can significantly affect its performance. The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to find the optimal combination of these parameters that results in best-performing models. There are several techniques available for hyperparameter tuning such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms. This guide aims at providing a comprehensive overview of different approaches for hyperparameter tuning in neural networks. We will go through each technique with an explanation on how it works and when to use which one. 

In this guide, we assume that you have some knowledge about deep learning architectures and their corresponding hyperparameters, e.g., number of layers, neurons per layer, activation function, regularization term, optimizer, learning rate, etc. If not, please read our previous article: "An Introduction to Deep Learning Architectures" before proceeding further. 

2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into any specific technique for hyperparameter tuning, let's first understand some basic concepts and terminology used widely in machine learning.

2.1 Hyperparameters
The term “hyperparameters” refers to the adjustable parameters in machine learning models that are set prior to training and remain constant throughout the process. These include things like the learning rate (α), momentum (β), regularization strength (λ), batch size, dropout rates, etc. In other words, hyperparameters control various aspects of the model’s architecture and learning process, while the data is fixed. However, they play an important role in determining the quality of the resulting model and need careful consideration and tuning during the experimentation phase.

To tune hyperparameters effectively, we need to know what they are and why they matter. For instance, if we choose too small a value for a hyperparameter, the model may converge very slowly or even diverge, leading to suboptimal performance. On the other hand, if we choose a value that is too high, it could lead to overfitting, i.e., poor generalization ability on new unseen data. Therefore, hyperparameters must be tuned carefully based on the characteristics of the problem under study and the model being trained.

2.2 Validation Set
During the hyperparameter tuning process, we divide the dataset into two parts - a training set and a validation set. The training set is used to train the model using the chosen hyperparameters, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model after each iteration of hyperparameter tuning. This helps us avoid overfitting by ensuring that the model does not memorize the training set but rather learns from it. Additionally, since the validation error tells us how well the model is performing on new, never seen data, we can use early stopping to stop the tuning process whenever the validation error starts increasing.

One common approach is to split the original dataset randomly into two halves, say 70% training and 30% validation. Another option is to keep the validation error consistent across multiple runs of the same hyperparameter configuration, so that we don’t waste time trying configurations that don’t improve the accuracy.

2.3 Regularization Term
Regularization is a technique that reduces the magnitude of the weights during training to prevent overfitting. It consists of adding a penalty term to the cost function that represents the sum of squares of the large weights. Intuitively, smaller weights mean that the network can learn simpler relationships between input features and output labels, making it less prone to overfitting. The strength of the regularization term controls the tradeoff between fitting the training data well and preventing overfitting. A higher strength means more aggressive regularization, which can result in poorer generalization performance on new data. Some popular regularization terms used in neural networks are L1 and L2 regularization.

2.4 Overfitting and Underfitting
Overfitting occurs when the model fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization on new, unseen data. Underfitting happens when the model cannot fit the training data well enough due to insufficient complexity. To avoid overfitting, we usually apply regularization methods such as L1/L2 regularization or Dropout. To avoid underfitting, we can increase the capacity of the model, add more hidden layers, or try a wider range of hyperparameters.

2.5 Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a method for evaluating the performance of a model on a limited dataset. Instead of splitting the dataset into two parts, we perform k-fold cross-validation where the dataset is divided into k equal parts, called folds, and each fold is used once as a validation set and the remaining k-1 folds form the training set. This ensures that every sample is used in both training and testing phases and thereby improves the stability of the evaluation metrics. Since the dataset is split into k equally sized parts, there is no bias towards any particular subset of samples. Overall, cross-validation is considered the most reliable way to estimate the true predictive performance of a model.
