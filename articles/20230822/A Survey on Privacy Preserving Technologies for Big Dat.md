# 1.简介
  

Privacy preserving technologies have become an increasingly important topic in the big data analytics domain as more sensitive personal information is collected from users over time. The collection of personal data poses significant challenges to privacy protection, especially when it comes to processing, storing or sharing this data securely. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in developing new techniques that can preserve user privacy while analyzing large amounts of data. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current research and practice concerning privacy preserving technologies for big data analytics. 

The focus will be primarily on state-of-the-art research, specifically focusing on areas such as differential privacy, attribute release, federated learning, and multi-party computation. Additionally, some case studies with concrete applications of these technologies are also included to demonstrate how they can help address big data problems related to privacy.

# 2.Basic Concepts & Terms
In order to understand privacy preserving technologies for big data analytics, we need to familiarize ourselves with several basic concepts and terms used throughout the field. Some of them include: 

1. Differential Privacy (DP): DP is a mathematical technique that allows datasets to be analyzed without compromising individual privacy by adding noise to their contents. It achieves this by treating each piece of data in the dataset independently, which prevents any single piece of data from being linked back to its source or revealing too much information about the individuals whose data it contains. DP ensures that the analysis results cannot be attributed back to specific individuals, making it particularly useful for processing sensitive healthcare data where access to raw patient records should remain protected.

2. Attribute Release: Attribute release refers to the process of selecting a subset of attributes from a dataset, rather than releasing all the available attributes. This feature makes it possible to protect individual privacy while still providing meaningful insights into the behavior and characteristics of the population. In medical imaging scenarios, this technology could allow patients' identities and contact information to be stripped out before images are shared publicly online.

3. Federated Learning (FL): FL involves training machine learning models using decentralized data across multiple devices, instead of centralizing the data and model at one location. FL enables distributed computing platforms like mobile phones, tablets, laptops, servers etc., to train local models in parallel, leading to increased efficiency and accuracy. However, FL also introduces risks of unintended leakage of private data through exfiltration of encrypted models, or biased or malicious use of models trained on different subsets of the data. Hence, proper handling of FL requires careful consideration of security protocols, such as encryption and authentication.

4. Multi-Party Computation (MPC): MPC refers to the process of performing computations on secret-shared data between two or more parties, without relying on any trusted third party. As the name suggests, MPC brings together various cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption, oblivious transfer and secret sharing to enable secure computations on encrypted data. Moreover, MPC offers advantages like scalability, fault tolerance and verifiability, making it suitable for distributed systems running complex algorithms and computational tasks.

# 3.Core Algorithms & Operations
Now let's move onto discussing core algorithms and operations involved in privacy preserving technologies for big data analytics. We will examine four main categories of technologies: 

1. Private Data Analysis Techniques
2. Encrypted Query Execution
3. Distributed Machine Learning Techniques
4. Secure Aggregation Methods

Let us now look into each category in detail.

1.Private Data Analysis Techniques
These methods aim to analyze massive datasets while ensuring complete privacy protection of individuals’ data. The most commonly used techniques within this category involve DP, PLR, K-anonymity, L-diversity, and T-closeness.

Differential Privacy (DP)
As mentioned earlier, DP is a mathematical technique that allows datasets to be analyzed without compromising individual privacy by adding noise to their contents. It treats each piece of data in the dataset independently, so that no single piece of data can be linked back to its source or revealed too much information about the individuals whose data it contains. DP guarantees that the analysis results cannot be attributed back to specific individuals, making it particularly useful for processing sensitive healthcare data where access to raw patient records should remain protected.

Practical limitations of DP make it difficult to scale to very large datasets or perform computations requiring high precision, such as those involving linear regression. Other techniques, including Randomized Response and Laplace Mechanism, offer similar guarantees but may not be able to achieve the same level of privacy protection due to the added randomness.

In addition to DP, other approaches to preserve privacy include Pseudonymization, k-Link Anonymity, and Attribute Release. Pseudonymization involves replacing real-world entities with artificial identifiers, such as names replaced with codes. By doing so, sensitive data can be transformed into unidentifiable identifiers that do not directly reveal identity, and privacy can then be preserved. However, pseudonymization becomes less effective if the original dataset already includes identifying features, such as race, gender, age or marital status. To overcome this limitation, k-Link Anonymity combines multiple variables to form a composite key that identifies individuals uniquely, even if they share certain common features. Similarly, Attribute Release selects a subset of attributes from the dataset, rather than releasing all the available attributes. These techniques may still lose some degree of privacy protection depending on the nature of the underlying dataset and the desired outcome of the analysis.

K-anonymity and l-Diversity
Another approach to ensure privacy during analysis is to apply K-anonymity, which restricts the number of unique tuples in the output that are allowed to appear in the input dataset. For example, if the dataset contains a list of purchases made by customers, applying K-anonymity would prevent any single customer from appearing more than once in the output. Similarly, L-diversity limits the range of values that can be associated with individual features. Both K-anonymity and L-diversity require additional computation resources beyond what is required for standard data analysis, limiting their applicability to smaller datasets or low performance computing environments. They also come with varying levels of privacy protection, ranging from highly selective queries that only retrieve a small portion of the dataset to generalizations that remove potentially sensitive information entirely.

T-Closeness
Finally, another method called T-closeness uses statistical measures to measure the closeness between two datasets, indicating whether they are likely to contain identical sets of tuples or identify individual tuples. While statistically unlikely, T-closeness does not provide exact guarantees regarding equality of sets or uniqueness of individual tuples, making it generally unsuitable for practical use cases outside of scientific research.

2.Encrypted Query Execution
Enabling secure query execution plays a crucial role in modern data analytics systems, as data breaches caused by vulnerabilities or hacking attacks pose significant threats to organizations’ confidentiality and integrity. Although DP provides strong privacy guarantees for individual data points, it remains susceptible to attacks that exploit patterns or correlations in the data. On the contrary, encrypted query execution techniques aim to prevent both data extraction and injection attacks by encrypting data at rest and in transit, respectively.

There exist several well-known encryption schemes, such as AES, DES, 3DES, RSA and ElGamal, that can be used to encrypt database tables and columns. However, these encryption schemes rely solely on symmetric keys, which means that the same plaintext block always produces the same ciphertext block, meaning that intrusion detection systems or other network monitoring tools may easily detect the encryption scheme and decrypt the traffic. Alternatively, hybrid encryption schemes combine public-key encryption techniques with symmetric encryption techniques to provide higher levels of security. Examples of popular hybrid encryption schemes include SSL/TLS certificates and GPG/PGP. Encryption at rest helps to protect data against physical attacks, whereas encryption in transit helps to defend against eavesdropping and interception of communication channels.

To enforce end-to-end encryption, DBMSs often integrate encryption functionality directly into the database management system itself, by encrypting and decrypting data streams at various stages of the query execution process. This way, attackers who gain access to the server’s file system or memory space cannot read or modify the encrypted data until it is decrypted again by the application layer code. Some existing commercial products, such as Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, offer built-in support for encrypted query execution. With this solution, operators simply need to set up appropriate encryption options and add the necessary credentials to establish secure connections between client and server.

3.Distributed Machine Learning Techniques
Distributed machine learning (DL) techniques are widely used in many industries today because of their ability to handle large volumes of data and improve the speed and accuracy of machine learning algorithms. DL exploits the properties of cloud computing to distribute workloads among multiple machines, allowing for faster and cheaper training times compared to single-node implementations. However, DL also entails several risks, including data exfiltration and bias in models generated by participating nodes.

Federated learning (FL) is an emerging DL technique that enables training machine learning models using decentralized data across multiple devices, instead of centralizing the data and model at one location. FL distributes training data across multiple clients, enabling local models to be learned in parallel. It relies on secure multiparty computation (MPC) techniques to share gradients between clients and minimize the risk of exposing private data through exfiltration of encrypted models or colluding node participants. However, FL also introduces risks of unintended leakage of private data through exfiltration of encrypted models, or biased or malicious use of models trained on different subsets of the data.

In recent years, several advanced FL frameworks have been proposed, such as TensorFlow Federated, PyTorch Flower, Apache Spark Federation, MXNet's Autograd, and Google's DeepLearningX (partially based on MPI). Each framework addresses a particular subset of challenges, such as ease of deployment, scalability, and privacy protection. Overall, however, it is essential to carefully consider the tradeoffs involved in adopting FL, including its potential impact on privacy and data security, as well as the right balance between centralization vs decentralization, and mutual trust between clients and servers.

4.Secure Aggregation Methods
Data aggregation is essential in a variety of applications, such as business intelligence, supply chain management, and finance. However, aggregating sensitive data without proper precautions can result in disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors. Traditional data aggregation mechanisms include average, minimum, maximum, median, quantiles, count, summation, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and percentile functions. However, these traditional methods typically assume a priori knowledge of the data distribution and thus do not provide strict privacy guarantees.

A promising alternative is secure aggregation, which combines multiple input values into a single output value without compromising individual privacy. Unlike the traditional methods, secure aggregation protocols keep track of all inputs, removing the need for pre-computation of summary statistics or sampling, improving utility and utility accuracy. Additionally, secure aggregation protocols guarantee privacy even under arbitrary adversaries, eliminating the need for central coordination and storage of global data summaries.

Some existing secure aggregation protocols include Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS), Threshold Cryptography, and Bloom Filters. SSS divides an input value into several shares, which are sufficient to reconstruct the original value if a minimum threshold of shares are present. The protocol takes care of both recovering the correct value and protecting against active attacks such as collusion or oracle attacks. Similarly, threshold cryptography splits a secret into several parts, each held by a different entity, such as a bank or government official. If a minimum threshold of shares is present, the original secret can be recovered without collusion or byzantine behavior by combining the partial secrets. Finally, Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures that approximate set membership tests. They are useful for checking whether an element is a member of a set, but they cannot distinguish between true and false positives. Nonetheless, they offer reasonable performance and can be used for secure aggregation.
