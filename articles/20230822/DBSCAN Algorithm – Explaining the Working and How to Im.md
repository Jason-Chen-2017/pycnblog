DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm is a popular clustering technique used in data mining and machine learning applications. In this article we will be explaining how DBSCAN works under the hood using an example. We also provide code implementation for some common libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pyspark, and R. Finally, we will discuss potential future developments and challenges that can arise due to its non-parametric nature. 

## Introduction:What is Density-based spatial clustering? 

In simple terms, density-based spatial clustering refers to a type of clustering where clusters are formed based on their similarity in space. The idea behind this approach is that dense regions of data points should form separate clusters while sparse regions should be grouped together into a single cluster. In other words, the closer two data points are located within each other's local neighbourhoods, they are more likely to belong to the same cluster. The density thresholds determine at what point two data points are considered to be neighbours or not. This method has been widely used in various fields including image processing, geographic information systems, social network analysis, etc. 

## Basic Concepts & Terminology:
The main components involved in DBSCAN algorithm are:

1. **Data Points:** These represent the objects being clustered. 

2. **Epsilon:** Epsilon represents the maximum distance between two data points for them to be considered related. If any pair of data points fall within this radius, then they are said to be neighbors.

3. **MinPts:** MinPts represents the minimum number of neighbors required for a core object to be identified. An object whose number of neighbors falls below this threshold cannot be considered as a core object since it does not have enough support to form a cluster.

4. **Core Objects:** Core objects are those which have at least MinPts number of directly adjacent points. Among these core objects, further expansion starts from them to create a cluster. 

5. **Border Objects:** Border objects are those which do not have sufficiently many adjacent points and hence they are assigned as noise points during the clustering process.

## Understanding DBSCAN Algorithm:Now let’s understand the working of DBSCAN algorithm step by step.

1. Identify all the seed points i.e., the data points that are close to each other according to epsilon value, and mark them as core points if they have at least minpts direct neighbors. Otherwise, mark them as border points. All border points are marked as outliers.

2. For each core point, expand the search area until you reach a certain distance called “reachability”. Here, all the points that are within epsilon distance from the current core point are added to the candidate list. Now, repeat steps 1 and 2 for each new candidate point until there are no candidates left in the list or till the time limit expires. If a core point has at least minpts number of neighbors within the given distance then it becomes a part of the cluster otherwise it becomes an outlier point.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for every core point until all the points are classified either as core or border. Then return only the core points along with their respective clusters.

Let’s consider an example to illustrate this better.<|im_sep|>

<|im_sep|>

In this example, suppose we want to cluster the following set of data points: 


1. First, identify the seed points:

   - Point 1 belongs to the first group because it is closest to itself. Hence, mark it as core point with respect to the minimum number of neighbors required (minpts). 
   
   - Point 2 does not belong to this group because it has only one neighbor within eps=1.
   
   - Point 3 belongs to the second group because it forms a circle with point 1 and 4 within eps=1.
   
   - Point 4 belongs to the third group because it forms a triangle with point 1 and both other points within eps=1.
   
2. Expand around each core point to find the entire neighborhood.

   - Expand point 1 to include point 3. Since there are only three neighbors within eps=1, point 1 remains a core point.
   
   - Expand point 3 to include point 4. Point 3 now becomes a border point since it has less than four neighbors within eps=1.
   
   - Expand point 4 to include point 1 and the rest of the dataset. Since there are at least five neighbors within eps=1, point 4 becomes a core point and the process continues for all core points.
   
After completing this process, the final result would look like:
