Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns how to make decisions in a dynamic environment by interacting with it through trial-and-error experience. It was first introduced by researchers at Deepmind in December 2013 and has become one of the most popular areas of deep learning research. 

RL algorithms have been used in diverse fields such as robotics, gaming, finance, healthcare, transportation, energy, manufacturing, and industrial automation. In this article, we will explore various RL algorithms that can be used for reinforcement learning tasks. We will cover basic concepts like Markov Decision Process (MDP), Q-learning algorithm, Value iteration algorithm, Policy Gradient algorithm, and DQN (Deep Q-Networks). We will also demonstrate some applications using these algorithms on different problems like grid world game, mountain car problem, and Atari games. Finally, we will discuss future directions and challenges in RL research.


# 2.基本概念及术语介绍：
## Markov Decision Process(MDP)
The MDP model defines the dynamics of an environment as well as the reward function and transition probabilities between states. The state represents the current condition of the environment, while the action takes the agent from the current state to another state based on its policy. Actions influence the next state according to their effectiveness or inefficiency, which results in a corresponding reward signal given to the agent after taking an action. Rewards are typically determined by a scalar value called the "return". Mathematically, an MDP can be defined as: 

S: set of states   
A: set of actions   
T(s'|s,a): transition probability matrix, indicating the probability of moving to state s' from state s when performing action a   
R(s,a): reward function, determines the magnitude of the return obtained by the agent after executing action a in state s   

In summary, the MDP consists of four elements: States, Actions, Transition Probabilities, and Reward Function. An agent interacts with the environment through observations and chooses actions based on its policies. The goal of an agent is to maximize its expected rewards by exploring the environment and finding better policies. 


## Q-Learning Algorithm
Q-learning algorithm is a model free, off-policy control method that tries to learn optimal policies directly from experiences. It works by updating the estimated value of each state-action pair based on the observed reward and then choosing the action that maximizes the estimated reward. This process repeats over and over again until convergence or until the agent reaches the maximum number of iterations. Its mathematical formulation is as follows:

Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + alpha * [r(s,a) + gamma * max_a'(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)] 

where r(s,a) is the observed reward, Q(s',a') is the estimated value of the next state-action pair, alpha is the step size, gamma is the discount factor, and max refers to the highest value among all possible actions in the next state. 

The main advantage of Q-learning is its simplicity and ease of implementation compared to more complex methods such as neural networks. Additionally, it can handle both discrete and continuous action spaces. However, Q-learning does not consider interactions between multiple agents within the same environment. Therefore, it may fail to generalize well if there are several similar environments being learned simultaneously. On the other hand, it requires a relatively small amount of training data to converge. Despite its limitations, Q-learning remains a promising approach for solving many practical problems.  


## Value Iteration Algorithm
Value iteration algorithm is another model free, off-policy control method that uses Bellman's equation to iteratively approximate the optimal values of all state-action pairs. Once the values are initialized, they remain fixed throughout the iterations. The updated values depend only on the current estimate of the value of the previous state-action pair and the immediate reward received upon taking an action. The update rule is as follows:

V(s) <- V(s) + alpha * delta[i] 

where i is the index of the best action a* for state s, delta is the difference between the new and old estimates of the value of the state-action pair, alpha is the step size, and V(s) denotes the value function.

Similarly, the algorithm updates the value of every state iteratively until convergence or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. Unlike Q-learning, however, value iteration does not require access to the full transition probability distribution nor do we need to store any trajectories generated during exploration. Furthermore, since it relies solely on value functions, it does not suffer from the problems associated with Q-learning's assumptions about transitions between states. As a result, value iteration outperforms Q-learning in certain settings.  



## Policy Gradient Algorithm
Policy gradient algorithm is an on-policy control method that aims to find a stochastic policy that maximizes the total expected return under a particular policy. It works by computing the gradients of the logarithm of the expected returns with respect to the parameters of the policy function, and updating them along with the policy parameters using optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The policy function is usually represented as a neural network whose weights correspond to the parameters of the policy. The objective function can be written as: 

J(theta) = E[sum_{t=0}^infty R(tau)] 

where theta is the parameter vector of the policy function, tau is a sequence of states visited following the behavioral policy, and R(tau) is the sum of rewards obtained in each time step. Since the policy is stochastic, we cannot compute the expected return exactly. Instead, we use sample mean approximation to approximate it:

J(theta) \approx E_{\tau \sim P}[R(tau)]. 

The policy gradient algorithm alternates between two phases: the policy evaluation phase evaluates the performance of the current policy, and the policy improvement phase improves the policy based on the evaluated results. During the evaluation phase, we optimize the objective function J(theta) using standard optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam, where theta represents the policy parameters. During the policy improvement phase, we calculate the gradients of the logarithm of J(theta) with respect to the policy parameters theta and apply the gradients to adjust the policy parameters accordingly. By doing so, the algorithm explores the environment and finds better policies that maximize the total expected return. 

The policy gradient algorithm has proven to perform significantly better than Q-learning and other model-free off-policy algorithms in large-scale reinforcement learning tasks. Moreover, it does not rely on approximations or approximated solutions, making it suitable for high dimensional or continuous action spaces. However, it requires careful initialization and hyperparameter tuning to achieve good performance.


## Deep Q-Networks(DQN)
One limitation of Q-learning and related approaches is that they assume a deterministic, stationary environment. If the environment changes significantly due to unexpected events, Q-learning may become less effective. To address this issue, deep Q-networks (DQNs) exploit a deep neural network to represent the Q-function. They work by stacking several fully connected layers, adding non-linearity functions, and optimizing the loss function using techniques such as Adam or RMSprop. Specifically, the input to the network includes the current observation and the action taken, and the output is the predicted Q-value. Training occurs through minibatch sampling, where we randomly select a batch of recent experiences from memory, and backpropagation is performed using the computed targets. Similar to Q-learning, the target function is computed using the Bellman equation:

target = r + gamma * argmax_a(Q(next_state, a))

We also add an additional element to regularize the error term by clipping the Q-values to prevent numerical instability. Overall, DQNs have shown significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of sample efficiency and stability.


# 3.应用案例：Grid World Game
To get started, let’s implement a simple Grid World game in Python using the OpenAI Gym library. Here’s the code to define the game rules and initialize the player position and grid cells:

```python
import gym
from gym import spaces

class GridWorldEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        self.rows = 5
        self.cols = 5
        
        # Set up state space and action space
        self.observation_space = spaces.Discrete(self.rows*self.cols)
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(4)

        # Initialize grid cells and player position
        self.grid = [[' ']*self.cols for _ in range(self.rows)]
        self.player_pos = None

    def reset(self):
        """Reset the environment"""
        self.__init__()
    
    def render(self, mode='human'):
        print('---------------------------')
        for row in self.grid:
            print('|'.join([cell.center(5) for cell in row]))
        print('---------------------------')

    def step(self, action):
        """Perform the specified action and move the player"""
        x, y = self.player_pos
        

        if action == 0:  # Move left
            new_x = max(x-1, 0)
            new_y = y
        elif action == 1:  # Move right
            new_x = min(x+1, self.rows-1)
            new_y = y
        elif action == 2:  # Move up
            new_x = x
            new_y = max(y-1, 0)
        else:             # Move down
            new_x = x
            new_y = min(y+1, self.cols-1)
            
        # Check if the movement is valid
        if self.grid[new_x][new_y]!='':
            done = True
            reward = -10  # Penalty for invalid movement
        else:
            done = False
            reward = -1  # Penalty for standing still
            
            self.grid[x][y], self.grid[new_x][new_y] ='', '*'
            self.player_pos = (new_x, new_y)
        
        obs = self._get_obs()
        
        info = {}
        
        return obs, reward, done, info
        
    def _get_obs(self):
        """Return the current observation"""
        return self.rows*self.player_pos[0]+self.player_pos[1]
```

Now we can create an instance of our GridWorldEnv class and test the game by running `env.step()` repeatedly until the episode ends (`done==True`). For example:

```python
env = GridWorldEnv()
obs = env.reset()
for t in range(10):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    env.render()
    if done:
        break
```

This should display a rendering of a random walker in the grid world game. You can change the number of rows, cols, initial positions of walls, and penalty values to customize the game difficulty.
