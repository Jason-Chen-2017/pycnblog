# 1.简介
  

In this article, we will explore the current research trends in humanoid robotics field related to artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy. We will review and summarize recent advancements in the field of humanoid robotics that make significant progress towards building fully functional and capable social assistants, as well as chatbots with natural language processing capabilities. Finally, we will discuss challenges and future opportunities for advancing the field of humanoid robotics in these directions. Overall, our goal is to inspire researchers and developers alike by providing a comprehensive overview of the most recent advancements in the field of humanoid robotics, while also raising awareness on critical issues facing humanoids as they move forward into an increasingly complex and exciting industry.
The purpose of writing this article is three-fold:

1. To educate the audience about the cutting-edge research advances being made in the field of humanoid robotics, and provide them with a solid understanding of key concepts and techniques used throughout the literature. This can help them develop new ideas or identify existing gaps in their own work.

2. To highlight relevant stakeholders within the industry such as technologists, policy-makers, engineers, designers, managers, ethicists, and patients/clients who are interested in leveraging technology to enhance their lives. This can inform dialogue between different actors and their interests, ultimately leading to greater transparency and interdisciplinary collaboration.

3. To create a technical blog that serves as a reference point for others working in the field of humanoid robotics. It provides a more accessible platform than traditional conferences and journals where research papers and reports are readily available for download but not easy to digest. By sharing information and experiences in a format that is easily understandable, accessible, and engaging, we aim to foster communication across various communities involved in the field. 

Let's get started!
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
Before diving into the core topics of this article, let’s first define some basic concepts and terms that you may encounter when reading articles related to humanoid robotics. These definitions will serve as a foundation for later explanations. 

1. **Humanoid robot:** A mobile manipulator that resembles humans in shape, form, and functionality. Common examples include people-sized humanoids like Staubli PR2 or ABB YuMi, and large animal-like models like Pepper or NAO.

2. **Humanoid behavior:** The way a humanoid robot interacts with its environment and takes actions to accomplish tasks. Examples include navigation, speech recognition, facial expression recognition, gesture recognition, etc.

3. **Artificial intelligence (AI):** Intelligence demonstrated by machines, unrestricted by physical limitations or constraints. A typical application of AI in humanoid robotics includes recognizing faces, gestures, and voice commands to interact with users.

4. **Autonomy:** An ability of a machine or system to operate independently and without human input beyond basic instructions. In other words, an autonomous system functions perfectly even if no operator is present to give it control. Autonomy plays an essential role in improving overall productivity and safety for both humans and machines.

5. **Language model:** A statistical algorithm that predicts the probability of occurrence of words based on past context. Used in natural language processing, language models enable machines to generate text similar to what a person might say. 

6. **Reinforcement learning (RL):** Machine learning technique that enables agents to learn from experience and take actions that maximize long-term reward. RL is commonly applied in training deep neural networks for vision, speech, and reinforcement learning tasks.

7. **Behavior cloning:** A method of teaching a machine agent how to perform specific behaviors by imitating human demonstrations. Behavior cloning often leads to faster learning speed compared to supervised learning methods like traditional machine learning algorithms. 

8. **Open-source software:** Software that allows anyone to view, modify, or distribute source code. Open-source software makes it easier for researchers to collaborate and improve upon each other's work, thereby accelerating scientific progress.

9. **Robot Operating System (ROS):** An open-source middleware framework for robot development. ROS has become the de facto standard for developing real-time, robust systems for interacting with the physical world.

10. **Metaverse:** A virtual space where humans and robots meet and communicate with one another through digital means. Metaverses are becoming ever-more popular due to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence and automation technologies.
