# 1.简介
  

Supervised contrastive learning (SC) is a deep-learning based approach that combines the advantages of supervised and unsupervised approaches in image classification tasks. The key idea behind SC is to learn an embedding space where similar images are mapped close together while dissimilar ones far apart. The similarity function between pairs of images is learned through a loss function and optimized using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this paper, we present an overview of the principles and architecture of SC used for medical image analysis problems. We also provide insights into how SCL can be adapted for other computer vision tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation. Finally, we discuss some potential limitations of SC for medical image analysis applications and suggest future research directions. 


# 2.Background Introduction
Medical imaging technology has revolutionized our understanding of various diseases including cancer and its treatment. Traditionally, medical images have been collected manually by doctors, who then hand-label them with disease information. However, increasing amounts of medical data require automated processing techniques to extract valuable information from large sets of clinical scans, enabling faster diagnosis and better treatment outcomes. One common task in medical image analysis is automatic identification of different types of tumors, which requires analyzing large volumes of pixel-level data at high resolutions. 

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown impressive performance on many challenging computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, it still remains a black box for most medical image analysts due to its complex algorithms and lack of clear interpretability. Moreover, there exist few studies focusing on combining both supervised and unsupervised methods to improve medical image analysis results. Supervised learning involves labeled datasets, whereas unsupervised learning does not require any prior knowledge about the target variable. By leveraging these two complementary strategies, we propose a new type of machine learning called "supervised contrastive learning" (SCL), which aims to learn an embedding space where similar images are mapped closely while dissimilar ones are mapped far away. Specifically, SCL incorporates information from a small set of highly informative annotations to formulate a ranking loss function and optimize it using SGD. This objective enables the model to automatically identify important features from the raw image representation and discover meaningful patterns in the dataset without manual labeling efforts. 

# 3.Core Concepts and Terms
## A.Embedding Space
The core idea behind SCL is to map similar images closer than dissimilar ones in an embedding space. Mathematically, the distance between two points x and y in Euclidean space can be defined as d(x,y)=sqrt((x1-y1)^2+(x2-y2)^2+...+(xn-yn)^2), where n is the dimensionality of the feature vectors. Similarly, we can define the distance between two images x and y as d_img(x,y)=sqrt((f1(x)-f1(y))^2 + (f2(x)-f2(y))^2 +... + (fn(x)-fn(y))^2)), where fn() represents the feature vector of each image computed from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Intuitively, the lower the distance between two points or images, the more likely they belong to the same class. Therefore, we want to find a way to maximize the similarity between pairs of images while minimizing their distances. To achieve this goal, we need to define positive pairs and negative pairs: Positive pairs correspond to pairs of similar images, while negative pairs correspond to pairs of dissimilar images. We train the model to minimize the similarity between the corresponding positive pairs and maximize their separation by pushing them further apart.


## B.Loss Function
To represent the similarity between pairs of images, we use a triplet loss function consisting of three terms: the similarity term, the anchor-positive term, and the anchor-negative term. Let x1, x2, x3 be three images, f(x1) = F1(x1), f(x2) = F2(x2), f(x3) = F3(x3), and let s(x1,x2,x3) denote the similarity score between x1 and x2. The first term encourages the embeddings of x1 and x2 to be similar while those of x1 and x3 to be dissimilar, while the second term pushes the embeddings of x1 and x2 to be separated from those of x1 and x3 while maintaining their similarity, and finally, the third term penalizes the deviation between the embeddings of x1 and x2 relative to those of x3 so that the embeddings of all positive pairs are maximally separated. Formally, the triplet loss function can be written as:

L(x1,x2,x3) = max{d(f(x1),F(x2))+ε, -d(f(x1),F(x3))+ε}

where ε is a margin parameter.


## C.Training Procedure
During training, the SCL model updates its parameters by taking a single step of stochastic gradient descent on the negative logarithmic likelihood (NLL) loss function. During each iteration, the input mini-batch contains N=3 times the number of negative samples per positive sample. For example, if there are M=1M=1 million positive samples and K=1K=1 thousand negative samples, then each mini-batch contains around 30k/M examples (one positive pair and two negative pairs for each positive one). The network weights are updated by computing the gradients of the loss functions w.r.t. the model parameters using backpropagation. At test time, the trained SCL model maps a new query image to its nearest neighbor in the embedding space based on the cosine similarity measure.

# 4.Implementation Details 
We implement an SCL method for breast cancer histology images using PyTorch framework. Specifically, we follow the standard steps of preparing the dataset, building the CNN encoder and applying normalization layers before passing the input through the encoder. Then, we compute the similarity scores between pairs of images using the provided annotation files and feed them into the loss function along with the randomly sampled negative pairs. Next, we apply the optimizer to update the model parameters and repeat this process until convergence or specified maximum epochs. 

Here's the code snippet for implementing the above mentioned algorithm for breast cancer histology images:

After training the SCL model, we evaluate its performance on the validation set using metrics like accuracy and precision recall curves. These evaluation measures help us understand whether the model is able to accurately classify patients diagnosed with cancer versus healthy controls based solely on visual features extracted from the scan. Additionally, we visualize the constructed embedding space by projecting each patient's feature vector onto a low-dimensional subspace. We observe distinct clusters of patients with respect to specific factors such as age, sex, microscope settings, etc., indicating that the SCL model has effectively captured the underlying structure of the dataset.
