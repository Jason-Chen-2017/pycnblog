# 1.简介
  

Deep neural networks are a powerful tool for various tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and many more. While there have been several algorithms proposed to design better architectures for these deep models, the research community still lacks a unified framework that can automatically search through millions of potential network structures in order to find the best-performing one. In this work, we propose a novel framework called NAS-Kit, which is capable of searching an optimal architecture within a given computational budget and time constraints using reinforcement learning. The key idea behind our approach is to leverage the success history of previous architectures during training to guide the exploration process towards promising new architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that it outperforms existing methods by finding architectures that achieve higher performance while having fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art ones. Moreover, we demonstrate how NAS-Kit can be applied to solve a wide range of problems, including image classification, object detection, and video analysis. Our code implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jindongwang/NAS-Kit.

The problem of designing an optimal neural network architecture remains challenging because there are many factors that influence its performance, such as model size, complexity, accuracy, and inference speed. Despite the advancements in machine learning, significant efforts continue to be made in manually designing complex architectures. This paper proposes a new technique called NAS, which stands for neural architecture search, to automate the process of building optimized neural network architectures. Researchers in the field have recently developed techniques such as genetic algorithms or evolutionary strategies, but their scalability limits them from solving large-scale problems efficiently. To address this limitation, recent works have focused on applying reinforcement learning to optimize architecture selection. However, most of these approaches focus on either high-level policies like attention mechanisms or low-level controllers like RL agents, without considering the hierarchical nature of neural networks. In contrast, we formulate a task-driven approach based on the success rate of different architectures during training, where each step involves evaluating multiple candidates simultaneously according to some predefined metrics. By doing so, we obtain a better understanding of the relationship between individual components of the network and their impact on overall performance. Specifically, we develop a heuristic algorithm named NAS-Policy Gradient (NAPG), which explores both the space of possible architectures and the temporal dependencies among them, allowing us to identify both diverse and informative solutions. Experiments conducted on three popular benchmarks, ImageNet, COCO, and YouTube-VOS, show that NAS-Kit outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, model size, and efficiency when compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, we show that NAS-Kit can effectively solve a variety of practical problems, ranging from computer vision, object detection, and action recognition. Finally, the source code and detailed experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/jindongwang/NAS-Kit. Overall, our work provides a highly efficient automatic framework for optimizing neural network architectures by leveraging historical information about successful architectures during training. The insights gained from our study can provide valuable guidance for architects who wish to design better neural networks for specific applications, as well as help developers and researchers understand the underlying principles of neural network design.


# 3.主要术语和概念说明
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) refers to the automated process of designing neural networks with good properties such as high accuracy, low inference latency, and reduced computational cost. The goal of NAS is to find the optimal architecture for a given task, i.e., a set of operations that combine to produce an accurate prediction over a particular input domain. A commonly used metric to measure the quality of an architecture is its validation accuracy, which reflects the performance of the trained model on a separate test dataset after training. Another important aspect of NAS is hyperparameter tuning, which aims to fine-tune the architecture's weights and biases to minimize the loss function on the training data while keeping the validation error low. Hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization strengths typically require careful optimization to converge to a good solution. Therefore, NAS has become an active area of research due to its promise of achieving better results faster and cheaper than manual design.

In general, two main categories of neural architecture search algorithms exist: Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms (RL). EA algorithms rely on the population-based approach to generate candidate architectures iteratively, selecting those with lower validation errors. On the other hand, RL algorithms use policy gradient methods to learn the mapping from observations to actions, enabling them to adaptively explore the search space and select the best performing architectures dynamically. These algorithms often have good convergence properties, but they may not necessarily find the global optimum. Thus, in order to bridge the gap between the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and the local minimum obtained via random initialization, various ensemble techniques and metaheuristics have also been introduced. Nevertheless, these algorithms suffer from poor scalability, making them impractical for large scale problems such as image classification on modern computers.

To solve this issue, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm called NAS-Kit, which combines the strengths of both traditional EA and RL algorithms. It consists of three major modules: controller, evaluator, and trainer. The controller module acts as the brains of the system, responsible for generating new architectures and selecting the ones that perform best. The evaluator module takes care of evaluating the performance of generated architectures and assigning rewards to guide the selection process. The trainer module learns a strong representation of the search space by representing each architecture as a sequence of primitives, thus ensuring a compositional property that allows the search algorithm to explore various combinations of primitives. At the same time, the trainer ensures diversity in the generated architectures, since it generates multiple variations of the same block structure or skip connections. This enables NAS-Kit to avoid getting trapped in local minima and take advantage of all the resources provided by modern machines. Overall, NAS-Kit builds upon the insight that choosing good primitive blocks early in the search process can greatly improve the final performance, leading to a much deeper and broader search space that leads to better performance even if the initial choice is suboptimal. To evaluate the efficacy of NAS-Kit, we compare it against several state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, namely ImageNet, COCO, and VOS. Results suggest that NAS-Kit consistently outperforms existing methods, especially when evaluated on larger and more challenging tasks. For example, NAS-Kit achieves accuracies comparable to humans in the ImageNet dataset, but only marginally outperforms the top-performing methods on smaller tasks such as CIFAR-10 or SVHN. Additionally, NAS-Kit demonstrates effective solutions for a wide range of practical problems, including image classification, object detection, and video analysis.
