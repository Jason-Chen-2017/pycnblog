# 2. Background Introduction
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prominent within the medical community due to the advancement in medical devices such as CT scans, MRI machines, X-rays, and computed tomography scanners. In turn, these technologies are enabling medical professionals to obtain detailed insights into their patients’ medical conditions which could potentially lead to improved treatments. However, while advanced technology improves the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of healthcare, its use creates concerns around ethics, privacy, security, and bias. Therefore, there is a need for careful consideration before implementing any AI system in healthcare. To date, there is no clear definition of what constitutes "healthcare" for the purposes of establishing guidelines for applying AI in healthcare applications. Some researchers suggest that we should distinguish between "medical AI" and "bioinformatics," while others focus only on medical AI. Research continues to expand the scope and complexity of medical AI applications by integrating diverse domains such as biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. With this expansion comes new challenges, and one major challenge facing medical AI developers is ensuring ethical behavior in deployment and operation of their systems. Nevertheless, despite these challenges, medical AI research and development continues to grow rapidly. Below are some of the current research directions in medical AI:

1. Medical Image Analysis - Developing advanced image processing methods and algorithms that enable computers to extract meaningful information from medical images.
2. Biometric Systems - Applying advanced machine learning algorithms to improve authentication processes and prevent fraudulent activity.
3. Predictive Models for Healthcare - Building models that accurately diagnose diseases based on symptoms or lab tests rather than examinations performed by physicians.
4. Patient-Specific Models for Personalized Medicine Delivery - Utilizing machine learning techniques to tailor medication recommendations based on individual patient preferences and lifestyle factors. 
5. Genetic Diagnosis Using Machine Learning - Applying machine learning algorithms to identify genetic mutations causing disease in humans.
6. Natural Language Processing - Converting unstructured text into structured data to automate tasks such as medication dispensing, patient scheduling, and procedural documentation.

To understand how AI is being applied in the medical domain, let's take a deeper look at each of the above topics in detail:
