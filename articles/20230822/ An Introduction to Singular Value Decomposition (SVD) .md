# 1.简介
  

Singular value decomposition (SVD) is one of the most popular matrix decomposition techniques used for data analysis and machine learning tasks such as principal component analysis (PCA), image compression, topic modeling, etc. The SVD algorithm can be considered as a generalization of eigendecomposition that enables us to decompose any real-valued square matrix into three separate matrices with orthogonal columns and rows. In this post we will discuss the basic theory behind singular value decomposition and how it can be applied to various machine learning applications like PCA, recommendation systems, collaborative filtering, and natural language processing. We will also provide detailed examples on how to implement SVD algorithms using Python libraries scikit-learn and numpy. Lastly, we will explore some limitations and future directions of the SVD technique.

In order to make things clearer, let's first define what are the main goals of data science:

1. **Data Exploration**: This involves gathering information about the dataset by performing exploratory data analysis techniques, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualization. 
2. **Data Preparation**: Data preparation refers to the process of cleaning and transforming raw data so that it can be analyzed effectively. This includes dealing with missing values, handling outliers, normalizing data, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Model Building**: Model building refers to the process of selecting suitable models based on statistical criteria, evaluating their performance, and tuning them until they meet the desired accuracy level. There are several types of machine learning models, such as regression, classification, clustering, and recommender systems, each with its own set of challenges and requirements.
4. **Model Deployment**: Once a model has been trained and validated, it needs to be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen data. Model deployment usually involves deploying the model on production servers, integrating it into an existing application or workflow, and monitoring its performance over time. 

All these activities involve working with large datasets containing numerical and textual features. Understanding the fundamental principles behind singular value decomposition (SVD) will help you better understand and apply it to different problems within data science.

# 2.Background
Before diving into the details of singular value decomposition (SVD), it is important to have a good understanding of the context where it is being used. Here are some common scenarios where SVD is commonly employed in data analysis:

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** - Principal Component Analysis is a method used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data while retaining the maximum amount of information. It works by finding the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the original data, which represents the relation between all pairs of random variables. We then select only those eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues, and use them to project the original data onto a smaller subspace. This transformation reduces the dimensionality of the data without losing much information from the original representation. Examples of applications include image compression, stock market prediction, and gene expression analysis. 

2. **Topic Modeling** - Topic modeling is another approach that finds abstract topics underlying a collection of documents. Unlike traditional keyword search approaches, topic modeling focuses more on discovering latent patterns rather than individual keywords. The goal of topic modeling is to find groups of words that frequently co-occur together across multiple documents. By extracting topics from the corpus, we can identify distinct concepts or ideas discussed in our dataset. This can lead to better understanding of complex social phenomena and improve decision making processes. Examples of applications include analyzing customer reviews, mining political discourse, and identifying product categories.

3. **Collaborative Filtering** - Collaborative filtering is a type of recommendation system that predicts user preferences based on their similarity to other users. The key idea here is to recommend items that people who share similar tastes would also enjoy. To do this, we represent each user and item as vectors in a space spanned by the latent factors that capture personal preferences. Then, we calculate the cosine similarity between every pair of users or items, and use this similarity measure to estimate the rating that a user would give to an item. Examples of applications include movie recommendations, music listening history, and shopping cart recommendations.

4. **Natural Language Processing** - Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of AI research dedicated to developing computer programs that can analyze, generate, and manipulate human languages. One of the core tasks in NLP is sentiment analysis, which tries to determine the overall attitude or emotion expressed in a given text. However, there are many practical issues involved in this task, including speech recognition errors, sarcasm, contradictory statements, and idiomatic usage. An effective solution to this problem requires the ability to extract meaningful insights from large corpora of texts, whether they are product reviews, news articles, tweets, or emails. With the aid of SVD, we can perform highly accurate sentiment analysis on large collections of texts. Examples of applications include sentiment analysis of customer feedback, product review analysis, and opinion mining from social media.

# 3.Concepts and Terminology 
## Matrix multiplication

The concept of matrix multiplication plays a crucial role in the SVD algorithm. Simply put, if A and B are two matrices, then their product AB means adding the products of corresponding elements of both matrices. Mathematically speaking, AB = C, where C is a third matrix consisting of elementwise products of corresponding elements of A and B. For example, consider the following two matrices:

$$A=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}, \quad B=\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8
\end{bmatrix}$$

Then, we have:

$$AB=\begin{bmatrix}
1 \times 5 + 2 \times 7 & 1 \times 6 + 2 \times 8 \\
3 \times 5 + 4 \times 7 & 3 \times 6 + 4 \times 8
\end{bmatrix}=C=\begin{bmatrix}
19 & 22 \\
43 & 50
\end{bmatrix}$$

This property holds true for any number of matrices, not just two. Thus, multiplying any number of matrices gives rise to a chain rule of matrix multiplication, i.e., if we write $A_i$ for the $i$-th matrix in the sequence, then:

$$\underbrace{\underbrace{A_1B_1}_{\text{$A_1$ columns times $B_1$ rows}}}+\underbrace{\underbrace{A_2B_2}_{\text{$A_2$ columns times $B_2$ rows}}}+...+\underbrace{\underbrace{A_{n-1}B_{n-1}}_{\text{$A_{n-1}$ columns times $B_{n-1}$ rows}}}+A_nB_n=C_{n-1}\dots C_1 C_0,$$

where $C_i$ denotes the $(i+1)$-st result obtained after multiplying $A_i$ and $B_i$, up to $C_n$ obtained after multiplying $A_n$ and $B_n$.

## Eigendecomposition

Eigendecomposition is the basis of SVD. Given a symmetric matrix $M$, we want to factorize it into two unitary matrices U and V, along with diagonal matrices $\Sigma$ representing the squared singular values of M. More precisely, the diagonal matrix $\Sigma$ contains the squares of the singular values, arranged in descending order of magnitude. The resulting matrices satisfy:

$$MM^T=U\Sigma V^T.$$

It turns out that any square matrix can be factored as $M=Q\Lambda Q^{-1}$, where Q is unitary (orthogonal) and $\Lambda$ is diagonal with non-negative entries. If M is symmetric, then Q is simply equal to its transpose, so we may rewrite this equation as follows:

$$M=QV\Lambda^{1/2}.$$

Thus, if M is positive definite (has a positive semidefinite real Schur form), then it admits an eigenvalue decomposition, which we can use to obtain the required matrices. We will now go through the SVD algorithm step-by-step, starting with the simplest case: the matrix has zero rows or columns.

### Case I: Zero Rows and Columns

Suppose that the input matrix has either no rows or no columns. In this case, we cannot proceed further since we need at least one row and column to compute the SVD. Therefore, we simply return the input matrix as the left singular vector and the identity matrix as the right singular vector. The singular values will always be zero, since we cannot divide anything by zero. Therefore, the SVD reduces to calculating the rank of the matrix. Specifically, we count the number of nonzero singular values. Let me explain why counting nonzero singular values is equivalent to determining the rank of the matrix:

If we encounter a nonzero singular value during the iteration, then it corresponds to a significant contribution to the geometry of the matrix. If we take away this singular value, then we introduce error into the reconstruction of the matrix, which does not reflect the structure of the data well anymore. As such, we should discard this singular value and focus instead on the remaining ones. If we eliminate all nonzero singular values, then the resulting matrix is low-rank, i.e., very sparse. Conversely, if we keep all nonzero singular values, then the resulting matrix is full-rank. Since we don't know how many nonzero singular values we might get during the iterations, we must iterate until convergence and hope that the rank is accurately estimated. Finally, note that even if we only keep the largest k nonzero singular values, the reconstructed matrix still has dimensions n x m, where n and m could be quite large! So it's generally best to throw away all singular values except the largest ones that explain at least 90% of the variance.
