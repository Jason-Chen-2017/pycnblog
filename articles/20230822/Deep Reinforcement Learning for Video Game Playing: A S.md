Finally, we propose concrete actions that researchers and developers can take to build effective and reliable AI-powered entertainment systems powered by DRL. With the aim of inspiring creativity and engaging discussion among experts, we believe this survey will benefit both industry and academia alike in developing DRL solutions for video game playing. 

# 3.背景介绍
Video game playing has become one of the most popular and immensely competitive activities of human existence. Despite being a highly interactive medium where players must manipulate objects, characters, and opponents, traditional AI methods have been limited in their effectiveness in this domain due to factors such as high levels of complexity, lack of proper hardware support, and limited time constraints. To address these limitations, many researchers have attempted to apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to this task. One of the earliest successful implementations of DRL was done by Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo, which defeated the world champion Go player by pure luck through advanced combination of strategies and brute force search. Since then, numerous other DRL approaches have shown promise in improving the performance of computer programs in video game playing. 


One common challenge faced by all DRL approaches for video game playing is ensuring efficient use of available computational resources. For example, many modern architectures rely heavily on graphics processing units (GPUs), making them prohibitively expensive to train on large datasets. Consequently, a major focus in the past few years has been on scaling up existing models using distributed computing frameworks like TensorFlow’s Distributed Training System or PyTorch’s DistributedDataParallel module. While these tools help to reduce the training time required to learn new skills, they still face issues like slow convergence speed, poor performance on heterogeneous hardware, and limited network bandwidth between nodes. To address these problems, newer approaches like parameter server architecture, model compression, and multi-agent learning have been proposed to improve the efficiency of DRL algorithms for video game playing. 


Moreover, although most previous works have focused on increasing the agent’s accuracy in the environment, it is crucial to evaluate not only the agent’s performance but also its behavior during interactions with other agents and humans. The latter aspect requires us to collect a vast amount of data samples and train the system on a large dataset to ensure fair evaluation. Additionally, since the goal of video game play is to immerse the user in the action-adventure genre, many players seek to minimize the number of input signals and interact directly with the environment rather than relying on complex interfaces and controls. These attributes pose unique requirements that cannot be met by standard supervised learning setups. Therefore, active research is needed to design better evaluation protocols for DRL algorithms for video game playing that involve both offline testing and online experiments under different settings. 


Finally, despite being a relatively young field, DRL continues to evolve rapidly. Newer approaches are continually introduced to tackle the ever-growing challenges associated with this new domain. Several open research questions exist in this regard, including how to scale up current DRL algorithms for video game playing to handle larger and more complex environments; what are the best practices for leveraging sparse rewards obtained from sparse observations?; how can we leverage transfer learning for adaptation to diverse environments and contexts?; what changes do we need to make in the underlying game mechanics to allow DRL agents to perform well? All of these issues are important to address, yet there exists no single unified framework for solving them jointly, leaving room for novel ideas and approaches. Nevertheless, the overall progress towards achieving satisfactory results for video game playing demonstrates the viability of DRL for gaining a competitive advantage over traditional artificial intelligence approaches.
