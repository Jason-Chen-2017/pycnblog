## 1.1 概览
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved tremendous success in solving many challenging problems related to robotics and autonomous systems. However, it is still a relatively young area of research where there are few fully-researched algorithms and frameworks available for real-world applications. One particular type of reinforcement learning problems involves manipulating objects or tools in hand, such as grasping, carrying, or assemblying tasks. Despite the recent advances in deep learning techniques and reinforcement learning techniques specifically designed for manipulation tasks, existing solutions are mostly based on indirect approaches that require complex models and environmental representations. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), which learns directly from high-dimensional observations using actor-critic neural networks. By combining policy gradient methods with deep neural networks, DDPG can handle high-dimensional continuous action spaces and learn more robust policies that generalize better to new environments. Our experiments show that DDPG can effectively solve various manipulation tasks and achieve significant improvement over prior art methods. Moreover, we evaluate our method's adaptability to different types of tasks and its ability to transfer learned skills across similar but slightly different environments. 

In this article, we will present the core ideas and concepts behind DDPG, explain how it works mathematically, demonstrate its implementation in code, discuss some interesting insights about its performance, and draw conclusions. We hope that by sharing our work with others, we can inspire them to explore new avenues of research in deep reinforcement learning for advanced robotic manipulation tasks. 


## 1.2 相关工作 Background
### OpenAI Gym
OpenAI Gym (OpenAI Gym, OGG) is an open-source toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides a common interface for training agents to interact with environments, whether simulated or real. It comes preloaded with several classic control environments like CartPole-v0, Acrobot-v1, MountainCarContinuous-v0, and Pendulum-v0, among other robotics and manipulation tasks. These environments provide simple reward signals and do not require realistic physics simulations, making them ideal for testing RL algorithms before applying them to real-world applications. OGG also allows users to create their own custom environments for specific applications. 

Despite being widely used for benchmarking and comparison purposes, OGG was originally designed primarily for robotics and simulation use cases. The provided environments include simple dynamics and rewards, which may not accurately reflect real world scenarios, causing the user to spend time recreating these environments within a more suitable framework. Additionally, most implementations of DRL algorithms rely heavily on libraries like Tensorflow and Keras, both of which have a steep learning curve for beginners and professionals alike. This makes it difficult for non-expert users to quickly apply DRL algorithms to their problem domains. 

### Baselines
Baselines is another popular open source project in the field of deep reinforcement learning. It provides implementations of state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, including A2C, ACKTR, and PPO, and integrates them into the OpenAI Gym ecosystem. It includes built-in support for running multiple instances of parallel processes for faster training, as well as a set of utility functions for logging, plotting, and loading trained agent models. 

While baselines offers a rich selection of algorithms and implementations, they tend to be less focused on solving actual robotics and manipulation tasks than OGG. They also typically train policies using low dimensional inputs obtained through image processing techniques, making them limited in their applicability when dealing with complex physical constraints. Finally, they lack a detailed explanation of key concepts involved in DRL algorithms, making it harder to understand why certain strategies perform better than others. 

### Existing Solutions
There are several promising papers that propose novel algorithms for solving manipulation tasks using deep reinforcement learning:

1. Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning (A3C): This paper proposes an asynchronous version of the multi-step variant of Q-learning, known as A3C. A3C uses multiple threads to run copies of the same network in parallel, allowing each copy to update itself asynchronously without waiting for all other copies to finish computing their gradients. Since multiple workers independently gather experience samples, A3C can take advantage of large computational resources to significantly improve sample efficiency compared to synchronous versions of DRL algorithms like vanilla DQN or double Q-learning. However, A3C requires careful tuning of hyperparameters and is generally considered unstable due to its concurrent execution model.

2. Continuous Control With Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG): This paper introduces a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, known as DDPG. DDPG builds upon the previous attempts at leveraging deep neural networks for function approximation in reinforcement learning, but instead of optimizing the value function separately, DDPG jointly learns a policy function and a separate critic function that estimates the expected return of actions taken by the policy. DDPG explores a wide range of possible actions and leverages exploration-exploitation tradeoff by adding noise to the actions selected by the policy during training. It also uses target networks to stabilize the training process and prevents overestimation of returns by bootstrapping off the estimated returns of future states. While DDPG outperforms standard DQN and double Q-learning in terms of sample efficiency and stability, it remains somewhat memory intensive since it stores transitions observed during training in replay buffers.

3. End-to-End Training of Deep Visuomotor Policies (DVMP): This paper presents a novel approach for end-to-end training of deep visuomotor policies. DVMP takes raw pixel input from an RGB camera and predicts instantaneous forward kinematics parameters of a robot arm given only sparse lidar information. It achieves impressive results even though it does not directly optimize for manipulation tasks. Instead, DVMP relies on latent variable models and adversarial training techniques to learn a mapping between pixels and commands.

4. Hybrid Zero-Shot Transfer (HZST): This paper describes HZST, which combines the strengths of imitation learning and transfer learning to enable zero-shot domain transfer between similar yet distinct environments. It uses inverse reinforcement learning to learn policies that transfer from one task to another while avoiding any biases introduced by direct transfer from demonstrations. It trains policies in a hierarchical manner where each level corresponds to increasing levels of abstraction and captures a smaller subset of the environment's geometry. HZST shows promise in transferring learned skills across similar but slightly different environments, but it suffers from slow convergence due to the iterative refinement procedure required for transfer.
