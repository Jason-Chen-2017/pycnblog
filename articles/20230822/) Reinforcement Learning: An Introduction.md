Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique that allows an agent to learn how to make decisions in a dynamic environment by taking actions and observing rewards. It’s also known as the artificial intelligence technique of trial-and-error or goal-oriented behavior. 

In this article, we will go over the basic concepts, terminology, algorithms used for RL, implementation details, practical applications, and future trends of RL research. We will be using Python programming language throughout this article for its ease of use, readability, and flexibility.  

Before diving into the actual content, let's briefly cover some basics about RL: 

1. Agent: The entity that takes actions in the environment and learns from experience through interactions with the environment.

2. Environment: The world in which the agent interacts with and receives feedback for its actions.

3. Action: The decision made by the agent based on the state it is currently in. Actions can range from simple movements like going left or right to more complex actions such as manipulating objects or navigating mazes.

4. State: A representation of the current conditions within the environment. This includes information such as location, orientation, temperature, light intensity, etc.

5. Reward: The consequence of the agent’s action that determines if it has acted appropriately or not. For instance, if the agent picks up a piece of fruit, it would receive a positive reward; but if it falls down and lands in the ground without picking anything up, it would receive a negative reward.

6. Policy: The algorithm used by the agent to determine what action to take at any given time. In simpler terms, a policy is just a mapping function between states and actions. The purpose of a policy is to guide the agent towards achieving its goals in the environment. 

Now let’s dive into the actual content!
# 2. Basic Concepts, Terminology & Algorithms
Let us begin our discussion by understanding some key points related to reinforcement learning and their corresponding definitions. 

## Key Points Related to Reinforcement Learning
### Markov Decision Process
A Markov decision process (MDP) is a tuple $(S,A,\pi,R,T)$ where $S$ is a set of states, $A$ is a set of actions, $\pi$ is a probability distribution over all possible policies, $R(s,a,s')$ is the expected immediate reward obtained when executing action $a$ in state $s$, and $T(s,a,s')$ is the probability distribution over all possible transitions after executing action $a$ in state $s$. These five components define the MDP. 

The objective of MDPs is to find the optimal strategy for maximizing cumulative discounted reward, i.e., finding the most desirable sequence of actions that results in the greatest long term reward. The optimal policy $\pi_*$ that satisfies the Bellman equation 

$$\forall s \in S, v_*(s)=\underset{\pi}{\max}\left[E[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t|s_0=s]\right]$$ 

where $v_\pi(s)$ denotes the value function associated with policy $\pi$, represents the maximum discounted reward that can be achieved starting from state $s$ under policy $\pi$.

### Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
Value iteration and policy iteration are two popular methods for solving finite MDPs iteratively until convergence. Both methods follow the following steps:

1. Initialize a random value function $V(s)$ for each state $s$ and a random policy $\pi(s)$ for each state $s$.

2. Repeat until convergence:

    a. Update the values $V(s)$ for each state $s$ using the Bellman operator
        
        $$\forall s \in S, V(s)=\underset{a}{\max}\left[R(s,a)+\gamma E_{s'}[V(s')]\right], \forall s' \in S$$
    
    b. Using these updated values, update the policy $\pi(s)$ for each state $s$ according to the greedy policy improvement formula
    
        $$Q_{\pi}(s,a)=R(s,a)+\gamma E_{s'}[V(\pi)]=\underset{a'}{\max}\left[R(s',a')+\gamma V(s')\right], \forall s'\in S, a \in A$$
        
        $$\pi'(s)=\underset{a}{\arg\max}\left[Q_{\pi}(s,a)\right], \forall s \in S$$
        
   c. If the new policy is the same as the old one, terminate. Otherwise, repeat from step 2a).

Policy iteration guarantees convergence to a unique stationary policy, while value iteration may converge to a local optimum depending on the initial guess for the value function. However, both methods require significant computational resources for large MDPs. Therefore, they have been replaced with other approximate solution methods, such as Q-learning, deep reinforcement learning, and model-based reinforcement learning.

### Q-Learning
Q-learning is another powerful technique for solving MDPs efficiently, especially when dealing with continuous or high-dimensional spaces. The main idea behind Q-learning is to estimate the optimal action-value function $Q^\ast(s,a)$ for each state $s$ and action $a$, then use this estimated function to choose the best action at each timestep instead of computing the exact optimal policy. The Q-learning update rule is defined as follows:

$$Q(s,a)\leftarrow(1-\alpha) Q(s,a)+(1-\epsilon+\epsilon/|A|) [r + \gamma max_{a'}Q(s',a')]$$ 

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, $\epsilon$ is the exploration rate, $r$ is the reward received after taking action $a$ in state $s$, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $max_{a'}Q(s',a')$ means the highest action-value function estimate for the next state $s'$ from all available actions $a'$.

Similarly, there exists many variants of Q-learning such as double Q-learning, dueling Q-networks, and prioritized replay.

### Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep reinforcement learning uses deep neural networks to represent the value function and policy functions learned by the agent. Instead of directly computing the function, the agent samples trajectories from the environment and learns to predict the q-values and actions for these trajectories. The main advantage of deep reinforcement learning compared to traditional approaches is that it can handle high-dimensional input spaces and explore the environment more effectively. There exist several types of deep reinforcement learning models such as DQN, DDPG, and PPO.

### Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
Model-based reinforcement learning treats the problem as inference rather than optimization. The agent starts with a prior model of the environment dynamics, and learns to plan a trajectory that minimizes its cost, usually the expected sum of future rewards. The main advantage of model-based reinforcement learning is its ability to generalize beyond training data and tackle sparse or delayed rewards. There exist several types of model-based reinforcement learning techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search and AlphaGo.
