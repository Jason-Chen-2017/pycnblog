# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this article, we will cover the mathematical foundation of SVMs, explaining how they work in detail and illustrating their working with Python code examples. The focus is on understanding the concepts involved rather than an extensive explanation of every aspect of SVMs. If you need more detailed explanations or want to delve into advanced topics like kernel functions, probability estimation, and regularization, then I recommend looking at other resources such as Wikipedia and research papers.

In general, SVMs try to find the best hyperplane between two classes of data points by maximizing the margin around each point. This means trying to maximize the distance between the closest possible decision boundary and the margins. 

For example, let’s say we have two classes of data points: red circles and blue squares. We want to create a classifier that separates them based on some features. One feature could be the radius of the circle while another could be its location along the x-axis. A natural way to do this would be to draw a line perpendicular to one of these features that passes through the middle of each class. However, this approach may not always give us the optimal solution, especially when there is noise or overlap in our dataset.

To overcome these issues, SVMs use a soft margin technique which allows points to be misclassified without affecting the decision boundary. They also take into account the curvature of the data points using kernels, which allow them to handle non-linearly separable datasets.

Overall, SVMs are a powerful tool for solving complex problems that require accurate predictions and ability to handle large amounts of data. By understanding how they work, we can start to build intelligent machines that perform tasks similar to those humans do today.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before diving into the details of SVMs, it's important to understand some basic concepts and terminology related to support vector machines.

## 2.1 Hyperplane
A hyperplane is a flat surface that separates space into two distinct regions. In the context of support vector machines, we typically refer to two types of hyperplanes - linear hyperplanes and nonlinear hyperplanes. Linear hyperplanes are simply lines that split the space evenly between different classes of data points. Nonlinear hyperplanes, on the other hand, consist of complex decision boundaries that cannot be approximated with a straight line.

### Linear Hyperplane
Linear hyperplanes are easy to visualize and formulate mathematically. Consider a dataset with two dimensions:


We can plot a linear hyperplane passing through any two data points in the above graph:


This line is called the decision boundary because it splits the region into two parts based on where the two dots fall. To make things easier to compute, we generally choose two pairs of parallel lines that cross the decision boundary. These are known as support vectors, and together define the entire set of support vectors that lie within the margin.

The equation of a linear hyperplane can be written as `w^T * X + b = 0`, where w is a weight vector and b is a bias term. It is essentially finding the minimum distance from the origin to this plane, given by the formula `-w^Tx - b / ||w||`.

### Nonlinear Hyperplane
Nonlinear hyperplanes are much more complicated, but still defined by some function g(x). For example, if f(x) is a quadratic function of x, then its derivative g(x) has the form `g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c` for some constants a, b, and c. We can represent a nonlinear hyperplane in terms of this form, where y denotes the output variable (either positive or negative), and h(x) represents the decision boundary:

```
h(x) = sign([a;b;c] * [1, x_1, x_2]) = (-1)^y * norm([a;b;c]^T*[a;b;c])^(-1) * [1, x_1, x_2];
```

Here, `[1, x_1, x_2]` is the concatenation of all input variables, and `sign()` returns either -1 or 1 depending on whether the dot product is positive or negative. `norm()` computes the L2 norm of a vector, which gives us the magnitude of the decision boundary. Since we don't know what kind of function g(x) might look like, we assume that it is unknown and must be learned from training data.

### Decision Boundaries
Decision boundaries are critical for SVMs because they determine how well the model can classify new, unseen data. Without clear separation between the classes, a machine learning model won't be able to correctly predict outcomes on new inputs.

When creating a binary classifier, the problem becomes straightforward since we only need one decision boundary. When dealing with multi-class problems though, we often need multiple decision boundaries, one for each class. Common methods include one-vs.-all (OvA) and one-vs.-one (OvO) strategies.

One-vs.-all involves training multiple binary classifiers, one for each class, using OvR strategy. In this case, each binary classifier models the presence or absence of the corresponding class label, and uses a linear combination of the input variables to produce the final prediction.

On the other hand, one-vs.-one involves training a single binary classifier for each pair of classes, using OvC strategy. Each binary classifier tests the presence or absence of a specific pair of labels, and combines the results to generate the final prediction.

Both techniques provide flexibility and improve accuracy compared to a single binary classifier trained directly on all labels simultaneously. While useful in practice, each method comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, choosing the right method depends on the specific task at hand.

## 2.2 Margin
Margin refers to the gap between the decision boundary and the nearest points to it. In simpler terms, it is the amount of free space left outside the decision boundary after including all the training data points. Intuitively, a larger margin indicates better classification performance.

Margin is essential for SVMs because it helps prevent overfitting. Overfitting happens when the model fits too closely to the training data and fails to generalize to new, unseen data. High variance usually occurs due to high degrees of freedom, leading to poor generalization performance. Using a smaller margin forces the model to relax itself and avoid overfitting, resulting in higher robustness against noise.

It is worth noting that margin alone does not necessarily guarantee good generalization performance. Instead, SVMs optimize cost functions that incorporate both margin and other factors such as the width of the margin and the number of support vectors. Cost functions are derived from optimization criteria such as maximum margin or minimum error rate.

## 2.3 Maximum Margin Classifier
Maximum Margin Classifier (MMC) is another name for the simplest version of SVMs. In this variant, the objective function tries to minimize the difference between the distance to the nearest point to the decision boundary and the distance to the next nearest point. MMC minimizes this cost function subject to meeting certain constraints on the weight vector w and the bias term b.

Maximizing the margin effectively turns the decision boundary into a "soft" separator that allows some errors to go unnoticed while rejecting others. It is widely used in text categorization, image segmentation, and bioinformatics applications.

However, the computation time required for optimization is exponential in the dimensionality of the input data, making it impractical for large datasets. Therefore, modern SVM variants typically rely on approximate optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.
