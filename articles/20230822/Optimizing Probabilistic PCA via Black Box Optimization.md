# 1.简介
  

Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is a powerful tool in data analysis and dimensionality reduction. It models the joint distribution of high-dimensional observations as a product of multiple univariate distributions. However, PPCA assumes that each variable has an independent latent Gaussian prior distribution which may not be realistic when we have strong assumptions on the structure of the data or are dealing with complex datasets where the relationship between variables cannot be easily described by simple Gaussians. 

In this blog article, I will introduce you to a new optimization technique called Bayesian Optimization for optimizing probabilistic principal components analysis (PPCA). The key idea behind Bayesian optimization is to use probabilistic models to represent our uncertainty about the objective function and optimize it using samples from the model posterior instead of just one sample at a time. This approach allows us to explore regions of the parameter space that might be better suited for improving the performance of our model. By combining black box optimization techniques such as surrogate modeling and derivative-free optimization algorithms, we can find optimal solutions faster than conventional methods like grid search and random search while still providing good approximations of the true optimum.

# 2.PPCA 模型及其参数估计
## 2.1 概念介绍
Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis(PPCA) is a statistical method used to decompose high-dimensional data into linear combinations of low-rank components, while accounting for uncertainties due to missing values or outliers. Its basic idea is based on the observation that most real world datasets do not follow a normal distribution but possess some degree of non-Gaussianity or heteroscedasticity, resulting in a mixture of different probability density functions for each feature in the dataset. To estimate these multivariate probability densities, PPCA uses a nonparametric kernel density estimator that captures both local and global aspects of the data distribution.

The goal of PPCA is to transform the original multi-variate dataset $\mathbf{X}$ into a set of low-rank vectors $W$ and scalars $\alpha$. Let $\mathbf{Y} = \alpha^T W\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times r}$, then: 

$$\mathbf{X}\approx \mathbf{\tilde X}=\alpha^T W=U \Sigma V^\top$$

where $\mathbf{X}$ is observed and $\mathbf{\tilde X}$ is the projected version of $\mathbf{X}$. Here, $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are orthonormal matrices whose columns span the eigenvectors of the empirical covariance matrix $\frac{1}{n-1}XX^\top$, respectively, while $\Sigma_{ij}$ represents the explained variance ratio of the i-th component. Specifically, $\sum_{i=1}^r \Sigma_{ii}=1$ and $\Sigma_{ij}>0$ for all $i,\ j$.

We can further assume that the joint distribution of the variables in the input dataset follows a product of univariate priors specified through a probability density function $g_i(\cdot)$ for each variable i, denoted by $G_i(\cdot)=\int_{\mathbb{R}} g_i(x)\mathrm{d} x$. Then, assuming that the first $k$ components explain most of the variance, we can write:

$$p(\mathbf{X})=\prod_{i=1}^np_i(\mathbf{x}_i)\quad p_i(\mathbf{x}_i)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^m|\Lambda_i|}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_i-\mu_i)(\Lambda_i^{-1}\mathbf{x}_i-\lambda_i))$$

where $\Lambda_i$ is a diagonal matrix representing the eigenvalues of the m-dimensional inverse covariance matrix of $\mathbf{X}_{:,i}$ adjusted by the Mahalanobis distance metric, and $\mu_i$ and $\lambda_i$ are the mean and log-determinant of the corresponding inverse covariance matrix. We also have $\mathcal{N}(a,\sigma^2)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp(-\frac{(a-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})$. Note that the parameters of the univariate priors $p_i$ depend only on the individual features $\mathbf{x}_i$ rather than on the entire dataset, making them more interpretable and easier to tune compared to non-probabilistic methods. 

## 2.2 参数估计

To perform PPCA, we need to determine the values of the parameters $\alpha$, $W$, $\mu_i$, $\Lambda_i$, and $\lambda_i$ that maximize the likelihood of observing $\mathbf{X}$. We can use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to obtain estimates for the parameters, but since the likelihood function involves integrals over the univariate priors $g_i(\cdot)$, it is difficult to evaluate explicitly. Nevertheless, we can use numerical optimization algorithms to find approximate solutions to the problem. One popular algorithm for optimizing a black box function is Bayesian optimization, which works by constructing a surrogate model for the expensive-to-evaluate function and optimizing it to minimize its predictive error. In practice, we can use stochastic approximation techniques such as tree-based methods or random forests to construct a suitable surrogate model. Once we have optimized the hyperparameters of the surrogate model, we can evaluate the cost function at selected test points using the best value of the hyperparameters found during training. Finally, we can choose the next evaluation point by selecting the sample with the highest expected improvement, which balances exploration of promising regions with exploitation of information from existing evaluations. 

The main steps involved in performing PPCA with Bayesian optimization are as follows:

1. Initialize the parameters $\theta$ randomly.
2. Define the acquisition function $A(\theta)$, which determines how to select the next sampling point given the current state of the optimization procedure. Common choices include Expected Improvement (EI), Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), or Thompson Sampling. 
3. Evaluate the initial design points $\{\theta^1, \ldots, \theta^{M_init}\}$, each corresponding to a trial configuration. These trials should cover a large range of possible hyperparameter configurations, including those close to the best ones found so far. 
4. Construct a surrogate model $f(\cdot; \theta)$ using the initial evaluations, typically using a regression tree or a random forest.
5. Train the surrogate model using gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent, optionally adjusting the learning rate adaptively. Alternatively, we could use conjugate gradient or other quasi-Newton methods directly without doing any additional optimization.
6. Optimize the acquisition function $A(\theta)$ using sequential quadratic programming (SQP) or trust region methods, using the learned surrogate model as the target function. If using SQP, we would update the parameters $\theta$ using backtracking line search or another appropriate strategy depending on the specific nature of the optimization problem.  
7. Repeat step 5 and 6 until convergence criteria are met, or a fixed number of iterations is reached. At each iteration, we repeat steps 3-6 using updated versions of the hyperparameters obtained from step 5, and record the results for later analysis.  

At the end of the process, we should have reasonably accurate estimates of the parameters $\alpha$, $W$, $\mu_i$, $\Lambda_i$, and $\lambda_i$ that maximize the joint likelihood of the input dataset under the assumed joint distribution specified by the univariate priors. We can use these estimated parameters to project new data points onto the subspace spanned by the corresponding eigenvectors and apply standard dimensional reduction techniques such as PCA or t-SNE to visualize the results or identify clusters of similar examples.<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>
