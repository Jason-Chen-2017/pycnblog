Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique used in signal processing to extract independent sources from multivariate data. It has many practical applications such as blind source separation, speech recognition, image denoising, fMRI analysis, and more. Despite its widespread usage, ICA has remained mysterious despite its seemingly magic properties until recently when it was shown that there exists an equivalence between ICA and sparse coding. In this article, we will explain how the two techniques are related mathematically and explore their differences and similarities through concrete examples. We hope this article can provide valuable insights into the role of ICA in today's research landscape and shed new light on some of its surprising properties.
ICA is often referred to as unsupervised learning because it does not require any labeled training data for feature extraction or parameter tuning. Instead, it uses statistical inference to identify underlying factors of variation within multivariate signals using independent components. The basic idea behind ICA is to find directions in the original feature space that maximize variance while minimizing noise, with each component capturing one of these underlying factors. Intuitively, if we treat each observation vector as a probability distribution over a set of latent variables, ICA seeks to estimate the most probable set of latent variables that would generate the observations under some given assumptions about the model structure. By breaking down the problem into small manageable pieces, iterative optimization algorithms can be used to solve for the latent variables and recover the original features.
However, since the introduction of sparse coding techniques in the mid-1990s, researchers have realized that they share several important characteristics with ICA. For instance, both techniques seek to learn low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional inputs by finding compact codes for the observed data. Additionally, both techniques attempt to discover independent information across multiple dimensions of the input, which may better capture the natural variability of the data than ICA alone. Finally, both techniques typically use non-linear transformations of the data to make them amenable to easy interpretation and visualization. Therefore, it is likely that both techniques will continue to evolve in parallel due to their complementary strengths.
In summary, ICA and sparse coding are both popular tools for dimensionality reduction in various fields such as signal processing, machine learning, and pattern recognition. While they differ in terms of goals, approaches, mathematical formulations, and interpretations, they do share several fundamental ideas and principles. With the emergence of deep neural networks and large amounts of annotated data, it is becoming increasingly clear that applying powerful deep learning methods to complex problems requires careful consideration of both the architecture and algorithmic choices. Understanding the interplay between ICA and sparse coding will help us develop more robust and reliable solutions to real-world problems.

Independent component analysis (ICA), also known as Latent Variable Modeling (LVM), is a linear generative model for identifying individual sources of non-Gaussian, noisy, multivariate data. The goal of ICA is to extract independent components that explain the majority of the variations among the observed data. Each extracted component captures one of the underlying factors of variation found in the data. To achieve this, ICA involves three main steps:
1. Data whitening: Standardize the data so that all dimensions have equal contribution to the total covariance matrix. This ensures that the estimated sources are uncorrelated and follow a Gaussian distribution.

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Identify the principal components (or modes) that correspond to the largest eigenvalues of the data’s correlation matrix. These represent the dominant eigenvectors explaining the majority of the variation in the data.

3. Independent Component Analysis (ICA): Use nonlinear functions of the principal components to transform them into statistically independent components, maximizing their individual variances but marginalizing out the shared information captured by other components. The resulting independent components constitute the final result of the decomposition. Mathematically, ICA finds the solution to the following optimization problem:

max Var(W^T*S*W) - min Trace[D_KL(W^T*X*inv(W)*Y)]
where S is the covariance matrix of X, W are the transformation matrices, D_KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, X is the data, Y are the independently generated sources, and * represents the convolution operator.
In practice, rather than optimizing the above objective function directly, ICA relies on iterative updates that converge towards the global minimum. One common approach is to alternately update the weight matrices W and S until convergence. Another alternative is to use maximum likelihood estimation instead of gradient descent. However, both of these approaches are computationally intensive and prone to getting stuck in local minima. Thus, it is necessary to regularize the optimization procedure with appropriate tradeoffs between performance and stability.
The roles of PCA and ICA are different and should be interpreted accordingly. PCA identifies the "true" eigenvectors of the data’s covariance matrix without any additional assumption on the underlying model, whereas ICA additionally imposes constraints on the identified components to enforce independence between them. This allows ICA to perform variable selection and decompose the original data into smaller subspaces that are more interpretable. On the other hand, PCA suffers from biased estimates of the explained variance and can lead to overfitting; consequently, ICA is preferred where interpretability is a primary concern. Overall, ICA and PCA belong to distinct branches of statistical modeling and understanding data is essential for making sound decisions in both areas.
