> "Tensor decomposition" is a powerful mathematical tool for understanding and analyzing large multi-dimensional data sets. In this article, we will use Python to implement the popular CP decomposition method called PARAFAC (Principal Component Analysis using SVD). We will also present an intuitive explanation of tensor decomposition and why it's useful in multidimensional analysis tasks such as image processing or natural language processing. 

In order to get started with tensor decomposition algorithms, I recommend first reading the Wikipedia articles on tensor decomposition, which can provide some contextual information about the concept and its applications in machine learning and natural language processing. You can then start by introducing the basics of tensor decomposition through principal component analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), followed by more advanced concepts such as nonnegative matrix factorization and alternating least squares. Finally, you'll be ready to apply these methods to your own datasets and work towards building more sophisticated tools that make the most of multi-dimensional data sets.

2.环境准备：
To follow along with this tutorial, you need to have Python installed and several libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. If you're not sure how to set up your environment, there are many resources available online, including tutorials on YouTube, websites like StackOverflow, and books like *Python Data Science Handbook*. 

3.基本术语和定义
Before we begin writing code, let's familiarize ourselves with some basic terminology and definitions used throughout tensor decomposition math and algorithms.
## 3.1 Tensors
A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions. A tensor of rank r is an n-dimensional array where each element can be thought of as a scalar value. For example, a three-dimensional tensor would look something like this:
$$T_{ijk} = \begin{bmatrix}t_{i1j1k}\\ t_{i1j2k} \\ \vdots\\ t_{injk}\end{bmatrix}$$
where $t_{i1j1k}$ represents the value at position $(i, j, k)$ of the tensor. The notation T[i,j,k] may also be used instead of T_{ijk}. Note that tensors may also represent higher dimensional structures, such as images, videos, or sound files.

We refer to the size of the tensor as its shape or dimensionality. For example, the shape of a two-dimensional tensor of rank 2 would be ($n_1$, $n_2$), while the shape of a three-dimensional tensor of rank 3 would be ($n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$).

## 3.2 Bases and Coordinates
The basis vectors of a tensor determine what kind of structure the tensor might possess. Each basis vector corresponds to one of the indices of the tensor, and defines a direction or axis of variation. For example, consider the following two-dimensional tensor of rank 2:
$$\begin{bmatrix}x_{ij}\\ y_{ij}\end{bmatrix}$$
Suppose we choose the basis vectors $e_1=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}$, $e_2=\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}$. This means our tensor has two modes of variation - one perpendicular to the x-axis and another perpendicular to the y-axis. Any coordinate system based on these basis vectors could be considered valid representations of this tensor. These bases can also be referred to as latent factors, features, or components.

To construct a tensor from a given basis, we need to specify the coordinates of each mode. Specifically, if $\vec{\beta}_1,\vec{\beta}_2$ are the basis vectors, respectively, and $c_{1j}, c_{2j}$ are the values associated with those basis vectors in each of the m samples, we can define the corresponding tensor as follows:
$$T(\vec{\beta}_1,\vec{\beta}_2)=\sum_{j=1}^m c_{1j}\vec{\beta}_1+c_{2j}\vec{\beta}_2$$
This formula expresses the same tensor as before, but now we've expressed it in terms of only two base vectors and their respective coordinates. It's important to note that the ordering of the basis vectors matters - the order of the coordinates must match the order of the basis vectors used to create the tensor. For example, $\vec{\beta}_1$ should correspond to the first index of the tensor and $\vec{\beta}_2$ should correspond to the second index, regardless of whether the original tensor had all three indices or just two.

## 3.3 Kronecker Product
The kronecker product is a very important operation in tensor algebra. Given two tensors $A$ and $B$, the kronecker product combines them into a new tensor of rank $r'=r_a+r_b$:
$$C_{\alpha\beta}=A_{\alpha_1\alpha_2...r_a}B_{\beta_1\beta_2...r_b}$$
where $\alpha=(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_r)$ and $\beta=(\beta_1,...,\beta_r)$ denote arbitrary labels for the indexes of the resulting tensor. This formula uses the Cartesian products of the sets $\{1,...,r_a\}$ and $\{1,...,r_b\}$ to generate all possible combinations of indices, making it straightforward to understand and visualize. 

Note that the shapes of the input tensors must satisfy certain conditions in order for the kronecker product to be defined. For instance, if $A$ is of shape ($n_1$, $n_2$) and $B$ is of shape ($p_1$, $p_2$), then $AB$ cannot exist unless both sizes are equal or one of them is a scalar. Similarly, the number of elements in the output tensor depends on the total number of possible combinations of the individual indices, so the space complexity grows quickly as inputs grow larger. Therefore, tensor decomposition techniques aim to reduce the complexity of tensor operations without losing accuracy or interpretability.
