Support vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for classification or regression problems. In this article we will explain what SVM is and how it works. We’ll also show you how to visualize data using a scatter plot with support vectors highlighted on top, which can help you understand better your problem and improve your model's performance. At the end of this article, you will have a clear understanding of SVM by analyzing its key concepts, working examples, and visualizations. Let's get started!

2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Firstly, let us discuss some basic concepts and terminology related to SVM before going into further details:

What is SVM?
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models that are used for both classification and regression analysis. They work by finding the hyperplane in higher dimensional space that separates the two classes well while maximizing the margin between them. SVM has many advantages compared to other classification methods like logistic regression, decision trees, etc., such as robustness to outliers, ability to handle high-dimensional data efficiently, ease of interpretation, and kernel functions to transform non-linear data into linear features easily. 

How does SVM Work?
SVM uses a technique called "Kernel Trick" to transform the input data into a higher dimensional feature space where the data becomes separable. The algorithm finds the maximum marginal hyperplane by computing the inner product of the transformed data points over all possible pairs of instances in the training set. To classify new instances, the distance from each instance to this plane is computed using dot product.

The Hyperplane
Hyperplanes are planes that separate data points into two classes based on their features. A hyperplane consists of at least three points, whereas an n-dimensional hyperplane consists of exactly n+1 distinct points. If there exists no straight line that separates these points without intersecting any existing point, then they must be contained within a lower-dimensional subspace embedded within R^n. It is important to note that if the dataset contains more than one cluster, the hyperplane may not be able to perfectly separate those clusters unless additional constraints are added during training.

Support Vectors
The support vectors refer to the data points located closest to the hyperplane and responsible for creating it. These data points determine the direction and position of the hyperplane and are therefore critical for defining the optimal boundary between different classifications. 

3. Core Algorithm and Operation Steps
Now that we have discussed the basics of SVM and its operation steps, we will now dive deeper into how it works under the hood. Here's how the core algorithm works:

Step 1: Kernel Function
Before we can apply SVM, we need to preprocess our data so that it fits within the constraint imposed by the hyperplane equation. This involves applying a transformation function known as the kernel function K(x, x'). 

K(x, x') = <phi(x), phi(x)>
where <.,.> represents the dot product operator. Phi(.) is the mapped version of x that takes care of the specific structure of the original input space. For example, if we have two variables x1 and x2, we might choose to map them into polar coordinates, resulting in the following kernel function:

K(x, y) = r1*r2 exp(-gamma*(theta1 - theta2)^2)
where gamma controls the shape of the decision boundary and r1 and r2 are the radial distances between corresponding input points x and y, respectively, and theta1 and theta2 are the angles between the lines connecting x and y with the positive x-axis and negative y-axis, respectively.

To use this kernel function, we simply compute the inner product of each pair of preprocessed data points K(x, x') over all possible pairs of instances in the training set. This results in a higher dimensional feature space where the data becomes separable.

Step 2: Optimization Problem
We want to find the hyperplane that best separates the data points. We optimize the objective function F(w) subject to some constraints C(w). The optimization problem can be written as follows:

min_w F(w) s.t. C(w) <= 0
Here w is the weight vector representing the coefficients of the hyperplane, F(w) is the objective function that measures the separation between the classes, and C(w) is the constraint function that specifies the properties of the hyperplane.

One commonly used formulation of the objective function is given by:

F(w) = \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^m max\{0, 1-y_i w^Tx_i\}
Where C is the regularization parameter that controls the tradeoff between misclassification errors and slack variable infeasibilities. The sum inside the max function represents the number of misclassified data points (hinge loss function). By setting C to zero, we obtain the primal formulation of SVM, but it becomes unstable when C is large due to small variations in the solution caused by numerical instability. Therefore, C is usually chosen small enough so that the solution remains numerically stable.

For soft margins, we use the hinge loss instead of the L2 penalty:

max_{|w|=1} min_i {1-y_i f_i(w)} + epsilon \|w\|^2
where f_i(w) = x_i^T w and epsilon > 0 is a small constant used to promote solutions with fewer support vectors. Soft margins allow the hyperplane to move away from the support vectors, but still remain close to them.

To solve this optimization problem, we use various techniques, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), subgradient methods, conjugate gradient method, and interior point methods. Different choices of hyperparameters, such as the choice of kernel function and regularization parameter, can affect the convergence rate and accuracy of the model.

Step 3: Prediction
Once we have trained the model using the training set, we can use it to predict the output values of new instances x'. We first preprocess x' using the same kernel function K(x', x'), and then compute the dot product between x' and the learned hyperplane w^T x' to make a prediction.

4. Code Example and Explanation
Let's take an example dataset containing two blobs of data points, separated by a linear separator. We can generate such a dataset using scikit-learn library in Python. Then we'll fit a SVM classifier using the sklearn implementation of SVM. Finally, we'll visualize the data along with the support vectors, which highlight regions where the decision boundary is being violated.

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Generate random data
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=[[-2,-2], [2,2]],
                  cluster_std=0.4, random_state=1)

# Fit SVM classifier
clf = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1e10) # Using linear kernel
clf.fit(X, y)

# Visualize the data and decision boundary
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
ax.set_xlabel('Feature 1')
ax.set_ylabel('Feature 2')
ax.set_title("Linear Decision Boundary")

# Calculate slope and intercept of decision boundary
w = clf.coef_[0]
a = -w[0]/w[1]
xx = np.linspace(-5, 5)
yy = a * xx - (clf.intercept_[0]) / w[1]
ax.plot(xx, yy, color='k', linestyle='--', label="Decision Boundary")

# Plot support vectors
ax.scatter(clf.support_vectors_[:, 0], clf.support_vectors_[:, 1],
           edgecolors='black', facecolors='none', linewidths=1, label='Support Vectors')
ax.legend();
```

Output:


In the above code snippet, we generated random data using `make_blobs()` function from `sklearn.datasets`. We passed two sets of centers (`centers=[[-2,-2], [2,2]]`) and assigned them labels `[-1, 1]` because we want to distinguish between the two datasets.

Next, we initialized an object of type `SVC` and passed it the `'linear'` value for `kernel` argument. Since we wanted to avoid overfitting, we set the `C` hyperparameter very high (`C=1e10`). This means that the penalty term for SVM will be almost zero and we don't want any regularization. After fitting the model on the data, we calculated the slope and intercept of the decision boundary using `clf.coef_` and `clf.intercept_` attributes.

Finally, we plotted the data points along with the decision boundary using `ax.scatter()`. Additionally, we marked the location of the support vectors by plotting them separately using `ax.scatter()` with `edgecolors='black', facecolors='none', linewidths=1`, and labeled the figure accordingly.
