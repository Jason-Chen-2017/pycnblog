The rise of open-source software and its applications in recent years has led to a significant shift in the way developers approach software development. Developers are now required to have skills such as programming languages, database management systems, networking protocols, and web technologies at their fingertips through online tutorials, documentation, code examples, forums, social media platforms, etc., which can help them build complex applications quickly and effectively using pre-built modules or tools available on various open source platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc. In this article, we will discuss some key concepts related to open-source application development and walk you through building an end-to-end chat application from scratch using Node.js and MongoDB. This is not just another tutorial that teaches you how to use these frameworks; it's more about understanding fundamental principles of developing modern web applications with modern tools and techniques. You'll also learn how to structure your project directory and organize your codebase efficiently so that it follows best practices and is easy to maintain over time. We hope that by sharing our experiences with beginners, you'll be able to get started with your own projects without feeling intimidated by the sheer size of the world out there. 

In summary, if you're looking for an introduction to developing real-world web applications using popular open-source technologies like Node.js and MongoDB, this article should provide a good starting point. By the end of reading this article, you should feel comfortable setting up your own project, writing clean, organized code, and learning about common pitfalls and best practices during app development. Good luck!

# 2.基础知识点
To understand why people choose to develop open-source software, let's first talk briefly about some basic technical terms used in this field. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Programming Language:** A programming language is a set of instructions that tells a computer or device how to perform specific tasks, such as adding numbers, displaying text, manipulating data, and interacting with users. There are many different programming languages used today - including C++, Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, and Swift among others. Each one has its own syntax, semantics, and functionality, making it essential to choose the right language depending on the type of task that needs to be performed. Popular choices include JavaScript (front-end), Python (back-end), and PHP (server-side).

2. **Web Technologies:** Web technologies are those involved in creating websites and web applications, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.), and server-side scripting languages like PHP or Node.js. These technologies enable developers to create interactive user interfaces, connect to back-end APIs, store data securely, manage sessions, and much more. It's important to choose the correct combination of technologies based on the requirements of your project - do you need to handle user authentication? Do you want to integrate third-party services like Google Maps or Facebook Login? Decide accordingly before moving forward. 

3. **Operating System:** Operating Systems (OSs) are the software programs that govern the hardware resources of a computer. They control processes, allocate memory, coordinate inputs/outputs, and protect against errors. Different OSes vary in complexity, features, and usage patterns, but most operating systems share a few core components such as file systems, command line interface, and shell environment. Depending on your level of expertise and interest, choosing the appropriate OS may impact your choice of development environments and toolchains. Popular options include Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android.

4. **Package Managers:** Package managers are automated tools that simplify installation and updating of software packages. Their main purpose is to streamline the process of installing libraries, dependencies, compilers, and other software packages needed to compile and run software. Some package managers commonly used in the open-source community include npm (Node.js package manager), Composer (PHP package manager), Pip (Python package manager), and NuGet (Microsoft.NET framework package manager). 

5. **Version Control Systems:** Version Control Systems (VCSs) track changes made to files over time, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if necessary. Git is one of the most widely used VCSs, along with Mercurial and Subversion. Popular repositories hosting sites like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket offer free private repositories for individuals and small teams who don't require full version control capabilities.

Now that you've got a high-level understanding of some of the basics behind open-source software development, let's dive into the details of building a real-world web application using Node.js and MongoDB.

To demonstrate how to build a real-world web application using Node.js and MongoDB, we'll create an end-to-end chat application that allows users to communicate in real-time. The following steps will guide us through the creation of this application step by step:

## Step 1: Set up the Environment
Before getting started, make sure you have installed both Node.js and MongoDB on your system. If you haven't already done so, follow these steps to install each of these tools:

1. Install Node.js by downloading and running the installer from the official website. Make sure to check all the boxes while installing to ensure you have everything you need.
2. After Node.js is installed, verify that it is working by opening the terminal/command prompt and typing `node -v`. If the output shows a version number, then Node.js was successfully installed.
3. Next, install MongoDB by downloading the community edition from the MongoDB website. Follow the prompts to select your preferred download method, platform, and architecture. Once downloaded, extract the contents and place the mongod executable in a location that's included in the PATH variable.

Once you have verified that Node.js and MongoDB are correctly installed, you're ready to move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Create the Project Directory
Open a new terminal/command prompt window and navigate to the desired parent directory where you want to create your project folder. Then, run the following command to create a new directory called "chat-app" inside it:

```bash
mkdir chat-app && cd chat-app
```

This creates a new directory named "chat-app" and switches to it using the `cd` command. 

Next, initialize a new git repository for this project using the following commands:

```bash
git init
```

This initializes a local git repository and starts tracking any changes you make to the project. 

## Step 3: Initialize the Project Dependencies
For this application, we'll be using two main dependencies - Express.js and Socket.io. To add these to our project, run the following command:

```bash
npm init --yes
```

This creates a default package.json file for our project with all the necessary configuration settings filled in.

Next, install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express socket.io body-parser mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken express-jwt passport passport-local mongodb
```

This installs the requested packages locally within our project directory. Since we specified `--save` option after the name of each dependency, they will automatically be added to the package.json file.
