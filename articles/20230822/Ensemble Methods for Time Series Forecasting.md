# 1.简介
  

Ensemble methods (EM) is a class of machine learning algorithms that combines multiple models to improve predictive performance and reduce variance in predictions. In time series forecasting, ensemble methods can be used as an alternative to traditional supervised learning techniques such as linear regression or decision trees. The basic idea behind ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several weak learners (i.e., individual models with high bias but low variance), which will hopefully yield more accurate and reliable results than any one model alone. The two main types of ensemble methods are bagging and boosting. Bagging involves combining multiple instances of the same algorithm, whereas boosting involves training multiple models on different subsets of the data and then combining them based on their performance on hold-out test sets. Both bagging and boosting can lead to improved forecasts by reducing the variance of the final prediction.

In this blog post, we will present a brief overview of bagging and boosting methods for time series forecasting. We will explain how they work in detail using mathematical formulas and provide Python code examples for implementing both methods. Finally, we will discuss potential future directions of research in these areas. 

This article assumes some familiarity with time series analysis concepts like seasonality, trends, autocorrelation, etc. It also requires at least intermediate level knowledge of Python programming skills.

# 2.Background
Time series forecasting refers to predicting future values of a variable over a period of time. There are various approaches to building time series models including autoregressive models, moving average models, ARMA models, exponential smoothing models, and neural networks. However, it is not uncommon to use a combination of multiple models together to achieve better accuracy and reduce variance. This approach is known as ensemble methods. Ensemble methods involve combining multiple models to produce better forecasts, typically by aggregating their outputs into a single result. Two major categories of ensemble methods are bagging and boosting.

Bagging (bootstrap aggregation) is a technique whereby a base learner is trained on bootstrap samples of the original dataset. Each bootstrap sample contains a subset of the observations from the original dataset, allowing each instance to be repeatedly sampled with replacement. The key advantage of bagging is its ability to decrease the variance of the resulting aggregate estimate by aggregating the output of many models trained on slightly different datasets. In other words, bagging trains multiple models on overlapping partitions of the data, leading to reduced variance compared to single models trained on the whole dataset. Additionally, bagging can handle complex relationships between variables by taking into account all available information rather than relying solely on individual models. For example, if we have two dependent variables A and B, we can train separate models for each variable separately and then combine their outputs through averaging or weighted averaging.  

Boosting is another type of ensemble method that uses iterative algorithms to convert weak learners (models with low error rates) into strong ones. Boosting works by sequentially applying weights to each observation in the dataset, which allow subsequent iterations to focus more on difficult cases and less on those that were already handled well by previous iterations. Boosting achieves this by combining the predictions of multiple models, where each model tries to correct the mistakes of the previous iteration. Overall, boosting is particularly effective when there is uncertainty in the predictions due to noisy data or intermittent events. Boosting has become widely popular among data scientists because of its robustness and simplicity compared to bagging.

# 3.Terminology and Mathematical Background
Before diving into implementation details, let's first understand some of the terminologies and math behind bagging and boosting. 

## Terminology 
**Bootstrap Sample:** When bootstrapping a dataset, we randomly resample the dataset with replacement. This means that every observation has an equal probability of being included in the new dataset. The size of the bootstrap sample is usually set to be equal to the size of the original dataset.  

**Base Learner:** A base learner is simply a machine learning algorithm that makes predictions given a labeled input. In bagging, each base learner is trained on a bootstrap sample of the original dataset. In boosting, each base learner takes into account the errors made by previously trained models.

**Weak Learners:** Weak learners are base learners that make poorly correlated predictions. In bagging, weak learners have high variance (i.e., they do not capture the overall structure of the data well). In boosting, weak learners often have high bias, making them prone to overfitting.

**Strong Learners:** Strong learners are base learners that perform well even when combined with many weak learners. They capture the underlying pattern in the data without overfitting.

## Math
### Bagging 
Bagging is done by creating multiple bootstrap samples from the original dataset and training a separate model on each bootstrap sample. These models may have overlapping feature spaces, so they should share some features. During testing, we take the mean or median of the predicted outcomes of the constituent models to obtain the final forecast. The general formula for calculating the final forecast is:

$$\hat{f} = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B f_b(x^*)$$

where $f_b$ is the predicted outcome of model $b$, $B$ is the number of bootstrap samples, and $\hat{f}$ is the final forecast value.

Here's the step-by-step process of performing bagging on a simple dataset:

1. Bootstrap the original dataset n times to get a total of n bootstrap datasets.
2. Train a model M on each bootstrap dataset.
3. Test the model M on the original dataset and compute the mean or median of the predicted outcomes. This gives us the final forecast value $\hat{f}$.

Let's consider an example. Suppose we have a simple dataset containing only three observations with values [2, -1, 3]. To create a bootstrap sample, we choose random indices i ∈ {1,..., n} uniformly at random and include the corresponding observations. For example, if we choose i=1, our bootstrap sample would be [-1, 2, 3] while if we choose i=2, our bootstrap sample would be [2, 3, -1]. 

1. To create a bootstrap sample of the original dataset, we repeat steps 2 and 3 above for k=1,...,n. 
2. Consider a bootstrap dataset Sk obtained by selecting observations with indices i=(1/n),...,floor((n-1)/n)*j*n, j=1,...,n and i+1,...,(n-1)/n. In our case, K=1 and Sk=[-1, 2, 3].
3. Train a model Mi on Sk, say Linear Regression on Sk={[-1, 2, 3]}=<-1,2,-1> to predict y=2|X=-1. Note that X is represented as a column vector {-1}.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for additional bootstrap datasets, say Sk={(3/-1),(-1/2)}=<-1>, Sk={(2/3),(3/-1)}, Sk={(2/-1),(3/2)}.
5. Compute the mean or median of the predicted outcomes to obtain the final forecast value $\hat{f}$. Since we have only one actual target value y=2, and the predicted outcomes are [<y>=<-\infty,+\infty>, <-\infty,+\infty>, <-\infty,+\infty>] respectively, we can compute $\hat{f}=mean(\pm\infty)=nan$.

The formula for computing the standard deviation of the predicted outcomes is similar, giving us the following formula for obtaining the standard deviation of $\hat{f}$:

$$Var[\hat{f}] = Var\left[\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B f_b(x^*)\right] \\
              = \frac{1}{B^2}\sum_{b=1}^B Var[f_b(x^*)] \\
              = \frac{\sigma_{\epsilon}^2}{B}$$
              
### AdaBoost 
AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is another ensemble method that builds upon boosting. It starts by initializing all instances with equal weight, essentially assuming that each instance is equally important. It then applies a sequence of weak classifier transformations to each instance, adjusting the weights assigned to misclassified instances during each round until convergence. The primary difference between AdaBoost and ordinary boosting is that AdaBoost assigns higher weights to early misclassified instances, which focuses on difficult cases instead of misclassifying easy cases early. Adaboost updates the weights of each instance using a weighted error rate. The updated weights are then normalized to sum up to 1. Let's assume we have m iterations and i denotes the ith iteration.

1. Initialize weights w1=1/m, wi=1/(m−i+1) for i=1,...,m;
2. For t=1 to T do
   a. Train weak classifier G(x) on the weighted training set Xw, using the current weights w; 
   b. Evaluate the error rate E(t,G) on the weighted test set Xwt, using the current weights wt;
   c. Update the weights wi = wi * exp(-ei), where ei = log(1/E(t,G));
   d. Normalize the weights to ensure that they sum up to 1.
3. Output the final hypothesis H(x) = sign(∑_im=1^Mwi G(x)).

Note that AdaBoost does not require cross-validation or leave-one-out validation for choosing hyperparameters, since the adaptive nature of its update rule allows it to adaptively select appropriate weights per iteration.
