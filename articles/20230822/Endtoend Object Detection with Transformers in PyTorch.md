# 1.简介
  

Object detection refers to the process of locating and identifying multiple objects present within an image or a video. It has many applications such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, and face recognition. However, traditional computer vision methods often suffer from low accuracy, high computational complexity, long training time, and poor real-time performance. In recent years, transformer networks have shown impressive results in natural language processing (NLP) tasks and are proposing new paradigms for computer vision problems. 

In this article, we will explore how transformers can be applied to object detection tasks using PyTorch library. We start by providing a brief overview of transformers and then describe how they can be used to build end-to-end object detectors. Finally, we provide insights into object detection architecture design principles that enable transformers to perform well on object detection tasks. 

Overall, our goal is to give readers a comprehensive understanding of how transformers work and their potential use cases in computer vision, particularly in object detection domain. The key takeaway message is that transformers may provide better solution than traditional techniques for addressing these challenging computer vision tasks. 


# 2.Transformer Networks

In order to understand transformers in detail, let’s first recall some basics of NLP:

1. Word embeddings: Each word in a sentence is represented as a vector embedding. These vectors can capture semantic relationships between words. For example, two similar words like “apple” and “banana” would likely be closer together in space compared to unrelated words like “cat” and “dog”. Word embeddings can also capture contextual information about each word in the sentence.

2. Embedding layers: A common technique for capturing both local and global relationships between words is to train separate embedding layers for each token in the vocabulary. This leads to large number of parameters which makes it difficult to learn complex relationships across all tokens. Transformer networks address this issue by training one single shared embedding layer that captures both local and global relationships between tokens.

3. Positional encoding: Positional encodings add positional information to the embedding vectors. They help the model to reason about the relative position of words in the sentence. Without the positional information, the model wouldn’t know that the second element in the sequence has more significance than the first element. Additionally, since the transformer model doesn’t explicitly consider any sequential structure in its representation, the positional encoding helps it generalize better on longer sequences without relying on recurrence or convolution.

4. Encoding layers: Encoding layers are the main building blocks of transformer networks. Each encoding layer consists of multi-head attention and feedforward layers followed by residual connections. Multi-head attention enables the model to jointly attend to different representations of the same input sequence from different positions. Feedforward layers apply linear transformations to the output of the attention layer to map it to a desired dimensionality. Residual connections ensure that the output of each layer remains unchanged. 

5. Decoding layers: Similar to encoding layers, decoding layers are used in decoder-only models like seq2seq models. Decoder layers include multi-head attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feedforward layers alongside residual connections. The output of the previous decoding layer serves as input to the current decoding layer.

Let's now summarize the above concepts in terms of transformers:

1. Input embedding: The input sequence is embedded into fixed length vectors through a learned embedding table. 

2. Positional encoding: Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to capture the order of the inputs.

3. Encoder layers: Multiple encoding layers follow wherein each layer applies multi-head attention followed by feedforward layers to produce enhanced feature maps.

4. Output pooling: The output features produced by the final encoding layer are pooled and fed to a fully connected layer for classification or regression. 

The overall structure of the transformer looks something like below:<|im_sep|>
