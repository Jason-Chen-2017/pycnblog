# 1.简介
  

Gradient boosting is an machine learning technique used to create models in supervised learning tasks by combining multiple weak learners or base models. It works by sequentially training models on the errors made by previous models. The final model tries to minimize these errors and produce a more accurate prediction. 

In recent years, gradient boosting has become one of the most popular algorithms for predictive modeling due to its high accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness in dealing with complex datasets. However, it suffers from some drawbacks such as slow convergence speed, lack of interpretability, and overfitting problem when applied to imbalanced datasets or noisy labelled data. In this article, we will discuss about gradient boosting machines (GBMs), which are based on decision tree regression techniques and have been proven to work well even in highly imbalanced datasets while also being able to handle noisy labelling issues efficiently. GBM can be classified as a type of boosting algorithm that combines several weak regressors into a single strong predictor.

## 2.1.Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithm
Gradient descent optimization algorithm is used to find optimal weights or parameters of a function by iteratively updating them until they converge to their local minima. There are many variants of the algorithm including stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and mini-batch gradient descent, which update the weights after computing gradients over small batches of the dataset instead of the whole dataset at once. These updates reduce the variance of the estimates and hence improve the overall performance of the algorithm. We use SGD in our implementation.

## 2.2.Boosting
Boosting refers to a set of algorithms where each learner produces a contribution to the final outcome by correcting the mistakes made by the previous learners. In other words, it involves creating new models that focus on misclassifying the instances that were predicted incorrectly by the existing models. During each iteration, the newly trained model focuses on reducing the error rate of the existing ones. The final result obtained by adding these predictions together forms a weighted average, known as the aggregate. Therefore, boosting is a type of ensemble method where several models combine to make better decisions. Boosting is widely used in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis. 

## 2.3.Weak Learner
A weak learner is a simple model that can perform reasonably well on the given task but is not very powerful. Weak learners usually don’t have enough capacity to capture all the underlying patterns in the data. This characteristic makes them less prone to overfit than complex models like neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines. One common approach to construct a composite model using multiple weak learners is called AdaBoost. AdaBoost uses a sequence of weak learners, each of which attempts to classify instances correctly, alongside with a weight associated with each classifier. The weights are adjusted so that subsequent classifiers focus on those examples whose predictions are incorrect. AdaBoost often achieves good results even when the number of weak learners is limited. For example, if there are only two classes present in the data, then AdaBoost creates two models – one for positive samples and another for negative samples. Similarly, if the data contains categorical variables, AdaBoost constructs separate models for each category, making it useful for handling structured outputs.

## 2.4.Decision Tree Regressor
A decision tree regressor builds a series of rules, similar to how humans build decision trees to solve classification or regression problems. At each node of the tree, it tests whether a specific feature value is greater than a certain threshold. If the condition is true, then it follows the left branch; otherwise, it goes to the right branch. Each leaf node represents a unique predicted value based on the observations in that region of space. Decision trees can handle both continuous and discrete features, and they do not require any pre-processing of the input data before fitting the model. They tend to be easy to interpret and explain since they show what factors contribute most to the predicted outcomes.

## 2.5.Imbalanced Data
Imbalanced data occurs when the distribution of data points among different classes is significantly different from one another. When the dataset contains skewed classes, it affects the ability of the majority class to provide significant information to the classifier during training. Moreover, it leads to poor generalization performance of the model and hinders the development of reliable insights through interpretation methods. Imbalanced data typically arises when the cost of false negatives outweighs the benefits of having a large number of informative positive cases. Handling imbalanced datasets requires techniques such as resampling, undersampling, or oversampling. Resampling consists of duplicating minority class samples, whereas undersampling discards minority class samples while oversampling duplicates majority class samples.

## 2.6.Noisy Labels
Noise means unintended variations or errors in data collection procedures. Label noise is caused when the actual label assigned to an instance differs from the ground truth label available to the researcher. Noisy labels cause bias in the training process because they introduce ambiguity to the model. To avoid such issues, researchers need to address the following challenges:

1. Identify and remove noisy labels early in the process: Detection of noisy labels can help to identify erroneous annotations early on, preventing them propagating throughout the analysis pipeline. 

2. Employ domain knowledge: Domain experts can provide guidance on how to clean up noisy labels automatically or manually assign appropriate values depending on the context and purpose of the project. 

3. Address data quality issues: Exploratory data analysis techniques can reveal potential data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent formats, and duplicate records. Tools such as OpenRefine can assist in cleaning up such issues. 

4. Evaluate and mitigate errors: Establishing benchmarks and metrics to evaluate the impact of noisy labels can help detect and eliminate biases in the model's predictions. Additionally, algorithms such as Bayesian filtering can be used to estimate the probability distributions of relevant variables conditional on the presence or absence of noisy labels.
