# 1.简介
  

This article will guide you through the process of building a deep learning based product search engine that suggests relevant products to users based on their query in real-time. The search engine will be powered by Elasticsearch as its backend database, Keras for training neural networks, and PyTorch for running inference on input data. We will also use various libraries such as Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, and Gensim. 

In this tutorial, we will cover: 

 - Setting up Elasticsearch with Docker
 - Defining the Schema and Indexing Data into Elasticsearch
 - Training Neural Networks using Keras
 - Running Inference using PyTorch
 - Integrating Elasticsearch with Flask application
 - Deploying the complete Application

 Note: This is only a high level overview and all the details will be explained throughout the article. However, if you have any questions or doubts while going through the article then feel free to ask them at the end of each section. 

By the end of this article, we will build a powerful and user-friendly product search engine powered by deep learning techniques and ready to integrate with other applications. If you are interested in this topic, let's get started!



# 2. Prerequisites & Assumptions
To follow along with this tutorial, you need to have the following tools installed locally: 

 - Docker (to run Elasticsearch)
 - Python (>=3.6)
 - pip
 - virtualenv

You can install these dependencies by executing the following command in your terminal: 

```bash
pip install docker virtualenv
```

It would be helpful if you are familiar with the following topics: 

 - Basic understanding of machine learning algorithms and concepts like neural networks, optimization functions, backpropagation etc.
 - Knowledge of web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask framework. 
 - Understanding of Elasticsearch concepts like indexes, mappings, shards, replicas, documents, queries etc.

Before moving forward, it is important to note down some key assumptions and limitations of our solution: 

 - Our search engine assumes that there exists one pre-populated dataset containing information about products and their features.
 - We assume that the user will enter a valid query which contains at least three words.
 - For demonstration purposes, we will train our model on a small subset of the entire dataset but when deployed in production, we would want to train our model on the entire dataset so that it can provide better suggestions.  
 - When displaying the results, we will display only the top N most relevant products. Currently, we are using Elasticsearch's default scoring mechanism which returns relevance scores for each document matching the search query. 

With those assumptions in mind, let's move ahead and start setting up our environment.<|im_sep|>

# 3. Environment Setup
## Step 1: Install Docker
Make sure Docker is properly installed on your system. You can download and install it from here: https://www.docker.com/get-started. Once done, verify if Docker is successfully installed by opening a terminal window and typing `docker --version`. It should print out the version number of Docker. If not, try rebooting your system.

## Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
Create a new virtual environment for this project. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment. Then execute the following commands to create a new virtual environment named "product_search" and activate it:

```bash
virtualenv product_search
source product_search/bin/activate
```

Note that every time you open a new terminal window, you'll need to activate the virtual environment first before running any commands inside it. To deactivate the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate` in the terminal.

## Step 3: Install Required Packages
Install the required packages inside the virtual environment by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install elasticsearch flask keras nltk pandas numpy scikit-learn gensim torch transformers
```

These packages include:

 - Elasticsearch: A powerful distributed indexing and searching service.
 - Flask: A lightweight web development framework used to create our REST API endpoints.
 - Keras: An open source library for training neural networks.
 - NLTK: A natural language processing toolkit built on Python.
 - Pandas: A fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use data analysis and manipulation tool.
 - Numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
 - Scikit-learn: A popular machine learning library for Python.
 - Gensim: A popular library for topic modeling and similarity detection.
 - Transformers: A popular library for state-of-the-art transformer models.
 
We'll make use of some more specific packages later on in the tutorial.

## Step 4: Download Dataset
Download the dataset you want to use for training and testing the model. We'll use the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset provided by Kaggle. You can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews/downloads/amazon_fine_food_reviews.csv/1. Save it in the same folder as your script.

Next, let's set up the Elasticsearch container and index the dataset.<|im_sep|>
