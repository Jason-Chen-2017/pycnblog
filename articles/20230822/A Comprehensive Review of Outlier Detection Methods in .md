Outlier detection is one of the most crucial tasks for various applications such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection in many fields including finance, biology, medicine, marketing, and e-commerce. However, outlier detection methods are often complicated and computationally expensive in high dimensional data with large sample sizes. In this paper, we will review several commonly used outlier detection algorithms in high dimensional data to provide a comprehensive view on their advantages, limitations, and usage scenarios. 

This article reviews four popular outlier detection algorithms: PCA based algorithms (LOF, LDOF), distance-based algorithms (KNN, IForest), cluster-based algorithms (DBSCAN), and hybrid algorithm using ensemble learning technique. We will also discuss how these algorithms handle multi-class problems and compare them against each other by evaluating their performance metrics. Finally, we present some case studies where these algorithms have been applied successfully to real-world datasets to demonstrate their effectiveness.

The main goal of this review article is to provide an organized and comprehensive view of existing outlier detection techniques that can be applied efficiently and effectively in high-dimensional data analysis. This review paper could serve as a reference tool for practitioners who need to select appropriate outlier detection methods for different types of data sets, including financial, healthcare, social media, IoT sensor networks, etc., and further understand the strengths, weaknesses, and usage scenarios of each method. The information provided here should help researchers and developers better understand the challenges and opportunities associated with applying outlier detection methods to high-dimensional data analysis, and accelerate the development of new advanced techniques and tools for practical use cases.

To summarize, the proposed approach includes: 

1) Overview and characterization of outlier detection algorithms;

2) Detailed description of common outlier detection algorithms and comparison between them;

3) Presentation of results obtained through experiments comparing selected algorithms against each other; and finally, 

4) Evaluation of pros and cons of each algorithm according to its suitability for specific application domains and dataset characteristics. Additionally, we also analyze their efficiency, robustness, and scalability properties under different conditions such as noise levels and dimensionality reduction techniques. By analyzing the various approaches, we hope to guide future research efforts towards more effective and efficient solutions for handling outliers in high-dimensional data. 

Overall, our objective is to create a well-organized and comprehensive report that provides clear insights into current state-of-the-art outlier detection methods for high-dimensional data analysis. Moreover, it promotes discussion about the strengths, weaknesses, and potential uses of these methods across various application areas and emphasizes the importance of careful consideration when selecting or combining multiple algorithms for optimal performance.

# 2.背景介绍
## 2.1 高维数据分析中的异常检测
Outlier detection is defined as identifying individual observations which deviate significantly from the overall distribution or pattern of a given set of data. It has widespread applications in diverse fields such as finance, biology, medicine, marketing, and e-commerce. Outlier detection plays a critical role in detecting erroneous or rare events occurring in unusual circumstances. Examples include credit card fraud, stock market crashes, malware infection, network traffic abnormalities, botnets activities, and natural disasters such as terrorist attacks. Identifying these events before they become bigger issues would greatly benefit organizations involved in preventing and responding to these incidents. 
In recent years, there have emerged numerous techniques and models to identify outliers from high-dimensional data. These techniques involve measuring distances between individual points and clustering groups of similar objects together, thus allowing us to identify patterns and trends in the data without relying on prior knowledge or assumptions. There are two main categories of outlier detection algorithms in high-dimensional data:

1. Distance-based algorithms: These algorithms measure the distances between data points and identify those that lie farther away from all others. Popular examples of these algorithms include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Isolation Forest. 

2. Cluster-based algorithms: These algorithms group similar objects together into clusters and then identifies outliers within those clusters. Popular examples of these algorithms include DBSCAN and HDBSCAN. 

Distance-based and cluster-based algorithms are both non-parametric methods, meaning that they do not rely on assumptions such as normally distributed data or linear relationships among variables. They also offer faster processing times than parametric models like linear regression and logistic regression. Both techniques can handle high-dimensional data with millions of features or even billions of records. 

However, these algorithms may not always perform optimally in every scenario. For example, if the data contains outliers with respect to the rest of the population, or if we want to extract meaningful insights from sparse and noisy data, traditional statistical tests might not work well. To overcome these limitations, researchers and developers have developed several ensemble learning techniques that combine multiple outlier detection algorithms to produce more accurate results. These techniques typically require additional computational resources but enable greater flexibility and accuracy in outlier detection compared to single models. The next section describes several ensemble learning methods that can be used to improve outlier detection performance.

## 2.2 集成学习方法
Ensemble learning is a type of machine learning strategy that combines multiple models or predictions to produce more accurate results than any individual model alone. Commonly used ensemble methods include bagging, boosting, stacking, and variants of these strategies. Each of these methods involves training multiple models on subsets of the original data and aggregating their outputs to form a final prediction. Some of the key benefits of ensemble methods include improved generalization ability, reduced variance, and stability.  

Two main types of ensemble methods exist in the context of outlier detection: Bagging and Boosting. 

### 2.2.1 Bagging 方法
Bagging is a basic ensemble method in which bootstrap aggregation is performed, which means that a subset of the input samples is drawn repeatedly to generate a number of synthetic datasets. Each synthetic dataset is used to train a separate base learner, resulting in a small set of aggregated predictions. The final output is usually combined via majority vote or averaging to obtain the final result. One advantage of bagging is that it reduces the chance of overfitting due to the diversity of the trained models. Another advantage is that bagging produces stable and consistent results even when subsets of the data are randomly sampled. Nevertheless, bagging is sensitive to noise and limited by the low bias of individual learners. Therefore, bagging can perform poorly when the data contain irregularities or outliers. Furthermore, bagging requires relatively long training times compared to other ensemble methods. 

### 2.2.2 Boosting 方法
Boosting is another ensemble method in which sequential learners are trained in sequence to generate a series of pseudo-residuals or errors. The learners focus on correcting the errors made by previous learners, leading to a cumulative improvement in the overall performance of the system. AdaBoost, Gradient Tree Boosting (GBT), and Random Forests are three widely used boosting methods. AdaBoost and GBT are adaptive versions of gradient descent and decision trees respectively, which aim to reduce bias and variance during training. Similar to bagging, boosting can handle noisy and incomplete data well since it trains each learner on a weighted version of the entire dataset. However, boosting does not guarantee that the final output is unbiased, which makes it less suitable for situations where we care about the exact fit of the model to the training data. Despite these drawbacks, boosting continues to be one of the most popular ensemble methods for outlier detection. Overall, the choice of ensemble method depends on the nature of the problem, available computing resources, and desired level of interpretability and explainability of the final output.
