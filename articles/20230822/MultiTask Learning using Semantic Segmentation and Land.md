Defect detection is a crucial step towards the industrial sustainability and quality improvement of manufacturing plants. In this article, we propose a multi-task learning framework combining semantic segmentation and landmark regression to automatically detect defects in manufacture lines at high precision levels. We first utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based models for semantic segmentation, which segment out different parts of an image into classes such as background, tool holes, and surface damage areas. Next, we train a linear regressor model on top of the CNN output to predict coordinates of important points such as center of gravity or key features. The two tasks are then combined together by training a multi-task neural network that jointly considers both outputs. This approach significantly improves the performance of defect detection compared to single task methods like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models alone. Our experiments with synthetic data show that our proposed method achieves good results compared to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, MSE loss, and evaluation time. 

In addition to this, we have also performed extensive experimental evaluations on real manufacturing plant images to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed technique. We found that our method can effectively identify various types of defects present in the raw material supply chain process. For instance, it can correctly classify tool holes in painted surfaces while ignoring non-defective pixels or uninteresting regions. Additionally, our method has shown promising results in identifying broken tools and loose parts along with their location within the surface damage area. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the combination of deep learning techniques with geometrical information about the objects is a powerful way to achieve accurate and precise defect detection in manufacturing processes.

* **Semantic Segmentation**: It refers to the process of partitioning an input image into multiple overlapping segments with distinct semantic labels. It helps to understand the contents and relationships between different components of an object in an image. A common application of semantic segmentation is image classification where each pixel in the image represents a class label. In contrast to traditional image recognition systems, where images are flattened before being fed through complex convolutional neural networks, semantic segmentation allows us to preserve spatial contextual information and highlight the relevant details in the image. Examples of popular architectures used for semantic segmentation include UNet, Mask R-CNN, and DeepLab V3+.<|im_sep|> 

* **Landmark Regression**: It refers to the problem of estimating the location of an object’s keypoints or important landmarks without directly using any annotation. A common use case of landmark regression is facial landmark detection, where the goal is to accurately localize the four corners of a face in an image. Landmark regression algorithms typically learn a set of weights to map the input image to its corresponding landmark locations. Another application of landmark regression is 3D human pose estimation, where the goal is to estimate the position and orientation of the human body joints in a 2D image. Recent advances in deep learning techniques have enabled the development of new machine learning models for these applications.<|im_sep|> 

* **Multi-Task Learning**: It refers to the scenario where we simultaneously train several related tasks using a single neural network. Each individual task learns from only a subset of the total dataset, thereby requiring less computational resources than when training separate networks independently. The final prediction is made by aggregating all the predictions obtained by the individual tasks. One example of a commonly used architecture for multi-task learning is a Siamese network, where we have two inputs, x and y, and we want to learn a similarity function f(x,y). Given pairs of inputs (x1,y1),..., (xn,yn), we compare each pair to obtain a similarity score r1,..., rn. The final prediction is obtained by aggregating the scores using some aggregation function, say average().<|im_sep|>

Our proposed solution combines deep learning techniques with geometric knowledge about the objects in order to improve the accuracy of defect detection in manufacturing lines. Specifically, we first use CNN-based models to perform semantic segmentation on the raw input image, which partitions the image into different classes such as background, tool holes, and surface damage areas. We then use a pre-trained ResNet-50 backbone network trained on ImageNet dataset for feature extraction followed by global pooling layers. Global pooling layers extract features from the entire image rather than just the receptive fields associated with certain objects. These extracted features are fed into a dense layer with softmax activation to produce class probabilities per pixel. Finally, we combine the predicted probability maps with the bounding box coordinates generated by the CNN model to generate refined estimates of the defect locations. To ensure robustness against variations in lighting conditions and shapes, we apply random horizontal flip augmentation during training and test time. This brings significant benefits due to the symmetry breaking property of convex polytopes. 

We use another linear regression model called the Linear Regression with Prior Knowledge (LRP) to make final predictions on the fault localization task. LRP assumes that the keypoints or landmarks detected in an image belong to one of a fixed number of predefined categories, i.e., left eye, right eye, nose tip etc. Unlike the previous approaches where the keypoint detector was independent of the underlying classifier, in our case, the same keypoint detector is used to provide prior information for the regression model. Therefore, we reuse the pre-trained detector and do not need additional fine tuning for this purpose. During training, we minimize the mean squared error between the predicted keypoint locations and the true values provided by the dataset. At test time, we simply return the predicted keypoint locations computed by the linear regression module.<|im_sep|>
