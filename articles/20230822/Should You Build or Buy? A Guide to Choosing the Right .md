What is an analytics platform and what does it mean to build a platform vs buying one? This article will help you understand the differences between building your own platform versus choosing a platform from a provider. Throughout this guide, we'll explore how to make informed decisions about whether or not to build or purchase an analytics platform that best meets your business needs. 

To start, let's define what an "analytics platform" means: An analytics platform refers to software infrastructure designed specifically to support data collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of large amounts of data, typically coming from multiple sources and used by businesses for decision-making. It can be as simple as a database or server running specific applications such as tableau or Power BI, but more complex platforms may involve specialized hardware, cloud computing services, and integrated tools that are optimized for working with big data.

Building your own analytics platform requires significant resources and expertise, but provides great flexibility and control over your data processing pipeline. However, building an effective analytics platform can also be costly and time-consuming. In contrast, purchasing an off-the-shelf solution like Tableau Server or Google Data Studio allows you to get up and running quickly and spend less on ongoing maintenance and support.

In summary, if you have the technical skills necessary to build a robust and scalable analytics platform, it's always worth considering using these existing solutions instead of starting from scratch. On the other hand, if your requirements are simpler or limited, then getting access to a pre-built platform might save you both money and effort. Whether you choose to build or purchase a platform, it's important to focus on meeting the core business goals first, and only after that consider additional benefits that come along with a dedicated team, dedicated hardware, or better customer service.

Before diving into the details of building or purchasing an analytics platform, here are some key questions to ask yourself:

1. What type of organization do I work for?
2. How much volume of data do I need to process daily or monthly?
3. What types of products or services should my platform provide?
4. Do I already have a clear strategy or roadmap for growing my product or service?
5. Will my platform need to scale rapidly or remain stable throughout its lifetime?

These answers will help inform your decision about whether to build or buy an analytics platform. By answering these questions and understanding the importance of maintaining a strong technology foundation, your organization can ensure that they are building a high-quality, reliable platform that delivers value to their customers. Let's dive into the details...


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1. Cloud Computing Services
Cloud computing is a model where remote servers are hosted on the internet rather than being physically located within a company's data center. The term was coined in 2006 by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which launched their cloud computing offering in 2006. Nowadays, there are several different cloud computing offerings available, including Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services. These platforms allow organizations to rent virtual machines, known as instances, and use them to host various applications and databases.

The primary advantage of using a cloud computing service over a physical server is that you don't have to worry about managing the physical hardware required to run the server, nor do you have to maintain any software patches or updates. Instead, you can simply log onto the cloud provider's website, select the type of instance and amount of memory needed, and start using the application immediately. Additionally, cloud providers generally offer greater security measures through encryption protocols and intrusion detection systems, making it easier for companies to store sensitive information securely.

Aside from providing quick provisioning and easy scaling options, cloud computing offers several advantages compared to traditional hosting models. First, it can reduce capital expenditures by allowing organizations to pay only for the compute power they actually utilize. Second, cloud computing enables you to easily migrate your applications to new platforms or regions without having to worry about downtime or installation issues. Finally, cloud providers often offer flexible pricing structures that enable organizations to optimize costs based on demand and usage patterns. Overall, cloud computing has become increasingly popular due to its ability to handle massive volumes of data and meet the ever-increasing demand for modern analytics solutions.

## 2.2. Big Data Frameworks and Tools
Big data is a relatively new field that describes an environment in which large datasets are generated frequently, requiring advanced technologies and frameworks to extract valuable insights. Typical examples include social media interactions, sensor networks, web logs, and IoT devices. The big data ecosystem consists of several components, including frameworks like Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Cassandra, as well as tools like Presto, Hive, Impala, and Zeppelin. Each framework or tool addresses a particular area of big data processing, such as distributed file systems, real-time analytics, or machine learning algorithms. Each component brings unique benefits depending on the context in which it is used, so it's essential to carefully evaluate each option before selecting the right combination for your organization.

Hadoop and Apache Spark are two leading big data frameworks that were originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley and Yahoo! respectively. They are built upon the MapReduce programming model and offer efficient ways to process large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware. Both frameworks provide APIs for Python, Java, Scala, and R, making them ideal choices for working with big data in enterprise environments.

Hive, Presto, and Impala are three commonly used query engines that work directly on top of HDFS, Hadoop Distributed File System, a centralized distributed storage system. Presto provides fast SQL performance and eliminates the need for complex ETL processes, while Hive and Impala provide SQL-based querying capabilities and can scale horizontally to handle larger datasets.

Zeppelin, another open source project, provides an interactive notebook interface for data exploration and visualizations, similar to Jupyter Notebook. It supports multiple languages, including SQL, Python, and Scala, making it an excellent choice for data analysts who prefer to write code rather than interact with a command line interface.

Overall, big data frameworks and tools represent a wide range of options for handling large volumes of unstructured data and generating meaningful insights. While each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, selecting the most appropriate ones for your business depends on factors such as data size, complexity, frequency of change, and skillset availability. For example, if your organization is focused solely on analyzing textual data, then you may want to use a lightweight framework like Apache Spark to improve processing speed and lower latency. Alternatively, if you're looking for a solution that integrates with external systems and third-party tools, then you may need to opt for a full-fledged enterprise platform like Cloudera or Hortonworks.
