# 1.简介
  

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular clustering method that can identify clusters and outliers based on density distribution in the dataset. In this article, we will be implementing the DBSCAN algorithm from scratch and applying it to various datasets for clustering analysis. We will also discuss some key factors affecting the performance of DBSCAN algorithm including epsilon value and minimum number of points.

We assume you are familiar with basic machine learning concepts like data preprocessing, normalization, feature scaling, etc., as well as Python programming language. If not, please refer to previous articles or tutorials before continuing with this one.

## Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise(DBSCAN)
DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. It is an unsupervised clustering technique used for identifying groups of similar data points in large datasets without any pre-defined cluster centers. 

The basic idea behind DBSCAN is to find areas of high density that are separated from areas of low density by regions called “dense regions”. A point is considered dense if at least minPts points are within its Epsilon distance radius, where Epsilon is a user specified parameter known as the neighborhood radius. The dense regions are then assigned to individual clusters, while remaining non-dense points are marked as outliers.


## Epsilion（ε）
Epsilon is a measure of the maximum distance between two points for them to be considered neighbors. Points whose distances are less than ε belong to the same core region. Epsilon is determined using either a distance metric such as Euclidean Distance or Manhattan Distance, or using a density based criterion such as the inverse of k-nearest neighbor density estimate (KNN-ID). For small values of eps, many points may be considered as being in different clusters, whereas for larger values of eps, close points will form dense regions and hence become more difficult to separate.

## MinPoints （minPts）
MinPoints specifies the minimum number of points required to form a dense region. Points that do not satisfy this criteria are classified as outliers or noise and do not belong to any cluster. Decreasing the value of minPts increases the robustness of the algorithm but also reduces the size of the resulting clusters.

## Attributes（属性）
Attributes are characteristics or features of the data objects which are relevant to the problem being solved. Each object has multiple attributes associated with it, each corresponding to a particular dimension. Since these attributes define the intrinsic geometry of the data space, they play a significant role in determining whether or not a point belongs to a specific group. Attributes may include continuous variables such as age, income, temperature; categorical variables such as gender, occupation; or ordinal variables such as ratings. Attribute information should be provided in advance to help the algorithm understand the underlying structure of the data and identify appropriate clustering patterns.

In summary, DBSCAN works as follows:

1. Select a starting point
2. Find all points within the Epsilon radius of the selected point
3. If there are at least minPts points in this neighboring set, mark the current point as part of a dense region
4. Expand the search outwards from the dense region until no new points are found within the Epsilon radius
5. Assign a unique ID to each dense region and label all non-dense points as noise

For our implementation below, we will use scikit-learn library's implementation of DBSCAN algorithm. We need to install it first if it isn't already installed on your system. You can install it using pip command - `pip install scikit-learn`. 
```python
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
import numpy as np
```
## K-means clustering vs DBSCAN
Both K-means and DBSCAN have their advantages and disadvantages depending upon the type of dataset and application. While both algorithms aim to create clusters of similar data points, they differ slightly in terms of how they approach finding the optimal solution.

1. Performance: K-Means requires specifying the number of clusters upfront, whereas DBSCAN finds clusters automatically without requiring prior knowledge about the number of clusters. Additionally, DBSCAN does not require explicit specification of the number of dimensions to work effectively, making it suitable for data sets with varying dimensionalities. 

2. Scalability: Both algorithms scale linearly with the increase in the number of data points. However, K-Means has trouble handling large datasets due to the requirement of calculating centroids after every iteration, whereas DBSCAN can handle very large datasets efficiently thanks to its efficient processing of only those points that are potentially involved in creating a cluster.

3. Novelty Detection: When dealing with novelties or rare cases in a dataset, K-Means becomes prone to generating incorrect clusters. This is because K-Means assumes that all data points belong to a fixed number of Gaussian distributions representing each cluster. Hence, when encountering a previously unseen data point, K-Means will most likely classify it incorrectly since it cannot match it with any existing cluster. On the other hand, DBSCAN is insensitive to the order of data points and does not rely on assumptions regarding the probability distribution of the data. Instead, it uses the local density around a given point to determine if it forms a cluster. Thus, it is resistant to the presence of outliers and allows for easy identification of novelties in the data.

Conclusion: While both K-means and DBSCAN have their own strengths and weaknesses, the choice of one over the other depends primarily on the requirements of the project at hand. K-Means may perform better when the goal is to identify predetermined numbers of clusters, while DBSCAN may perform better when it is important to capture complex relationships and subgroups across multiple dimensions.
