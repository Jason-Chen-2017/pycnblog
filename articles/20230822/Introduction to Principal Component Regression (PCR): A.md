# 1.简介
  

Principal component regression (PCR) is a type of linear regression that involves transforming the input data into new orthogonal variables called principal components. The primary goal of PCR is to identify which principal components explain most of the variance in the dataset and use them as predictor variables while discarding those that do not. This can be useful for reducing the dimensions of high-dimensional data by identifying patterns among the variables with greater predictive power than other variables. In this article, we will focus on an example of using PCR for analysis of cement materials data set from a reservoir simulation model. We also hope to provide practical insights and lessons learned from applying PCR in practice.

## 2.1 Principal Component Analysis（主成分分析）
PCA is one of the most commonly used techniques for analyzing multivariate data sets. It is often used to reduce the number of variables by finding a small subset of the original variables that capture most of the information in the data set. These reduced variables are known as principal components and represent different directions in the data space where there exists some correlation between the variables. PCA involves two steps: 
1. Centering the data matrix: The first step is to center the data matrix around its mean so that each feature has zero mean. This makes it easier to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the highest eigenvalues, which correspond to the principal components. 
2. Finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues: Once the data matrix is centered, we calculate its covariance matrix and then extract its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Eigenvalues describe how much each eigenvector explains the variation in the data along its direction. We typically choose the top K eigenvectors based on their eigenvalues to form our principal components. 

We can visualize these principal components graphically using scatter plots colored according to their corresponding labels or continuous variable. 

Once we have identified the principal components, we can project the data onto these components and obtain low-dimensional representations of the data that capture most of the variability. Here, we refer to these projections as scores or loadings. 

## 2.2 Linear Regression with Principal Components (PCR)
In PCR, we take the raw inputs x1,x2,…,xn and compute the correlations between them to obtain a correlation matrix R. Next, we perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on R to obtain three matrices U, Σ, V^T such that R = UVΣV^T. The columns of U span the same subspace spanned by the principal components, i.e., UUT = I (where I is the identity matrix). Thus, we can express xi in terms of the principal components as uiΣi/σij*xj for all pairs of i,j, but only keep ui's for which σij > τj, where j indexes over the squared deviations from the diagonal of Σ, and τj denotes the maximum value of σij across all i,j. If no i satisfies σij > τj for any j, then all ui's will be kept. Intuitively, we select only those principal components that contribute significantly to explaining the observed variations in the data. Then, we fit a linear regression model on the selected principal components instead of the raw input features. This reduces the dimensionality of the problem and may lead to improved performance due to sparsity of the solution.


## 2.3 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of several hundred samples of cement material properties measured during a reservoir simulation model run. Each sample contains eight variables related to the physical characteristics of the cement: age, porosity, permeability, tortuosity, swelling pressure, water content, viscosity and thickness. The target variable is pore fluid velocity at saturation conditions. Note that we have preprocessed this data by logarithmic transformation and normalization before performing PCA.

## 2.4 Notations
Throughout the article, we will use boldface letters to denote vectors and matrices. For instance, if x is a vector of length n, we will write $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Similarly, if A is a matrix of size m by n, we will write $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$. Lowercase letters will be used to index elements inside vectors and matrices, e.g., $\alpha_i$ refers to the i-th element of the vector α.
