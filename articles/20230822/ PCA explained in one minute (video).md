Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular technique used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data by finding the directions of maximum variance that capture most of the information in the dataset. The goal of PCA is to find orthogonal linear combinations of the original variables such that each new combination captures as much of the variation in the data as possible while being uncorrelated with previous combinations. By projecting the data onto these linear combinations, we can obtain lower-dimensional representations that preserve most of the important features of the data. 

In this article, I will explain how principal component analysis works using an intuitive and easy-to-understand video format. You don’t need any math background to understand what PCA is, but you should be familiar with some machine learning terminology like dimensions, covariance matrix, eigenvectors, eigenvalues etc., if not already. 


Before moving on, let me give you a brief introduction about myself: I am currently working at Salesforce as a Product Marketing Manager for AI & Platform team. In my role, I help our sales teams identify opportunities for their customers to leverage AI technologies to improve their business processes and increase revenue. My expertise includes building and maintaining product intelligence tools for customers through various platforms like Google Cloud, Salesforce Wave, and Zendesk. Moreover, I have extensive experience in managing large distributed systems architectures across multiple geographies and ensuring scalability, reliability and availability of those products.


Let's dive into the detailed explanation of PCA!



# 2.基本概念术语说明
Firstly, let us define few terms related to Principal Component Analysis. Here are some basic concepts that need to be understood before proceeding further:

1. **Data**: This is a set of observations from different sources. Each observation can be represented as a point in n-dimensional space. Common examples include images, videos, audio signals, text documents etc.

2. **Dimensions**: A dimension refers to a property or characteristic associated with a particular object or measurement. For example, consider a picture of an apple. It has two dimensions - width and height - which describe its shape along the x and y axes respectively. There could also be additional dimensions such as color and shade of skin. All these properties form a multi-dimensional space where every point represents an instance of an object in real world. 

3. **Covariance Matrix** : Covariance matrix measures the degree of similarity between two random variables. Let X and Y be two random variables having n independent components, i.e., they both take values only on a finite number of points. Then, the covariance matrix C[i][j] measures how two successive components vary together. If X increases significantly after a small change in Y, then C[i][j] would be positive. Otherwise, it would be zero or negative. Hence, the covariance matrix gives us a measure of the joint variability of the variables. 

4. **Eigenvectors** : Eigenvectors are the vectors that do not change direction when multiplied by a scalar factor. They represent the directions along which the data varies the most. These eigenvectors determine the principal components of the data.

5. **Eigenvalues** : Eigenvalues are the coefficients that multiply the eigenvectors to get the corresponding principal components. The larger the absolute value of an eigenvalue, the more informative that eigenvector is in describing the variations in the data. Hence, eigenvectors with higher eigenvalues correspond to more informative principal components.

6. **Variance** : Variance refers to the amount by which the data deviates from its mean. Higher variance indicates greater spread amongst the data points. Var(X)=E[(X-EX)^2].

7. **Total Explained Variance** : Total explained variance tells us how much of the total variation in the data is captured by the first k principal components. We use ratio of total variance explained to sum of all the individual variance explained so far.

8. **Explained Variance Ratio** : Explained variance ratio tells us how much of the variance in the data is explained by each subsequent principal component. Together, these ratios make up the cumulative explained variance curve. It shows us how well the first principal component explains the majority of the variance, second principal component explains next level of variance etc.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
Now that we have defined a few key terms, we can move ahead and look at the core algorithm of PCA. 

## Step 1: Standardize Data
The first step involves standardizing the data so that each variable has zero mean and unit variance. This is done to ensure that the variables contribute equally to the final result. Let X be a mXn data matrix representing the m instances and variables measured over n time points. First, compute column means μ of the columns of X and subtract them from X:

μ = colMeans(X)   # Column means of X
X_centered = X - rowMeans(X) %*% diag(1/rowSds(X))    # Subtract column means and divide by standard deviation

where rowMeans() returns vector containing rowwise means of X, rowSds() returns vector containing rowwise standard deviations of X, and diag(c) constructs diagonal matrix with elements c repeated along its diagonal. Finally, replace missing values with zeros.

## Step 2: Compute Covariance Matrix
Next, calculate the covariance matrix of the centered data matrix:
C = cov(X_centered)     # Covariance matrix of X_centered

This matrix measures how two successive components vary together. The element C[i][j] measures how the ith variable changes given the jth variable changes. If X_centered[k] increases significantly after a small change in X_centered[l], then C[k][l] would be positive. Otherwise, it would be zero or negative.  

## Step 3: Find Eigenpairs of Covariance Matrix
We now seek to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix C. The eigenvector v of C corresponding to the eigenvalue λ is called a principal component. One way to do this is to perform singular value decomposition (SVD), which factors the covariance matrix into three matrices U, S, V such that C=USV'. However, SVD may not always converge numerically due to round-off errors and other numerical issues. So, instead, we simply solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors directly using QR decomposition of C:

Q,R = qr(C)      # QR decomposition of C
eigenvals = diag(R)       # Eigenvalues of C
eigenvecs = Q[,1:length(X)]  # Columns of Q corresponding to the top k eigenvectors

Here, q is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors and r is upper triangular matrix with nonzero elements on its diagonal. Both q and r satisfy C = QR, where R is upper triangular. Therefore, we extract the top k eigenvectors from the square matrix q by selecting the first k columns.

## Step 4: Project Data onto Principal Components
Finally, we project the centered data matrix X_centered onto the selected principal components obtained above:
Z = X_centered %*% eigenvecs        # Projection of X_centered onto principal components

The resulting matrix Z contains m rows and k columns, where k is the desired number of principal components. The nth row of Z corresponds to the nth instance after projection onto the principal components. Note that we did not center the projected data since we want to preserve the relative scale and orientation of the data points within each principal component.
