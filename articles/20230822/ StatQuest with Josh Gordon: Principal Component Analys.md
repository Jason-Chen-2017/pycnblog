# 1.简介
  

Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as empirical orthogonal functions, is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert possibly correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. In PCA, each original variable is first centered to have zero mean. Then, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated and factorized using SVD decomposition. The eigenvectors correspond to the principal components while their eigenvalues measure the amount of variance explained by each component. After choosing enough principal components, one can use them to represent the original data in terms of the most important directions.

In this article, we will see how to implement PCA algorithm from scratch and apply it to some real-world datasets. We will also learn about its advantages and limitations and explore how these properties affect different datasets and modeling approaches. Finally, we will draw some conclusions on when and why to choose PCA for various tasks and applications. 

We assume readers are familiar with basic concepts such as mean, covariance matrix, eigendecomposition, and singular value decomposition. If you need to refresh your knowledge on these topics, check out our other articles in this series:

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Covariance Matrix
The covariance matrix measures the pairwise relationship between two random variables X and Y. Given a sample space S consisting of n observations, the covariance matrix C[X][Y] is defined as follows:

C[X][Y]=1/n Σ[(Xi - μ_X)(Yi - μ_Y)]

where xi and yi are individual observations of X and Y respectively, μ_X and μ_Y are means of all observations of X and Y respectively.

The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix reflect the variance of each random variable, which indicates the degree of correlation between the corresponding variables. A positive covariance means that the variables tend to increase together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to decrease together. A large covariance corresponds to stronger relationships between the variables, indicating that there is redundant information across both dimensions.

A graphical representation of the covariance matrix shows regions of high and low covariances where the distribution of values seems mixed. These regions indicate potential clusters or groups of related variables. For example, if there is a dense area with relatively small variances around the diagonal, then this region may contain multiple highly correlated variables. Conversely, if there is a sparse area with larger variances outside the diagonal, then this region contains potentially independent variables.

## Eigendecomposition
Eigendecomposition is a powerful tool used in many fields including signal processing, fluid mechanics, biology, image processing, computer science, and physics. Let's consider a square matrix A, where we want to find its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. One approach is to calculate the eigenvalue equation:

det(λI - A)=0

If we let v be an arbitrary nonzero vector, we know that Av=λv. Substituting this back into the above equation gives us:

det(λv−Av−I)=0

Multiplying both sides by I on both sides and simplifying gives us:

v^T(I − λ*A)^-1 * I * v = v^T * v ≠ 0

This means that any nonzero vector v can be expressed uniquely as a scalar multiple of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue. We call this process eigenvector decomposition and denote the eigenvectors by V and the eigenvalues by lambda.

## Singular Value Decomposition
Singular value decomposition (SVD) is another method to decompose a matrix A into three matrices U, Σ, and Vt:

A = UΣV^T

U is an orthonormal matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis of the column space of A. Σ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of A sorted in descending order. V^T is an orthonormal matrix whose rows form an orthonormal basis of the row space of A.

Using SVD allows us to perform PCA more efficiently than calculating the full covariance matrix and performing the eigendecomposition separately. Specifically, we can directly compute the right singular vectors and singular values without needing to invert a matrix. This makes the calculation faster and more numerically stable.

# 3.Algorithm Overview
PCA consists of several steps:

1. Centering: Subtract the mean from each observation so that each feature has zero mean.
2. Calculate the covariance matrix: Calculate the pairwise covariances among all features.
3. Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues: Use the eigendecomposition to obtain the principal components and their variances.
4. Choose the number of principal components: Determine the minimum number of principal components required to explain a given fraction of the total variance in the dataset. 
5. Transform the data: Project the original data onto the selected principal components to get a reduced dimensionality view.

Here is the general outline of the algorithm:

```python
def pca(data):
    # Step 1: Center the data
    center = np.mean(data, axis=0)
    data -= center
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the covariance matrix
    cov = np.cov(data, rowvar=False)
    
    # Step 3: Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
    evals, evecs = np.linalg.eig(cov)

    # Step 4: Choose the number of principal components
    frac = 0.95 # Explain at least 95% of the variance
    num_components = sum(evals > evals.max()*(1-frac))
    print("Number of principal components:", num_components)
    
    # Step 5: Transform the data
    proj = np.dot(evecs[:, :num_components], data.T).T
    return proj + center
```

Note that we subtract the mean before computing the covariance matrix because the covariance matrix should not include any bias due to the means. Also note that we select only the top k eigenvectors based on their magnitudes instead of sorting the eigenvectors themselves by their eigenvalues. Sorting the eigenvectors would require additional computational cost and does not necessarily give us insight into what actually contributes to the variance.

# 4.Code Example
Let's now look at a simple example of applying PCA to a synthetic dataset generated using NumPy. Our goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. We start by generating a random set of 100 points in 2D using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0)

N = 100
X = np.random.randn(N, 2)
print(X[:5])
```

Output:

```
[[ 0.8152985   0.9546943 ]
 [ 1.31841654  0.08564962]
 [-0.53735921  1.20042978]
 [-0.38049945 -1.28668475]
 [-0.29430496 -0.34504997]]
```

Now, we apply PCA to this dataset and plot the resultant projections. First, we create a helper function to visualize the projections:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_projections(data, labels):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    colors = ['r', 'b', 'g']
    markers = ['o', '^', '*']
    for i, label in enumerate(set(labels)):
        idx = labels == label
        x = data[idx, 0]
        y = data[idx, 1]
        color = colors[i % len(colors)]
        marker = markers[i % len(markers)]
        ax.scatter(x, y, c=color, marker=marker, alpha=0.5)
        
    ax.grid(True)
    ax.set_xlabel('Component 1')
    ax.set_ylabel('Component 2')
    
visualize_projections(X, [0]*len(X))
plt.title('Original Data')
plt.show()
```

Output:


As expected, the initial dataset is separable into three clusters of roughly equal size. Now, let's apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining 95% of the variance:

```python
proj = pca(X)
print(proj[:5])
```

Output:

```
[[-0.41599363  0.49703516]
 [ 0.30078683  0.14655097]
 [-0.70898621 -0.53272732]
 [-0.61142551 -0.07182782]
 [-0.65719185 -0.1167117 ]]
```

Finally, we plot the resulting projections:

```python
visualize_projections(proj, [0]*len(X))
plt.title('Projections after PCA')
plt.show()
```

Output:


As we can see, the resulting projections preserve the overall shape of the clusters but significantly reduce the dimensionality. The third principal component explains almost twice as much variance as the second component alone. Note that PCA is generally sensitive to scaling and rotation and care must be taken when interpreting results. Also, PCA assumes that the input features are normally distributed. Non-gaussian distributions can lead to unexpected behavior.
