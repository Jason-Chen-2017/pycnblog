## 1.1 背景
Alibaba Group Inc., a Chinese multinational technology company headquartered in Hangzhou Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics (HUST), plans to increase its e-commerce sales by approximately 2% over three years from 2019 to 2021.

The group's long-standing reputation as one of China’s leading internet companies has allowed it to position itself as an industry leader for online retail payment processing, shipping logistics management, and electronic commerce marketplaces. The company is also known for its technological advancements such as its robotic process automation platform, which enables merchants to automate common tasks like inventory tracking and order fulfillment using software algorithms.

Despite being among the world’s largest e-commerce companies, Alibaba Group has been struggling with limited success in certain sectors, including apparel and clothing, healthcare services, travel and hospitality, automotive, home and lifestyle products, financial services, education, and gaming. It remains steadfastly committed to building on its strong foundations to become even more significant in the international e-commerce space.

## 1.2 目标
To reach its target of increasing its e-commerce sales by 2% over three years, Alibaba Group will need to invest significantly in marketing efforts and grow its overall sales territory. The new year begins with improved global customer experience through better user engagement, personalization, and promotional campaigns that are optimized for relevant content, product categories, and shopper segments.

Additionally, Alibaba Group is working to ensure its suppliers meet highest quality standards and provide excellent customer service levels. They have expanded their global network of suppliers to include manufacturers across industries, providing Alibaba with access to high-quality products and brands at reasonable prices. Moreover, they continue to develop their supply chain management system, enabling them to adapt quickly to changing business requirements and integrate seamlessly into Alibaba Group’s own platforms.

With these initiatives in place, Alibaba Group expects to see significant increases in e-commerce transaction volumes and sales across all product categories and regions in Q3 and Q4 2019 – 2021. However, specific action items may vary depending upon current trends, demand, and competitive pressures. 

## 1.3 挑战与机遇
Alibaba Group faces several challenges during this period, some related to market penetration, growth expectations, and competition. Understanding and analyzing the factors driving these challenges can help Alibaba make informed decisions on how best to address them. These key areas include:

1. Market Penetration
Market penetration refers to the degree to which an organization has achieved or continues to achieve market share over time. In the case of e-commerce giants like Alibaba, achieving widespread public awareness requires multiple strategies, including brand advertising, content creation, sales events, and increased attention paid to social media channels.

2. Growth Expectations
Growth expectations reflect the anticipated rate of change in consumer behavior, market share, and earning potential. Alibaba is focused on continually expanding its business footprint and promoting its offerings to customers globally. As part of this strategy, Alibaba has partnered with external businesses to increase their visibility and generate additional revenue opportunities.

3. Competition
Competition is defined as the tendency of organizations to seek out alternatives to compete with one another. E-commerce giants like Alibaba often face a substantial amount of competition from other players within their sector, particularly when it comes to distributor networks and payment gateways. Despite significant advantages, Alibaba must continuously identify and strategize against these threats to maintain its dominant position in the field.
