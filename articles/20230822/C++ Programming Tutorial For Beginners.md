# 1.简介
  

C++ is a high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the year 1983 and has become one of the most popular languages used today for developing various applications ranging from operating systems to games, scientific simulations etc. In this article, we will be discussing some basic concepts and features of C++, along with its core algorithms and operations. We will also showcase some practical code examples demonstrating how these concepts can be applied practically using modern IDEs like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text. This article aims at providing beginners with an introduction into C++ programming which they can use as a reference book while writing their own programs. It provides a comprehensive overview of all essential topics required for someone who wants to understand the basics of the language and get started with their first project.

2.Who Should Read This Article?
This tutorial is suitable for anyone who wants to learn about the fundamentals of C++. The content is suitable for those who are familiar with object-oriented programming (OOP) but have never written any lines of C++ before and those who want to improve their skills on the language. However, it may not be suitable if you already have a good understanding of the language and wish to delve deeper into details or chapters that require expertise in other areas such as data structures or networking protocols. In that case, you might need to consult external resources such as books, online documentation or tutorials.

3.When Should You Start Reading This Article?
If you have just started learning C++, then you should start reading this article right away after going through some introductory materials like OOP and data types. If you have already been using C++ professionally for several years, you might find this article too basic and would benefit more from exploring advanced topics such as memory management or algorithmic optimization. Nevertheless, it should give you a solid foundation so that you can easily dive into more complex projects later on.

4.Article Structure
The following sections will discuss the fundamental concepts of C++, followed by detailed explanations of each topic:

1. Introduction to C++
2. History of C++
3. Basic Syntax and Data Types
4. Operators and Expressions
5. Control Flow Statements
6. Functions
7. Classes and Objects

Finally, I’ll provide answers to some commonly asked questions about C++ and cover relevant references and links. This article requires careful planning, revision, editing and proofreading before publication. Please let me know your feedback about the article structure and contents. Also, please feel free to contribute to make this article even better!

Hopefully, this article will serve as a useful resource for C++ programmers starting out, as well as experienced developers looking for additional information on specific subjects. Thanks for reading!


# 2.Introduction
In this section, we'll briefly introduce C++ and outline why it's different than other programming languages. 

## What is C++? 
C++ is an object-oriented programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983. Its design philosophy emphasizes on safety, portability, extensibility, and maintainability. C++ supports both procedural and structured programming styles, allowing programmers to write modular, reusable, and efficient code. Some key highlights of C++ include:

1. Object-Oriented Programming
2. Dynamic Binding 
3. Automatic Memory Management 
4. Standard Template Library 
5. Exception Handling

Some notable differences between C++ and other programming languages include: 

1. Syntax: Although similar to many other programming languages, there are minor syntax differences that can trip up newcomers. 
2. Execution Speed: C++ is generally faster than most other programming languages due to its low-level implementation and speedy execution times. 
3. Type Safety: C++ guarantees type safety, ensuring that variables are always used correctly. Additionally, compilers help detect errors early during compilation time. 
4. Platform Independence: Since C++ runs on multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and MacOS X, the same source code can run without modifications on each platform.  
5. Large Community Support: There is a large community of C++ developers and programmers around the world who contribute to open-source software libraries and frameworks. 
6. Large Number of Libraries and Frameworks: Many pre-built libraries and frameworks exist to simplify development tasks such as input/output handling, multithreading, networking, graphics, databases, and more.  

Overall, C++ is a versatile programming language that combines ease of use, performance, and power. It is widely used in industry, education, game development, scientific computing, and robotics among others. With its vast array of features and capabilities, C++ offers great opportunities for software engineers, scientists, and engineers alike.
