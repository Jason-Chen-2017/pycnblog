Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), proposed by Ian Goodfellow et al., are a family of deep neural networks that aim to generate new and realistic images or other data types. They were first introduced in May 2014 as an alternative to the popular autoencoder technique for unsupervised learning.

Since then, GANs have achieved some impressive results, including generating high-resolution fake celebrity faces, turning photographs into cartoonish artworks, and creating novel music compositions. However, there is also evidence suggesting that these models may not be entirely immune to common failure modes such as mode collapse, vanishing gradients, and instability during training.

In this article, we will examine four key reasons why GANs may fail:

1. Mode Collapse
2. Vanishing Gradients
3. Instability During Training
4. Overfitting/Underfitting

We will provide explanations and illustrate each issue with visual examples using Python code. Finally, we will propose potential solutions to address these issues. We hope that this article can serve as a useful guide to technical readers interested in developing their own understanding of how GANs work and handle failures.

## Introduction 

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful deep learning models used mainly for generative tasks like image synthesis, text-to-image conversion, and object reconstruction from partial views. They consist of two components called the Generator and Discriminator. The Generator takes random noise vectors as inputs and transforms them into realistic outputs while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between true samples and those generated by the Generator.

However, GANs have been criticized for being difficult to train, producing sample quality degradation, and sometimes even suffering from mode collapse or instability problems. Here, we'll discuss four major causes of GAN failure and explain possible ways to fix them. This should give you a better idea about what's happening underneath and suggest approaches to improving your GAN architecture and training process.


## Mode Collapse 

### The Problem Statement

When training GANs, the Discriminator network learns to identify fake samples produced by the Generator against actual ones. It might seem straightforward at first but surprisingly, things get tricky quickly if both the networks start becoming too similar.

During training, the Discriminator tries to correctly classify real and fake samples according to its decision boundary obtained after multiple iterations through the dataset. In simpler terms, the discriminator’s goal is to discriminate between the distributions of the data within the feature space. If it gets fooled by one type of distribution while ignoring another, it becomes less certain of its decisions. Eventually, once the generator produces different samples than seen before, the discriminator starts losing its confidence in its classification ability, resulting in a state known as “mode collapse” where the generator stops producing good quality samples.<|im_sep|>
