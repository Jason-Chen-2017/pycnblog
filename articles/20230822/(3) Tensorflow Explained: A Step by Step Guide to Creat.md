# 1.简介
  

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation and machine learning. It has become one of the most popular libraries in deep learning and artificial intelligence applications due to its ease of use, flexibility, and scalability. In this article, we will learn how to create a basic machine learning model using TensorFlow, covering essential concepts such as tensors, variables, graphs, sessions, placeholders, operations, and optimizers. We will also implement two supervised learning models - logistic regression and neural networks - on real-world datasets like Iris dataset, breast cancer diagnosis dataset, and digit recognition dataset. Finally, we will discuss some common pitfalls and problems that may arise while creating these models.
# Our goal with writing this article is to provide a comprehensive guide to building complex deep learning models using TensorFlow. By going through each step involved in creating our own models, we hope that you'll gain a solid understanding of the inner workings of TensorFlow and be able to apply it effectively to your own projects. We've already found many developers struggling with implementing their first deep learning project or trying to understand more advanced topics like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Hopefully, by reading this article, you'll find it easy to grasp new concepts and build effective models in TensorFlow!
# 2.预备知识
Before we dive into technical details, let's quickly go over some preliminary knowledge needed to understand this article. Here are some things you should know before continuing further:
# Tensors and Vectors
A tensor is an n-dimensional array where every element represents a scalar value. Similarly, vectors are simply arrays of numbers with only one dimension. The difference between them lies in their size and number of dimensions. For example, [1, 2] is a vector of length 2, but [[1], [2]] is a matrix with one row and two columns.
# Linear Algebra
Linear algebra refers to the branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations, systems of linear equations, and vector spaces. This includes tools like dot product, transpose, inverse matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, etc., which will come in handy when working with machine learning models. Some key points include:
Matrix multiplication: If we have two matrices A and B of the same shape (i.e. they have the same number of rows and columns), then their product AB is defined as the result of multiplying each element of A with each corresponding element of B, and summing up all the resulting products. To perform matrix multiplication, the number of columns in A must match the number of rows in B. 

Scalar multiplication: Scalar multiplication is just multiplying a matrix by a constant, i.e. scaling all the elements by the same factor.

Transpose: Transposition is the process of interchanging the order of rows and columns in a matrix. Simply put, if A is a matrix, then A^T denotes the transposed matrix of A.

Determinant: Determinants are values obtained by computing the volume of the parallelepiped formed by three collinear points. They represent the "directionality" of a transformation (like rotation) and play important role in linear transformations such as rotations and reflections.

Eigendecomposition: Eigendecomposition is a method used to decompose a square matrix into eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Eigenvectors represent the directions along which a matrix undergoes a certain type of change and eigenvalues represent the magnitude of the changes.

# Python
Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used for scientific computing, data analysis, and AI/ML. You'll need to have familiarity with Python syntax and basic programming constructs like loops, conditionals, functions, classes, objects, etc. 

Here's a simple code snippet to illustrate what a tensor is in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

my_tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2, 3],
                         [4, 5, 6]],

                        [[7, 8, 9],
                         [10, 11, 12]]])
print("Shape:", my_tensor.get_shape()) # Shape: (2, 2, 3)
```

In the above example, `tf.constant` creates a tensor object with the given value. We can get the shape of the tensor using `.get_shape()`. The output shows that this tensor has two dimensions (represented as `(2, 2)`), and each element consists of three values (indicated as `[3]` at the end).

Another useful resource to familiarize yourself with Python is the official documentation available online: https://www.python.org/doc/.
