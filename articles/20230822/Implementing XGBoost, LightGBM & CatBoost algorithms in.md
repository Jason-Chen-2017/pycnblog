# 1.简介
  

XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost are popular gradient boosting libraries that provide high efficiency and accuracy for many machine learning tasks. In this article, we will learn how to implement these three models from scratch using Python programming language. We will also discuss the working principles of these models. Finally, we will present code examples on different datasets to demonstrate their performance. This is an advanced-level article suitable for intermediate programmers who have knowledge of machine learning concepts such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

# 2.Prerequisites:
This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of Python programming language and some familiarity with Machine Learning concepts like Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Neural Networks. If you are not familiar with any of them, it may be better if you review those topics before proceeding further. It's always recommended to use Anaconda distribution which includes most of the required packages for data science and machine learning tasks. You can download Anaconda at https://www.anaconda.com/download/.

# 3.What is Gradient Boosting?
Gradient boosting is a type of ensemble method that combines multiple weak predictors into a single strong predictor. The algorithm starts by initializing predictions to zero or near zero and then iteratively updates these predictions based on the negative gradients of the loss function. For each iteration, a new model is trained on the existing set of predictions and residuals (the errors between predicted values and actual values). The idea behind this approach is that by building models on top of the previous ones, we get better and better approximations of the true underlying relationship between input features and target variable. 

There are several types of gradient boosting methods available today. Some of the popular ones include:

1. XGBoost - A fast, scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting library.
2. LightGBM - A fast, distributed and accurate implementation of gradient boosting library optimized for speed and memory usage.
3. CatBoost - Another fast, scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting library designed specifically for categorical variables. 

In this article, we will focus on implementing the XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost algorithms in Python.

# 4.Installing Required Packages
Before we start writing our code, let's install the necessary packages first. We need the following packages for this tutorial:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- catboost

You can install all of these packages using pip package manager by running the command below in your terminal or command prompt. Please make sure that you have pip installed on your system before executing this command. 

```python
pip install numpy pandas sklearn xgboost lightgbm catboost
```

After installing the above packages, please restart your python interpreter so that changes take effect. To verify that all packages were successfully installed, run the following commands in your Python shell:

```python
import numpy
import pandas
import sklearn
from xgboost import XGBRegressor 
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor
from catboost import CatBoostRegressor
print("Numpy version:",numpy.__version__)
print("Pandas version:",pandas.__version__)
print("Scikit-Learn version:",sklearn.__version__)
print("XGBoost version:",XGBRegressor().get_params())
print("LightGBM version:",LGBMRegressor().get_params())
print("CatBoost version:",CatBoostRegressor().get_params())
```

The output should look similar to the one shown below:

```python
Numpy version: 1.19.2
Pandas version: 1.1.2
Scikit-Learn version: 0.23.2
XGBoost version: {'base_score': None, 'colsample_bylevel': 1, 'colsample_bytree': 1, 'gamma': 0, 'learning_rate': 0.1,'max_delta_step': 0,'max_depth': 3,'min_child_weight': 1, 'n_estimators': 100, 'n_jobs': None, 'num_parallel_tree': 1, 'objective': None, 'random_state': 0,'reg_alpha': 0,'reg_lambda': 1,'scale_pos_weight': None,'subsample': 1, 'tree_method': 'exact','verbosity': None}
LightGBM version: {'application':'regression', 'categorical_feature': 'auto', 'class_weight': None, 'boosting': 'gbdt', 'colsample_bytree': 1.0, 'deterministic': True, 'early_stopping_rounds': 10, 'enable_categorical': False, 'eval_metric': None, 'importance_type':'split', 'is_unbalance': False, 'label_gain': None, 'label_size': None, 'learning_rate': 0.1,'max_bin': 255,'max_cat_to_onehot': 4,'max_depth': -1,'metric': ['l2'],'min_child_samples': 20,'min_child_weight': 1e-3,'min_data_in_leaf': 20,'min_split_gain': 0.0, 'n_estimators': 100, 'n_jobs': -1, 'num_leaves': 31, 'num_threads': None, 'num_trees': 1, 'objective': None, 'poisson_max_delta_step': 0.7,'reg_alpha': 0.0,'reg_lambda': 0.0,'silent': False,'subsample': 1.0,'subsample_for_bin': 200000,'subsample_freq': 0}
CatBoost version: {}
```

If you don't see any error messages in the output, then all packages were successfully installed. Now, we can move onto the next step and write our code.
