# 1.简介
  

在云计算的发展过程中，容器技术成为了实现云原生应用开发的一个新的途径。容器是一个轻量级、可移植、自包含的软件打包环境，它将应用程序的代码、运行时环境、系统工具和依赖项打包到一起，并通过隔离运行在独立的容器虚拟化层上。虚拟机（VM）是另一种用于创建独立于物理服务器或云提供商平台的操作系统的技术，它将整个操作系统打包到一个虚拟磁盘中，能够提供一致的运行环境。在本文中，我将探讨一下两种技术的优缺点。

## 2.1.Containerization VS Virtualization
**Containerization**: It is a software technology that allows independent applications to run on the same operating system instance without requiring virtual machines (VMs) and hardware resources to be dedicated for each application or workload. It relies upon container runtime technologies like Docker which allow users to package their applications with all dependencies into small images which are then executed by containers. Containers provide an isolated environment where developers can test and debug their code before pushing it to production environments. 

**Virtualization:** It refers to creating simulated computer systems running within larger physical computers. VMs use a hypervisor layer to isolate guest OSes from the underlying host machine, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently on one machine. The hypervisor manages interactions between the VM and its host machine, such as resource sharing and input/output (I/O) operations. In contrast, containers do not require a separate kernel and share the underlying host's kernel with other containers on the same host. They have more overhead than VMs due to the additional layers required for container management but offer better isolation and security. However, they also come at a higher performance cost compared to VMs because they still rely on a hypervisor.  

## 2.2.Cloud Native Application Architecture
Cloud native architecture refers to an approach to building distributed applications that are scalable, resilient, fault tolerant, and manageable using cloud computing techniques. It takes advantage of cloud platform features like auto scaling, load balancing, and service discovery to optimize application performance and availability. It focuses on developing modern, cloud-ready applications that take advantage of microservices architectures, automated deployment pipelines, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes. 

A typical cloud-native application consists of several components, including a front end UI component, API gateway, database, message queue, caching services, and microservices implementing various business functionalities. These components interact with each other via RESTful APIs and messaging queues, and communicate with external systems through APIs provided by third-party providers. All these components must work together seamlessly to ensure high availability and scalability of the overall application.

# 3.Benefits of Containerization over Virtual Machines
Containers provide several benefits over traditional virtual machines:

1. Isolation and Security: Containers offer greater level of isolation and security compared to VMs, especially when compared to processes running directly on top of the host machine. Each container runs inside its own execution context, with its own set of resources allocated to it. Additionally, containers can leverage the existing authentication mechanisms used in enterprise networks, further enhancing the security posture of the entire infrastructure. 

2. Lightweight and Scalable: Since containers are much smaller in size compared to VMs, they start up quickly and consume less memory. This makes them highly suitable for running large numbers of lightweight and ephemeral applications simultaneously. Moreover, since containers utilize dynamic resource allocation, they can scale horizontally across multiple nodes in a cluster automatically, providing near-unlimited scalability. 

In addition to these benefits, containers also bring some unique advantages:

1. Flexibility: As mentioned earlier, containers offer great flexibility and portability capabilities. Developers can choose any programming language or framework of their choice to develop their applications, and simply pack it into a container image that can be deployed onto any container orchestration platform like Kubernetes. This provides an incredibly flexible way of developing cloud-native applications. 

2. Simplified Devops: With containers, developers no longer need to worry about managing servers and infrastructure. Just push your containerized application to a container registry, let the platform handle the rest. This simplifies the development lifecycle and automates most of the DevOps activities, thus reducing human error and improving overall efficiency.

3. Faster Deployment Rates: By utilizing container clustering technologies like Kubernetes, you can deploy and update containers rapidly at lightning speed. This means that new versions of your application will be rolled out instantly, even during peak traffic times. 

Overall, while both technologies solve different problems, they complement each other well in a cloud-native application ecosystem. While virtual machines provide a strong isolation boundary around individual workloads, containers offer greater flexibility, agility, and scalability, making them ideal choices for developing cloud-native applications.
