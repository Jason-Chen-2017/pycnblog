Design culture refers to the way that companies create, maintain, and use design in their business strategies. It encompasses all aspects of branding, visual design, user interface, motion graphics, typography, iconography, information architecture, etc., and represents how these elements are integrated and used across different parts of an organization such as marketing, engineering, product management, and sales. To ensure consistent and unified brand identity across multiple platforms or brands, organizations typically rely on design systems which provide reusable components that can be easily adapted to fit different needs.
Design systems are frameworks or libraries containing pre-designed components (such as buttons, cards, modals) that can be assembled together to produce various user interfaces for digital products or services. They act as a central source of truth for design decisions, ensuring consistency, simplicity, and ease of implementation. 

A key aspect of establishing a design culture within an organization is creating awareness amongst stakeholders about its importance, benefits, and role in shaping company strategy. The aim is to foster communication between departments, encourage collaboration between teams, and help identify potential problems early in the process to prevent them from escalating to larger issues later down the line. A well-established design culture helps avoid any unnecessary waste of resources, improves efficiency, and provides better outcomes for both internal and external stakeholders. Therefore, it's essential to adopt a holistic approach towards design throughout an organization by integrating design system best practices into everything from corporate communications to development processes.
In this article, we'll explore what design systems are, why they're important, and how to integrate them into an organization's design process. We will also learn about some common design system tools and methods that you can leverage to improve your team's design workflow and overall quality. By the end of the article, you should have a better understanding of design systems and how they can positively impact your workplace.

2. Basic Concepts & Terms
Design Systems
Design systems are a collection of pre-designed components that support specific user interaction patterns and can be assembled together to build more complex interfaces for websites, mobile applications, and other digital products and services. These components include standardized UI elements like buttons, forms, menus, headers, footers, and cards, but also customizable elements like popups, sliders, data visualization charts, etc. Each component has been thoroughly tested and validated before being released publicly, allowing developers to quickly prototype new features without spending time building every element from scratch.
The purpose of design systems is to reduce redundancy and increase consistency across digital products and services, while improving usability, accessibility, and performance. Organizations often combine several design systems to achieve a cohesive look and feel across multiple channels and devices, making it easier for users to navigate through the site or app. 

Design Tokens
Design tokens are variables that represent colors, fonts, spacings, borders, and other visual attributes that define the appearance and behavior of design elements. These values are stored in a single location where they can be accessed and updated centrally, reducing the risk of inconsistent styles and typographic choices across different parts of an application. 

Style Guides
Style guides are documents that outline design standards and guidelines for a particular project or platform. They provide clear instructions and examples for how different components should be used and behave, providing consistency across the entire brand or product. Style guides also promote good design practices like using color harmony, contrast ratio, and spacing, which contribute to readability, comprehension, and emotional stability of the interface. 

3. Design System Best Practices and Tools
Creating a design system requires careful planning and execution, with attention paid to detail and meeting high standards for visual fidelity, accessibility, responsiveness, and user experience. Here are some tips and best practices to follow when creating or integrating a design system into your organization:

1. Prioritize Consistency: Start small and focus on consistency first. Ensure that all UI components align with the same style guide and use similar typographical treatment. This ensures that users have a familiar and predictable environment, and reduces cognitive overload during navigation.

2. Document Design Elements: Create a design reference document or library of specifications for each component, including descriptions, interactions, states, and variations. Keep track of updates, revisions, and changes over time, so that all contributors understand the context behind decisions made and communicate clearly with one another.

3. Test Components Individually: Conduct tests to validate individual components in isolation, focusing on functionality, usability, and accessibility. This allows for quicker feedback loops and incremental improvements, rather than waiting until the entire design system is complete.

4. Optimize Performance: Consider performance optimization techniques like lazy loading images and minimizing HTTP requests to speed up page load times. Additionally, consider using CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less, enabling cross-browser compatibility and code reuse.

5. Develop Design Guidelines: Write clear guidance for contributing members of your team, emphasizing conventions around language, tone, voice, formatting, imagery, and layout. This not only encourages clarity and consistency, but also facilitates collaboration and improves team morale.

6. Use Version Control: Store design files in version control software, such as GitHub or GitLab, to enable collaborative editing, tracking changes, and sharing design materials. This makes it easy for everyone involved to stay up to date with the latest changes and prevents conflicts.

7. Encourage Community Collaboration: Support community events and projects to further grow and inspire design talent within the organization. Offer mentoring programs or career development opportunities to emerging designers and engineers who want to take their skills to the next level.

Tools to Help Build a Design System
To effectively implement a design system, there must be efficient processes in place to manage and update the assets, communicate changes, and test new components. Here are some popular design system tools and methods that you can leverage:

1. Sketch App: Adobe Sketch is a powerful tool for creating design mockups, wireframes, and prototypes. Its plug-in ecosystem includes many helpful plugins like symbols, shared styles, image cropper, and measurements, which make it ideal for managing large design libraries. You can also save Sketch file versions in a cloud storage service like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive, so that design files can be synchronized across multiple computers and platforms.

2. Figma App: Figma is another great option for design mockups and prototyping. It offers seamless integration with Sketch, including importing and exporting files. Figma also enables real-time collaboration with others, helping to streamline the design process.

3. Adobe XD App: Adobe XD is another tool for creating design mockups and prototypes. While less fully featured than Sketch and Figma, it's still worth evaluating if your organization uses Sketch or Figma exclusively.

4. Invision App: InVision is a web-based prototyping tool that supports user flows, wireframes, clickable prototypes, and interactive prototypes. You can use InVision to share design files and receive feedback directly from colleagues, stakeholders, and clients.

5. Zeplin App: Zeplin is a design collaboration platform that allows designers to work collaboratively on a project simultaneously. It provides a simple drag-and-drop interface for creating and sharing design assets, including screens, components, icons, and illustrations.

6. ProtoPie App: Protopie is a fun and free online prototyping tool that lets anyone create mobile apps, website pages, and landing pages. It even supports live collaboration with team members, providing immediate visual feedback and instant messaging.

7. Bitbucket Cloud or Gitlab Cloud: If you use version control software like Git or Mercurial, storing your design files in cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive makes it easy for team members to access and edit the latest version of the design material.
