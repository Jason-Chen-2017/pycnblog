Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique used in machine learning to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data sets by transforming them into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components or directions in the feature space. The goal of PCA is to identify patterns and relationships between the variables that maximize the variance along each direction, effectively reducing the amount of noise present in the original dataset while preserving as much information as possible. In this article, we will briefly explore the basic concepts and principles behind PCA using simple examples.

## 2.1 Data Sets and Variables
PCA operates on datasets consisting of multiple variables, where each variable represents one aspect of the observed phenomenon being measured. These variables are commonly referred to as features or dimensions. For example, consider the following two-dimensional dataset: 


In this case, there are two variables: x and y. Each point corresponds to a different observation, such as the location of a person, object, etc., and has both an x and y coordinate value associated with it. We can represent this data in a matrix form: 

$$X = \begin{bmatrix}x_{1} & x_{2} &... & x_{n}\\y_{1} & y_{2} &... & y_{n}\end{bmatrix}$$

where n refers to the number of observations in our sample. 

We assume that the rows of X correspond to individual observations, i.e., samples, while columns represent different features or variables describing those observations. Specifically, let's say we have m observations, which correspond to n patients undergoing some treatment. The corresponding variables might include age, gender, weight, BMI, heart rate, blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, smoking status, exercise frequency, insulin dose, etc. Thus, we may end up with a design matrix $X$ having dimensions mxp, where p is the total number of variables involved in our study. 

The concept of "dimensions" is important because it means that we cannot visualize high-dimensional datasets directly. Instead, we need to find ways to simplify these multi-dimensional problems down to smaller subspaces spanned by the most informative features. By identifying these directions or vectors that capture the largest amount of variance in our data, we hope to find a compressed representation of the data that still captures its essential features without overfitting or underestimating anything. 

## 2.2 Variance and Covariance Matrix
Let's first define what exactly variance measures. Informally, variance measures how far data points tend to vary from their average values across all dimensions. Mathematically, variance is defined as follows:

$$Var(X) = E[(X-\mu)(X-\mu)^T]$$

Where $\mu$ is the mean vector of the dataset, also known as the expected value or population parameter. 

To understand why variance is helpful for identifying the most informative directions, imagine you have two identical balls placed randomly on the table and another ball slightly shifted towards you. As you roll the third ball, it should be very similar to the other two. If one of the balls were quite heavy but had a small diameter, however, the next time you rolled the ball, it would likely slide away due to the sudden change in shape. This suggests that the axes that contribute most to the variation in your dataset are probably not actually linear combinations of the original measurements. Therefore, rather than attempting to fit an arbitrary function to every single datapoint, we instead try to find the directions that explain the maximum amount of variance in our data.

Now, back to covariance matrices. A covariance matrix tells us how two random variables move together around their mean values. Formally, if we have two variables $X$ and $Y$, then their covariance matrix $Cov(X, Y)$ is given by: 

$$ Cov(X, Y) = E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)] $$

As usual, $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$ refer to the respective means of the variables $X$ and $Y$. 

However, note that the term $(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)$ doesn't make sense unless either $X$ or $Y$ is constant relative to the other variable. To fix this, we add the condition that $E[XY]=E[X]\cdot E[Y]$ to get:

$$ Cov(X, Y) = \frac{E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]}{Var(X)} $$

This gives us a measure of how the variables move together compared to their individual variances, giving us a more nuanced picture of the structure of our data. However, since we only care about the directions of maximum variance, we can simplify things further by taking the absolute value of the covariance matrix: 

$$\Sigma=E[\|X-\mu\|^2]=-E[(X-\mu)(X-\mu)^T] $$

This quantity measures the degree to which the data varies in any particular direction, assuming that everything else stays fixed. We call this the precision matrix $\Lambda$ since it contains the inverse of the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$. 


## 2.3 Eigendecomposition of the Precision Matrix
One way to interpret the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the precision matrix is through the decomposition: 

$$\Sigma = QDQ^{-1}$$ 

Here, $Q$ is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of $\Sigma$, ordered by decreasing magnitude of their corresponding eigenvalue. That is, the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue explains the most variance in the data. Similarly, $D$ is a diagonal matrix whose elements contain the square roots of the eigenvalues in descending order, indicating how much each eigenvector contributes to the overall variance in the data. Finally, we take the pseudo-inverse of $Q$ to obtain the eigenvectors of $\Sigma$.

Note that although the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are useful for finding the directions of maximum variance in the data, they don't tell us anything about the scales or ranges of the underlying variables. For that, we need to use standardization techniques like normalization or Z-score scaling, depending on the application. Also keep in mind that PCA assumes that the data has zero mean and no correlations among the variables. If these assumptions are violated, additional transformations may be needed before applying PCA.
