Before discussing individual strategies, let us first clarify some basic concepts and terms used commonly in the industry.

1. Engagement Rate - The percentage of active daily interactions with an app or website by unique visitors. An engaged user is considered to be someone who frequently uses the platform or service over a certain period of time. 

2. Conversion Rate – A measure of how many of your targeted consumers perform some action after viewing or interacting with your advertisement or message.

3. Time On Site (TOS) - The average amount of time spent by individuals on your website during a given session. TOS measures the experience of your website visitors.

4. Churn Rate - The rate at which customers stop visiting or using your company's product or service. 

5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) - The estimated monetary value that a customer brings to your organization permanently across all channels, including acquisition cost, upfront costs, ongoing revenue, and churn costs. CLV provides insight into the long term financial performance of your customers. 

# 3. Content Creation Strategy
The content creation strategy involves writing high quality articles, blogs, videos, or images that are focused on converting prospects into paying customers. Here are the steps involved in implementing this strategy:

1. Choose Your Target Audience: Determine the age group, gender, education level, location, interests, and psychographic profile of your ideal customers. Based on these factors, select the appropriate demographics to create personalized content for.

2. Write Original Articles/Blogs: Create original, informative articles or blog posts that capture readers' attention, make them interested in reading further, and drive conversion. Use creative headings, imagery, and graphics to enhance readability. Avoid jargon and provide clear explanations when necessary.

3. Add Relevant Images: Adding relevant images increases engagement and improves brand image. You should use images that highlight the features or benefits of your product or service, showing its capabilities or appeal to potential customers. Additionally, add screenshots, diagrams, and quotes to support your point better.

4. Publish Regularly: Keep publishing content regularly on social media platforms, targeting various audiences based on their interests and behaviors. Use hashtags and mentions to reach out to relevant people within your community.

5. Monitor Performance Metrics: Collect real-time metrics such as engagement rate, bounce rate, and other KPIs to monitor the effectiveness of your content and identify areas where improvement is needed. Optimize and fine-tune your content regularly based on results to maximize engagement and conversions.
