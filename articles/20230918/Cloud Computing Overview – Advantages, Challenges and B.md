# 1.简介
  

Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of compute power, storage, database services, software, analytics, and other resources through a cloud service provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The cloud offers several advantages for businesses:

1. Cost Savings: With cloud computing, organizations can save costs by using pre-built virtual machines or containers that are ready to run applications without the need to purchase and maintain hardware. This means they can spend less time maintaining servers and more time building solutions based on their business needs.

2. Scalability: Cloud computing enables scalable architecture where an organization can increase or decrease processing power as needed. It allows companies to adapt quickly to changing business demands, making it easier to meet customer expectations and grow revenue over time.

3. Global Reach: Cloud computing is available globally which makes it accessible to anyone in any part of the world who has access to the internet. As a result, customers can work from anywhere around the globe with ease and have access to infrastructure closer to them. 

4. High Availability: Cloud platforms also offer high availability so that even if one server fails, the application continues running uninterrupted. This helps ensure that critical systems remain operational while providing continuity to business processes.

However, there are also some challenges associated with cloud computing:

1. Data Security: Cloud providers use various security measures to protect data stored within their platform, but this comes at the cost of increased complexity and added layer of management required. For example, AWS uses multiple layers of encryption, including SSL/TLS protocols, VPN tunneling, intrusion detection, and log analysis to secure data during transmission. However, these measures may not be sufficient to keep data safe against malicious actors.

2. Compliance Risks: Even though cloud computing eliminates much of the burden of managing physical servers, compliance risks still exist such as PCI-DSS, HIPPA, GDPR, and others. These regulations require certain certifications and procedures to be followed when working with cloud providers. Organizations must understand how their data will be used and make sure it complies with relevant laws before utilizing cloud services.

3. Vendor Lock-in: When moving to a new cloud vendor, organizations face the risk of losing control of their existing infrastructure and programs. It's essential to consider this factor when deciding whether to adopt cloud computing.

In summary, cloud computing provides many benefits to organizations, but it also poses significant challenges and requires careful planning and attention to detail to avoid common pitfalls. In conclusion, cloud computing promises to help organizations reduce costs, improve scalability, and expand global reach, but it also introduces additional complexities, risks, and potential issues. Therefore, the right approach should depend on the specific requirements and constraints of each organization.

# 2.Basic Concepts & Terminology
Before we get into the meat of the article, let’s review some basic concepts and terminology related to cloud computing. Let’s start with a brief definition of cloud computing:

“Cloud computing” is a type of computational resource that is delivered over a network rather than through local installation. The key feature is that users can request temporary “cloud resources,” typically accessed via web interfaces or APIs, for tasks that do not require immediate local computation. The term "cloud" refers to the federated nature of the underlying technology, composed of different components – virtualization, networking, storage, etc. - which together provide a comprehensive solution for business use cases.

Now let’s break down what exactly does it mean for something to be “computational”. Computational resources include CPU, GPU, FPGAs, ASICs, TPUs, etc., and encompass all aspects of performing calculations. They may include large-scale parallel processing, computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, finance modeling, molecular simulations, among others. 

To utilize computational resources effectively, organizations often rely on distributed computing frameworks. These frameworks enable processing across clusters of computers, allowing computations to scale up or down as needed. Distributed computing frameworks can be classified according to two main categories: public clouds and private clouds.

Public clouds refer to those provided by third parties like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, and offer shared services and infrastructure to a wide range of users. Public clouds serve as a convenient way to access services without having to set up and manage your own environment. Private clouds, on the other hand, involve the deployment of isolated environments hosted on dedicated servers for internal use only.

It’s important to note that cloud computing is just one of many ways to perform computational tasks remotely, and the choice between using a cloud provider versus building your own infrastructure depends on factors such as budget, expertise level, and existing technical stack. There are also hybrid approaches where organizations combine cloud and on-premises resources for better performance or flexibility.

Now let’s move on to defining some terms related to cloud computing:

1. IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, refers to the process of providing infrastructure (e.g., servers, networks, and storage) over the internet as a service. Users rent virtual machines (VMs) and pay per hour or per month, depending on usage patterns. VM images can be customized and installed on top of VMs, enabling organizations to rapidly deploy identical copies of operating systems, databases, and applications onto new servers.

2. PaaS: Platform as a Service, or PaaS, involves provisioning an environment consisting of programming languages, runtimes, libraries, and tools that support development, testing, and production activities. Users interact directly with the platform, rather than installing software on their local machines. Examples of popular PAAS providers include Heroku, Google App Engine, and Salesforce.com.

3. SaaS: Software as a Service, or SaaS, consists of an enterprise-level software suite that runs entirely on the cloud. Customers access the system through a browser-based interface, meaning no physical installation is necessary. SaaS products vary from small business websites to multi-tenant business applications, offering a variety of functionality under a single subscription package.

4. Bare metal: A bare metal server is a physical machine without a hypervisor or virtualization software installed. Unlike virtualized environments, bare metal servers do not share resources with other guest OSes. Bare metal servers can deliver higher performance and bandwidth compared to virtualized servers due to lower overhead.

5. Hypervisor: A hypervisor is a software program that manages virtual machines and delivers resources to them. Virtual machines are emulated on top of physical hosts, reducing overhead and improving efficiency. Typical hypervisors include VMware ESXi, KVM, Xen, and Hyper-V.

6. Instance: An instance is a copy of a virtual machine image that runs on a server. Each instance has its own unique IP address and associated disks, giving it its own memory and CPU cycles. Multiple instances can be launched from the same image, creating a pool of identical servers.

7. Serverless computing: Serverless computing refers to the practice of running cloud functions without the need to provision or manage servers. Instead, functions are executed on-demand, usually triggered by events like HTTP requests or file uploads. Frameworks like AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions provide serverless computing capabilities, while traditional server architectures can leverage cloud functions as well.

8. Containerization: Containerization involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies in a standardized unit called a container, similar to a virtual machine. Containers can then be deployed on top of a host operating system, eliminating the need to install and configure individual software on each server. Popular container orchestration platforms include Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Apache Mesos.

# 3. Core Algorithms and Operations
Here is a general outline for the core algorithms and operations involved in cloud computing:

1. Networking: Cloud computing relies heavily on networking to communicate between different servers and clients. Various networking technologies such as VPC, DNS, Load Balancing, and Firewalls are commonly used in cloud deployments.

2. Storage: Cloud storage includes object storage, block storage, and file storage options. Object storage stores data as objects, such as files or photos, whereas block storage organizes data into blocks, similar to hard disk drives. File storage, on the other hand, stores files in a highly scalable and efficient manner, using techniques like erasure coding or replication.

3. Compute: Cloud computing employs a combination of virtualization and distributed computing technologies to create a pool of identical servers that can be dynamically scaled up or down as needed. Modern cloud platforms such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) implement several types of virtualization, including Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Serverless Application Model (SAM), and Virtual Machines (VMs).

4. Databases: Relational databases, NoSQL databases, and big data analytics tools can all be implemented in the cloud, enabling organizations to store and analyze large amounts of data in real-time. Some popular database services offered in the cloud include Amazon DynamoDB, MongoDB Atlas, and IBM Cloudant.

5. Automation: Many cloud platforms offer automation features that allow developers to script automated workflows, saving time and effort. Common examples include CloudFormation, Terraform, and Ansible.

6. Monitoring: To ensure proper functioning of cloud platforms, organizations need to monitor their resources and take action when problems arise. Common monitoring tools include Amazon CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Stackdriver.

# 4. Code Example and Explanation
A code example would go here, along with explanatory text explaining what the code accomplishes and why it's useful. Here's an example implementation of a Python script that calculates the average temperature for a given city:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def weather_avg(city):
    url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+{}'.format(city)
    res = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')
    
    # Find element containing temp information
    info = [tag for tag in soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'BNeawe vvjwJb AP7Wnd'})]
    
    try:
        temp = float([t for t in info[0].text.split() if t.endswith(('F','C'))][0][:len(info[0].text)-1])
        
    except IndexError:
        return None
    
    avg = sum(temp)/len(temp)
    
    if info[0].text.lower().endswith('f'):
        avg = round((avg*1.8)+32, 2)
        
    else:
        avg = round(avg, 2)

    return avg
    
print(weather_avg('New York City')) 
```

This script takes advantage of the `requests` library to send GET requests to Google's search engine, parsing the resulting HTML content using Beautiful Soup. It looks specifically for elements with a particular CSS class, which contains the current temperature for a given location. Once the temperature value is extracted, it computes the average of all values found. Finally, it converts the output units from Celsius to Fahrenheit if necessary, rounding the final result to 2 decimal places. 

The benefit of this script is that it doesn't require any manual input or configuration steps, since everything is handled automatically. Users simply call the `weather_avg()` function and pass in the name of the desired city as an argument.
