Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the most popular programming paradigms used today. The main idea behind OOP is encapsulation and abstraction that helps developers create reusable code through objects. In this article we will discuss how OOP works and what are its fundamental concepts and terms. We will also see some key algorithms associated with object-oriented programming and their implementation using different languages like Python and Java. Finally, we will compare and contrast these two implementations. 

Before jumping into any examples or explanations, let us understand why do we need OOP? Let's say you want to develop a simple calculator app which performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Without an OOP approach, you may write several functions or classes such as add(), subtract(), multiply() and divide(). However, when your project grows bigger and more complex, managing all those functions becomes difficult. You can easily forget about updating one function and break the entire functionality of your app. With OOP, you can abstract away common functionalities and reuse them across multiple modules. This way, it becomes easier to manage codebase, make changes quickly and improve maintainability. Additionally, you get better modularity and scalability in your software development projects. 

With this background knowledge, let’s proceed further and start our journey into understanding OOP from scratch. 

Let me give you a brief overview on OOP terminologies:

1. Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines data members and member functions that define its behavior.

2. Object: An object is an instance of a class created at runtime. It has properties and methods(member functions) associated with it.

3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to binding data with the methods that operate on it within a single unit, known as a class. It allows access to internal variables and prevents direct modification by external code outside the class definition. 

4. Abstraction: Abstraction means hiding irrelevant details and showing only necessary information to the user. Abstraction enables us to focus on essential features while ignoring unnecessary details.

5. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where one class inherits the properties and behaviors of another class called base class or parent class. The derived class or child class extends the capabilities of the parent class.

6. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take many forms. It allows calling the same method on different objects depending upon the context or usage. Polymorphism enables us to write flexible and modular code that can work with different types of objects.

7. Interface: An interface is a collection of abstract methods that specify the behavior of a class but does not provide any implementation. Interfaces enable various objects to be interchanged without affecting each other directly.

Now let’s move ahead and explore these concepts with an example in Java language. 

Example #1: Creating Objects
In Java, every variable is an object and therefore they are instances of the "Object" class. Here's an example of creating a Person object:

```java
public class Person {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  
  public void setName(String name){
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  public void setAge(int age){
    this.age = age;
  }
  
  public void printDetails(){
    System.out.println("Name: "+this.name+", Age: "+this.age);
  }
}
```

We have defined a Person class which contains two attributes - name and age. We have provided getters and setters for both the attributes so that they can be accessed and modified from outside the class. 

To create an instance of this class, we simply use the following syntax:

```java
Person p1 = new Person(); // Create a person object named 'p1'
```

This creates an empty Person object. Now we can assign values to its attributes using its setter methods:

```java
p1.setName("John");
p1.setAge(25);
```

After assigning values to attributes, we can print the details of the object using the `printDetails()` method:

```java
p1.printDetails(); // Output: Name: John, Age: 25
```

We can create multiple instances of the Person class to represent different people:

```java
Person p2 = new Person();
p2.setName("Jane");
p2.setAge(30);
p2.printDetails(); // Output: Name: Jane, Age: 30

Person p3 = new Person();
p3.setName("Bob");
p3.setAge(40);
p3.printDetails(); // Output: Name: Bob, Age: 40
```

Note that each object is independent of others and has its own state represented by its attribute values. Therefore, modifying one object does not impact the state of another object.

That's pretty much everything we need to know about objects in Java! Next, let's look at some core concepts related to inheritance and polymorphism in Java.
