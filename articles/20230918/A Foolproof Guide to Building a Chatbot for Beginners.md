# 1.简介
  

Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular in the last few years due to their ability to assist users with various tasks and services via natural language conversations. In this article, we will discuss how to build your own chatbot from scratch using Python programming language, which is an open-source language widely used by data scientists, developers, and machine learning researchers. We also provide clear step-by-step instructions on how you can create a chatbot that has basic functions such as greeting, asking questions, answering them correctly, and providing feedback. Additionally, we'll cover some more advanced features like incorporating NLP techniques or integrating with other APIs such as databases or third-party platforms. Finally, we'll highlight some best practices for creating a successful chatbot and give suggestions for further reading and learning materials. This article is intended for those who have basic knowledge of Python programming language but may not be familiar with machine learning or AI concepts.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
Before we dive into building our chatbot, it's important to understand some fundamental terms and concepts related to it. Let's briefly review these terms:

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): It refers to the field of computer science involved in understanding human languages and converting them into machines-readable formats. We use natural language processing algorithms such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition to extract insights from user inputs.
2. Dialogflow: It is a cloud-based platform that helps us to design and develop conversational interfaces. We need to register on its website first and then create our chatbot project through the dashboard. Once the project is created, we can add intents, entities, and API integration. 
3. Intent: It is the purpose or goal of a conversation with the chatbot. For example, if we want to book a flight ticket, the "intent" would be to confirm the reservation details and payment information. The chatbot needs to understand what the user wants to do before responding back to the user.
4. Entity: An entity represents something specific mentioned in the user input. For example, if we ask the user to specify the airport they want to travel from and to, the "entities" could be city names such as New York and London. These types of entities help the chatbot identify relevant information about the user's query.
5. Training Data: It contains a set of examples where the chatbot should respond appropriately based on different user queries and responses. 

# 3. Building a Simple Chatbot 
In this section, we will demonstrate how to build a simple chatbot using Python and Flask framework. Before proceeding, make sure you have installed Python and Flask on your system. Here's the code snippet to get started:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def home():
    return '''
        <html>
            <head><title>Simple Chatbot</title></head>
            <body>
                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <form method="post">
                    <label for="query">Enter Query:</label>
                    <input type="text" id="query" name="query"><br><br>
                    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
                </form>
                
                {% if response %}
                <p>{{response}}</p>
                {% endif %}
                
            </body>
        </html>
    '''
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code creates a very simple HTML form that asks the user to enter a query and sends it to the server when submitted. When the query is received at the server side, it simply returns a default message saying "Hello!" instead of actually performing any action. If we run this script and navigate to http://localhost:5000/ in our web browser, we should see the following screen:


Now let's modify the `home()` function so that it performs a small task - it takes the user input and greets them accordingly. We can achieve this using string manipulation in Python. Add the following lines after line 7:

```python
elif request.method == 'POST':
    # Get the user input from the POST request
    query = request.form['query']
    
    # Perform a small task - Greet the user according to their query
    if 'hello' in query.lower() or 'hi' in query.lower():
        response = f'Hi! Nice to meet you.'
    else:
        response = 'Sorry, I don\'t understand you!'
        
    return home(), {'response': response}   
```

Here, we check whether the user's input includes either "hello" or "hi" (case insensitive) and generate a personalized response accordingly. We store the response in the variable called `response` and pass it to the template along with the updated version of the homepage content. Now, if we submit a query containing either "hello" or "hi", we should receive a personalized response:


Note that we included two conditionals (`elif`) because we only want to perform this behavior when the HTTP method is post. We return both the rendered homepage content (with the new response displayed underneath the text box) and the response itself in JSON format (using the `return`, `,` notation). You can access this JSON response by calling `/` with the `Accept: application/json` header.
