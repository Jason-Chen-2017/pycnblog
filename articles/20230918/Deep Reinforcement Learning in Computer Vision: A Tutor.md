Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of machine learning that enables agents to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. DRL has emerged as an essential tool for solving complex problems in robotics, autonomous driving, gaming, finance, healthcare, etc., which involve sequential decision making with uncertainties. It can be used in image recognition tasks such as object detection and classification, instance segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc., where the goal is to identify and understand objects or actions by observing visual inputs.

The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) research in computer vision and related fields. We will introduce basic concepts, algorithms, and operations involved in DRL methods, including image observations, agent design, training, evaluation, exploration, and imitation learning. In addition, we will explore recent advancements and challenges in DRL research in computer vision. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion on open issues and future directions for further research in DRL in computer vision.

This article assumes readers have prior knowledge of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Familiarity with RL terminology and underlying mathematical theory are also helpful but not required. This document provides a high-level perspective on existing works in DRL in computer vision, outlining the main challenges and current trends, providing detailed explanations and illustration of key technical components like neural network architectures, exploration strategies, model-based versus model-free approaches, and reward functions.

# 2.基本概念、术语介绍

In this section, we first define some key terms used throughout the article. Then, we explain how DRL is applied in computer vision using three fundamental principles - observation, policy, and value function approximation. Next, we discuss different exploration strategies and their role in achieving better performance during training. We then summarize the steps involved in applying DRL in computer vision, including data collection, architecture selection, algorithmic details, and implementation. Finally, we cover common issues and potential pitfalls encountered while implementing DRL in computer vision systems, and suggest ways to mitigate them.


## 2.1 Terms and Definitions

1. Observation: An observation refers to the input provided to an agent during interaction with the environment. For example, in the case of image recognition tasks, an observation could be an image patch extracted from a video frame at a particular time step. 

2. Policy: A policy specifies the behavior of the agent within the given environment based on its perceptual inputs. A policy could be deterministic or stochastic, depending on whether the agent's decisions are fully determined by its past observations or subject to randomness.

3. Value Function Approximation: A value function approximator takes in an observation and outputs a scalar value representing the expected return achieved by following a specific policy from that point onwards. It learns the mapping between observations and corresponding expected returns to improve the accuracy of estimating rewards.

4. Exploration Strategy: An exploration strategy determines how the agent explores the environment before it begins optimizing its policies. The primary purpose of exploring new states and actions is to avoid getting stuck in local minima or dead ends, leading to poor generalization abilities. There are various exploration strategies used in DRL, including epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann exploration, Gaussian noise injection, Q-learning noise injection, multi-arm bandit exploration, or intrinsic motivation exploration.

5. Data Collection: The process of gathering a set of trajectories experienced by an agent in the real world is called data collection. Typically, data collection involves sampling sequences of images from videos taken by cameras installed over long periods of time. These sequences form the basis for training data sets for DRL models in computer vision. 

6. Architecture Selection: The choice of neural network architecture influences both the expressiveness and stability of the learned representations, enabling the agent to make accurate predictions about the state space and take optimal actions. There are many architectures available for use in DRL in computer vision, ranging from simple feedforward networks to more sophisticated hierarchical ones like residual nets and transformers. 

7. Algorithm Details: The actual implementation of DRL requires careful consideration of several parameters, such as the number of updates performed each time step, the size of replay buffers, and the frequency of parameter updates. We briefly review these important hyperparameters here. 

8. Model-Based vs Model-Free Methods: Traditional RL methods rely heavily on model-based techniques, which estimate the dynamics of the system and derive insights into optimal control policies directly from it. On the other hand, model-free methods do not rely on explicit modeling of the environment and instead attempt to learn best policies directly from samples obtained from interactions with the environment. This distinction becomes even more significant when considering imitation learning methods, which typically require expert demonstrations in order to transfer knowledge across environments. 

9. Reward Functions: The objective of an agent interacting with the environment is often defined through a reward signal, which encourages the agent to behave appropriately according to the observed features of the environment. Different types of reward signals are possible, including sparse or dense binary feedback, numerical values assigned to individual events, or continuous values estimated by a predictive model trained on previous experience. 

10. Batch Size: The batch size is the number of sampled experiences used for updating the agent's parameters in each iteration of the learning process. Increasing the batch size improves the convergence rate of the optimization procedure, but increases the computational resources needed to train the agent. 

11. Number of Epochs/Iterations: The number of epochs refers to the total number of times the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the network during training. Decreasing the number of epochs may lead to slower convergence, especially if the initial learning rate is too large. 

12. Target Network: The target network maintains a copy of the online network during training, which is periodically updated with the weights of the online network. This helps to stabilize the learning process by reducing oscillations due to correlations between consecutive gradient updates. 

13. Experience Replay Buffers: An experience replay buffer stores previously experienced transitions and serves as a source of stochasticity for generating batches of training data. During training, the most recent transitions are discarded, whereas earlier ones are prioritized for replay. The priority of each transition is determined by the temporal difference error between the predicted discounted future reward and the empirical return obtained after taking the same action in the same state. 


## 2.2 Principles of DRL in Computer Vision

DRL in computer vision relies on four core principles: observation, policy, value function approximation, and exploration. Let us now see how these principles apply to a typical problem of image classification in object detection.  

### 2.2.1 Observations

An observation refers to the input provided to an agent during interaction with the environment. Image classification in object detection typically involves processing multiple frames captured by camera mounted over an object to detect the presence of objects and classify them accordingly. Each frame is represented as a sequence of pixels, which can be fed directly into a CNN as input. Therefore, the input representation for any frame is an image patch. 

However, another type of observation commonly used in DRL in computer vision is an optical flow field, which captures motion patterns between adjacent frames. Optical flows enable the agent to reason about spatial relationships among objects and recognize movement patterns, making it easier to track objects and adapt to changes in appearance over time. Therefore, DRL in computer vision often combines image patches and optical flow fields as part of its input representation.

### 2.2.2 Policies

A policy refers to the behavior of the agent within the given environment based on its perceptual inputs. In object detection, the agent receives two separate observations - an image patch and an optical flow field. The task of the policy is to select one of the two options - either perform object detection solely using the image patch or incorporate the information from the optical flow field as well. One popular approach is to choose between a classification head and a regression head, where the former performs binary classification on the image patch only and the latter uses the optical flow field to refine the detected bounding box positions.

Another aspect of policy design relates to the way the agent interacts with the environment. For example, in certain situations, the agent might need to trade off accuracy and robustness against speed and flexibility. In this case, it might prefer to focus on maximizing precision rather than recall, allowing for slight deviations from the true ground truth labels. To achieve this level of control, the policy might employ a combination of multiple heuristics and domain-specific priors, relying on expert guidance or risk-averse exploration mechanisms. 

### 2.2.3 Value Function Approximation

Value function approximation (VFA) is a central component of DRL in computer vision, particularly for imitation learning. VFA estimates the expected future returns associated with each state visited by the agent. By computing VFA on the fly during training, the agent can update its policy based on the anticipated outcome of each decision made by the agent. Similarly, VFA can help to guide the search for good solutions during exploration by giving the agent hints about what is likely to succeed and what might fail. However, as mentioned above, traditional RL in computer vision tends to favor simpler and faster methods, especially those based on model-based approaches like Q-learning. 

Recent work in DRL in computer vision explores combining deep learning techniques with classical RL algorithms to jointly optimize the agent's policy and value function. For example, AlphaZero, a grandmaster level AI chess player that defeated Stockfish, was trained using a combination of supervised learning and self-play. The idea behind AlphaZero was to combine strong Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and neural networks to establish a generalizable policy that could handle challenging games of chess despite being limited by the enormous amount of computation power necessary for MCTS alone. The final AI model consisted of a hybrid CNN-LSTM policy network and a mean squared error loss function. 

Overall, DRL in computer vision requires careful consideration of the choice of input representation, policy structure, exploration strategy, and value function approximation method. Moreover, there exist diverse applications of DRL in computer vision, including object detection, scene understanding, event prediction, and tracking. 

## 2.3 Exploratory Strategies

Exploration plays an important role in training DRL agents. Without exploration, the agent would never become proficient at identifying relevant features and actions in the environment, leading to low levels of success during training. Various exploration strategies are used in DRL to encourage exploration early in the training process and gradually decrease the preference for purely exploitative strategies later on. Some of the most widely used exploration strategies include epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann exploration, Gaussian noise injection, Q-learning noise injection, multi-arm bandit exploration, and intrinsic motivation exploration. 

### Epsilon-Greedy Exploration Strategy

Epsilon-greedy exploration consists of randomly selecting an action with probability ε and choosing the argmax action otherwise, where ε is a hyperparameter that controls the degree of exploration. Initially, ε is set to a high value to ensure that the agent explores frequently initially. Over time, as the agent learns from its own experience, it can reduce the value of ε to bias towards exploiting the known parts of the environment and increase the value of ε to exploit novel portions. At test time, however, the agent always selects the greedy action, i.e., the action with the highest expected reward under the current policy. Epsilon-greedy exploration is effective because it promotes active searching of the environment for areas of uncertainty and avoids getting trapped in a local minimum by actively probing the unknown regions.

### Boltzmann Exploration Strategy

Boltzmann exploration generates a soft distribution over possible actions, similar to Thompson sampling, and chooses an action proportional to its probability under the current temperature. The temperature hyperparameter controls the degree of exploration, with higher temperatures resulting in greater exploration and lower temperatures resulting in less exploration. Under high temperatures, the agent chooses the action with the highest probability, and under very low temperatures, all actions have equal probabilities. The advantage of Boltzmann exploration is that it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is able to efficiently search for diverse solutions. However, since the agent needs to evaluate the effect of every action individually, it may still encounter local minima or get trapped in narrow passages. Despite these shortcomings, Boltzmann exploration remains a powerful exploration strategy for imitation learning in computer vision.

### Gaussian Noise Injection Exploration Strategy

Gaussian noise injection exploration adds small random perturbations to the policy output at test time, drawn independently from a zero-mean unit-variance normal distribution. This makes the agent resilient to sudden changes in the environment and prevents it from falling into local minima. Gaussian noise injection is effective at exploiting non-local regions of the state space, especially those that correspond to unlikely next states. It can also prevent the agent from becoming trapped in a regime of constant error, which can arise due to an incorrect initialization of the agent's parameters or faulty reward function.

### Q-Learning Noise Injection Exploration Strategy

Q-learning noise injection is a modification of standard Q-learning that injects additional noise into the update rule to encourage exploration and prevent overfitting. Specifically, the agent modifies the Q-value update rule to add a normally distributed random term to the Q-function estimate, which corresponds to adding noise to the action-value estimate. The injected noise follows a fixed schedule, with smaller magnitudes starting late in the training process and increasing to maximum strength later on. This allows the agent to escape local minima and explore the entire state space more thoroughly, potentially finding better solutions. While Q-learning noise injection has been shown to be effective in some domains, it has yet to be compared systematically with other exploration strategies and evaluated on real-world tasks. Nonetheless, Q-learning noise injection remains a valuable technique for exploring large state spaces.

### Multi-Arm Bandit Exploration Strategy

Multi-arm bandit exploration involves allocating small fraction of available budget to each arm of the multi-armed bandit, chosen uniformly at random. The agent tracks the cumulative reward collected so far for each arm and chooses the arm with the highest reward until the remaining budget reaches zero. Once the agent finishes interacting with the environment, it switches to a greedy policy that always selects the arm with the highest reward seen so far. The advantage of multi-arm bandit exploration is that it scales well to larger state spaces and supports adaptive exploration schemes that change the allocation of budget over time. The disadvantage is that it does not necessarily exploit all parts of the state space, which can lead to inefficient exploration and slow convergence.

### Intrinsically Motivated Exploration Strategy

Intrinsically motivated exploration aims to discover useful skills and behaviors in the environment by analyzing the agent’s internal representations and preferences. To accomplish this, the agent learns to evaluate its actions relative to both the immediate reward received and the expected future reward under the agent’s current beliefs. Based on this evaluation, the agent adjusts its beliefs in response to changes in the external environment, leading to improved exploration of rare or unexplored regions of the state space. Intrinsically motivated exploration can leverage existing skill discovery tools like GPT-3 and OpenAI CLIP, which can analyze raw pixel observations and generate synthetic captions describing the surrounding scenes. Additionally, intrinsically motivated exploration can be combined with model-based techniques like Bayesian filtering and MDP solvers, which allow the agent to maintain a probabilistic model of the environment and plan ahead to maximize future reward. Despite its promise, intrinsically motivated exploration remains a nascent area of research in DRL in computer vision.
