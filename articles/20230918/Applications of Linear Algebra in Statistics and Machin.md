Linear algebra is one of the most important areas of mathematics that underpins a wide range of modern applications, from computer graphics to statistical analysis and machine learning. Its foundations include vector spaces, linear transformations, matrix decompositions, determinants, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues. Many real-world problems can be solved by applying these concepts or by utilizing their numerical methods. In this article we will explore some applications of linear algebra in statistics and machine learning with emphasis on how they are used in solving various practical problems. 

In brief, there are two main categories of applications of linear algebra:

1) Statistics: This includes topics such as regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, hypothesis testing, and time series analysis. We will discuss some basic linear algebra concepts like vectors, matrices, norms, distances, and singular value decomposition (SVD). Some common algorithms for processing data include principal component analysis (PCA), multivariate linear regression, factor analysis, and k-means clustering. 

2) Machine learning: Here we focus on models that learn patterns from training data without explicitly specifying the model parameters. These models use optimization techniques based on convex functions such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks. The core mathematical ideas behind them lie in probability theory, linear algebra, and optimization. Common algorithms involve backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent, regularization, and kernel tricks.

This article assumes readers have at least a basic understanding of linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and programming skills in Python or other high level languages. It also covers some advanced mathematical concepts but does not require an extensive background knowledge beyond what is necessary for understanding the content discussed here.

The following sections provide more details about each category of application and illustrate the approach using examples. Finally, we conclude with a few suggestions for further reading and references.

## 2.1 概念术语
### 2.1.1 向量空间（Vector Space）
Vectors are a fundamental concept in linear algebra. A vector space V over a field F is a set of objects that obey the following axioms:

1. Vector addition is associative and commutative: u + v = v + u
2. There exists an additive identity element e in V called the zero vector: ∀u∈V, e+u=u+e=u
3. For every vector v in V, there exists a scalar multiple of it such that v*c = c*v = v if c is any scalar in F.
4. Multiplication by scalars is associative and distributive with respect to vector addition: c(u+v)=cu+cv; uv=vu*(vxw)/(vwx) for all triplets of vectors u, v, w in V

A vector space V over a field F is said to be a complete metric space if there exists a positive number ε > 0 such that for every pair of vectors u, v in V, dist(u, v) ≤ ε implies u = v. If δ(u, v) denotes the distance between u and v in R^n, then the inner product defined as <u, v> = sum_i u_i * v_i is well-defined and satisfies the following properties:

1. Non-negativity: <u, v> ≥ 0 for all u, v
2. Symmetry: <u, v> = <v, u>
3. Triangle inequality: |<u, v> + <v, w>| ≤ |<u, v> + <v, w>|
4. Positive definiteness: exists non-zero vector z in V s.t. <z, z> = 1


### 2.1.2 矩阵乘法（Matrix multiplication）
Two matrices A and B over a field F are said to be compatible if A has n columns and m rows and B has m columns and p rows where n, m, and p are integers greater than or equal to 1. Matrix multiplication AB is defined only when the dimensions of A and B satisfy certain conditions, i.e., A has m columns and n rows while B has p columns and r rows, where both m, n, p, and r must be even numbers. The resulting matrix C has n rows and p columns and represents the dot product of corresponding row vectors of A and column vectors of B, i.e.,

C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^m A_{ik}B_{kj}

For any integer j ≤ p, let Sj represent the submatrix obtained by taking out row j from the first p columns of B, which has size n x r. Then, Sjk can be interpreted as the jth row of S multiplied by the kth column of A. Thus, the product of A and B written in terms of Sj is equivalent to the matrix multiplication expression above.

If A is invertible, then its inverse Ab is defined and satisfies the following properties:

1. C = AB => CA = I 
2. AX = b => X = Ab⁻¹b 

where I denotes the identity matrix of size n x n. If B is invertible, then its inverse is given by B⁻¹. More generally, if A is invertible, we say that B is semidefinite positive definite (SPD) if BBᵀ is symmetric positive definite for any semidefinite positive definite B. Similarly, if B is SPD, we say that A is PSD if AAᴴ is SPD for any PSD A. Note that this definition is slightly different from the usual terminology in the literature since our intention is to consider cases where B is invertible instead of just square matrices. 


### 2.1.3 SVD分解（Singular Value Decomposition）
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a way of decomposing a rectangular matrix into three parts, U, Σ, and Vᵀ, where U and V are unitary matrices, Σ is a diagonal matrix containing the non-negative singular values of the original matrix sorted in descending order, and the leading diagonal entries of Σ are known as “singular values” or “eigenvalues” of the matrix. Let A be an m × n matrix over a field F. Then, we have the following representation:

A = UΣVₜ
where U is an m × m unitary matrix, Σ is an m × n diagonal matrix with non-negative entries and decreasing order on the diagonal, and V is an n × n unitary matrix, up to sign flips. The SVD of A can be computed efficiently using iterative algorithms such as QR algorithm. Specifically, let A be an mxn matrix and Q be an mxm orthogonal matrix with the property that Q'Q = I. Then, we can compute the SVD of A as follows:

A = QΣQT 
Where QT is the transpose of the upper triangular part of T, with ones on the diagonal. Therefore, we can find the SVD of A by computing its QR decomposition, obtaining a factorization A = QR with R being an upper triangular matrix. Next, we extract the U and V matrices as follows:

U = QT
V = Qtanspose(R)T 

Finally, we sort the diagonal entries of Σ in descending order and discard any zeros appearing due to rounding errors.  

Some common operations performed on SVDs include:

1. Truncation: keep only the top K largest/smallest singular values and corresponding left and right singular vectors, where K is chosen according to the required accuracy requirement.
2. Reconstruction: reconstruct the original matrix from the left and right singular vectors along with their respective singular values.

We can use SVDs to solve a wide variety of statistical problems such as linear regression, PCA, and factor analysis. For example, we can project new observations onto a reduced dimensional space obtained by reducing the dimension of the observation matrix using SVD. Alternatively, we can estimate the underlying factors of variation present in the data using low rank approximations of the data matrix obtained using SVD.
