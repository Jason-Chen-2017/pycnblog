As of April 22, 2020, there have already been over 3.7 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, up from just over 2,500 on February 1st. However, this number may increase as the true scale of the outbreak remains unknown. In response to the rapid spread of the virus, many countries have implemented strict control measures such as stay-at-home orders, curfews, social distancing guidelines, and strengthening of healthcare systems.

## Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, and has quickly spread around the globe. As of May 11, 2020, more than 970,000 cases have been reported across 183 countries and territories, including at least 36 million in Europe and Asia alone. Coronavirus disease 2019 is known as the new coronavirus that originated from an old one called SARS-CoV.

## Disease spreads through airborne particles or droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, or breathes. These particles contain small amounts of virus that can be easily carried by droplets throughout the airways and into the lungs. This means they can be transmitted via close contact with someone who is breathing it. There are different types of viruses, which are divided into two categories based on their replication mechanism: alpha and beta strains.

Alpha strains are mainly found in birds, while beta strains are found mostly in humans. Alpha strains cause mild illness such as common cold, while beta strains cause severe diseases like pneumonia, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, etc.

The transmission rate of COVID-19 varies widely depending on factors such as age group, sex, underlying medical conditions, vaccination status, and travel history.

## Lockdown
Lockdown refers to restrictive measures put in place by government authorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include closing public spaces, limiting gatherings, advising people to practice good social distancing, closing schools, and imposing severe economic restrictions. Governments around the world have taken several measures to try and stem the spread of the virus, but each country still faces its own unique set of challenges. Some successful strategies include promoting physical distancing, adopting universal basic income policies, enforcing mandatory masks on all workers, and offering financial assistance to those struggling financially.
