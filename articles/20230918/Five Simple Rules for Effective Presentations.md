# 2. Planning
The first step in creating an effective presentation is planning. In order to get started on the right track, it is crucial to gather all necessary materials together beforehand. This may include researching the topic, reviewing current presentations related to the same topic, analyzing competitors' presentations, conducting user interviews, and collaborating with other departments or individuals within the organization to determine what is needed to create an engaging and impactful presentation. Additionally, during the planning stage, it is important to keep in mind the intended audience, their level of expertise, and any specific requirements they have such as time constraints, accessibility needs, or language preference. Here are some general steps to plan your presentation:

1. Determine the objective of your presentation
2. Choose the target audience
3. Analyze the problem/issue
4. Outline the core points
5. Create a presentation template or outline
6. Schedule meetings / calls with stakeholders to review and discuss
7. Set up working materials (slide decks, notes, etc.)
8. Define communication goals and deadlines

Here are some examples of how to use planning to create an effective presentation:

Example 1: Creating a technical talk for executives
The manager at ABC Company wants to raise awareness around a new product launch. They would like to share the benefits of the product, but they don't know exactly where to start. So they decide to create a brief tech demo presentation for executive management team members. 

Step 1: Determine the objective of the presentation - To introduce the product and its features to the executives. 
Step 2: Choose the target audience - Management executives. 
Step 3: Analyze the problem/issue - The company has been looking for a replacement for a legacy system, which could potentially save money and reduce costs. However, the old system isn't compatible with the latest version of the software, so it requires significant modifications. 
Step 4: Outline the core points - The presentation should highlight the product's advantages over the existing system and explain why customers might choose it instead. It should also demonstrate how the customer interface works, showcase usage scenarios, and describe how the product can fit in with the rest of the enterprise ecosystem. 
Step 5: Create a presentation template or outline - A slide deck or outline can be created based on the basic structure of the presentation, including slides for introducing the product, highlighting its features, and demonstrating how it works. 
Step 6: Schedule meetings / calls with stakeholders - The executives involved in the presentation must agree to attend the meeting, whether it's face-to-face or virtual depending on the size and complexity of the group. 
Step 7: Set up working materials - Slides, notes, and any other supporting material required for the presentation should be prepared ahead of time. 
Step 8: Define communication goals and deadlines - Communication goals for this type of presentation might include creating awareness among executives about the potential benefits of the product and encouraging them to consider switching to the newer technology. Deadlines might involve setting a date for when the presentation should be delivered.

Example 2: Conducting a survey for marketing promotion
An online retailer wants to test out a new marketing campaign. They need to collect feedback from both existing customers and interested visitors to gauge their interest and satisfaction. So they hire a marketing specialist to conduct a quick survey for targeted customers and ask visitors if they have any thoughts on the brand. They set up a Google form and schedule a call with the marketing director to review and edit the questions before publishing the results.

Step 1: Determine the objective of the presentation - To gain feedback on the new marketing strategy and products. 
Step 2: Choose the target audience - Interested customers and visitors. 
Step 3: Analyze the problem/issue - There were concerns raised regarding the reliability of the sales channels due to COVID-19 pandemic. They decided to test out a new offering and survey existing customers for opinion. 
Step 4: Outline the core points - The presentation should focus on promoting the brand and suggesting ways to improve the overall experience. It should also address issues raised by the visitors and evaluate the satisfaction levels of the existing customers. 
Step 5: Create a presentation template or outline - The marketing director can work closely with the marketing specialist to come up with the appropriate questions for the survey. Once ready, he or she can create a slide deck or outline to display the questions and request feedback from various groups. 
Step 6: Schedule meetings / calls with stakeholders - The marketing director and the marketing specialist should be scheduled to review and revise the survey prior to the public release. 
Step 7: Set up working materials - One working document can be used to record responses to the survey and any analysis performed on the data. Additional resources such as graphs and tables can be included in the slideshow. 
Step 8: Define communication goals and deadlines - Communication goals for this type of presentation might include generating leads for the new market and assessing customer loyalty. Deadlines might involve setting dates for reaching out to prospective customers and sharing the results.
