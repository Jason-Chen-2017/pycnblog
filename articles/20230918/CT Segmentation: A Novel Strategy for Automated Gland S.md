Cancer tumor segmentation is the process of dividing the image into its different parts to identify and analyze the cells inside each region of interest (ROI). The goal of automatic gland segmentation is to identify and segment the cancer glands present in a breast lesion image. This will help doctors diagnose the disease more accurately and treat patients better. However, achieving high-accuracy automated gland segmentation remains challenging because it requires a good understanding of how individual cells behave and interact within their surroundings to correctly classify them as tumors or glands. 

In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for automated gland segmentation that combines two complementary techniques: cell classification and nuclear size analysis. We use machine learning algorithms to automatically classify each individual cell in an image based on its morphological characteristics such as shape, color, texture, etc., while also analyzing its nucleus area using mathematical tools like PCA and Mahalanobis distance. By combining these two techniques, our proposed methodology achieves high accuracy in identifying both tumors and glands. Furthermore, it takes advantage of the spatial context information obtained from all the cells in the image to generate accurate boundaries between glands and background, even when there are no visible delineations in the original images. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating it on various datasets with different tumor types and patient populations. Our results show that our method can achieve similar performance to human experts but with significant improvements over other state-of-the-art methods.

# 2. Background and Concepts

## 2.1 Cancer Tumor

A cancer tumor is a malignant growth involving one or multiple tissues. It may be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous), and occurs throughout the body. When the tumor grows, it invades through the skin, the bloodstream, and the internal organs, causing damage to various structures including tissues, nerves, and organs. Cancers of the colon, rectal, lung, liver, stomach, brain, heart, spleen, and bladder are the most common among all diseases. There are three main types of cancer: 

- Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC): Produced when abnormal cells form in the epidermis and lining of the outer surface of the epithelium of the skin. 
- Adenocarcinoma (ACC): Produced when abnormal cells form in the connective tissue, which makes up the inner layers of the skin.
- Sarcoma (SC): Produced when abnormal cells form in the connective tissue and/or muscle tissue of the body. 

## 2.2 Glands

Glands are small structures found within the body wall of certain bones and cartilages called tarsals. These structures typically contain a few fatty tissue and fluid-filled cavity where the cells reside. Depending on the type of cancer, some glands are located inside the tumor or outside it. For example, a tumor composed primarily of squamous cells might have glands located within the epidermal layer of the skin or at the base of the tumor. On the other hand, adenomas often possess pillar-like or lobule-shaped glands surrounding the tumor, whereas SCs usually have elongate bulbous glands with deep margins.

## 2.3 CT Scan 

An X-ray, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is performed on the breast tissue using advanced equipment. In general, CT scans capture details about the structure, function, and composition of the breast tissue in all dimensions of space, enabling detailed interpretation of the pathologic changes observed during surgery or following radiation therapy procedures. 

## 2.4 Algorithmic Approaches

The problem of automated gland segmentation requires complex algorithmic approaches due to the large amount of variations in the appearance, shapes, and sizes of glands, and the difficulty of distinguishing between tumors and normal glands without prior knowledge. 

One commonly used technique for segmentation is pixel-based classification. Within each ROI, individual pixels are classified based on their value intensity, contrast, and edge detection properties. This technique works well for most cases, but it fails to account for local features and multi-scale interactions across the entire tumor. Other techniques include region growing and watershed segmentation, which require manual intervention to define the borders of the glands. Another challenge is the complexity of handling missing data, artifacts, noise, and cluttered regions.

Another technique is feature-based classification. Here, instead of relying solely on visual aspects of the pixel values, more powerful computer vision algorithms can extract relevant features such as edges, textures, and contours that characterize the geometry and topology of the objects. This allows for more precise segmentation since the shape and location of the glands is taken into consideration. However, this technique requires specialized hardware and software infrastructure that is difficult to deploy across a wide range of platforms and settings.
