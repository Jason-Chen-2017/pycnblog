Data visualization is an important aspect of data analysis and it helps in understanding the relationship between different variables. The plotly express library provides a user-friendly interface for creating interactive visualizations that are easy to create, publish, and share. In this article we will learn how to use this powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing data in python. We will be covering topics like basic concepts of plots, creating line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, pie charts, and animations. 

By the end of this article you should have learned:

1. Different types of plots available in plotly express library.
2. How to create various kinds of plots using syntax provided by the library.
3. Syntax for customizing your plots according to your requirements.
4. Importance of exploratory data analysis before performing any type of analysis on your dataset.
5. Why and when to use animations in data visualization.
6. Understanding limitations and best practices while working with large datasets.
7. Interpreting the results obtained from our plots to draw insights and make better decisions based on data analysis. 


## What is Plotly?
Plotly is a popular web-based platform which offers advanced data visualization tools such as plotting libraries, dashboards, analytics, and maps. It provides users with high-quality graphs, maps, and statistical plots along with other functionality including machine learning models, financial modelling, and more. It also has a vast community support that enables users to seek help from experts and learn new techniques quickly. In summary, Plotly provides a wide range of useful features and capabilities for data visualization and exploration.

## Installing Plotly Express
Before we begin with our journey into data visualization with plotly express library, let's first install the necessary packages and get them up and running. To start with, we need to install plotly and plotly express library. We can do so using pip package manager by executing the following command in our terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install plotly==4.9.0
```

The above command installs the latest version (at the time of writing) of plotly library. However, at the moment of writing this article, there were some bugs in the latest versions of the library, hence we installed the specific version mentioned in the command above. 

After installing these packages, we can import both plotly and plotly express libraries in our python script file as follows:


```python
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```

We will use `px` module for creating all types of plots except for three special ones (`go.Scatter3d`, `go.Surface`, and `go.Isosurface`) which requires separate installation. Once imported, we can move forward with our journey into data visualization with plotly express library. 

Let’s dive deeper into what each of the modules does and its functionalities:

1. **plotly** - This is the main module responsible for rendering and displaying all the figures created using other submodules. 

2. **express** - This submodule contains functions to generate commonly used chart types like line plots, bar charts, scatter plots etc., making it very simple for us to visualize our data without having to write complex code. 

3. **graph_objects** - This module provides classes for representing all sorts of objects on a graph. Some of the most common classes are Scatter, Bar, Histogram, Box, Violin, Contour, Heatmap, and more. Each class represents a particular type of chart and exposes properties that allow us to customize the appearance of the figure accordingly. For example, we can set color, size, labels, title, ticks, gridlines, legend position, animation duration etc., depending on the object type being represented.  

Now that we understand the basics of plotly, plotly express and graph objects, let’s see how to use them to create various types of plots.<|im_sep|>
