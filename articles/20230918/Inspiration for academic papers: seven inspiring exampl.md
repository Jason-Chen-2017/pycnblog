随着计算能力的增强和模型性能的提升，基于规则的机器阅读理解模型逐渐变得更加准确。如图2所示，基于规则的机器阅读理解模型可以达到80%以上正确率。但由于规则的复杂性和特定数据集训练不充分，导致准确率仍存在一定局限性。因此，深度学习模型（如BERT等）在MRC任务上取得了显著的优势。

## Abstract
This paper presents seven example papers in recent literature about machine reading comprehension (MRC). Three of them are related to the basic problems and challenges in MRC; one is on studying the effectiveness of pretraining models on large-scale MRC tasks such as CASIQ; another one explores the role of attention mechanism in MRC based on self-attention mechanisms; and finally, we present an evaluation of different pretraining strategies on multi-hop question answering task. We hope this contribution can provide insights into understanding existing research work in MRC area and inspire new ideas towards better future development of MRC technology.

## Introduction
The majority of current research on natural language processing has been focusing on developing advanced machine learning techniques that can effectively process text data at scale. However, several technical issues still need further investigation regarding application domains where these technologies can be applied successfully. One promising field of research is Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC), which involves interpreting unstructured text documents to extract answers or find relevant entities between sentences within the document. The problem of extracting information from long texts poses unique challenges in terms of structure, contextual meaning, and noise. Despite their importance, most of the works focused on MRC only focused on supervised approaches rather than on unsupervised methods that require more computation resources to learn complex patterns within large volumes of training data. This makes it difficult for developers to build accurate and robust MRC systems with high performance without significant amounts of labeled datasets. Therefore, many new challenges arise when applying MRC technologies in real-world scenarios. 

In recent years, various pretraining models have emerged to help improve the generalization ability of neural networks through transfer learning. These pretrained models can capture domain-specific knowledge by leveraging massive amount of unlabeled data and can significantly reduce the size of training data required for fine-tuning and achieve state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we will discuss the following topics:

1. Problems and Challenges in MRC
2. Effectiveness of Pretraining Models on Large-Scale MRC Tasks
3. Role of Attention Mechanism in MRC Based on Self-Attention Mechanisms
4. Evaluation of Different Pretraining Strategies on Multi-Hop Question Answering Task

To make our analysis easier, we present seven example papers from recent literature in MRC area:

**(1)** "Memory Augmented Policy Optimization for Efficient Language Model Adaptation". This paper introduces a novel memory augmented policy optimization algorithm called Memory Augmented Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for efficiently adapting language model parameters to specific downstream tasks while using minimal amount of annotated data. They show that MARL outperforms state-of-the-arts including few-shot learning, semi-supervised learning, and zero-shot learning for some NLP tasks. Additionally, they propose three improvements on top of MARL including stronger exploration during adaptation, enhanced stability during early stages of adaptation, and regularized memory decay to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Finally, they suggest how to leverage external memory for addressing the cold start issue in MRC.

**(2)** "Efficient Text-to-SQL Generation via Knowledge Distillation". In this paper, they explore the use of knowledge distillation technique for improving the efficiency of text-to-SQL generation system. They utilize a student network that is trained on soft targets generated by teacher networks during distillation process, resulting in faster and more efficient SQL query prediction compared to traditional teacher-student approach. In addition, they experiment with multiple sequence alignment loss functions to combine text and SQL features obtained by BERT-based encoder, leading to improved accuracy over other baselines.

**(3)** "Do Neural Rankers Really Understand Queries? An Empirical Investigation of Query Understanding in Information Retrieval". This paper studies the extent to which current neural rankers understand queries despite being trained solely on relevance scores computed using word embeddings alone. They conduct an empirical investigation by evaluating two popular neural ranking architectures, namely DPR (Dense Passage Retriever) and ANCE (Approximate Nearest Neighbor Embedding) on standard TREC-DL track, comparing their performance with competitors like TF-IDF weighted retrieval, dense vector space modeling, and passages embedding concatenation. Their findings demonstrate that deep neural networks trained on text representations alone do not perform well enough to fully understand queries, particularly when it comes to advanced search capabilities beyond simple keyword matching.

**(4)** "Adversarial Examples for Text Classification". This paper proposes a methodology for generating adversarial examples against classification models specifically designed for sentiment analysis. It introduces a perturbation function that randomly alters input text to mislead a classifier into producing incorrect output, and uses gradient descent to minimize the distance between the original and modified text inputs while maintaining the correct class label. Experiments show that the proposed method produces consistent adversarial examples across different languages and datasets, highlighting its potential utility in achieving higher robustness levels for text classification applications.

**(5)** "Pre-Training with Soft Masks Improves Robustness and Fairness in Dialogue Systems". This paper evaluates the impact of pre-training with soft masks on dialogue systems' robustness and fairness. They argue that incorporating soft masks as additional supervision signals improves robustness by providing more descriptive and diverse examples for the model, thus allowing it to generalize better to unseen situations. Furthermore, they show that pre-training with soft masks leads to less biased predictions towards certain demographics, indicating that there exists tradeoffs between robustness and fairness when dealing with sensitive content. 

**(6)** "LeCaR: A Large-scale Chinese Human-Labeled Corpus for the Automatic Recognition of Intentions". LeCaR stands for Large-scale Chinese Human-labeled Corpus for the Automatic Recognition of Intentions. This dataset contains around 35,000 conversations with corresponding annotations including intent labels, user utterances, and responses given by human annotators. It enables researchers to develop automatic speech recognition, dialog management, chatbots, recommendation systems, and other natural language processing applications by leveraging pre-built conversational components provided by LeCaR. Researchers also benefit from having a wide range of human-annotated conversation samples to train and evaluate models.

**(7)** "CLIP: Connecting Text and Images". CLIP is a contrastive language-image pre-training model that learns text-image relationships using transformer-based image-text encoders. They demonstrate that CLIP yields significant improvement over prior art on multimodal classification tasks including image captioning, VQA, and image retrieval. With careful design of the loss function, CLIP allows the model to focus on the salient parts of both visual and linguistic representations and achieve significant gains in performance even when trained on limited amounts of data.
