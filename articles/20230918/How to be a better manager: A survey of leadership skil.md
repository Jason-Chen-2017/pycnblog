# 2.Background Information
To effectively lead teams or organizations through change management is a challenging task that requires attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, communication skills, interpersonal skills, and ability to motivate team members to achieve desired outcomes. Without effective leadership, a company may suffer from disruption, lack of growth, decreased productivity, negative impact on customers, and loss of revenue opportunities. It’s essential for managers to understand and apply various leadership techniques and tools that help them manage these complex processes efficiently. Therefore, there exists a need for knowledgeable professionals who can turn insights into action. However, this process takes time as it involves careful planning, research, analysis, and decision-making based on experience, knowledge, and perspectives. To become a more effective leader, learners must continuously seek out new learning materials and train themselves so that they can take advantage of best practices and developments in leadership. Moreover, embracing a holistic approach towards leadership development will allow you to create lasting impressions and instill confidence in your employees while building stronger relationships across the organization.

# 3.Key Concepts and Terminology
Before we begin discussing about leadership, let's first understand key terms and concepts involved. These concepts and definitions are crucial because they define the context and scope within which our discussion would span. Here are a few important ones:

1. Vision and Mission Statement: 
Vision statements establish the long-term direction of the company, whereas mission statements focus on the short-term goals and objectives set by stakeholders. Both are needed to guide and support the efforts of the leaders. 

2. Team Culture: 
A team culture is defined as the set of values, beliefs, norms, expectations, and behaviors that promotes success among its members. It includes positive values like empathy, respect, and collaboration. In order to build a successful team, leaders must demonstrate their commitment to creating a healthy environment of trust, communication, and inclusion. 

3. Evolutionary Purpose: 
Evolutionary purpose refers to the overall goal of a company beyond simply providing goods and services. Companies aim to transform society by leading lives that enhance wellbeing, prosperity, and happiness. There are several ways to frame evolutionary purposes such as achieving economic growth, addressing social issues, improving public safety, advancing human rights, enhancing cultural diversity, etc. 

4. Leadership Style:
Leadership styles refer to the way leaders engage in different situations, managing challenges differently. Some popular leadership styles include authoritarianism, consultative leadership, consensus-based leadership, meritocracy, power play, psychological safety, service orientation, transformational leadership, etc. Each style brings its own unique characteristics and influences on leadership decisions. 

Now that we know the basics behind leadership, let's move ahead and discuss about some effective techniques used by individuals to improve their leadership capabilities.
