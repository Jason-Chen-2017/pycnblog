>Puzzle is a combination of letters and numbers that requires the player to solve for missing information or determine a sequence of steps to complete a task. In this article, we will use logic programming technique known as Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver along with python libraries such as `pycosat` and `csp_solver` to solve different types of puzzle problems. 

## Introduction to constraint satisfaction problem
A CSP consists of three main components- variables(or nodes), domains, and constraints. The variables are called *states* or *variables*, which can take on values from some domain, represented by a set {a1,…,an}. Constraints represent relationships between pairs of states. These relationships constrain the possible combinations of variable assignments so that there exists at least one assignment that satisfies all of the constraints. If no such assignment exists, then the CSP has been solved successfully.

In other words, CSP is a problem where you have to assign values to certain unknowns (variables) based on given conditions. It's similar to finding solutions to math equations or sudoku puzzles. Here's an example of a simple CSP having two variables X and Y:

    Variables:
    - X belongs to {1, 2, 3}
    - Y belongs to {1, 2, 3}
    
    Constraints:
    - X + Y = 4
    - X >= Y
    
This CSP says that X and Y can take only values either 1, 2 or 3. We also have two constraints here- first one states that the sum of X and Y should be equal to 4, while the second constraint ensures that X always has a value greater than or equal to its corresponding value of Y.

Here's another more complex example of a CSP:

    Variables:
    - A belongs to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    - B belongs to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    - C belongs to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    - D belongs to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    - E belongs to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    
    Constraints:
    - A + B + C <= 7
    - A^2 + B^2 = C^2
    - A + B < 5
    - A + C + D = 8
    - A == B + E
    - A!= 3
    
 This CSP has five variables A through E and nine constraints. We assume that each letter represents any number between 1 and 5 inclusive. The first four constraints state that A, B, C cannot add up to more than 7, which means it could not exceed total of seven units; The next constraint is a square equation that squares of A and B must be equal to C squared; And finally, we have eight constraints that specify various relationships among these variables.
 
Based on the above examples, we can say that a CSP problem can be classified into several categories depending on how many variables and constraints exist. Some CSP problems may have hundreds of variables and millions of constraints. However, most common CSP problems involve only dozens of variables and tens of constraints.


## Different types of CSP Puzzle Problems
There are mainly six types of CSP puzzle problems:

1. Sudoku Puzzles
Sudoku is a popular puzzle game consisting of a 9x9 grid containing digits. Each row, column, and nonet can contain every digit from 1 to 9 exactly once. The goal of the game is to fill in the entire grid with unique digits while adhering to the above mentioned rules. 

2. Crossword Puzzles
Crosswords are word games in which players spell out a crossword puzzle consisting of clues found in a newspaper, magazine, etc., and try to identify the correct answer. Each puzzle consists of several rows and columns filled with random characters, and clues within them asking players to place specific words in the specified positions. Crossword puzzles usually require knowledge of both letter placement and word definition.

3. N-Queens Puzzle
The N-Queens puzzle is a classic puzzle involving placing N queens on an NxN chessboard so that none of them threaten the others' line of sight. There are multiple ways to approach solving this puzzle using CSP techniques. One way is to enumerate all possible configurations of N queens and check if they're valid according to the constraints given in the problem statement.

4. Minesweeper Puzzles
Minesweeper is a board game where the objective is to clear a rectangular area of cells without stepping on any mine tiles. The mines appear randomly throughout the grid, some percentage of which are marked as "blanks". Initially, the user needs to mark the remaining blanks accurately, revealing the locations of the mines, before proceeding to open adjacent unmarked cells. Similarly, our CSP puzzle solver would help us to find the best arrangement of the mines and avoid hitting any mine tile during the process.

5. Kingdom Wars Puzzle
Kingdom Wars is an ancient fantasy warrior game in which players fight against one another in order to conquer their kingdoms. Kingdom wars is actually a special case of CSP since each location on the map represents a variable, the resources available at that location define its domain, and the relationship between variables defines the constraints. Although Kingdom Wars offers limited choices for actions like movement and combat, it still provides interesting challenges for AI systems due to its complexity and realistic environmental factors.

6. Adventure Game Pathfinding
Adventure game pathfinding involves navigating a maze or other obstacle course, visiting certain points of interest, and completing quests or missions while avoiding obstacles such as thieves, monsters, and traps. Unlike traditional pathfinding algorithms, CSP solvers often consider various aspects of the game world including item availability, equipment equipped, enemy strength, level of difficulty, and time constraints when planning routes. Adventure game pathfinding is a great application scenario for CSP techniques because it involves reasoning over large, partially observable environments.
