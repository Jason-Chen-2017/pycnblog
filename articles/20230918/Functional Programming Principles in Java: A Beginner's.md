# 1.简介
  

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is based on the Lambda Calculus introduced by Alonzo Church in his paper "The Lambda calculus". In this article, we will discuss how to use functional programming principles in Java, including immutability, higher-order functions, recursion, pattern matching, and lambda expressions. We also provide examples of using these features in real world applications such as sorting, filtering, and aggregation. The goal of this article is for readers to gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles behind functional programming in Java and how they can be applied to solve problems in various areas.
# 2.Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you should have basic knowledge about object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, such as classes, objects, methods, constructors, access modifiers, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and abstract classes. You should also be familiar with some basic math terminology like function, parameter, argument, return value, variable, and conditionals. If you are not familiar with these topics, please review them before proceeding further. This guide assumes that the reader has at least intermediate level proficiency in Java development.
# 3.What is Functional Programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes using pure functions to transform input data into output data without any side effects or external state modification. Functions are considered first class citizens in functional programming, which means they can be treated just like any other data type. Immutability is one of the key ideas underlying functional programming because it promotes data independence and predictability. By design, all inputs must be declared and cannot change during execution. Instead of modifying data directly, programs create new copies of modified data. Another important concept in functional programming is recursion, which enables programmers to write elegant solutions to complex problems by breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems that can then be solved recursively. Pattern matching is another feature of functional programming that allows developers to handle different types of input data differently. Finally, lambda expressions offer a concise way to define small pieces of code that can be used repeatedly. All of these core functional programming principles together form what is known as the Zen of Python, which offers practical wisdom for how to approach solving programming challenges effectively.
# 4.Immutability
In functional programming, data is immutable. That means once a piece of data is created, its values cannot be changed after creation. Instead, if we need to modify a piece of data, we always create a new copy of the original data. Immutability ensures that data remains consistent throughout our program and prevents unintended side effects caused by mutation. One advantage of immutability over traditional OOP programming is that it simplifies the logic required to manage shared state across multiple threads of execution. 

Java provides several mechanisms to enforce immutability in your code, including making fields private and final, making collections unmodifiable, and using copy constructors when creating new instances of existing objects. Here is an example of how to make a string field immutable in Java:

```java
public class Person {
    private final String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter method for name property
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    // Make constructor private to prevent direct instantiation of person objects
    private Person() {}
}
``` 

Here, we defined a `Person` class with a single `final` field representing the person's name. This makes it impossible to accidentally modify the `name` field outside of the constructor. To ensure immutability, we provided a default no-args constructor and made the constructor private so that people cannot create `Person` objects directly from outside the class. Additionally, getter methods are available to allow clients to view the current state of the object but not modify it directly. However, client code still needs to take precautions to avoid passing around references to the internal state of the object, especially if they are working in a multi-threaded environment.

Using the builder pattern, we can further improve the flexibility and reliability of our code by allowing clients to construct `Person` objects in a controlled manner while ensuring immutability:

```java
import java.util.Objects;

public class Person {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;

    public static class Builder {
        private final String name;
        private Integer age;

        public Builder(String name) {
            this.name = Objects.requireNonNull(name);
        }

        public Builder age(Integer age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }

        public Person build() {
            return new Person(this.name, this.age);
        }
    }

    private Person(String name, Integer age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age == null? -1 : age;
    }

    // Getters...
    
}
```

Here, we moved the implementation details of the `Person` class into a separate `Builder` inner class. The `Builder` uses `private` fields instead of getters and setters to ensure immutability. When a client wants to create a new instance of `Person`, they call the `build()` method on their `Builder` object. At this point, the `Builder` checks that the `name` field was initialized correctly and constructs a new `Person` object using the validated values of `name` and `age`. Note that we included some additional error handling here to handle cases where the `age` field was left unset.

Overall, immutability helps us achieve more robust and reliable systems by reducing race conditions, improving consistency, and enabling easier testing and debugging.
