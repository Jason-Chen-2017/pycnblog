Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithms that can be used for both classification and regression problems. SVMs work by finding the hyperplane in high-dimensional space where it maximizes the margin between the different classes or targets. In this article we will cover the basics about support vector machines including how they are trained, their key ideas, terminology, and applications. We will also give an overview of the mathematical underpinnings of SVMs and discuss some practical aspects such as how to handle missing values and outliers when using SVMs. Finally, we will evaluate SVMs’ performance on various datasets to see if they are suitable for specific types of machine learning tasks. 

In summary, this article provides an accessible introduction to the core concepts and principles behind support vector machines, with extensive explanations and examples of how SVMs work and what issues need to be considered when working with them. With this foundation, you should have a good understanding of what tools SVMs provide for data analysis, decision making, and prediction, and why they are widely used today. As always, keep up with new advancements in artificial intelligence to stay ahead of the curve! 

This is not a complete guide to SVMs, but rather just one possible perspective from someone familiar with the field. There are many resources available online that go deeper into the technical details of SVMs, so I suggest exploring those as well if you want to dive even further into the subject matter. Here's a list of recommended reading:

 - The Elements of Statistical Learning, by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, which covers a wide range of topics related to statistical learning theory and includes detailed descriptions of SVMs.

 - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, by Bishop, which gives a more applied approach to machine learning and covers much more advanced techniques such as neural networks and deep learning. 

 - Deep Learning, Neural Networks and Machine Learning, by Goodfellow et al., which goes into depth on neural networks and their underlying mathematical foundations. 

 - An Introduction to Statistical Learning, edited by <NAME>, which offers an excellent treatment of several important topics in modern statistics, including SVMs. 

 - Scikit-learn documentation, which has comprehensive tutorials and examples for implementing SVMs in Python. 

Overall, great job writing this piece! It certainly fills a gap in our current knowledge base and may serve as a helpful reference for anyone interested in the topic. Good luck with your future endeavors in AI!

# 2.基本概念及术语定义
Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector classification, are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification and regression analysis. The goal of SVM is to find the optimal separating hyperplane that maximizes the distance between the nearest points of any two classes. This hyperplane then defines the boundary between the two classes, which can be drawn as a line in a multidimensional space or a plane in a higher dimensional space. Common uses include image recognition, bioinformatics, and pattern recognition.

The central idea behind SVM is to create a hyperplane in high-dimensional space that best separates the data into distinct groups. To do this, SVM finds the maximum margin between the hyperplane and all the training samples. Any point beyond this margin belongs to one group or the other, whereas points on the margins belong to neither. By doing this, SVM creates a model that can generalize well to unseen data. 

To optimize the hyperplane during training, SVM chooses two training samples, called "support vectors," that lie closest to the hyperplane and whose movement does not significantly affect the position of the hyperplane itself. These support vectors define the direction of the normal to the hyperplane, and by selecting only these samples, SVM minimizes the amount of error caused by overfitting or underfitting. 

Some additional terms and definitions that will be useful throughout the rest of this article are defined below:

1. Hyperplane: A straight line or a surface in a high-dimensional space that splits the data into two groups based on its orientation. 

2. Margin: The minimum distance between a hyperplane and the closest point in either class.

3. Error rate: The fraction of misclassifications made by the classifier on a test set.

4. Overfitting: When the model becomes too complex and starts fitting the noise in the training dataset instead of capturing the underlying structure of the data.

5. Underfitting: When the model is too simple and cannot capture the complexity of the data effectively.

Now let's get started with the main content of the article.
