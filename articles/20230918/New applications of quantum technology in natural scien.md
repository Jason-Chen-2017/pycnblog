Quantum technology has been around for a long time and is actively used in various fields including physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, computer science, finance, engineering, etc., to solve problems that were once considered impossible or very difficult to solve with classical computers. In recent years, quantum technology has become more advanced than its predecessors due to the development of new hardware devices such as superconducting qubits (SQUIDs), atomic-level quantum gates, topological qubits and trapped ions. Quantum computing offers unprecedented potentials for solving complex problems by breaking down the curse of dimensionality that arises from traditional computers. Although quantum technology can be regarded as revolutionary, it still faces many challenges, especially when it comes to real-world application. Researchers and engineers are working on developing practical solutions for industrial and natural science problems based on quantum computing technologies. In this article, we will discuss some research efforts in this field and provide an overview of future research directions. We also hope that our discussion will inspire readers to think about their own ideas and seek collaboration with others to develop new applications using quantum technology. 

# 2. Concepts & Terms
Before discussing the actual research works related to quantum computing applied to natural sciences and industry, let’s first clarify some basic concepts and terms commonly used:

1. Superconductivity - The study of the phenomena associated with normal electrical currents passing through a material called superconductor. The process of applying electricity to such a material results in a flow of electrons that change energy levels and create interferences between them, resulting in magnetization or superconductivity.

2. Semiconductor device - A device consisting of one or more layers of semiconducting material bonded together in a periodic array to form a structure known as a transistor. The semiconductor material includes metallic atoms and oxides that undergo electronic transitions through excitation and de-excitation of electrons, creating charge carriers or photons. 

3. Transistor - An electronic component consisting of two semi-conducting regions separated by an insulating layer and connected at the edges by junction or tunnel barrier layers. It is responsible for converting electric current into electromagnetic radiation.

4. Quantum gate - A quantum mechanical operation that consists of two or more states of matter occupying different physical degrees of freedom simultaneously. These quantum gates can act on multiple qubits or even entire circuits, enabling quantum computation and information processing tasks.

5. Qubit - A quantum bit or particle that can exist in either a singlet or doublet state depending upon the direction of its spin. Each qubit can interact with other qubits or bits via logical operations like NOT, AND, OR, etc. Thus, qubits are essentially tiny computers capable of carrying digital data or performing logical operations.

6. Tomography - A method of reconstructing an object by projecting light onto a sample, which then produces a map of the object’s surface containing multiple shadows or features. This mapping technique allows scientists to determine the shape, size, arrangement and orientation of objects without direct observation. Tomographic imaging involves imaging optics, microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or X-ray techniques to produce images of objects by detecting reflected illumination from a flat specimen of a known three-dimensional shape.

7. Quantum algorithm - An algorithm designed specifically to take advantage of quantum mechanical effects instead of traditional computational resources, allowing efficient and accurate calculations. Quantum algorithms have revolutionized modern cryptography, telecommunications, transportation, medical diagnosis, finance, securities trading, quantum simulation, artificial intelligence, sensing systems, security analysis and much more.

# 3. Core Algorithm and Steps
The core algorithm used in quantum computing applied to natural sciences and industry is based on principles of superposition and entanglement. Here's how these principles work in brief:

1. Entanglement - Two quantum systems or particles that are not normally coherent (non-entangled) cannot communicate directly because they do not share any common resource such as energy, momentum or position. However, if they are linked together in a way that changes the behavior of each system in such a way that both behave differently, they can exhibit properties of entanglement. For example, if you had two identical chairs side by side, where each chair was equally likely to be facing upwards or downwards, but you could never tell which face each chair was showing unless you picked it out and made it visible separately, then these two chairs would exhibit entanglement since they are linked by the shared environmental conditions in front of them. Once you pick out one chair, there exists no single determinable outcome for what the other chair might show until you also reveal its hidden status.

2. Superposition - One major feature of quantum mechanics is that of wave-like nature. Therefore, if we start with a base state of a system and apply certain operators or transformations to it, the system may move through different combinations of states resulting in a superposition of all possible configurations. When two systems are entangled, their combined behavior is dependent on the joint behavior of their individual parts rather than simply the summation of their individual behaviors. By considering the interactions among quantum particles, we can harness these properties to design quantum algorithms that can achieve exponentially higher performance compared to conventional digital computations.

Here are steps involved in implementing a quantum algorithm to classify handwritten digits using supervised learning approach:

1. Data preparation – Collecting and cleaning dataset of handwritten digits.

2. Encoding data – Representing input data into a quantum format so that it can be processed by the quantum circuit.

3. Training model – Applying various machine learning methods such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines or neural networks to train models on the given dataset.

4. Testing accuracy – Evaluating trained model’s accuracy using test set of handwritten digits.

5. Implementing quantum algorithm – Designing quantum circuit to implement classification task.

6. Running the quantum circuit – Implementing the designed quantum algorithm on a simulator or quantum computer to perform classification on the same dataset.

To ensure high fidelity in the quantum circuit, we need to use special types of gates such as Clifford Gates or Quantum Phase Estimation algorithms. Quantum phase estimation algorithm generates a sequence of angles that optimize the objective function while minimizing the number of iterations required to converge to the solution. Such optimization algorithms allow us to reduce the complexity of the quantum circuit significantly, making it feasible to deploy large scale quantum computers for quantum computing applied to natural science and industry.

In conclusion, the goal of quantum computing applied to natural science and industry lies in finding ways to leverage quantum mechanical principles and mathematical knowledge to enhance scientific advancements and transform industries by unlocking potential capabilities of quantum computers. Within this sphere, we are still far away from achieving full scale commercial success yet, but this remains an active area of research. Hence, it is crucial for everyone to collaborate and contribute towards building hybrid quantum/classical systems to enable breakthroughs in the coming years.
