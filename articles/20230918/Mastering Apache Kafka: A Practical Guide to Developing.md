# 2.基本概念术语说明
Apache Kafka refers to a fast, distributed streaming platform developed by LinkedIn in 2011. It has many features that make it ideal for building real-time messaging systems, such as scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance. Its main components include brokers, producers, consumers, topics, partitions, and offsets. Below are the key terms and definitions you need to know before getting started with Apache Kafka.

2.1 Brokers
A broker is where messages get stored and delivered to clients. Each client communicates with one or more brokers depending on its subscription. Clients submit requests to produce or consume messages to specific topics. 

2.2 Producers
Producers send messages to specified topics. They keep track of which topic they're publishing to, what partition(s) they belong to, their offset within each partition, and any metadata associated with those messages. When producing a message, producers select a partition based on a partitioner function provided by the user, or randomly if none is provided.

2.3 Consumers
Consumers read messages produced by other producers. They subscribe to specific topics and specify their own unique group IDs to ensure that all members of the group receive the same subset of messages. Consumers maintain an offset into each partition indicating the last consumed message. Whenever a new message is added to a partition, consumers automatically start reading from that point forward. 

2.4 Topics
Topics provide a categorization mechanism for messages. Producers and consumers communicate over topics rather than directly between themselves. Messages published to a topic do not expire unless explicitly set, allowing users to control retention policies. Topics allow multiple producers and consumers to interact seamlessly without requiring complex communication protocols or manual coordination.

2.5 Partitions
Partitions divide up a single topic across multiple servers to improve throughput and availability. Partitioned topics can be scaled horizontally simply by adding more brokers, providing great flexibility. However, managing and balancing partitions requires careful planning and configuration to avoid hotspots and bottlenecks.

2.6 Offsets
An offset is a marker indicating the position of the next message to be consumed. Consumers maintain an internal pointer indicating the current position in each partition. When consumers commit their positions, they claim ownership of certain messages so that they won't be lost even if the process fails or restarts. For example, if a producer crashes while writing to a partition, the latest committed offset may not match the actual write location, causing the consumer to miss messages.

2.7 Consumer Groups
Consumer groups are a way to consume a stream of messages from multiple consumers. Each consumer belongs to exactly one consumer group, identified by a name, and reads from the entire stream of messages rather than just a single partition. Within a group, consumers share ownership of partitions so that no two consumers read the same data simultaneously. Group membership changes take effect immediately and reassign ownership of partitions among remaining members. If a member leaves the group, its owned partitions are reassigned to the remaining group members.

2.8 Replication Factor
Replication factor determines the number of copies of each partition that should exist across different brokers. Having multiple copies of each partition ensures that if one copy becomes unavailable, another copy continues to service the stream until the original copy comes back online. Replicas enable load balancing across brokers, improving overall throughput and availability.

2.9 Zookeeper
ZooKeeper is an open-source server that acts as a centralized coordination service for distributed systems. Kafka uses ZooKeeper to manage cluster membership, assign topics to brokers, and coordinate cluster operations like leader election. Kafka requires at least three instances of ZooKeeper to operate correctly, but more are recommended for higher availability and scalability.

2.10 Asynchronous Operations
Kafka supports both synchronous and asynchronous message delivery mechanisms. Synchronous delivery means that when a client sends a request to publish a message to a topic, the operation waits for the response before returning to the client. On the other hand, asynchronous delivery means that the broker returns success or failure immediately after receiving the message, without waiting for the response.

2.11 Message Ordering Guarantees
When consuming messages from a partition, there are several ways to guarantee message ordering:

1. "At most once" delivery - A message might be delivered twice because of a retry or failover, but never lost.
2. "At least once" delivery - A message is guaranteed to be delivered at least once, but potentially duplicated.
3. "Exactly once" delivery - A message is delivered exactly once, i.e., once and only once, irrespective of failures or retries.
4. Unordered delivery - Messages are delivered as soon as available regardless of their order.

By default, Kafka implements "at least once" delivery semantics for non-idempotent producers. To achieve exactly-once delivery guarantees, however, additional infrastructure must be implemented at the application level.

2.12 Storage Engines
Storage engines store log segments containing messages. By choosing the appropriate storage engine, administrators can trade off latency against disk space usage and throughput. Log compaction combines smaller log segments into larger ones to reduce overhead and save space. Kafka currently supports log segments written in Java NIO buffers, which offers optimal performance for modern hardware architectures. Other options include direct memory access (DMA), persistent disks, and network file systems.

2.13 Compression
Compression reduces the amount of data needed to be stored by reducing redundancy, but increases CPU utilization and decompression time. There are two types of compression supported by Kafka:

1. Snappy - A popular compression algorithm that works well with byte arrays.
2. Gzip - A traditional compression method that works well with text files.

Kafka allows you to configure per-topic compression strategies to balance speed versus size. Specifically, you can choose whether to compress records individually ("lz4", "zstd"), batches of records together ("gzip", snappy), or disable compression altogether.

2.14 Authentication/Authorization
Kafka supports pluggable authentication and authorization mechanisms via SASL. Currently, Kafka supports PLAIN, DIGEST-MD5, AWS V4 Signing, OAuthBearer, scram-sha-256, sasl-gssapi, OIDC, and custom plugins.

2.15 Message Delivery Semantics
Message delivery semantics determine how Kafka handles duplicate messages and message loss during cluster failures. ConsumeOnce is the simplest delivery semantic where every message is delivered at least once, but duplicates are possible due to retries or failover. AtMostOnce is similar to "At Most Once" delivery from earlier versions of Kafka, meaning that each message is either delivered or not delivered. ExactlyOnce is the highest level of delivery guarantee where each message is delivered exactly once and without duplication, even in case of cluster failures.

# 3.核心算法原理及操作步骤
Apache Kafka was initially conceived as a highly reliable messaging system for large scale data streams. Its core algorithms rely on a few fundamental ideas:

1. Scalable partitioning scheme - Kafka divides incoming messages into partitions, which are distributed across different nodes in the cluster. Each partition is assigned to one node and gets replicated across others to increase fault tolerance.
2. Proactive replica management - Kafka assigns replicas to brokers dynamically based on the available capacity, minimizing the need for operators to manually adjust settings. This helps eliminate potential points of failure and improves scalability.
3. Simple API - Kafka provides a simple, intuitive API consisting of producer, consumer, and admin APIs that abstract away low-level complexity.

Let’s now understand these principles in more detail.

## Core Algorithm Principles
### Data Flow
The first principle of Apache Kafka involves the flow of data in Kafka. Here’s how it works:

1. Producers continuously generate messages and push them onto a queue called a “topic”
2. The messages go into different partitions of the topic, which are divided among the brokers in a round-robin fashion
3. The brokers responsible for each partition replicate the messages to other brokers in the cluster
4. Consumer processes fetch messages from the brokers for the partitions they are subscribed to


The above figure illustrates the flow of data in Kafka. Every piece of data goes through four steps in this pipeline:

1. Producer: Generates data and pushes it onto a topic. 
2. Broker: Assigns each message to a partition, which distributes it to other brokers in the cluster.
3. Leader Replica: Accepts writes and propagates them to follower replicas.
4. Follower Replica: Stores a local copy of the data. 

Each partition consists of one or more contiguous segments of data called log segments. These segments are sequenced, compressed, and encrypted for efficient storage.

### Key-Value Pairs
Kafka stores messages in a log structure called a topic. Each topic contains messages with keys and values. Keys are optional and can be used to identify related messages. Value fields are typically small chunks of data that carry useful information. Both keys and values can be arbitrary binary strings of up to 1 MiB in length.

Here’s an example message:

```python
{
  'key': b'alice', 
  'value': b'message_one', 
}
```

In addition to storing raw bytes, Kafka provides rich support for structured data formats like JSON, Avro, Protobuf, etc. It also supports schema versioning and evolution with compatibility checks.

### Scalable Partitioning Scheme
Scalability plays an important role in Apache Kafka. The distribution of data among partitions enables scaling horizontally by adding new machines, increasing the total volume of data processed by the system. This approach eliminates the risk of a single machine becoming a bottleneck. Instead, the workload is shared efficiently among all participating nodes.

Partitioning ensures that messages remain ordered within a topic and distributed across different nodes according to the configured replication factor. Partitions are grouped into sets called "topics". The number of partitions is determined upon creation of a new topic. Users can specify the replication factor for individual topics, which indicates how many copies of each partition should be kept in the cluster. This value cannot exceed the number of brokers in the cluster.

If a broker fails, one of its partitions moves to another broker. The movement is transparent to the rest of the system. Similarly, if a new broker joins the cluster, its partitions are redistributed among existing and newly arrived brokers to distribute the load evenly.

### Proactive Replica Management
Apache Kafka manages replicas for each partition dynamically, which simplifies the configuration process and saves operator effort. Replicas are asynchronously replicated from leaders to followers. The number of replicas is determined upon creation of a new topic, and can be increased or decreased later. Based on the distribution of partitions, Kafka chooses which replicas to promote or demote and rebalances the replicas accordingly.

To ensure fault tolerance, Kafka employs quorum-based voting protocols to elect a controller for the cluster and prevent split-brains. Quorums ensure that there are always enough active brokers in the cluster to serve as leaders or followers. If a majority of brokers fail, the cluster transitions to a standby mode, where one of the surviving brokers takes over as the new controller. The failed brokers come back online eventually and catch up with the latest state of the cluster.

### Fault Tolerance
Apache Kafka achieves fault tolerance through automatic replica management, strong consistency, and durability guarantees.

1. Automatic Replica Management: Kafka automatically replicates data across multiple nodes, ensuring that no single node becomes a bottleneck.
2. Strong Consistency: Kafka provides strict ordering guarantees among messages within a partition and across partitions within a topic.
3. Durability: All data is persisted on disk and is protected against any permanent loss. Kafka journals transactions on disk, ensuring atomicity and consistency of writes.

## Common Issues & Errors
Before jumping into implementation details, let’s talk about some common issues and errors that you may encounter when working with Apache Kafka. 

### OutOfMemoryError
Out Of Memory error occurs when your JVM runs out of free memory. Sometimes, this problem is caused by too much data being accumulated on the Kafka server. Try setting a retention policy on your topics to discard old messages periodically, or clean up unused logs to free up heap space. Another option is to upgrade the instance type or add more memory to the server.
