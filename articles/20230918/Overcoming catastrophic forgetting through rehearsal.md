Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a long-term decline in performance on tasks after they have been learned by neural networks, especially when new patterns or situations are encountered. This phenomenon has led to the development of various methods such as replay buffers and continual learning strategies that can mitigate this effect. However, these approaches only reduce forgetting over time but not immediately upon encountering a novel pattern or task. In this work, we propose an approach called Rehearsal Based Catastrophic Forgetting (RBC), which aims at reducing CF in real-world scenarios where a limited number of examples are available during training. Our proposed method uses a replay buffer with offline learning algorithms that include distillation and contrastive learning to effectively forget previously learned patterns while still maintaining current knowledge. The resulting model is able to quickly adapt to new patterns without forgetting any previous information. We evaluate our approach using several real-world benchmarks including image classification, language modeling, and sequential decision making tasks. Results show that RBC significantly reduces CF compared to standard techniques such as online learning and replay buffers, particularly on challenging tasks like language modeling and sequential decision making. Moreover, we demonstrate that RBC can achieve competitive or even better results than state-of-the-art baselines in terms of metrics such as accuracy and perplexity. Finally, we discuss future directions for research in this area and provide insights into how our approach may help solve other problems related to catastrophic forgetting in real-world scenarios.

Catastrophic forgetting (CF) refers to a situation in which artificial neural networks (ANNs) lose their ability to generalize beyond what was seen during training. It has become one of the most studied challenges in deep learning and there exist many approaches to address it such as regularization, transfer learning, continual learning, and replay buffers. All these methods aim to preserve knowledge acquired from previous tasks while adapting well to new ones. However, none of them offer immediate reduction in CF for a single new example that arrives outside of the context of known data distribution.
One major limitation of existing approaches is that they rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data during training, limiting their scalability to practical deployment settings. On the other hand, few works focus specifically on addressing CF in contexts where limited amount of training data is available. Another issue faced by contemporary ANN models is that they struggle to learn complex concepts like images or speech, due to their linear nature. To address this problem, a lot of effort has gone towards developing more powerful non-linear representations and architectures like transformers or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These models allow for greater flexibility and representational power, leading to significant improvements in performance on some tasks. Nevertheless, they also require vast amounts of training data and resources to obtain good performance. A promising direction for future research is to develop hybrid architectures that combine the benefits of both linear and non-linear representations. However, this involves balancing between expressiveness and ease of training, and requires careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve best performance.
Reproducing results published in the past remains important for evaluating the efficacy of proposed solutions. In this regard, several datasets have been used for testing different types of ANNs, such as MNIST, ImageNet, Penn Treebank, Wikitext-2, and LM1B. However, very little attention has been paid to test their capacity to handle catastrophic forgetting, despite its crucial role in enabling these models to perform well in practice. Additionally, several studies have explored the effects of various factors on catastrophic forgetting such as dataset size, network architecture complexity, and initialization strategy. However, less exploration has been done to understand the mechanisms behind why certain tasks lead to worse performance in catastrophic forgetting and potential factors that contribute to it.
We believe that further explorations into catastrophic forgetting under limited training regimes would be valuable for advancing the field of AI. Therefore, the goal of this article is to explore the possibility of solving CF in real-world scenarios where only a small number of examples are available during training. Specifically, we present a technique called Rehearsal Based Catastrophic Forgetting (RBC) that allows a model to quickly forget previously learned patterns yet retain current knowledge. We evaluate our approach against multiple baselines and show that RBC outperforms all others in terms of various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RBC can easily be integrated into existing pipelines and systems with minimal modifications, allowing it to scale up to larger datasets and enable improved performance in production applications.
