# 1.简介
  

Hierarchical clustering is a popular technique in data mining to group similar objects or entities together based on their relationships in a hierarchy structure. It involves dividing the entire dataset into smaller clusters that contain similar objects or belong to the same community. 

One of the most commonly used algorithms for hierarchical clustering is the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm (AHC), which starts by merging the two most similar objects or communities until there is only one big cluster containing all objects or communities. This process continues recursively until each object or entity belongs to its own cluster. 

Community detection refers to identifying groups of highly connected nodes in an undirected graph. In this case, we are interested in finding communities within a hierarchical network where each node represents an individual, organization or concept. These networks can be obtained from social media, web-based content or knowledge graphs such as Wikipedia. 

The HierGraph library provides efficient implementations of AHC and Louvain modularity optimization methods for both unweighted and weighted hierarchical graphs with overlapping community structures. The latter include support for multiple resolutions and directed hierarchical graphs. We also provide several evaluation metrics for evaluating clustering results and identify quality aspects such as balance, cohesiveness and coverage. Finally, our package includes visualization tools for exploratory analysis of hierarchical and community networks.

To the best of our knowledge, there exist no open source libraries providing efficient implementations of hierarchical clustering techniques for both unweighted and weighted hierarchical graphs with overlapping community structures. Most existing libraries focus solely on the latter category, but they do not offer any support for implementing clustering techniques for unweighted hierarchical graphs. Furthermore, these libraries usually rely on iterative approaches like k-means or Expectation Maximization for optimizing modularity while ignoring the underlying hierarchy structure.

Our approach is different from other related work in that it directly considers the hierarchy structure through explicit modeling of hierarchy partitions. Specifically, we use a Bayesian nonparametric prior distribution model to represent the hierarchy structure among nodes, allowing us to perform probabilistic inference over the membership probabilities of nodes to form subclusters. Our method simultaneously accounts for the hierarchy information during clustering by integrating them into the partition function of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for optimizing modularity. This allows us to capture the complex interplay between community structure and hierarchy structure and obtain more accurate solutions than traditional methods. Additionally, we provide various evaluation metrics that take into account the topology and geometry of the hierarchical and community networks, making our method more suitable for real world applications. Moreover, we have made significant improvements to the performance of our implementation compared to state-of-the-art methods by using GPU acceleration and parallel processing.

## Unweighted Hierarchical Graph Clustering Using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)
For unweighted hierarchical graphs, we propose an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm called Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC). AHC works by starting with every vertex in its own cluster, then merging pairs of adjacent clusters until all vertices belong to just one large cluster. Similarity scores between pairs of clusters are determined by their shared edge weights in the original graph. During each merge operation, we select the pair of clusters with the highest similarity score and combine them into a single new cluster.

At each iteration, AHC chooses the two clusters with the highest similarity score and merges them into a single new cluster. To measure the similarity between two clusters, we compute the Jaccard index, which measures the ratio of common neighbors between two sets. That is, given two sets A and B, the Jaccard index is defined as follows:

J(A,B)= |A intersect B| / |A union B|

We set γ=1 when computing the similarity score between clusters, since this corresponds to considering only the connections between neighboring vertices. At the end of each iteration, we assign each vertex to exactly one of the resulting clusters. 

## Weighted Hierarchical Graph Clustering Using Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC)
For weighted hierarchical graphs, we propose a divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm called Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC). DHC works by first splitting each leaf node into two child nodes, then progressively merging the resulting clusters to create larger clusters. Similarity scores between pairs of clusters are determined by their agreement in assigning edges of the original graph to the corresponding nodes in the current tree. During each split/merge operation, we select the pair of clusters with the highest similarity score and modify the current tree accordingly.

At each iteration, DHC splits each leaf node into two child nodes by selecting the two edges connecting to the largest number of nodes. It then computes the similarity score between the resulting clusters by taking the average weight assigned to the selected edges. Next, it selects the two clusters with the highest similarity score and merges them into a single new cluster. After each merge operation, DHC updates the similarity scores of all affected nodes in the tree by propagating the change to their parents in the tree.

## Overlapping Communities in Hierarchical Networks
In many applications, we may encounter hierarchical networks with overlapping communities, where some communities span across multiple levels in the hierarchy. For example, consider the following scenario:

Suppose we have a company with three departments: marketing, finance, and sales. Each department has a set of employees who collaborate extensively throughout the year. However, certain employees make frequent phone calls or meetings at the same time, leading to overlap in communication patterns. Thus, we might expect to see significant overlap in communication patterns among the employee nodes representing each department. In addition, suppose we know that employees tend to move around between departments depending on their responsibilities, so intra-department collaboration is expected. Therefore, we would expect to see dissimilarities in communication patterns among employee nodes within each department.

To handle such scenarios, we introduce a novel framework for detecting communities in hierarchical networks based on latent position estimation. Specifically, instead of assuming that each node belongs to its own unique community, we assume that the positions of nodes in the hierarchy correspond to distinct communities. We model the position of each node in the hierarchy as a multivariate normal distribution with a Gaussian likelihood function. We estimate the parameters of each distribution conditioned on its parent's position. By incorporating this extra layer of complexity, we enable our algorithm to discover overlapping communities and separate them effectively without requiring any pre-specified parameters or assumptions about how communities relate to one another in the hierarchy.
