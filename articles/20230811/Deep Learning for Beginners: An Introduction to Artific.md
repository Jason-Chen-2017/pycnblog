Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years with tremendous advances in various applications such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many others. However, it is challenging to understand deep learning from a beginner's perspective. This article aims at providing an easy-to-understand introduction to deep learning concepts, algorithms, and practical implementations using Python programming language. The article assumes readers have some knowledge of basic machine learning concepts like supervised/unsupervised learning, classification models, linear regression, and logistic regression. It also includes detailed explanations on mathematical operations performed by neural networks, including backpropagation algorithm and loss functions. Finally, this article will cover popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and MXNet, which are widely used today in industry and research labs. Overall, the goal of this article is to provide a complete guide for someone who wants to learn about the basics of deep learning, and get started quickly without being overwhelmed. With this tutorial, you can start building your own AI applications or integrate them into existing systems.

Before we dive into the core ideas behind deep learning, let’s briefly define some important terms that we will use throughout the article:

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Supervised learning refers to training a model using labeled data where each input sample is associated with its correct output label. In other words, the desired output is already known for certain inputs, and the aim of supervised learning is to develop a predictive model based on these labels. Examples include image classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis, etc. 

On the contrary, unsupervised learning involves training a model using unlabeled data, meaning there are no clear outputs associated with any given input. Instead, the aim of unsupervised learning is to discover patterns and relationships within the data. For example, clustering techniques group similar examples together while dimensionality reduction techniques reduce the number of dimensions in high-dimensional datasets.

## Classification vs Regression 
Classification problems involve predicting discrete output variables, such as classifying images according to their content (e.g., animal, human), detecting fraudulent transactions, or categorizing emails into folders. While regression problems involve predicting continuous output variables, such as predicting stock prices, diabetes progression rates, sales forecasts, etc. 

## Linear Regression vs Logistic Regression
Linear regression attempts to fit a straight line through a set of points in order to make predictions on new data points. On the other hand, logistic regression applies sigmoid function to map the predicted values between 0 and 1, making it useful for binary classification tasks, where two outcomes are possible - either the event occurs (1) or does not occur (0).

## Backpropagation Algorithm
The backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the weights of the network during training, allowing the model to adjust its parameters iteratively until it minimizes the error. 

## Loss Functions
Loss functions measure how closely the predicted results match the actual values during training. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross Entropy, and Kullback–Leibler divergence. These functions help determine how well the model is performing and help optimize the model by adjusting the weights accordingly.  

## Neuron Units 
A neuron unit takes multiple weighted inputs, adds them up, passes the sum through a non-linear activation function, and produces an output signal. Each neuron unit performs the same computation, but uses different sets of weights that were learned during training. A neural network is simply a collection of interconnected neuron units.

## Activation Function
Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the system by applying a transformation to the net input before passing it on to the next layer. Popular activation functions include Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh), Sigmoid, Softmax, etc. ReLU helps prevent vanishing gradients, reducing the risk of the network becoming stuck in local minima when training.

## Hidden Layer(s) vs Output Layer
Hidden layers are intermediate layers in a neural network that process input data and produce internal representations, which are then passed onto the output layer for final prediction. There may be more than one hidden layer, which allows the network to extract complex features from the input data.

Output layer consists of one or more neurons that generate the final prediction, depending on the type of problem being solved. If the task is classification, there may be one neuron per class; if it is regression, there might be only one output neuron.

## Gradient Descent Optimization
Gradient descent optimization algorithm updates the weights of the network by moving towards the direction of steepest descent along the cost surface calculated using the loss function. There are several variants of gradient descent such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, and adam optimizer.

## Overfitting vs Underfitting
Overfitting happens when the model learns too much from the training data and becomes biased towards them, resulting in poor performance on test data. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when the model cannot capture enough complexity in the data and fails to generalize correctly to new instances. To avoid both issues, hyperparameter tuning, regularization techniques, and dropout regularization should be applied to the model.
