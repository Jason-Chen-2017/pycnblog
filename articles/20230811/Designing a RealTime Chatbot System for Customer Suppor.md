Customer Service (CS) is one of the most important aspects of any company's success or failure. A well-designed and efficient CS system plays an essential role in providing high customer satisfaction through personalized interactions between customers and agents who are trained to provide high-quality support at all times. In recent years, chatbots have become increasingly popular among businesses due to their ability to provide valuable real-time assistance without having to wait for humans to respond. However, effective NLP techniques and systems for designing chatbots that can generate responses in natural language still need significant development efforts. This article presents a comprehensive overview on how to develop a real-time chatbot system for customer support using natural language generation techniques. We will also discuss various approaches such as machine learning models, rule-based chatbots, and deep neural networks. The reader should be able to understand the fundamental principles behind building chatbots capable of generating human-like conversations using natural language generation techniques.

# 2.Chatbot System Overview
A typical chatbot system consists of two main components: front-end agent interface and back-end conversational engine. 

The front-end agent interface typically includes a user interface where users interact with the chatbot either by text message or voice input. Depending on the specific requirements of your organization, you may choose different ways of presenting this interface to your customers such as websites, mobile apps, or social media platforms. Once the user inputs their question or request, it is passed from the UI component to the backend conversation engine which then processes the query and generates a response. The generated response could be displayed visually via text messages sent back to the user or spoken out aloud by the chatbot.

On the other hand, the back-end conversational engine is responsible for processing incoming queries and responding appropriately based on pre-defined rules, database records, and contextual information about the user. It comprises multiple modules including intent recognition, entity extraction, dialog management, and natural language understanding. These modules work together to extract meaningful entities and features from the input query, retrieve relevant answers from databases, and generate appropriate responses. An example of a common architecture for a chatbot system is shown below:


In summary, the goal of building a chatbot system for customer support involves developing accurate algorithms that accurately recognize user intents, extract entities, and select appropriate responses from database records while maintaining dialogue coherence and ensuring optimal engagement with end-users. With careful attention to details, good communication skills, and a keen eye for detail, we can build reliable and scalable chatbots capable of generating complex, engaging conversations in natural language format.

# 3.Natural Language Generation Techniques
Natural language generation (NLG), also known as text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT), is the process of converting computer readable data into human-readable text messages, audible signals, or both. NLG has several key advantages over traditional manual coding of response templates such as they allow for more natural and informal responses than static templates. Furthermore, NLG provides organizations the opportunity to customize responses to meet individual needs and preferences of their customers. To achieve this level of customization, organizations often use advanced NLP techniques such as semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, keyword matching, and entity resolution.

There are three basic steps involved in natural language generation:
1. Understanding - Extracting meaning from structured data or unstructured sources like emails or customer feedback.
2. Reasoning - Applying reasoning and logic to create accurate and consistent responses that address users' issues and concerns.
3. Generating - Using predefined templates or patterns to construct natural sentences that represent user intent and provide clear instructions.

Here is a brief explanation of each step:

1. **Understanding**: One approach to understanding the problem domain involves analyzing customer feedback data and extracting insights into what types of problems customers encounter and what solutions they seek. For instance, when troubleshooting hardware failures, analysts might focus on identifying symptoms and recommending remedies, while when dealing with financial queries, they would focus on identifying pain points and suggesting alternative products or services. By analyzing these insights, organizations can identify common themes across similar customer problems, thereby reducing redundancy and improving overall customer satisfaction. 

2. **Reasoning**: Another crucial aspect of natural language generation is incorporating reasoning and logical constraints into automated responses. Traditional static response templates may not always capture users' subtle nuances and emotions, leading to inconsistent or off-putting responses. Automatic responses must therefore include insights derived from large amounts of data, making use of natural language understanding tools such as semantic analysis and sentiment analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency.

3. **Generating**: Finally, given a set of analyzed data, generated responses must balance naturalness, readability, and clarity so that customers receive helpful, concise, and actionable advice. This requires selecting the right templates, defining grammatical structures, and adapting them to reflect the tone and style of the surrounding environment. Assembling these elements results in cohesive, consistent, and useful responses that highlight the value of the product or service being offered. Overall, good natural language generation techniques help organizations to deliver better customer experiences while minimizing costs and risks associated with traditional text messaging or call centers.
