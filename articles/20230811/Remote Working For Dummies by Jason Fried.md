Remote working (or teleworking) refers to the practice of working from a distance, or even in an office setting without being physically present at the company's premises. Many companies are now allowing employees who opt-in to work remotely using video conferencing and other technology tools. This allows workers to connect with colleagues across the world, and can lead to improved productivity, reduced commute times, and more efficient team collaboration. Despite these benefits, however, remote working still carries its own set of challenges that need to be overcome before it becomes routine. Here, we'll take a look at some common remote working challenges and how they affect people's day-to-day lives. 

This article will not go into detail about specific technologies used for remote working; instead, it aims to provide practical information on how to deal with them effectively. We'll also try to keep things accessible and approachable so that anyone interested in remote working can benefit from this guide. 

Note: While this is primarily intended as a beginner's guide, it may also serve as useful reference material for intermediate and advanced learners who want to better understand remote working practices. 


# 2.基本概念和术语
Before diving into the core of remote working, let's first define some basic terms and concepts:

- **Workstation:** A computer located inside a company's building or office where employees usually work directly. Workstations typically have high connectivity and power, but are often shared among multiple employees.

- **Downtime:** The time between when someone starts working and finishes their shift.

- **Distractions:** Unwanted interruptions that interfere with your work, such as emails, social media posts, notifications, phone calls, etc. These can include unexpected meetings, emergency situations, or sudden changes in weather conditions.

- **Switch-board/Hub:** A device that connects multiple devices together and acts as a central hub for communication between staff members. Switchboards help to reduce distractions by providing a single point of contact and routing traffic accordingly. 

- **VPN/Virtual Private Network:** An encrypted network tunnel that enables employees to access internal systems while staying connected through a public network. This helps protect sensitive data and ensures security during remote working sessions.

Now that we've covered some basics, let's talk about some of the major challenges faced by individuals trying to make the most of remote working. In general, there are three main categories of challenges:

1. Imposter syndrome: Lack of confidence caused by feeling unrecognized or isolated due to working remotely.

2. Physical isolation: Being required to live in a different location due to COVID-19.

3. Communication issues: Difficulty communicating clearly and concisely due to language barriers or cognitive disabilities. 

Here are some specific challenges faced by employees who are attempting to become fully remote:

- **Context switching:** As you're constantly moving around, it can be difficult to remember what task you were previously working on. To combat this, it's important to use multitasking techniques like screen sharing, breakout rooms, and chatbots to allow everyone to focus on one thing at a time. Additionally, don't rely solely on messaging apps like WhatsApp or Messenger—use email or meetings instead to share ideas, feedback, and coordinate efforts. 

- **Availability:** When you're working remotely, it can be tempting to sacrifice personal time by leaving the office altogether. However, it's crucial to maintain a regular schedule of checking in with colleagues throughout the day. Regular check-ins can help ensure that you're keeping up with tasks and avoid burnout. 

- **Teamwork:** It's essential to communicate effectively and listen closely to others' input when working remotely. Effective meeting scheduling can help avoid conflicts and get work done efficiently. Another way to improve teamwork is to encourage active participation by promoting engagement and openness within the team. 

- **Productivity:** Completing large projects or deliverables offline can be challenging because of long distances, slow internet connections, and lack of face-to-face interaction. However, it's possible to leverage online collaboration platforms like Google Docs or Slack to collaborate with co-workers and complete assignments independently.
