Word embeddings are one of the most popular techniques for natural language processing in deep learning. They have been used extensively to improve many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and machine translation. In this article we will learn about advanced word embedding techniques by implementing them with tensorflow library. 

In part-I, we will understand how a basic word embedding works, then we will implement three advanced techniques - skip-gram, CBOW and GloVe - that enhance its performance. We will also compare their results on different datasets to see which technique performs better. Finally, we will conclude the article by identifying some limitations of these techniques. 


# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology

## Word Embeddings
Word embeddings is a technique used for representing words in vector space. It maps each word into a fixed-dimensional space where similar words are mapped closer together than dissimilar ones. Vector representations of words can be learned from large corpora of text data, allowing NLP models to generalize better to new input texts. There are various types of word embeddings such as count based, predictive, neural network etc. Let’s consider two examples:

1. Count Based Approach: 
This approach involves counting occurrences of all possible pairs of words within a corpus and storing the resultant matrix. For example, if there are n distinct words in the vocabulary, then a countpair matrix would contain n^2 number of elements where each element represents the frequency of occurrence of the corresponding pair of words. This method does not take into account any context or relationships between the words other than their frequency of occurrence. 

2. Neural Network Based Approach:
Neural networks can automatically learn features from the training data while solving complex problems like classification, regression, clustering, etc. These features represent the semantic meaning of words in vector space. Thus, they can capture more meaningful relationships between words compared to count-based methods. However, building such systems requires expert knowledge and resources, making it expensive and time-consuming. 

### Examples Of Different Types Of Word Embeddings
There are several different ways to represent words in vector spaces depending on their underlying distributional semantics. Here are few common types of word embeddings:

1. One Hot Encoding:
One hot encoding refers to the representation of categorical variables as binary vectors, with only one entry being set to 1 and the others being zero. An example of one hot encoding could be “apple” -> [1,0,0], “banana”->[0,1,0] and so on. In contrast to word embeddings, this method lacks any structure and cannot capture the semantic relationships between words. 

2. Bag of Words Model:
Bag of words model assumes that the order of words do not matter, but rather, the presence or absence of specific words indicate whether a document contains a particular topic. A bag of words representation is typically represented as an array of word counts or frequencies in a given document. For instance, if we have a document containing five words “the quick brown fox”, we may represent it as [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. 

3. TF-IDF Weighted Word Vectors:
TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and captures the importance of individual terms in a document based on their frequency in the document and across the entire collection of documents. Each term is assigned a weight determined by its frequency in a document multiplied by the inverse document frequency, i.e., log(N/df_t), where df_t denotes the document frequency of the term t in the whole dataset. The resulting weighted vector provides a compact and informative representation of the text. 

4. Distributional Semantics:
Distributional Semantics assigns a unique vector representation to each word based on its use in similar contexts. For example, the vectors associated with words appearing in similar syntactic and semantic contexts are likely to be close together. On the contrary, unrelated words often share noisy, low dimensional representations. These vectors are learned automatically from massive corpora of textual data. 

# 3. Core Algorithms And Operations

Now let's discuss core algorithms and operations involved in applying these advance techniques.


## Skip-Gram Algorithm
Skip-gram algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm commonly used for generating continuous vector representation of words. Given a center word c and its neighboring window of size m around it, the aim of this algorithm is to learn to predict the surrounding word w_{i} based on the center word alone. Mathematically, it tries to minimize the cross entropy loss function between predicted probability distributions p(w_{j}|c) and true label y. The objective function looks like:
$$L=\sum_{c\in V}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(y_{ic}-p(w_{i}|c))^{2}$$
where $V$ denotes the set of all words in the vocabulary, $y_{ic}$ represents the target value indicating whether the jth word in the neighborhood of ith word is considered positive or negative, $\forall c \in V$, $\forall i \in {1...m}$.

Here, the focus lies on minimizing the squared error between actual and predicted values. The key insight behind this algorithm is that instead of considering the complete sentence as a sequence of words, it treats each word independently and trains a separate model for each word. Hence, it exploits the local context information of the surrounding words to make predictions for each center word.  


The figure above shows the skip-gram architecture. The input layer receives a one-hot encoded vector as input at every timestep. Then, after passing through multiple layers, the output is passed to the softmax activation function. Softmax gives us the probabilities of each word in the vocabulary being the next word in the sequence. The weights of the network are updated using backpropagation through gradient descent. The goal here is to train the network to correctly classify the next word in the sentence conditioned on the current word. 

Let's now implement the skip-gram algorithm using TensorFlow library.

## Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) Algorithm
Continuous bag-of-words algorithm is another variant of word embedding learning that uses the surrounding context of a center word to predict the center word itself. It learns to predict the center word based on both the surrounding words and itself. Similar to skip-gram, it uses a window of size m to predict the center word based on the surrounding words. The mathematical equation for calculating the cost function is same as before except for the modified formulation since we need to predict the center word instead of a neighbor word.


Similarly, the inputs to the model include a one-hot encoded vector representing the center word followed by the one-hot encodings of the surrounding words. The outputs pass through multiple hidden layers, which receive input from the previous layers and produce a final prediction for the center word. The weights of the network are updated using stochastic gradient descent optimization. Again, we want the network to predict the correct center word given the context.
