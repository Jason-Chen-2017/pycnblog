Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses the kernel trick to transform input features into a higher dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. The goal is to find a hyperplane in this new feature space such that its distance from the data points is minimized while also ensuring a margin around these data points. These margins are controlled by tuning the tradeoff between them and the misclassification errors caused by using an SVM with a large value of C. 

SVMs have been widely used for regression tasks because they can be used as a powerful tool for predicting continuous outcomes when there are only a few input features available. They achieve this accuracy through their ability to fit non-linear decision boundaries and minimize overfitting by avoiding complex models with high degrees of freedom. However, despite being effective at modeling relationships between variables, they are not always suitable for prediction tasks that require a more precise mapping of inputs to outputs.

In recent years, support vector machines have gained popularity due to their versatility and effectiveness in handling complex datasets. One particular method called the radial basis function (RBF) kernel has proven particularly useful in many applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and time series analysis. Despite these benefits, applying RBF kernels to regression problems remains challenging. 

In this article, we will explore how to implement support vector regression (SVR) in Python using scikit-learn library. We'll discuss various aspects related to SVR, including how to choose an appropriate kernel function, which parameters to tune, and what kind of performance metrics to use to evaluate our model's accuracy. At the end of the tutorial, you'll gain a deeper understanding of SVR and its application in industry and research areas.  

This tutorial assumes readers have some familiarity with machine learning concepts like regression and classification, but does not assume advanced knowledge in any specific programming language or software framework. All code examples will be written in Python and made use of popular open source libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

# 2.关键术语
Before diving deep into implementing SVR, let’s briefly introduce some key terms and concepts:

1. Supervised Learning: This refers to the task of training a machine learning model on labeled data, i.e., a dataset consisting of both input features and output values.
2. Input Features: These are the independent variables used to predict the outcome variable. For example, if we want to predict the price of a house based on the size and number of rooms, then the input features would be “size” and “number of rooms”. 
3. Output Variable: This is the dependent variable that needs to be predicted. For example, if we want to predict the price of a house based on the size and number of rooms, then the output variable would be “price”.  
4. Linear Regression: This is a simple type of supervised learning algorithm that tries to establish a linear relationship between input features and output variable. It works best when the relationship between the two is approximately linear. In contrast, SVR algorithms work better when the relationship between the two is non-linear, making them ideal for applications requiring more precision in predictions.   
5. Kernel Functions: When SVMs are applied to non-linear problems, we need to use kernel functions instead of traditional linear combinations of the input features. Common kernel functions include polynomial, Gaussian, and sigmoid functions, among others. Each of these functions converts the original input features into a higher-dimensional space where they become linearly separable.  
6. Hyperparameters: These are adjustable parameters used during training phase of an ML model that affect the performance of the final model. Some common hyperparameters for SVM include the choice of kernel function, regularization parameter, tolerance level, etc. Tuning these parameters requires careful experimentation and cross validation techniques to ensure that the resulting model performs well under different conditions.  
7. Cross Validation: This technique involves splitting the entire dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset and testing its accuracy on another subset. We repeat this process for each possible split of the dataset and calculate average error across all splits to estimate the generalization error of the trained model.  
8. Decision Boundary: This is the boundary that separates the positive and negative classes. In case of binary classification problems, the decision boundary is simply a straight line. However, in the case of multiclass classification, the decision boundary is more complicated and depends on the configuration of the classes.  
9. Margin: This is the minimum acceptable separation between the decision boundary and the closest data points. Ideally, we should try to maintain a small margin around the data points so that the model doesn't make unnecessary errors. If the margin is too small, the model may start to overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization performance. On the other hand, if the margin is too large, the model won't capture all the complexity present in the data and may lead to poor generalization performance even though it achieves good performance on the training set.  

# 3.算法原理和具体操作步骤
Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses the kernel trick to transform input features into a higher dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. The goal is to find a hyperplane in this new feature space such that its distance from the data points is minimized while also ensuring a margin around these data points. These margins are controlled by tuning the tradeoff between them and the misclassification errors caused by using an SVM with a large value of C. 

The basic idea behind SVR is similar to traditional SVMs, except that instead of using hard margins to separate data points, SVR finds a hypersurface that fits the data points accurately without getting "trapped" inside the inner region of the margin. This allows SVR to handle outliers, noise, and non-convex data sets that are typically encountered in real world applications.

To create a SVR model, we first need to specify the kernel function to be used, along with certain hyperparameters such as gamma, C, epsilon, etc. The choice of the kernel function plays a significant role in determining the results obtained by the SVR model. There are several commonly used kernel functions such as polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.

For polynomial kernel, the formula for calculating the similarity score between two observations xi and xj is given by:

k(xi,xj)= (gamma <x,y> + coef0)^degree

where gamma is a free parameter that controls the width of the kernel; coef0 is a bias term added to the result of the dot product; degree is the degree of the polynomial.

For RBF kernel, the formula for calculating the similarity score between two observations xi and xj is given by:

k(xi,xj)= exp(-gamma|xi-xj|^2 )

where gamma is a free parameter that controls the scale of the kernel.

For sigmoid kernel, the formula for calculating the similarity score between two observations xi and xj is given by:

k(xi,xj)= tanh(gamma<x,y>+coef0)

where gamma is a free parameter that controls the range of the curve, and coef0 is a bias term added to the result of the dot product.

Once we have chosen the kernel function, we need to select appropriate values for the hyperparameters gamma, C, epsilon, etc. The optimal values for these hyperparameters depend on the nature of the problem and must be determined using techniques such as grid search, randomized search, or cross validation.

Next, we train the SVR model using the training data and selected hyperparameters. During training, we compute the similarity scores between every pair of training samples and project them onto the hyperplane defined by the solution vectors w and b found during optimization. We then apply the loss function (i.e., mean squared error or huber loss) to measure the difference between the predicted values and true target values. Based on the value of the loss function, we update the weights w and intercept b until convergence is achieved. Finally, we test the SVR model using the testing data and evaluate its performance using various performance metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, r-squared coefficient of determination, adjusted r-squared, and others.

Let’s now take a closer look at the implementation steps involved in creating an SVR model using Python and scikit-learn library:


Step 1: Import Required Libraries 
We begin by importing necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn.


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.svm import SVR

Step 2: Load Data Set
Next, we load the required dataset into the program. The dataset consists of three columns - ‘Feature1’, 'Feature2', and 'Target' respectively representing the input features, 'Price' representing the output variable. Here, we're going to use the Boston Housing Prices dataset provided by sklearn.datasets module. 


from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
boston = load_boston()
X = boston['data']
y = boston['target']

Step 3: Splitting Dataset into Training and Testing Sets
After loading the dataset, we need to divide it into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance after training.


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Step 4: Choosing Appropriate Kernel Function and Hyperparameters
Based on the dataset characteristics, we need to select an appropriate kernel function and optimize the hyperparameters gamma, C, epsilon, etc. Once we have done that, we initialize the SVR object with the selected kernel function, hyperparameters, and other relevant options.


kernel = 'rbf'  # Selecting RBF kernel function
C = 1         # Setting Regularization Parameter C to 1
gamma = 0.1   # Setting Gamma to 0.1
epsilon = 0.1 # Setting Epsilon Value to 0.1

svr_model = SVR(kernel=kernel, C=C, gamma=gamma, epsilon=epsilon)

Step 5: Fitting Model on Train Set
Finally, once we have initialized the SVR model, we fit it on the training set using the.fit() method. We pass the training set inputs X_train and corresponding targets y_train to the.fit() method to train the model. After training, we obtain the estimated target values using the.predict() method.


svr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = svr_model.predict(X_test)

Step 6: Evaluating Performance Metrics
Now, we need to evaluate the performance of the SVR model using various performance metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, r-squared coefficient of determination, adjusted r-squared, and others. We can use built-in scikit-learn methods to perform this evaluation.


print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))
print('R-Squared Coefficient Of Determination:', metrics.r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
print('Adjusted R-Squared:', 1 - ((1-metrics.r2_score(y_test, y_pred))*(len(y_test)-1)/(len(y_test)-X_test.shape[1]-1)))

Thus, we have implemented support vector regression using Python and scikit-learn library successfully!
