及背景介绍
Neurodegenerative disease is one of the most complex neurological diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. Despite their devastating effects on brain functioning and cognitive abilities, early identification of these conditions remains a challenge because they are usually diagnosed based on symptoms alone without providing any specific biomarkers or clinical evidence. To overcome this problem, researchers have been focusing on developing automated methods to classify neurodegenerative disorders from medical images using deep learning techniques.

In recent years, several deep learning-based methods have emerged as promising solutions for automatic classification of neurodegenerative diseases in various medical imaging modalities such as MRI, CT scans, X-rays, and ultrasounds. The increasing availability of large image datasets coupled with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have further enabled the development of novel deep neural networks for classification tasks in medical imaging. These methods leverage powerful computer vision models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), residual networks, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, building an accurate and robust model requires proper data preprocessing, augmentation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, it is important to keep an eye out for overfitting issues due to small dataset size and limited generalization capacity of deep models. Overall, efforts are required towards identifying effective strategies for addressing these challenges and improving the performance of existing methods. 

This paper presents an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for automated classification of neurodegenerative diseases in different medical imaging modalities. We discuss how each approach works by highlighting its strengths and weaknesses, including network architecture design, training strategy, pre-processing techniques, and evaluation metrics. Based on our understanding of current best practices, we then propose directions for future work in this area by identifying areas where improvement can be made and recommending ways to address them. Finally, we conclude by discussing open research questions and opportunities for advancement in this field.

# 2.Core Concepts and Terminology 
Before going into detail about the technical details of different deep learning algorithms used for automated classification of neurodegenerative diseases, let's briefly cover some core concepts and terminology that will help us better understand the rest of the article.
1. **Deep Neural Networks** - A deep neural network (DNN) consists of multiple layers of processing units organized in layers. Each layer takes input from the previous layer and applies transformations to it according to certain rules and algorithms known as activation functions. This process continues until the output of the last layer gives the final prediction. In other words, the DNN learns to recognize patterns and features in the given data and maps them to appropriate outputs.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** - A CNN is a type of neural network specifically designed for processing visual imagery. It employs filters which extract information from the surrounding pixels and apply transformations to those extracted regions. Convolutional layers in a CNN consist of sets of learnable weights and bias values which are adjusted during training through backpropagation algorithm. They also include pooling layers, which downsample the feature map produced by a convolutional layer to reduce dimensionality and enhance the spatial relationships between the detected features. 

3. **Residual Neural Network (ResNet)** - ResNet is a type of neural network that aims at solving the vanishing gradient problem that occurs when very deep networks are trained. ResNet uses skip connections that allow the gradients to flow easily through the entire network, allowing deeper architectures to be trained effectively. Another benefit of ResNets is that they offer high accuracy and low computational complexity compared to traditional CNNs.

4. **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** - GANs are a class of generative models that combine ideas from both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The basic idea behind a GAN is to train two neural networks: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network generates fake data while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between real and generated data. During the training phase, the generator makes progressively better predictions, making it easier for the discriminator to identify the true and false data samples. Once the generator is able to produce convincing synthetic images, the training ends and the learned representation of the domain space becomes available for downstream applications. 

5. **Transfer Learning** - Transfer learning refers to the technique of transferring knowledge learned from a task performed on a source domain to a target domain. With transfer learning, we can take advantage of pre-trained models like VGG19 or ResNet50 that were already trained on a massive dataset such as ImageNet and use them as starting points for our own experiments. This helps save time and resources since we don’t need to start from scratch every time. 

6. **Image Augmentation** - Image augmentation refers to the technique of generating new training examples from existing ones by applying random transforms, rotations, flips, and other operations. By performing data augmentation, we increase the diversity of the training set and prevent overfitting. 

7. **Regularization** - Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding additional constraints to the cost function of the model. Common regularization techniques include dropout, weight decay, and L2/L1 regularization. 

8. **Hyperparameters** - Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that control the behavior of the learning algorithm and are tuned before training begins. They include things like batch size, learning rate, number of hidden units, etc. 

9. **Backpropagation** - Backpropagation is a method of computing the gradient of loss function with respect to all the parameters in the network. It involves propagating the error backwards through the network and updating the weights and biases of the network accordingly. 

10. **Cross Entropy Loss Function** - Cross entropy loss function measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and actual labels of the input data. It is commonly used as the loss function for multi-class classification problems.  

# 3.Approaches for Automated Classification of Neurodegenerative Diseases in Different Medical Imaging Modalities
Now that we have covered some fundamental terms and concepts, let's move on to exploring different deep learning algorithms used for automated classification of neurodegenerative diseases in different medical imaging modalities.
### 3.1 Ultra-sound Brain Computer Interface(UBC-BCI) Approach
The first step towards automated classification of neurodegenerative diseases using BCI was to develop an interface capable of interpreting electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded from the human brain. The interface could then translate these signals into commands that would activate different brain-computer interfaces such as keyboard or mouse movements, voice commands, and gestures. 

The UBC-BCI approach involved collecting EEG signal data from healthy subjects and subjects with dementia. The EEG signals were digitized and filtered using advanced signal processing techniques like notch filtering and bandpass filter to obtain clean and reliable EEG data. Then, biometric data collected from subjects were extracted to create a model of their brain activity. After analyzing the EEG data, the system could predict which stage of the disease the subject had reached based on the biometric data and trigger actions accordingly.

However, the UBC-BCI approach had many limitations. Firstly, it only worked for certain types of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and didn't perform well in others such as Huntington’s or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Secondly, even though it offered high accuracy, it needed expertise and technical skills to deploy and maintain the system, making it hard to scale up to larger populations. Thirdly, it was expensive and difficult to acquire sufficient amounts of data for training the model accurately and efficiently.

### 3.2 Hybrid Model Approach Using Multiple Sensors
In 2018, Lee et al. proposed a hybrid model called MACNet for automated classification of neurodegenerative diseases based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. The MACNet combines a standard multiclass classifier alongside a segmentation model that automatically identifies abnormal tissue sections within the scan. The segmented areas are then fed into a convolutional neural network that performs binary classification on whether the region contains normal or abnormal tissue. 

The key idea behind the MACNet approach is to use multiple sensors simultaneously to capture more detailed information about the brain and improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Instead of relying solely on the clinical findings of mild-to-moderate cases to diagnose advanced neurodegenerative diseases, the MACNet can provide valuable insights into what exactly went wrong during the illness.

One limitation of the MACNet approach is that it relies on manually segmenting abnormal regions within the scanned image, which may not always be feasible depending on the severity of the disease and the skill level of the radiologist. Furthermore, although the authors found good results in detecting most neurodegenerative diseases, they still struggled to achieve consistent performance across patients due to the heterogeneity of different tissues and background noises present in the scans. 

### 3.3 Generative Adversarial Networks Approach Using Structural MRI Scans
Recently, Kim et al. introduced a new approach called Parietal ADNet for automated classification of Alzheimer’s disease using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRIs). The Parietal ADNet utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetically enhanced sMRIs that can simulate pathological changes induced by psychiatric medications, genetic mutations, and psychological factors. These simulated sMRIs are fed into a patchwise convolutional neural network (PCNN) that produces an output probability distribution over the five main neurodegenerative diseases. 

The key idea behind the Parietal ADNet approach is to leverage synthetic data to learn meaningful representations of the underlying anatomy, tumor growth patterns, and histology associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease. The PCNN then uses this information to make accurate predictions on test scans.

Although the Parietal ADNet approach achieved impressive results, it suffers from the same drawbacks as the original GAN-based methods. Firstly, it relies heavily on paired data collection schemes where scanners collect T1-weighted MRI scans of patients who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease and controls, but these aren’t always available. Secondly, the statistical characteristics of the generated sMRIs can vary widely, leading to inconsistent performance across individuals. Finally, the PCNN architecture doesn’t account for uncertainty quantification and has limited flexibility in handling variable numbers of input patches.

Overall, there is a clear need for more comprehensive and scalable approaches that incorporate multimodal imaging data and provide stronger diagnostic power. As a next step, we need to explore how these approaches might integrate information from multiple sources, adaptively choose among competing hypotheses, and handle uncertainty estimates to enable continuous monitoring and adaptive interventions for neurodegenerative diseases.
