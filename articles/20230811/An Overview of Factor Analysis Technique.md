Factor analysis (FA) is a statistical technique for analyzing complex datasets with several variables. The goal of FA is to identify underlying patterns and structure in the dataset that can be used to explain its variation. FAs are widely applied in various fields such as psychology, marketing, finance, biology, and social sciences. The main advantage of using FA over other techniques is their ability to handle high-dimensional data sets while maintaining interpretability and easy-to-interpret results. This article will provide an overview of factor analysis and its basic concepts and terms. We will then explore the factors interpretation process by looking at a simple example. Finally, we'll review the limitations of factor analysis and potential future directions. 

## 1. Background Introduction: What is factor analysis? 
Factor analysis (FA), also known as principal component analysis (PCA), is a statistical method used to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets. It takes into account the interrelation between multiple variables within the same dataset and identifies underlying groups or factors. In simpler words, it helps you understand what influences your observations and outcomes better than just considering each variable independently. 

The basic idea behind FA is to find a set of uncorrelated variables that explains most of the variance present in the original dataset. These new variables are called "factors". By projecting the data onto these factors, we can obtain new views of the data where correlations among variables have been reduced. Thus, they offer insights about which variables are important in explaining certain aspects of the data, rather than being blind to individual effects. Moreover, they make it easier to compare different subsets of the data based on shared factors, making them ideal for exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing. 

In addition to identifying factors, FA also provides information about how much variation is explained by each one. The eigenvalues associated with each factor indicate how much variance in the data is captured by that factor alone; thus, choosing the number of factors that capture enough variance can help us determine the level of redundancy in our data.


FA has become increasingly popular over the last decade due to its effectiveness in dealing with high-dimensional data sets, ease of use, and widespread application across various disciplines. However, there are still some challenges associated with this technique, including the difficulty of inferring causal relationships between the independent variables and dependent ones, and concerns about collinearity and stability in low sample sizes. Nevertheless, FA remains a powerful tool for understanding complex data and extracting valuable insights. 
 
## 2. Basic Concepts and Terms 
Before we proceed further with the explanation of the core algorithm and steps involved, let's first briefly go through some fundamental concepts and terms related to FA. 

### 2.1 Components: How do we represent the variables in FA?  
First, let's consider the following two-dimensional dataset:

| Variable A | Variable B | Dependent Variable C |
|------------|------------|----------------------|
| x          | y          | z                    |
| 1           | 4          | 9                   |
| 2           | 3          | 10                  |
|...        |...        |...                 |
| n           | m          | p                   |

To analyze this data, we need to transform it into a matrix form. Each row represents a case and contains values of all three variables - X, Y, and Z. Let's call this matrix $X$. Now, if we want to perform PCA on this matrix, we need to transform it into another matrix $P$, such that $X \approx P \times V$ where $\times$ denotes matrix multiplication, $V$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvectors of covariance matrix $XX^T$. Hence, $Z = XP$ gives us a linear combination of $X$'s columns, along with coefficients proportional to their corresponding eigenvectors. 

Thus, we can interpret the rows of $P$ as the components of $X$, obtained after performing dimensionality reduction. If we only keep the top K components, we get a compressed version of $X$, representing the major sources of variability in the data. 

### 2.2 Covariance Matrix: How does FA calculate the relationship between the variables?   
To compute the correlation between the variables, we use the concept of covariance. Given two random variables $x_i$ and $y_j$, the covariance between them is defined as follows:  

$$cov(x_i, y_j) = E[(x_i-\mu_x)(y_j-\mu_y)] = \sum_{k=1}^n (x_ik - \mu_x)(y_jk - \mu_y) $$

where $\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$ are the mean values of $x_i$ and $y_j$, respectively. Here, $(x_ik - \mu_x)$ means $x_i$-th element of column k minus the mean value of $x_i$. The covariance matrix $C$ captures the pairwise covariances between all pairs of variables. For any given subset of variables, the covariance matrix $C_{ij}$ measures the degree of joint dependency between $X_i$ and $X_j$.

### 2.3 Eigendecomposition: How does FA find the factors?  
Once we know the covariance matrix $C$, we can apply the eigendecomposition method to obtain the factors $V$ and eigenvalues $\lambda$. The eigendecomposition of symmetric matrices allows us to write the covariance matrix as the product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues:

$$C = V\Lambda V^{-1}$$

Here, $V$ is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of $C$, ordered by their corresponding eigenvalues. The vector $\lambda$ consists of the square roots of the eigenvalues of $C$, sorted in descending order. The larger the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda_i$, the more important the i-th eigenvector $V_i$ becomes in determining the variation in the original data. 

The term $V^{-1}PV$ represents the reconstruction error of the data, giving us the amount of information lost during compression. Since the elements in $VP$ are equal to zero, the error can be expressed in terms of the proportion of variance lost:

$$Err(P) = \frac{1}{np}\sum_{i=1}^{p}(z_i-\hat{z}_i)^2=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(z_i-XP_i)^2$$

where $\hat{z}_i$ refers to the predicted values of $Z$ when $X_i$ was omitted from $P$. We minimize this error by selecting the right number of dimensions so that the overall loss of information is minimized. The objective function that determines this choice is known as the "explained variance" criterion:

$$VarExplained(\lambda)=\frac{\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\cdots}{\sum_{i=1}^m\lambda_i}$$

Here, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ refer to the largest and second largest eigenvalues, respectively, and $\sum_{i=1}^m\lambda_i$ is the total sum of all eigenvalues. We select the number of factors required to achieve a specific level of explained variance.

### 2.4 Correspondence Analysis: How does FA deal with categorical variables?    
One limitation of factor analysis is that it assumes that all variables are continuous. As mentioned earlier, fa deals well with highly multivariate data but not very suitable for mixed-type datasets such as those consisting of both numerical and categorical variables. To address this issue, we can use correspondence analysis (CA). CA involves creating a latent class model that accounts for the similarity and difference between categories. This approach involves treating categorical variables as a hierarchy of entities with commonalities and differences. One key assumption is that categories are exchangeable under the conditions imposed by the hierarchical structure. Once we have identified the commonalities and differences, we can create a set of latent variables capturing the similarities between categories. CA has many advantages compared to standard factor analysis methods such as its simplicity and scalability to large datasets. 

However, even though CA is effective in handling mixed type datasets, it cannot completely replace factor analysis in all cases. CA requires additional computational resources, especially for higher dimensional datasets. Additionally, the factors found by CA may differ depending on the chosen coding scheme. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to try out both approaches and choose the one that works best for a particular problem at hand. 


## 3. Core Algorithm and Steps  
Now, we're ready to dive deeper into the actual implementation details of FA. There are several algorithms available to implement FA, but the most commonly used one is SVD (singular value decomposition). We'll discuss this approach below. 

### 3.1 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
SVD is a generalization of the QR decomposition used in PCA. It applies to any rectangular matrix of rank r, where the columns contain the observed variables and the rows contain the observations. Its main idea is to factorize the matrix $A$ as the product of three matrices:

$$A = U \Sigma V^T$$

where $U$ and $V$ are unitary matrices, and $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix of singular values arranged in descending order. The columns of $U$ and $V$ are the left and right singular vectors, respectively, while the diagonals of $\Sigma$ are the corresponding singular values. Using this decomposition, we can rewrite any matrix $B$ as a weighted average of its left singular vectors multiplied by their corresponding singular values. Therefore, we can transform any observation vector $b$ as follows:

$$b^\prime = \Sigma v_i u_i^Tb$$

where $u_i$ is the i-th left singular vector of $A$ and $v_i$ is the corresponding right singular vector. In this way, we can compress the original observation vectors into smaller spaces while preserving most of the information contained in the original matrix. Furthermore, the singular values $\sigma_i$ give us information about the importance of each observation vector. Specifically, small singular values $\sigma_i<1$ indicate that the corresponding observation vector contributes little to the overall representation of the data, while large singular values $\sigma_i>1$ indicate that the observation vector plays a dominant role in describing the variations in the data. 

### 3.2 Proposed Methodology and Operations     
1. Data Preprocessing: In order to utilize the benefits of SVD, we must preprocess the input data before applying the algorithm. This includes removing missing values, scaling numeric features, and encoding categorical features.

2. Data Transformation: After preprocessing, we transform the raw data into the appropriate format needed for the algorithm. For instance, we might convert the data into a matrix form using a pivot table or group by aggregation functions. 

3. Calculate the Covariance Matrix: We calculate the covariance matrix using either the traditional formula or alternatively, use a kernel function to generate a similarity matrix. Both methods work equally well.

4. Perform the Eigendecomposition: We then perform the eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix to obtain the left and right singular vectors and their corresponding singular values. We sort the resulting eigenpairs according to their corresponding singular values in descending order.

5. Select the Number of Factors Required: We choose the number of factors required to capture enough variance in the data. We typically start with the minimum possible number of factors, followed by adding more factors until we reach the desired level of explained variance. 

6. Project the Data onto the Factors: Finally, we project the transformed data onto the selected factors to obtain the final result. We repeat the above steps iteratively until convergence or maximum iterations reached.
