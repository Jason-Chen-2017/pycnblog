Quantum computing has become one of the most exciting technologies in recent years with a wide range of applications including finance, medicine, security and energy efficiency. In this article, we will explore the basics of quantum computing and provide a high-level overview to developers who are interested in getting started with this new technology. We'll begin by introducing the basic concepts behind quantum mechanics and then move on to explain how quantum computers work under the hood and why they're so powerful. Finally, we'll cover some practical aspects of using quantum algorithms and programming languages like Qiskit and Pennylane which make quantum computation accessible to everyone.

## Introduction
As mentioned earlier, quantum computing is rapidly becoming more popular every year with multiple industries including finance, healthcare, education, government, robotics, transportation, energy efficiency, and many others. With the development of quantum computer technology, quantum information processing techniques have been revolutionized as the computational power of modern computers cannot process all possible inputs in finite time. However, while quantum computing provides tremendous advantages over traditional classical computing, it can be daunting for even experts to understand the technical details required to apply these techniques effectively. This article aims at providing an intuitive understanding of quantum computing without being too mathematical or technological.

## Basic Concepts
Before diving into the details of quantum computing, let's first understand some of the fundamental ideas that make up the field. 

### Quantum Mechanics
In general, quantum mechanics refers to the study of matter and its interactions with electromagnetic radiation. The basic concept underlying quantum mechanics states that everything around us exists in a continuous, constant state of matter, but through interaction with external factors such as light, heat, or sound, the system becomes entangled into different subatomic particles. These particles behave in ways that violate their laws of physics because they share properties of both matter and energy. A key property of quantum mechanics is the concept of measurement, whereby the probabilities of observing specific outcomes (e.g., spin values) depend on the initial conditions of the system. By performing experiments that control the initial conditions of the system, physicists can gain insight into the behavior of quantum systems.

One example of a physical phenomenon that involves quantum effects is light. Light itself is composed of wave interference patterns caused by quantum interference between electrons, protons, and neutrons. When light rays encounter each other due to quantum effects, they form collective phenomena called photons, which carry quantum information about the objects involved. This allows researchers to use quantum computers to manipulate digital data faster than current classical computers. Additionally, quantum computing relies heavily on quantum effects to perform operations that would take exponential amounts of time otherwise.

### Quantum Computation
The term "quantum" describes a whole family of concepts, including the above-mentioned quantum mechanics and atomic physics. While quantum mechanics defines quantum states as consisting of quantum particles, quantum computation uses them to solve problems that require efficient calculations and manipulations of large datasets. Quantum computation enables machines to simulate quantum systems accurately enough to analyze complex problems such as molecular dynamics simulations, weather forecasting, and computational chemistry. Although there are many advantages to quantum computing, it also comes with challenges. As quantum computers are still in their infancy, the technology has not yet reached full scale production. Furthermore, developing quantum software and hardware is costly, complex, and requires specialized skills.

To start working with quantum computations, you need to install special software packages known as compilers and APIs. There are several open source libraries available such as Qiskit and Pennylane, which allow developers to create quantum programs in Python or Julia. They offer easy-to-use tools to implement quantum circuits and access various quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm, Grover's search algorithm, and linear algebra routines. To learn more about how to use these libraries, check out our tutorials on Qiskit and Pennylane.

### Entanglement and Superposition
Superposition refers to the fact that two or more quantum systems may behave differently after interacting due to correlations between their individual parts. For instance, if you prepare two independent qubits in a superposition, i.e., half in a basis state |0⟩ and half in a basis state |1⟩, the probability of measuring either outcome could be any value between zero and one. One consequence of this is that the same input applied to two separate quantum systems may give different results even though they should act identically. Another effect of superposition is that when measuring one of the qubits, the other remains in superposition. This property makes quantum computers very versatile since they can handle correlated inputs and produce outputs that are difficult to reproduce experimentally.

Entanglement refers to the correlation of two or more qubits that occur when they interact non-locally. In contrast to ordinary correlation, entanglement occurs spatially separated from one another, which means that the probability of measuring a particular outcome depends not only on the state of one of the qubits but also on the state of the others. Examples of entangled pairs include photons in a light beam, electrons orbiting a nucleus, and atoms bound together by chemical bonds. While entanglement facilitates communication between quantum bits, it can also lead to decoherence when used incorrectly or improperly, which can seriously impact quantum computing performance.

Overall, quantum mechanics and quantum computation combine to enable new possibilities in computation and eventually reshape the way humans think and perceive reality. Despite the potential risks and limitations of this technology, it promises to unlock entirely new forms of knowledge and technology.
