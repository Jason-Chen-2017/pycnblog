## 概要概述
Logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification that uses logistic function as its activation function. It can be used to model the probability of a certain event occurring given some input variables. In this article, we will learn about how logistic regression works and implement it using Python programming language. We will also discuss various concepts in logistic regression like regularization, overfitting, feature scaling, etc., and their effect on performance. 

Logistic regression is widely used in many fields such as healthcare, marketing, social media analysis, finance, and many more. This article aims to provide an understanding of logistic regression, help developers understand how it works and make improvements based on their specific requirements, while being practical enough for beginners who are just starting out.

## 什么是Logistic回归（Logistic Regression）？
Logistic regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used to categorize or label data into two classes (binary classification) or more than two categories (multinomial classification). The goal of logistic regression is to find a relationship between one dependent variable (outcome) and multiple independent variables (input features) that yields good predictions within each class. Mathematically speaking, logistic regression represents a probabilistic model that maps input variables to probabilities of belonging to a particular category. These probabilities are then mapped back to the original scale using the logistic function. 

The logistic function takes values between 0 and 1, which means that they represent the likelihood of an event happening. As a result, it's often used in binary classification problems, where there are only two possible outcomes (e.g., true or false), but it can also be extended to multi-class classification by assigning probabilities to different classes.

Here's what logistic regression looks like visually:


In the diagram above, we see the logistic curve, which shows us the probability of a certain outcome depending on our input variables. Each point corresponds to an observation, which has been assigned either a value of 0 or 1 according to whether the probability predicted by the logistic regression model exceeds 0.5. If the probability is greater than 0.5, we classify the observation as "1", otherwise, we classify it as "0". 

We can use logistic regression for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam filtering, and diagnosis of disease. For example, if we want to build a spam filter application, we could use logistic regression to analyze emails and assign them a score indicating whether they're likely to be spam or not. Similarly, if we want to diagnose diseases in patients, we might train a logistic regression model on a dataset containing patient symptoms and demographics and try to identify patterns that correlate with certain conditions.
