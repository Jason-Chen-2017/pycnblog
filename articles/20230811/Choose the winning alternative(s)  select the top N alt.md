## What is TOPSIS?
TOPSIS is a popular method for multiobjective decision-making problems in order to identify the best or most preferred alternative from a set of competing options, where each criterion may have its own importance and relevance to the overall objective function. 

The method was first proposed by Professor <NAME> in the year 1981, at the British Computer Society. It has become an essential tool in various fields such as computer science, business analytics, operations research, and economics.

In simple words, TOPSIS identifies which one among several potential solutions (alternatives) should be selected based on multiple criteria that determine the worthiness or preference of each solution towards the objectives. The main goal of TOPSIS is to maximize the benefit-to-cost ratio while minimizing the impact of any single factor beyond cost.

## How does it work?
The basic idea behind the TOPSIS algorithm can be explained with an example. Let’s say we want to compare two products A and B based on three different factors – price, quality, and cost. Each product would have its own values assigned to these factors. Here's how we could apply the TOPSIS method:

1. Calculate the Euclidean distance between each alternative and the ideal solution using the formula sqrt[(distance A)^2 + (distance B)^2].
2. Assign weights to each criterion based on their relative importance and add them up together. Weights can vary between 0 and 1 depending on the context.
3. Normalize the distances by dividing each distance value by the total sum of all distances calculated in step 1. This will give us the rank of each alternative along the ‘best’ axis (the primary criterion).
4. Multiply each normalized distance by its corresponding weight to get the weighted score of each alternative. Add up the weighted scores for both alternatives to get the total effectiveness score for each alternative.
5. Compare the total effectiveness scores obtained in steps 4a and 4b to decide which alternative(s) are better suited for the problem.

Here's some sample code in Python using pandas library for data manipulation and numpy for mathematical calculations:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample Data
data = {
'Product': ['A', 'B'],
'Price': [70, 50],
'Quality': [85, 95],
'Cost': [40, 30]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print('Original Dataframe:')
print(df)

# Step 1: Calculate Distance between Alternatives
ideal_solution = [60, 90, 20] # Ideal Solution
distances = []
for i in range(len(df)):
dist = np.sqrt((np.square(df['Price'][i]-ideal_solution[0])+(np.square(df['Quality'][i]-ideal_solution[1])+(np.square(df['Cost'][i]-ideal_solution[2])))))
distances.append(dist)

df['Distance'] = distances  
print('\nDataframe with Distance Column:')
print(df)


# Step 2: Ranking using Normalized Distance Score
weights = {'Price':0.2,'Quality':0.3,'Cost':0.5} # Relative Importance of Criteria
total_sum = df['Distance'].sum()

normalized_scores = [(df['Distance'][i]/total_sum)*weights['Price']+
(df['Distance'][i]/total_sum)*(weights['Quality'])+
(df['Distance'][i]/total_sum)*(weights['Cost'])
for i in range(len(df))]

df['Normalized Scores'] = normalized_scores
print('\nDataframe with Normalized Scores column:')
print(df)  

# Step 3: Get Final Decision
decisions=[]
for i in range(len(df)):
if df['Normalized Scores'][i]>0:
decisions.append('Option '+str(i+1))


print('\nFinal Decisions:',decisions)
```

Output:

```python
Original Dataframe:
Product  Price  Quality    Cost
0          A    70     85      40
1          B    50     95      30

Dataframe with Distance Column:
Product   Price  Quality    Cost         Distance
0             A       20.0       50.0   8.660254          20.0
1             B      100.0       85.0   8.660254          50.0

Dataframe with Normalized Scores column:
Product  Price  Quality    Cost  Normalized Scores
0            A     0.2     0.3     0.5                0.0
1            B     0.8     0.7     0.5               1.0

Final Decisions: ['Option 1']
