及问题引入
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability in many developing countries around the world. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in continuous monitoring strategies that provide early detection of cardiovascular diseases. Among these strategies, we can find traditional methods such as physical examination or x-ray imaging to evaluate health status of patients at regular intervals, followed by tests like ECG and thoracic CT scan to check for disease progression. However, traditional methods are time-consuming, expensive, and limited in their ability to detect changes over time within a patient's clinical course. On the other hand, deep learning algorithms have shown great promise towards addressing this problem. The goal of this research project is to develop an automated system for predicting the risk factors for heart failure (HF) among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We propose a novel approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which learns from medical images collected during cardiac surgeries to accurately predict HF mortality and identify key features that contribute to high HF mortality. This approach will enable continuous monitoring strategies to more quickly and effectively diagnose HF among patients with minimal intervention.
In this article, we present our proposed approach and discuss its advantages and limitations. Specifically, we first summarize the literature on evaluation of cardiac surgical outcomes based on traditional and deep learning techniques. We then describe the architecture of our proposed CNN model and how it is trained and validated on real-world data. Finally, we test our model on previously unseen data and report the results, providing insights into the effectiveness and feasibility of our methodology.
# 2.相关术语定义
Here are some relevant terminologies and definitions:

- **Preoperative Care**: includes all preparations, evaluations, and treatments performed before any surgery. It involves gathering information about the patient’s condition, including history of previous heart attacks and stroke, family history, medication use, current medications, mental health conditions, etc. Preoperative care may include visiting the patient(s) throughout the day and/or week, making referrals to specialists, and following up for follow-up visits.
- **Patient Safety**: refers to safeguarding individual rights and responsibilities in the event of injury or illness. It ensures that each person involved in the procedure meets established protocols and takes reasonable measures to protect themselves and others. Patient safety requirements are typically set out in Healthcare Organizations' Continuity of Operations Manuals (CMOMs). CMOMs cover topics ranging from the handling of personal protective equipment to standards for temperature control, safety procedures, and hospital quality management practices.
- **Clinical Trials**: trials involving voluntary participants who seek to establish whether a new treatment or procedure reduces or prevents certain diseases or symptoms. Traditionally, clinical trials focused on small scale pilot studies, but recently increasing numbers of large scale multicentre clinical trials are being conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of various therapies and devices.
- **Mortality Rate**: the rate at which patients die due to complications related to their cardiovascular systems after receiving cardiac surgery. Mortality rates vary widely depending on several factors such as age, gender, region, type of surgery, and comorbidities. As of March 2019, US hospital mortality rates were averaging 10% per year - higher than most developed nations. Over the next decade, this trend is expected to continue as the burden of disease continues to increase globally.
- **Heart Failure**: is a common, chronic, and life-threatening disease caused by excessive coagulation of blood vessels in the heart. The term "heart failure" is used synonymously with both acute coronary artery disease (ACAD) and recurrent myocardial infarction (RMI). Despite its widespread prevalence, no cure has yet been found, although doctors often recommend lifestyle modifications and exercise to reduce the risk of heart failure.
# 3.核心算法原理
The core algorithm behind our proposed approach is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are deep learning models inspired by the structure and function of the visual cortex of the brain. They learn complex patterns in the input data by processing them through multiple layers of convolution and pooling operations. Our network consists of two main components:

1. Feature Extraction Layer: Consists of three convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions, each followed by max-pooling operation. These layers extract features from the medical image, such as edges, curves, and shapes. 

2. Classification Layer: Consists of two fully connected layers with dropout regularization and softmax activation function. These layers classify the extracted features into different categories such as normal heart (NC), atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular fibrillation (VF), or hypertensive crisis (HC). 

Our final prediction probability vector would be fed into a threshold function to determine the predicted outcome. If the probability exceeds a predefined threshold value, the patient is classified as having high HF mortality. Otherwise, the patient is classified as NC, AF, VF, or HC based on the highest predicted probability category.

To train and validate our model, we use a combination of binary cross entropy loss and Adam optimizer. We split the dataset into training and validation sets using a 80:20 ratio. During training, we also monitor the accuracy and loss metrics to ensure that the model is not overfitting or underfitting the data. To avoid class imbalance issues, we employ several techniques such as weight balancing, class weighting, and class-dependent sampling during training.
# 4.具体代码实例及功能实现
The implementation of our proposed approach is available in Python programming language. Here is a sample code snippet showing how we can implement and run our model on medical image data stored in NumPy arrays:

``` python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def get_data():
# Load medical image data from disk and preprocess as needed

X =... # load pixel values as NumPy array
y =... # load labels as NumPy array

return X, y

def build_model():
# Define CNN architecture

inputs = keras.Input(shape=(img_rows, img_cols, num_channels))
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', activation='relu')(inputs)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D()(x)
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', activation='relu')(x)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D()(x)
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', activation='relu')(x)
x = keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
x = keras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu')(x)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(units=num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

return model


if __name__ == '__main__':
# Set hyperparameters and define constants

batch_size = 64
epochs = 100
verbose = 1

# Get and preprocess medical image data
X, y = get_data()

# Split dataset into training and validation sets
X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build and compile CNN model
model = build_model()
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# Train and validate model on training and validation sets
callbacks = [keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_accuracy', patience=10)]
history = model.fit(x=X_train, 
y=y_train, 
batch_size=batch_size,
epochs=epochs,
verbose=verbose,
validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),
callbacks=callbacks)
``` 

This script loads the medical image data stored in NumPy arrays and splits it into training and validation sets. Then, it defines and compiles our CNN model using Keras library. Afterwards, it trains and validates the model using the categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. At the end of the process, it saves the trained model weights and performance metrics in HDF5 format for later use.
