Donut charts or doughnut charts are one of the most commonly used data visualization techniques in modern business and technology industry. They provide a simple way to showcase large amounts of information and make it easy for users to analyze their data at a glance. As an alternative to traditional pie chart, donut charts have been gaining popularity because they provide more insight into the values behind each section of the chart. However, before we proceed further let’s understand the basic concepts associated with this type of charts. 

In today's world, various organizations are adopting digital technologies to manage complex processes and improve overall efficiency. The number of data points generated by these organizations is increasing day by day which makes them hard to interpret visually. To solve this problem, donut charts become popular due to its simplicity and easy-to-understand representation. In this article, we will learn about what are donut charts and how you can create your own using R programming language. We will also see different examples on how to use donut charts effectively to help you gain insights from your data. Finally, we'll discuss some common challenges that arise when working with donut charts such as overplotting, irregular shapes, labels overlap and legibility issues.

## A. What is a donut chart?  
A donut chart (also known as a hole donut chart) is a circular statistical graphic that displays numerical values in a pictographic form. It has two central sections and three inner sections arranged in a clockwise direction starting from the rightmost section (often referred to as “the center”). Each segment within the central area corresponds to a category while those within the outer ring correspond to subcategories. These categories may be things like total revenue, profit margin, etc., and the subcategories reflect individual segments of the corresponding category. The size of each segment indicates the relative contribution of that particular category or subcategory to the whole. While donut charts can provide valuable insights into certain aspects of a dataset, they should not be solely considered as the only tool for visualizing data. Other types of charts may prove more effective depending on the context of use and audience interest.    

## B. Common terms and abbreviations
* **Central Section**: This part of the chart shows the main purpose or significance of the graph, indicating the value of the overall metric being compared against other factors. Here, the radius represents the percentage of the entire circumference of the chart.
* **Outer Ring/Segments**: These are smaller rings that sit outside the central section and represent subcategories or subsets of the same category. They usually represent proportionate values of the overall category being compared against all the others. Outer rings range from zero to 100% in a counterclockwise direction. 
* **Labels**: Labels are placed inside the ring of the chart and describe the specific category being analyzed. You can change the font style, color, size, position, angle, alignment, and opacity of these labels using appropriate options available in most software packages.
* **Padding**: Padding refers to any additional space added around the edges of the chart. Depending upon the design requirements, adding padding improves the readability and appearance of the chart.

# 3.Algorithmic Principles and Specific Operation Steps
Here are the steps involved in creating a donut chart:
1. Determine the total amount of your data and divide it equally among the central circle and the sectors within the circle. 
2. Arrange the segments of the chart so that the largest segment is at the center of the circle and the smallest sector sits directly outside the center. 
3. Add annotations to identify the central segment and subcategories in relation to the overall metric. 
4. Adjust the width of the segments based on their importance and desired hierarchy of the chart.  

To ensure proper reading and interpretability of the chart, follow these guidelines:
* Use clear labeling and avoid confusion between similar metrics.
* Ensure that there are no overlapping labels or lines throughout the chart.
* Choose colors that contrast well with each other and maintain high contrast ratio between text and background elements. 
* Avoid very small slices that cause confusion and misrepresentation of the data. If needed, increase the diameter of the central slice or add a separate legend to explain the meaning of each sector. 


The following formula can be used to calculate the proportional sizes of the segments in a donut chart:   
*(value / sum_of_all_values)* * 360° * (radius^2)/((central_radius)^2 + (radius)^2)  

This formula calculates the length of the arc required to draw each segment of the chart. It takes into account the total value of the dataset, the value of the current segment, the central radius of the chart, and the radius of the outer ring/segment. 

For example, if our data set contains four segments with values 70%, 15%, 10%, and 5%, respectively, we can apply this formula to determine the size of each segment. Assuming we want to use a central radius of 90% and an outer radius of 60%, here's how we would do it: 

1. Total Value = 70 + 15 + 10 + 5 = 100

2. Central Radius = 0.9 * 90% = 81%

3. Outermost Ring Size = *(10/100)*360°*(60^2)/((0.9*90)^2+(60)^2)
= (10/(100))*360°*(60^2)/(81^2+60^2)
≈ 0.493 °

4. Segment Sizes:
* Revenue:
* Proportion = (70/100)
* Angle Required = ((Proportion)*(Total Value))/(sum_of_proportions)
= ((70/100)*(100))/((70/100)+(15/100)+(10/100)+5/100) 
≈ 0.493 ° 
* Arc Length = 0.493° * (Central Radius)^2 
= 0.493° * (0.81)^2
≈ 2.816 mm
* Expenses:
* Proportion = (15/100)
* Angle Required = ((Proportion)*(Total Value))/(sum_of_proportions)
= ((15/100)*(100))/((70/100)+(15/100)+(10/100)+5/100) 
≈ 0.118 ° 
* Arc Length = 0.118° * (Central Radius)^2 
= 0.118° * (0.81)^2
≈ 0.901 mm
* Operating Margin:
* Proportion = (10/100)
* Angle Required = ((Proportion)*(Total Value))/(sum_of_proportions)
= ((10/100)*(100))/((70/100)+(15/100)+(10/100)+5/100) 
≈ 0.059 ° 
* Arc Length = 0.059° * (Central Radius)^2 
= 0.059° * (0.81)^2
≈ 0.325 mm
* Taxes and Interest:
* Proportion = (5/100)
* Angle Required = ((Proportion)*(Total Value))/(sum_of_proportions)
= ((5/100)*(100))/((70/100)+(15/100)+(10/100)+5/100) 
≈ 0.020 ° 
* Arc Length = 0.020° * (Central Radius)^2 
= 0.020° * (0.81)^2
≈ 0.097 mm


Calculating the angles for each segment requires taking the inverse of the product of the proportion and the total value divided by the sum of all the proportions. For each segment, we multiply the calculated angle by the central radius squared to get the arc length.
