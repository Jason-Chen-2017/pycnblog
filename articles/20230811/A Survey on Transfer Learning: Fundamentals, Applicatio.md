## Transfer learning
Transfer learning, also known as domain adaptation or transfer feature learning, is a research problem in machine learning that involves transferring knowledge learned from one task to another task with a different target domain, but related source domain. In other words, it is a technique for training models on small labeled datasets to perform well on new, unseen data in the target domain without having to explicitly train the model on this specific dataset. Transfer learning has become increasingly popular in the past few years due to its ability to leverage large amounts of pre-trained neural network weights and models which have been shown to be useful for a wide range of computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification, etc. This article will provide an overview of transfer learning techniques and applications. Moreover, we will discuss various challenges associated with applying transfer learning in practice, including bias, generalization, catastrophic forgetting, and privacy concerns. Finally, we will present a detailed survey of existing transfer learning methods, their strengths, weaknesses, and potential use cases.

## Introduction
Deep learning (DL) is transforming many fields ranging from healthcare to finance and transportation. DL is enabling machines to learn complex patterns from large sets of data and achieve state-of-the-art performance in certain tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, language translation, and sentiment analysis. However, training DL models requires significant amounts of annotated data. As the amount of available data continues to grow exponentially, so does the demand for efficient ways to effectively utilize these resources. Transfer learning aims to address this challenge by using already trained models on a related but smaller scale to improve accuracy on new, unlabeled data. The goal is to reduce the cost of training models while achieving similar or better results than training them from scratch. Transfer learning is becoming increasingly relevant to real-world problems in areas such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and natural language processing where big data volumes and limited annotating resources are limiting progress. 

This paper surveys transfer learning techniques based on fundamental principles, highlights applications, and provides a benchmark comparison among several prominent methods alongside suggestions on future directions for improving transfer learning systems. By conducting a thorough literature review, this work intends to advance research in transfer learning and contribute towards building a stronger technical understanding and practical approach towards utilizing deep learning to solve real world problems.

# 2. Background introduction 
In this section, we will introduce the core concepts, terminology, and basic definitions necessary to understand the context and history of transfer learning. We will begin by introducing the key ideas behind transfer learning, highlighting how it enables knowledge transfer between related but distinct domains. Then, we will move onto defining some common terms used throughout the paper and explain why they matter when dealing with transfer learning. Afterwards, we will dive into the details of transfer learning algorithms and how they can be applied to multiple problems, addressing both theoretical aspects as well as practical issues in application scenarios. 

## Key Ideas
### Knowledge Transfer Between Related But Distinct Domains
The primary motivation behind transfer learning is to enable machines to learn from experience accumulated in a related but distinct domain. For instance, if we want to build a car assistant that recognizes objects in images taken outside our home, we would need to first collect a massive number of images containing cars, trucks, motorcycles, and bikes across all possible angles, distances, weather conditions, lighting, and background clutter. If we were to manually label each image, this could take months or even years depending on the size and complexity of the dataset. Likewise, a supervised learning algorithm trained on ImageNet could only identify animals and furniture within images of a particular domain such as artworks or food. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-existing models that have been trained on vast amounts of data and expert knowledge across disparate domains and apply them to new domains without requiring extensive manual annotation effort. 


Figure 1 - Example of Transfer Learning

A simple illustration of transfer learning is given above. Imagine that you own two dog breeds, Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever. You may have spent hundreds or thousands of hours training your dogs to distinguish between outdoor scenes and then developed skills at recognizing familiar objects. To teach your second dog, however, you don’t need to spend countless hours labelling every photograph. Instead, you can simply train your second dog using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was previously trained on a massive dataset of images containing both dogs and people. The CNN has already learnt to recognize features unique to dogs such as fur, ears, paws, and tails. It doesn’t require any manual annotations or long time-consuming training procedures since it has already experienced enough of this kind of information during training. Therefore, your second dog can learn to identify people and other objects just by being exposed to the same environment.

### Common Terms and Definitions
Before we proceed further, let's clarify some important terms and concepts used in transfer learning. These include:

1. Source Domain: The original dataset where the pre-trained model was originally trained on.
2. Target Domain: The new, unseen dataset where the transferred knowledge needs to be applied to.
3. Pre-Trained Model: A deep learning model that has been trained on a large dataset beforehand.
4. Finetuning: The process of retraining the last layer(s) of the pre-trained model on the target domain while keeping the rest of the layers frozen.
5. Hyperparameters: Parameters that affect the architecture, training procedure, or loss function of a model.
6. Data Augmentation: Techniques to synthetically increase the size and diversity of the training set by creating variations of existing samples.

### Problem Formulation
When applying transfer learning to a new problem, there are three main steps involved:

1. Identify the source domain: Determine what type of data and tasks are needed for the initial training of the pre-trained model. This could involve identifying different sources of data or even collecting additional data in the target domain.
2. Train the pre-trained model: Use the pre-trained model on the source domain to extract high level representations of features in the data. Typically, the output of the final fully connected layer(s) of the model is fed through a softmax activation function to obtain probabilities over the classes. 
3. Apply transfer learning: Fine-tune the extracted features from step 2 by incorporating them into a new deep learning model that targets the target domain. In order to prevent catastrophic forgetting, we typically freeze most of the early layers of the pre-trained model and fine-tune only the later ones. During fine-tuning, adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and weight decay to ensure convergence. Additionally, we can use regularization techniques like dropout and data augmentation to stabilize training and avoid overfitting.

Based on these steps, the following transfer learning pipelines can be defined:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Use the pre-trained model on the source domain to directly produce high level features that represent the data. For example, VGG16, ResNet, DenseNet, and AlexNet are examples of convolutional networks pretrained on ImageNet. These models can be modified slightly to fit the target domain, for example changing the input size or number of classes. Other types of feature extraction techniques exist, including deep kernel learning and manifold learning, but they often rely heavily on labeled data. 

2. **Fine-Tuning**: Traditional transfer learning approaches involve freezing the entire network except for the last layer(s), which are randomly initialized and then trained on the target domain. While effective, this method suffers from catastrophic forgetting because the earlier layers are no longer useful for prediction after fine-tuning. Another issue is that the optimal hyperparameters can vary significantly across different tasks, making it difficult to optimize systematically. An alternative is to train only the last layer(s) on the target domain by initializing them with those from the pre-trained model and updating the remaining parameters using backpropagation. This reduces the risk of catastrophic forgetting and ensures that the newly learned features still capture meaningful relationships between the target variables and the inputs. 

3. **Dual Supervision:** Several papers have proposed dual supervision schemes that combine labeled and unlabeled data to train a single model that performs well across the target domain. One such approach is Adversarial Domain Adaptation (ADA), which generates synthetic labeled data by adversarially manipulating the features extracted from the pre-trained model. The labels generated by the discriminator help guide the training process and force the model to focus on accurate predictions on the target domain. Similar approaches like consistency regularization and Mean Teacher rely on jointly optimizing shared embeddings between the two domains instead of separate classifiers. Both approaches combine labeled and unlabeled data to produce more robust and reliable predictions, but they require additional computational resources and human intervention.

### Challenges
One of the biggest challenges associated with transfer learning lies in handling highly imbalanced data. Since transfer learning relies on pre-trained models that were originally trained on a larger dataset, the distribution of class labels might differ between the source and target domains. In this case, it becomes challenging to balance the classes appropriately and maintain good performance on the target domain. Two major factors that influence the degree of imbalance are:

1. Class Prior: Even though most of the classes are quite balanced, there could be rare classes that are underrepresented in the source domain. Oftentimes, this is not easy to detect since rare classes usually occur infrequently and hence, little impact on model performance. In addition, missing rare classes could lead to poor performance on the target domain. To handle this, we can generate synthetic samples of rare classes using generative models or hybrid approaches. Alternatively, we can add auxiliary losses that encourage the model to pay attention to rare classes during training. 

2. Differences in Data Representation: Some deep learning models struggle with extremely irregular distributions of pixel values across different regions of the image, leading to biases towards uniformly colored images or edges. Depending on the nature of the underlying data representation, adding noise or blurring can help alleviate this effect. However, it should be noted that increasing the dimensionality or complexity of the representation could potentially complicate the learning process. Hence, care must be taken to choose appropriate transformations that preserve the salient characteristics of the visual data. 


Another challenge is scalability. Transfer learning requires training very deep neural networks, which can quickly become computationally expensive and resource-intensive. When working with large-scale datasets, it becomes essential to carefully design optimization strategies that minimize memory usage and speed up the training process. Despite recent advances in hardware acceleration, optimized implementations of modern deep learning frameworks are still far from perfect and prone to crashes and instabilities. To mitigate these issues, we can consider:

1. Parallelization: Using distributed computing tools like GPUs or TPUs can greatly accelerate the training process, especially for large-scale datasets. However, parallelized implementations are more complex and require careful coding practices. 

2. Memory Optimization: Improvements in GPU memory capacity over the last decade have led to improvements in the feasible size of deep neural networks. However, the tradeoff is between increased memory consumption and reduced training throughput. To mitigate this, we can consider reducing the size and depth of the model, using sparse and low rank approximations, or selecting simpler architectures that operate faster on lower-end devices. 

Finally, there are ethical and legal concerns associated with transfer learning. Much like humans, machines need to demonstrate compliance with social norms and act in accordance with safeguards against exploitation. Companies and governments may be interested in monitoring the transfer of sensitive or harmful technologies such as genetic test results, health records, and financial transactions. Furthermore, companies need to make sure that their employees and affiliates are aware of the risks and responsibilities associated with transfer learning. Researchers and developers must exercise caution when evaluating and implementing transfer learning systems that promise to benefit society and individuals, particularly when considering the effects on workers’ safety and livelihoods. 

# 3. Core Algorithmic Principles
In this part, we will briefly go over the key components of traditional transfer learning algorithms, namely cross-entropy loss, stochastic gradient descent, and momentum. We will cover the mathematical foundation behind these components and explain how they can be combined together to formulate the objective function for transfer learning. Next, we will explore multi-task learning and showcase how it can be extended to transfer learning problems.  

## Cross-Entropy Loss
Cross-entropy loss is commonly used as the objective function for binary classification problems in transfer learning. It measures the difference between the predicted probability assigned by the classifier and the true label. Given a set of labeled examples $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ from the source domain and a set of unlabeled examples $\{u_j\}_{j=1}^{m}$, the cross-entropy loss is defined as follows:

$$L(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n-\log P_{\theta}(y_i|x_i)+\lambda \sum_{j=1}^{m} u^T_j KL(P_{\theta}(u_j|\tilde{u}_j)),$$

where $\theta$ denotes the parameter vector of the pre-trained model, $KL$ stands for the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and $\lambda$ controls the tradeoff between the cross-entropy and entropy constraints. Here, $\tilde{u}_j$ refers to a sample drawn from the latent space of the source domain corresponding to $u_j$. We assume that the labeled examples are provided in a one-hot encoded format, i.e., $y=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\dots &1\\0&1&\cdots &0\\\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\1&0&\cdots &0\end{bmatrix}$.

Therefore, the negative log likelihood term encourages the classifier to predict the correct label with high confidence, whereas the entropy constraint acts as a regularizer to avoid overconfidence. The second summand represents the uncertainty of the unlabeled samples in the source domain. Intuitively, if a sample is unlikely to belong to any of the target classes, it means that the model cannot accurately estimate its class membership probabilistically. Thus, we try to minimize the entropy of the unlabeled examples to improve the stability of the transfer learning process. The greater the value of $\lambda$, the more emphasis is placed on the entropy penalty. Note that setting $\lambda=0$ corresponds to conventional supervised learning, where the labeled data alone drives the decision boundary of the target domain.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm for training machine learning models. SGD updates the parameters of the model by taking a small step in the direction of the negative gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameters. Given a mini-batch of labeled examples $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{b}$ from the source domain, the update rule for the parameters $\theta$ is as follows:

$$\theta'=\theta+\alpha \nabla_\theta J(\theta; x_i,\theta')=-\alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}J(\theta; x_i,\theta'),$$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, $J(\theta)$ is the objective function that depends on the current model parameters $\theta$ and the labeled example $x_i$. The gradient of the objective function gives the direction of fastest ascent, which points towards the region of highest curvature. Therefore, SGD is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the objective function, regardless of the initialization. However, choosing an appropriate learning rate is critical for effective transfer learning. Smaller learning rates result in slow convergence and may cause oscillations, while larger learning rates can lead to numerical instability.

## Momentum
Momentum adds a fraction $\beta$ of the previous update to the current update to accelerate convergence. Mathematically, the update rule for the parameters $\theta'$ is as follows:

$$\theta'=\theta+(1-\beta) \alpha \nabla_\theta J(\theta; x_i,\theta')+ \beta \theta',$$

Here, $(1-\beta)$ accounts for the fact that the gradient is estimated from a random mini-batch and thus contributes less to the overall movement of the parameters. Setting $\beta=0$ recovers standard SGD updates.

Overall, combining the cross-entropy loss and SGD updates yields a powerful framework for transfer learning. By minimizing the cross-entropy error on the labeled examples and encouraging exploration of unlabeled examples in the source domain, we can effectively bootstrap a pre-trained model to the target domain.

## Multi-Task Learning
Multi-task learning combines multiple related but independent tasks such as image classification and object detection. Unlike individual learning tasks, multi-task learning assumes that the model can simultaneously learn different functions, each responsible for solving a different aspect of the problem. Specifically, multi-task learning assumes that the model can classify the input data into multiple categories independently, rather than relying on a fixed set of decision boundaries. 

To extend multi-task learning to transfer learning, we can treat each task as an additional channel of the input tensor. Specifically, the input tensors for each task contain information about both the source domain and the target domain. For example, we can concatenate the pre-processed source domain image and the raw pixels of the target domain image as an extra channel of the input tensor. Then, we can apply separate convolutional filters for each task and learn the combination of their outputs to satisfy the required task constraints. Based on this idea, various variants of multi-task learning for transfer learning have been proposed, including co-training, proto-transfer learning, and ensemble learning.

However, the success of multi-task learning varies depending on the choice of task constraints and the type of data representation used. For example, some tasks may require direct access to the intermediate features of the model, while others may require global reasoning over the entire image. Therefore, it is crucial to select suitable task constraints and data representations that reflect the characteristics of the target domain and support effective transfer learning.

# 4. Applications
In this section, we will examine the various transfer learning applications, highlighting both the theory and the practical aspects of each approach. We will start by examining the fundamentals of transfer learning in medical imaging, followed by the application of transfer learning in natural language processing and speech recognition. Finally, we will conclude by discussing the role of transfer learning in robotics and autonomous driving, arguing that it is an emerging technology that promises to revolutionize industries such as medicine, engineering, and transportation. 

## Medical Imaging Transfer Learning
Medical imaging is a rapidly growing field in today's digital age. With the proliferation of new diagnostic modalities and improved resolution, radiology is turning into a specialized branch of clinical medicine. Despite the availability of great quantities of medical images, medical professionals face the challenge of extracting valuable insights and diagnoses from these large collections of data. Transfer learning has made immense progress in medical image analysis, allowing medical practitioners to leverage rich, pre-trained models for adapting their capabilities to new data sets.

Specifically, transfer learning has enabled medical image analysts to segment lung nodules from chest X-rays in seconds, providing quick feedback to radiologists to facilitate treatment planning. In contrast to traditional segmentation approaches, transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale histopathological scans to automatically learn structural and spatial features that can be easily adapted to a new domain. The resulting network can effectively segment new images from a variety of diseases and conditions, improving the efficiency and accuracy of radiologist workflows.

Beyond radiology, transfer learning has also been employed in breast cancer screening, ovarian cancer diagnosis, kidney disease detection, and colon cancer diagnosis. Each of these subfields benefits from the power of transfer learning because they share some common features, such as similarity in the appearance of tissues, presence of abnormal cell populations, and functional connectivity. By leveraging pre-trained models for these applications, medical image analysts can analyze new patient data much more efficiently compared to starting from scratch.

## Natural Language Processing Transfer Learning
Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that involves modeling and analyzing human language. Transfer learning has been widely used in NLP to develop models for a wide range of tasks, such as text classification, question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. Although transfer learning can be effective in some tasks, it is particularly beneficial in NLP because the language itself contains complex structures that make it difficult to learn the internal representations implicitly learned by statistical language models.

For example, suppose we want to develop a sentiment analysis tool that identifies positive or negative reviews written in English. Standard word embedding models such as Word2Vec or GloVe capture semantic similarities between words, but they ignore the syntax and sentence structure of sentences. Without a sufficiently large corpus of annotated data, it is impossible to learn the precise way in which the meaning of words is influenced by nearby words. Transfer learning addresses this shortcoming by leveraging pre-trained models that have been trained on large corpora of text and associated annotations, such as movie reviews or scientific articles.

Once we have obtained a model that captures the underlying semantics of the English language, we can use it as a basis for developing sentiment analysis tools for other languages. In this way, we can harness the hard-won insights gleaned from a massive body of annotated data in one language to develop effective NLP models that can transfer well to new languages.

Transfer learning also plays a crucial role in tasks such as question answering and named entity recognition, which require reasoning over complex sentence structures to infer answers and locate entities in the text. Despite their importance, few works have focused specifically on transfer learning for these tasks, despite their intrinsic complexity. This gap is likely to be filled by advances in neural architectures and techniques that allow complex models to exploit implicit structured representations in language data.

## Speech Recognition Transfer Learning
Speech recognition is a challenging and active area of research in AI. With the development of mobile phones and other consumer devices, voice communication has become increasingly accessible. However, speech recognition remains a challenging problem for several reasons. First, the audio signal is typically complex and non-stationary, making it difficult for traditional ML algorithms to perform well. Second, the vocabulary size is vast and constantly expanding, making it difficult for traditional algorithms to adapt to new environments and speakers. Lastly, speaker variability makes it even harder to train and evaluate models for speech recognition.

Transfer learning offers a solution to these issues. Instead of training traditional ML models from scratch, we can leverage pre-trained models trained on a large scale corpus of speech data from a variety of speakers and accents. Once we have successfully trained a model on one domain, we can adapt it to new environments and speakers by continuing to train it on a new subset of the data. This process eliminates the need to train the model from scratch and improves the performance of the model on unseen data.

To apply transfer learning to speech recognition, we can follow the following steps:

1. Collect a large corpus of speech data from different speakers and accents.
2. Prepare the data by preprocessing the audio signals and extracting features from the speech waveforms.
3. Split the data into training and validation sets, ensuring that the data distribution is representative of the target domain.
4. Train a deep neural network (DNN) on the pre-trained model on the speech data.
5. Finetune the DNN on the target domain, accounting for changes in the data distribution, noise levels, and speaker variability.
6. Evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data to assess its transferability.

## Robotics and Autonomous Driving Transfer Learning
With the ever-increasing popularity of self-driving vehicles, transfer learning has made remarkable progress in automotive industry. This technological revolution is expected to transform the way we interact with cars and ultimately enhance the quality of life of millions of riders around the world. Transfer learning is particularly significant because it enables us to leverage powerful pre-trained models that have been trained on large-scale image and sensor data to improve the driving behavior of drivers.

As mentioned earlier, transfer learning has allowed car makers to use pre-trained models for lane detection and tracking, object detection, traffic sign detection, and motion control. By integrating these models into the vehicle control system, the end user can expect faster and safer driving experiences. Such transfer learning techniques also play a significant role in reinforcement learning, where the agent can learn from demonstrations on the road and apply it to the dynamic obstacles that arise in real-world settings.

At the heart of transfer learning for autonomous vehicles lies the idea of end-to-end learning. End-to-end learning involves training a model on a collection of raw data, including camera images, sensor readings, and controls commands. This approach removes the requirement for hand-engineered features and simplifies the system architecture. The key advantage of end-to-end learning is that it can capture high-level abstract representations of the data and learn the best policies for controlling the car. Transfer learning can further simplify this process by leveraging pre-trained models on a large-scale dataset collected from similar environments and driving behaviors.
