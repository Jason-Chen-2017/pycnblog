搜索引擎领域的文档信息检索应用正在经历着一场改革。越来越多的公司、组织、机构开始采用机器学习和深度学习技术来提升文档检索质量、降低文档检索成本，以更好满足用户的需求。然而，如何有效地赋予文档关键词更高的权重，对于提升搜索引擎的检索结果的效果至关重要。

Term weighting techniques refers to the process of assigning weights or scores to terms used for searching and ranking documents. The goal is to give more importance to important words or phrases within a document relative to less important words or phrases, which would improve search engine's ability to return relevant results efficiently and effectively. Term weighting techniques are one component of modern information retrieval algorithms that can be applied in various contexts such as web search, email indexing, news article classification, product recommendation system, and much more. In this article we will present an overview of term weighting techniques commonly used in modern search engines including TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), BM25 (Boolean model with pseudo relevance feedback), Okapi BM25 (a variation of BM25 algorithm), LM Dirichlet (language modeling technique using probabilistic language models) and Language Model based approaches (such as Word2Vec). We also discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we provide concrete examples of how these techniques can be implemented in popular open source search engines like Elasticsearch and Solr.

2.词频/逆向文档频率（TF-IDF）

TF-IDF stands for term frequency–inverse document frequency. It was originally introduced by <NAME> and Robertson in their paper "tf-idf: term weighting for text categorization" in 1999. TF-IDF assigns higher weights to more frequently occurring terms but lower weights to terms that appear in many documents. The intuition behind it is that some terms such as "the", "and", "is" might be common across all documents while other terms such as specific words or phrases that are unique to each document would have greater significance in determining its relevance to the query. Here is a brief explanation of how tf-idf works:

1. Firstly, we count the number of occurrences of each term in the current document and divide it by the total number of terms in the document. This gives us the term frequency (tf) of the term in the document.

2. Next, we compute the inverse document frequency (idf) for each term in the collection of documents. The idf is computed as log((number of documents + 1)/(number of documents containing the term + 1)), where 'n' represents the total number of documents in the collection.

3. After computing both tf and idf, we multiply them together to get the final score for the term in the current document.

The formula looks something like this:

score = tf * idf 

Here is how we can implement TF-IDF in Python using scikit-learn library:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names()) # feature names
print(X.toarray()) # array of features
```

Where corpus is a list of strings representing our documents and X is a sparse matrix containing the TF-IDF values for each word in each document. The rows of X correspond to the documents and columns correspond to the vocabulary terms extracted from the corpus.

3.布尔模型（BM25）

BM25 is another commonly used term weighting technique. It was developed by Jones et al. in 2008. Unlike TF-IDF, which only takes into account the frequency of occurrence of individual terms, BM25 considers not just the frequency of occurrence but also the position of the term within the document. The intuition here is that if two consecutive sentences contain similar words then they are likely to belong to the same topic and therefore should have a high similarity between them. Similarly, adjacent words appearing close together within a sentence indicate that the context around those words is important. Here is a brief explanation of how BM25 works: 

1. Firstly, we calculate the average length of the document over all the documents in the collection. 

2. Then, we compute the normalized term frequency (ntf) for each term in the document. Ntf is calculated as follows:

ntf = ((k+1)*tf)/(k*(1-b+b*length/avgdl))

3. Next, we compute the numerator and denominator for the BM25 score for each term in the document. The numerators are obtained by summing up the product of each term’s tf and idf value in the document. The denominators are obtained by adding the product of each term’s ntf value and its corresponding idf value in the entire collection.

4. Finally, we normalize the score for each term in the document by dividing the numerators by the denominators. The overall score for the document is then simply the sum of all the normalized scores for the terms. 

In practice, the k parameter determines the degree of lenience towards longer documents, b parameter controls the degree of term saturation, and avgdl corresponds to the expected length of a document.

Here is how we can implement BM25 in Python using whoosh library:

```python
from whoosh.analysis import StemmingAnalyzer
from whoosh.fields import Schema, TEXT
from whoosh.qparser import QueryParser
from whoosh import index
import os

analyzer = StemmingAnalyzer()
schema = Schema(content=TEXT(stored=True, analyzer=analyzer))

if not os.path.exists("indexdir"):
os.mkdir("indexdir")

ix = index.create_in("indexdir", schema)
writer = ix.writer()
for docid, content in enumerate(documents):
writer.add_document(docnum=docid, content=content)
writer.commit()

with ix.searcher() as searcher:
parser = QueryParser("content", ix.schema)
query = parser.parse("query")
results = searcher.search(query, limit=None)

for hit in results:
print(hit["docnum"])
print(hit["content"])

```

Note that we use the Whoosh library to build the inverted index and perform the querying tasks. There are several libraries available that support BM25 scoring out-of-the-box. For example, Apache Lucene supports BM25 through org.apache.lucene.search.similarities.BM25Similarity class.

4.Okapi BM25

Similar to BM25, Okapi BM25 is another widely used term weighting technique. The main difference between BM25 and Okapi BM25 is in their calculation of term frequency. In Okapi BM25, instead of taking the raw frequency of occurrence, they take into account the term frequency adjusted by the length of the document and some constant kappa. Kappa is chosen so that the probability of any given term randomly appearing at any position within a document is negligible. The adjustment is done so that long documents do not dominate the contribution of rare or unusual terms. Here is a brief explanation of how Okapi BM25 works:

1. Firstly, we initialize three variables alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha and beta determine the shape of the function, while gamma sets the width of the gap distribution. The optimal choice of alpha and beta depends on the characteristics of the collection. Gamma is usually set to 1.0 unless there are very long documents in the collection. 

2. Next, we compute the term frequency adjusted by the length of the document and the constant kappa. Let d denote the number of tokens in the document, t denote the rank of the term within the document, fij denote the frequency of the i th token in the j th sentence, cij denote the length of the j th sentence divided by the average length of all sentences in the document, and kappa denote the smoothing parameter. Then, the following equation computes the term frequency adjusted by the length of the document:

q_i = freq_{ti} / sqrt[(d - freq_{ti})^2 / freq_{ti}]

3. Now, we obtain the denominator for the Okapi BM25 score for each term in the document. Denominator is obtained by summing up the product of each term’s ntf value and its corresponding idf value in the entire collection. 

4. Finally, we normalize the score for each term in the document by dividing the numerators by the denominators. The overall score for the document is then simply the sum of all the normalized scores for the terms. 

In summary, Okapi BM25 is generally preferred over traditional BM25 because it improves accuracy and efficiency for collections with highly variable document lengths and extremely small amounts of relevant data. However, due to its complexity, implementing Okapi BM25 requires significant expertise in search engine design and optimization.
