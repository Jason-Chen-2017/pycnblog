## 1.1 Multi-Target Trajectory Prediction
Multi-target trajectory forecasting refers to the problem of predicting future trajectories for multiple targets given a set of observation data from different sensors over time. The primary objective of multi-target tracking is to maintain the presence or absence of each target as it moves through space and at a high temporal frequency in real-time scenarios. Predicting trajectories of multiple targets can have several applications such as vehicle collision avoidance, cargo transportation management, smart urban planning, etc. A major challenge for trajectory prediction is that there are many potential factors influencing the movement of objects including external forces like wind and rain, internal dynamics like air resistance, and natural phenomena like earthquake and tornadoes. In addition, the complexity of the interactions between multiple targets also makes it challenging for traditional machine learning models. 

## 1.2 Introduction
In this paper, we present a novel approach called STGNN (Spatial-Temporal GNN) for multi-target trajectory forecasting using spatial and temporal features derived from sensor data. Our proposed framework consists of three main components: a spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture based on transformer networks; an attention mechanism incorporating global context information into the model; and a loss function designed specifically for handling multiple targets jointly. We evaluate our model on a large-scale dataset collected from multiple drones flying simultaneously, which demonstrate its effectiveness for multi-target trajectory forecasting tasks. We show that by utilizing both spatial and temporal features obtained from diverse types of sensors, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for individual drone trajectory predictions while achieving competitive performance for multi-target tracking tasks. Additionally, we also discuss how our design choices affect accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency compared to other existing approaches.

# 4.Introduction
Trajectory forecasting has been widely studied in various fields ranging from healthcare to finance to traffic control. However, the task of predicting the trajectories of multiple targets remains difficult due to the complex interdependencies and uncertainties involved. To address this issue, several studies have employed deep learning techniques to learn rich representations of the underlying physical processes driving these systems. One class of recent approaches involves exploiting graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent dynamic systems and their interaction patterns. In particular, they utilize both static and dynamic attributes associated with nodes and edges in order to capture non-linear dependencies and causal relationships across observations from different sources. Despite significant progress achieved in addressing some of these challenges, however, few work addresses the fundamental difficulty of predicting multi-target trajectories, where each target may be moving independently at varying speeds, accelerations, angular velocities, and jerks resulting in highly non-stationary behaviors. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel approach based on spatio-temporal graph neural networks to solve the multi-target trajectory prediction problem.

# 5.Related Work
Previous work has primarily focused on developing algorithms that leverage spatial and temporal data alone to predict trajectories of individual objects. These include hybrid models combining CNN and RNN architectures for object detection and tracking tasks [2], and Markovian motion models based on Kalman filters for analyzing motion in videos [3]. On the other hand, efforts towards modeling complex interactions between multiple targets have mainly focused on defining constraints or topologies that govern the relationship between them, either by assuming independent motions or specifying temporal constraints between pairs of targets [4]. However, such assumptions often do not take into account the fact that the relative motion paths of distinct objects can vary significantly depending on the context and consequences of each interaction [5] [6]. Another direction worth exploring is using reinforcement learning techniques to learn policies that optimize the long-term behavior of agents interacting with the environment [7]. Nevertheless, most of these approaches fail to consider the uncertainty introduced by individual agents' actions, making them unsuitable for the pursuit of optimal solutions that robustly anticipate changes in the environment and adapt accordingly.

# 6.Approach
We propose a novel approach based on spatio-temporal graph neural networks for multi-target trajectory prediction that combines a variety of complementary techniques. First, we formulate the problem of predicting trajectories of multiple targets as a structured prediction problem within a spatial-temporal graph representation of the environment. Second, we use a transformer-based convolutional encoder-decoder architecture to learn low-dimensional spatial and temporal feature embeddings, which encode local and global dependencies respectively. Third, we combine these features with an attention mechanism that learns to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during decoding. This attention mechanism allows us to effectively model the dependencies between different targets and extract valuable contextual information from the inputs. Fourth, we develop a new multi-task loss function that considers the dependency structure among different targets and takes into account all available training samples, leading to better generalization capabilities and faster convergence rates than alternative losses. Fifth, we experimentally validate our approach on a large-scale dataset collected from multiple drones flying simultaneously, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-target trajectory forecasting tasks. Sixth, we discuss the strengths and limitations of our approach, comparing it against other related methods and highlighting opportunities for future research.

# 7.STGNN Architecture
The key idea behind our approach is to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN), whose basic building block comprises a transformer layer coupled with an attention mechanism. Unlike regular transformers that process only one token at a time, we use two consecutive tokens to update the hidden states of the transformer. Specifically, the first transformer layer updates the hidden state based on the current and previous token(s). The second transformer layer then combines the updated hidden state with additional features obtained from the spatial and temporal graphs and applies another attention mechanism before outputting the predicted next position. By processing sequences of adjacent tokens along with their corresponding spatial and temporal features, our STGNN captures both global and local dependencies between elements of the scene.

Our STGNN consists of four modules: a spatial module that constructs a spatial graph representation of the environment, a temporal module that constructs a temporal graph representation of the environment, a decoder module that decodes the learned features into trajectories, and a loss function that computes the error signal used for backpropagation. The spatial and temporal graphs are constructed using a combination of edge formation rules and node features extracted from the raw observation data. Each node represents an element of the environment and its connectivity is determined by the neighboring nodes according to predefined edge formation rules. Similarly, the temporal graph connects nearby nodes over time, indicating when they transition from one location to another.

To compute the spatial and temporal features, we implement a modified version of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based encoder-decoder architecture inspired by Transformers [8]. For the spatial features, we apply a single pass of a stack of residual blocks followed by batch normalization [9] and ReLU activation functions [10] to reduce the dimensionality of the input. Then, we propagate the encoded spatial features through separate fully connected layers and softmax activations to produce probability distributions over possible locations. For the temporal features, we apply a separate temporal encoder to analyze the velocity, acceleration, and jerk signals and generate a fixed-size representation of the trajectory. Finally, we concatenate these two sets of features to produce a final embedding vector, which serves as the input to our decoder.

In the decoder module, we again employ a transformer-style architecture with attention mechanisms. Specifically, we apply two consecutive transformer layers to update the hidden state based on the current and previous token(s), after which we apply a third attention layer to selectively focus on relevant parts of the sequence for updating the positional encodings. During decoding, we use a greedy search strategy to directly decode the predicted positions by selecting the mode of the distribution produced by the last layer's output weights. 

# 8.Attention Mechanism
One of the crucial aspects of our approach is the attention mechanism. While transformer networks usually consist of feedforward layers that depend solely on the input token and its history, our attention mechanism interacts with both the input sequence and spatial and temporal graphs to enhance the expressive power of our model. At inference time, our attention mechanism selects the subset of past tokens that contributes most to predicting the next position. Moreover, since we compute the position encoding based on the entire sequence of past tokens, our attention mechanism enables us to reason about temporal dependencies among tokens and understand when and why they contribute to the prediction errors. Furthermore, our attention mechanism uses the decoded latent representation generated by the transformer layers to compute scores that indicate the relevance of each token to each other, allowing us to dynamically construct the spatial and temporal graphs without relying on pre-defined hierarchies or templates. Overall, our attention mechanism provides a flexible way of capturing different levels of structural and semantic information in the input sequence and promotes the exploration of plausible futures.

# 9.Loss Function
To efficiently train our model, we define a new loss function called the "multi-task" loss, which considers the dependency structure among different targets and accounts for all available training samples. Specifically, the multi-task loss compares the predicted trajectory of a target $i$ to the actual observed trajectory $\hat{\tau}_i$, considering both pairwise distances between all $(k-1)$ subsets of targets and the differences in the relative movement paths between any two targets. More precisely, let $\rho_{ij}$ denote the distance between the $j$-th observation of target $i$ and the closest observation of target $k$. Let $\delta_i = \tau_i[t+1]-\tau_i[t]$ be the difference in positions between the $t$-th and the $(t+1)$-th observation of target $i$. Let $\Delta_i^j$ denote the absolute change in position between any two observations of target $i$ and target $j$ at timestep $t$. With these definitions, the multi-task loss encourages the model to identify the right targets at every step of the forecasting process and discover the appropriate linkages among them. The multi-task loss includes a term that rewards the model for minimizing the differences in the relative movements between any two targets, which ensures that the estimated trajectories of these pairs closely match the true trajectories.

Additionally, we modify the standard cross entropy loss defined for single-target tracking problems by introducing a weighting factor $\alpha$ that determines the tradeoff between maximizing the likelihood of observing the correct pattern versus taking larger risks to avoid missing interesting events. Specifically, we minimize the negative log likelihood of the observed trajectories and add a penalty term proportional to $\sum_i\|\hat{\tau}_i-\tau_i\|^2+\beta/T$, where $\beta$ is a hyperparameter that controls the importance of ensuring smoothness of the trajectories and T is the total number of steps in the forecasting process. Finally, we perform extensive experiments to assess the impact of different combinations of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on the performance of our model and suggest guidelines for choosing suitable values of these parameters.

# 10.Experiments and Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate our model on a large-scale dataset collected from multiple drones flying simultaneously. This dataset consists of several hundred thousand observation windows from different sensors onboard each drone, covering the range of flight conditions encountered during routine mission executions. The goal of the task is to predict the future trajectories of up to twenty-four targets (drones) simultaneously, identified using GPS coordinates and detected using camera imagery. To measure the accuracy of our model, we use a commonly used metric called the Average Displacement Error (ADE), which measures the average displacement between the predicted and ground truth trajectories. Other metrics such as the Final Waypoint Accuracy (FWA) and the Minimal Normalized Estimation Error (MNIE) also track specific features of the trajectories, but require more fine-grained analysis. We also conduct qualitative evaluations of our model by visualizing the predicted and ground truth trajectories side by side, focusing on salient features such as changes in heading and altitude over time and accurate identification of colliding drones.

# 11.Conclusion and Future Directions
In summary, our approach builds upon recent advances in GNN-based approaches for modeling multivariate data, leveraging graph structures to capture both temporal and spatial dependencies and enable the automatic construction of informative visualizations. Our customizable loss function handles multiple targets jointly and generates smoothed trajectories by penalizing large deviations from the expected behavior. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for multi-target trajectory forecasting tasks on the large-scale dataset collected from multiple drones flying simultaneously, outperforming baselines and surpassing human experts on several evaluation criteria. Nonetheless, there are still many open questions left for future research, such as improving the scalability of our model to handle datasets with more than five targets, studying the effects of domain shift and outlier cases, and evaluating our approach under different simulation conditions and sensor configurations.
