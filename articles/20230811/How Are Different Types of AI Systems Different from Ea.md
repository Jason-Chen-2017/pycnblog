Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation and understanding of human intelligence using machines. There are various types of artificial intelligence systems that have emerged over time such as chatbots, natural language processing applications, virtual assistants, and machine learning algorithms. In this article we will explore different types of AI systems by comparing their underlying principles, architectures, data sets used, and tools developed. 

In this study, we will use the following definition:
- A system is defined as an AI system if it can learn or reason based on a set of inputs and produce outputs in real-time or near real-time manner. 
- An agent is a software program that interacts with the environment to achieve some objective. The term “agent” comes from the AI research community where agents operate within environments that they are embedded in. Agents can be categorized into three main categories:
- Rule-based agents: These type of agents use rules based on predetermined logic to take actions in response to input data. For example, scheduling assistant agents rely on predefined rules for setting up appointments and meeting reminders. 
- Learning agents: These type of agents learn new skills and knowledge through experience gathering and adaptation during runtime. Examples of these include personal assistants like Alexa and Siri, which constantly improve themselves through learning and adapting to user behavior patterns.  
- Natural language understanding agents: These agents understand natural language commands and expressions and respond accordingly. They can translate spoken language to text format, identify intentions, entities, sentiment, etc., and perform appropriate action.

The goal of our study is to understand how each type of AI system works differently from each other and what makes them unique and valuable. We will also compare these systems against common benchmarks such as widely used rule-based systems, traditional programming languages, and cloud platforms. Finally, we will provide recommendations for selecting the most suitable AI system based on specific requirements and constraints. 

We hope that our exploration of different types of AI systems will help organizations choose the right AI system for their needs and challenges.

# 2.Background Introduction
Over the past few years, the field of Artificial Intelligence has been growing exponentially with several breakthroughs and advancements in various areas including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Robotics. As a result, there are now multiple types of AI systems available today ranging from simple rule-based solutions to complex deep neural networks trained on large datasets. However, despite all these advancements, the question still remains - What makes one type of AI system better than another?

This paper attempts to answer this question by examining various aspects of AI systems – its underlying principles, architecture, dataset used, and tool development. Based on our analysis, we will conclude on factors that distinguish between different types of AI systems and present a recommendation for selecting the most suitable AI system based on specific requirements and constraints. This article will not attempt to cover every aspect of the subject but rather focus on high-level concepts and results. Our goal is to demystify the mysterious world of artificial intelligence by providing insights and techniques for designing and implementing efficient and effective AI systems.

Let’s get started!

## Understanding AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation and understanding of human intelligence using machines. It involves computers that mimic human cognitive abilities, making them feasible for solving complex problems that require human intellect. Machines capable of self-learning through trial-and-error and unsupervised learning have made tremendous progress in recent years, revolutionizing fields like speech recognition, image classification, video analytics, and decision-making. Despite its enormous potential, however, the vast majority of current AI systems face fundamental challenges when it comes to integrating with humans. To address these issues, roboticists, engineers, and scientists have devised several strategies for creating more engaging and collaborative interactions between people and machines.

In summary, the major trends in AI are focused on enabling machines to solve increasingly challenging tasks while interacting with humans. The need for scalability, flexibility, and interactivity continues to grow, necessitating multi-modal interfaces and integration technologies that enable users to interact effectively across diverse contexts.

## Types of AI Systems
There are currently five main types of artificial intelligence systems: 

1. **Rule-Based Systems**: These systems have been around since ancient times and consist of pre-defined logic and rules that define the output given certain conditions. Some examples include search engines like Google and Yahoo, email filtering services, and content moderation platforms. 

2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: These systems utilize statistical models to automatically learn and make predictions about the data. One popular algorithm family is the supervised learning approach that uses labeled training data to adjust parameters to optimize performance. Another famous algorithm family is reinforcement learning that trains agents to learn behaviors by optimizing rewards and penalties in simulated environments. 

3. **Natural Language Processing Applications**: These systems analyze and interpret human language in order to extract meaningful information and generate responses. Examples include chatbots, automatic summarization tools, and voice-enabled apps like Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri. 

4. **Virtual Assistants**: These systems provide virtual personas that mimic the way a person would behave in real life. They typically work with hardware devices like microphones, speakers, and displays to simulate conversations with end-users and offer features like speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and contextual assistance. 

5. **Deep Neural Networks**: These systems have demonstrated impressive accuracy in many domains, especially those related to computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. They consist of layers of connected neurons that process raw data to produce accurate and informative outputs.
