Cognitive biases are a type of decision making error that occurs when an individual experiences an unconscious impulse to prefer one option over another despite the benefits associated with choosing the other alternative. These biases may result from our own prejudices or impressions or they may be inherited from our parents, teachers, society at large, or even culture-specific values and perceptions. They can have serious consequences on individuals' psychological wellbeing and outcomes. Although cognitive biases can occur in any field, they typically affect artificial intelligence systems (AI) due to their complexity and scale. The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive guideline for designing and developing effective AI systems that reduce these biases while retaining high performance by incorporating relevant cognitive science concepts and principles into its design.

## Types of Cognitive Biases
There are two main types of cognitive bias that affect human decision making:

1.Confirmation Bias: This bias involves the tendency to default to positive outcomes based on evidence presented during confirmation trials rather than the data we would use informed decisions. For example, if you believe something will happen because it has been demonstrated before, you might act positively towards the hypothesis regardless of whether the data supports it or not.

2.Overestimation Bias: This bias involves the tendency to overestimate the probabilities of events occurring and underestimate those which do not occur. It is often called the "regression fallacy," where participants view results as being less severe when they see them negatively compared to what they expected. People who experience overestimation bias usually take more risks than those who don't, resulting in higher chances of committing suicide or going through life experiences that they wouldn't otherwise go through without cognitive biases.

In addition to these two categories, there are several different versions of each bias depending on how they manifest themselves. Some examples include:

* Anchoring effect: When presented with multiple options, people sometimes choose the first or last one they come across as opposed to thinking critically about all possible outcomes. This leads to biased choices in tasks such as selecting clothes or buying products online.

* Availability heuristic: This bias involves assuming that information that is easily available is most valuable but fails to account for situations where information isn’t readily available. For instance, some people focus too much on sources that confirm their beliefs, leading them to accept falsehoods instead of engaging in thoughtful conversation with others.

* Attention residue effect: In decision making processes involving repeated reinforcement learning, people tend to stick with old memories rather than integrating new information into their models. This can lead to distorted judgments and inconsistent behavior within the system.

* Bandwagon effect: This bias refers to the tendency to follow the majority opinion regarding a topic or issue, irrespective of the facts or evidence behind it. Examples include voting issues, political positions, or brand reputation.

* Confirmation bomb: Similar to anchoring effect, this happens when people try to rationalize why things happened after seeing them repeatedly failing to meet criteria. They tend to dismiss evidence without giving proper attention to the causal factors behind it.

* Context effect: This bias refers to the fact that people pay attention to what's happening around them and thus interpret actions differently based on what they see around them. For example, some people make mistakes reading letters or encountering objects on their way home because they notice the negative tone surrounding them.

* Dependence on prior observations: People tend to rely on past experiences when deciding upon future decisions and treat their current knowledge as ground truth. This makes them prone to foolishly accepting incorrect assumptions or base their decisions solely on evidence presented during previous tests.

* Extraction effect: This bias is characterized by the tendency to extract information that confirms their existing beliefs, leading to harmful beliefs or inferences being formed. For example, some people might exaggerate their views on social media posts or claim that someone else is responsible for bad health conditions without fully understanding the situation.

* Hindsight bias: This bias comes from the fact that people react to events in retrospect, trying to identify and explain the causes of success and failure. However, inaccuracies or context changes can cause hindsight bias to worsen or disappear entirely.

* Illusion of contradiction: This bias is characterized by the idea that two seemingly unrelated ideas cannot both be true simultaneously. People fail to recognize when they are actually looking at conflicting information, leading to erroneous conclusions.

* Individualization effect: This bias involves treating each person or group of people independently and missing the commonalities between them. For instance, some people might become more risk-averse or sensitive to negative feedback when interacting with certain groups of people.

* Judgment call effect: In decision-making processes that involve assessing uncertainty, people might be tempted to ignore crucial information or avoid problems altogether. This leads to poor quality decisions that could put trust in outdated assumptions.

* Learning effects: People learn from their experiences and adjust their behaviors accordingly. However, this doesn't mean that every piece of information is equally informative. For example, some people get stuck on familiar topics like math or violent video games, ignoring important details and leading to wrong conclusions.

* Overconfidence effect: People assume that they know everything and seek information only when necessary. This can lead to a false sense of security, leading to inappropriate behavior or worse yet, financial losses.

* Prioritization bias: When faced with competing alternatives, people tend to prioritize the ones that were already agreed upon, taking into consideration their opinions and preferences. As a result, they end up rejecting many potential solutions that could have made the right choice.

* Recognition bias: People are drawn to items that conform to their cultural norms and associations, leading to the misinterpretation of novelty and unexpectedness. For example, some people are drawn to celebrity news articles and assume that all stories related to popular figures are just as realistic.

* Replacement effect: When faced with limited resources, people tend to replace what is working with what appears promising. This can result in long-term damage to the organization or loss of customer loyalty.

* Selection bias: In decision-making processes, people often select the option that seems most logical or intuitive at the time, disregarding the actual relative importance of each option. For example, some people favor ice cream over cookies or spend more on entertainment than leisure activities.

* Sunk costs bias: People value immediate gains over long-term rewards and feel shame when they lose money. However, this affects only those who suffered early injuries and provides little support to others who may face similar challenges later in life.

As mentioned earlier, cognitive biases can have serious consequences on individuals' psychological wellbeing and outcomes, especially in complex decision-making scenarios. To reduce these biases while maintaining high performance, AI systems should incorporate appropriate treatment strategies that emphasize considerations of fairness, transparency, and accountability, among others.
