Deep learning has emerged as a popular technique in various fields including computer vision and natural language processing, among others. It can perform complex tasks by analyzing large amounts of data without any prior training using artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the understanding of deep learning requires some technical skills such as linear algebra, probability theory, statistics, and programming knowledge. In this article, we will provide an overview of key concepts, algorithms, operations steps, and code examples related to deep learning and neural networks with emphasis on practical applications in Python.

We assume readers have at least a basic understanding of machine learning concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, loss functions, optimization methods, and feature engineering. We also assume that they are familiar with Python programming language, including libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

# 2.Basic Concepts
## Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is one of the fundamental mathematical subjects used in deep learning. It provides us with powerful tools for vector and matrix calculations, which helps us understand and implement more complex ANN architectures effectively. The most commonly used linear algebra techniques include dot product, determinant, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, trace, and inverse matrices. Here's how it works:

Dot Product
The dot product between two vectors v = [a1, a2,..., am] and w = [b1, b2,..., bn] is defined as follows:

v • w = ∑i=1n(ai*bi) 

where * denotes elementwise multiplication.

Determinant
The determinant of a square matrix A is defined as det(A), where det represents the symbol for the determinant operation. It is denoted as |A|, and is equal to the signed volume of the three-dimensional space spanned by the columns of A.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
An n x n matrix A is called diagonalizable if it exists by factorization into two matrices, B and C, each consisting of eigenvectors V and eigenvalues λ. Eigendecomposition of a matrix A gives us the same result:

A = V diag(λ) V^T

where V^T is the transpose of the eigenvector matrix V and diag() is the diagonal operator that extracts its diagonal elements. The columns of V form an orthonormal basis of the column space of A. This decomposition allows us to decompose higher-order tensor products into low-rank factors.

Trace Operator
The trace operator tr(A) measures the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix A.

Inverse Matrix
The inverse of a square matrix A is denoted as A^{-1} and is obtained through solving the equation AX = I.

NumPy Library
One of the most widely used Python library for scientific computing and numerical analysis is NumPy. It includes many useful linear algebra routines and supports fast array computations on CPU and GPU processors. You can install NumPy using pip command:

pip install numpy

Here's a few examples of working with NumPy arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([1, 2, 3]) # Create a 1D array
y = np.array([[1], [2], [3]]) # Create a 2D array (matrix)
z = np.array([[[1]], [[2]], [[3]]]) # Create a 3D array (tensor)

print(np.dot(x, y)) # Dot product of two 1D arrays
print(np.linalg.det(z)) # Determinant of a 3D array
print(np.trace(y)) # Trace of a 2D array
print(np.linalg.inv(y)) # Inverse of a 2D array
```

## Probability Theory
Probability theory plays an essential role in machine learning, especially when dealing with continuous variables. We use probability distributions to model and predict random outcomes in different contexts. Some common probability distributions used in deep learning are normal distribution, uniform distribution, and categorical distribution. Normal Distribution
Normal distribution is a symmetric bell curve characterized by mean μ and standard deviation σ. It is often used to represent real-valued random variables whose distribution is not known but can be approximated using a normal distribution. Its PDF can be expressed as follows:

f(x;μ,σ)= (1/(sqrt(2π)*σ))*exp(-((x - μ)^2 / (2*σ^2)))

Uniform Distribution
Uniform distribution assigns equal probability mass to all possible values within an interval. It is typically used to model binary variables, such as true/false questions, coin flips, etc. Its PMF can be written as follows:

p(x;a,b)= {1/(b-a)} if a ≤ x ≤ b
{0} otherwise

Categorical Distribution
Categorical distribution models discrete random variables with a finite number of categories. Each category has an associated probability, which sums up to 1. It is commonly used for multi-class classification problems, where there are multiple target labels for each input sample. It is a multivariate generalization of the Bernoulli distribution, which only considers two classes. The PMF can be expressed as follows:

p(x;p_1,...,p_k)= p_1^{[x=1]}p_2^{[x=2]}...p_k^{[x=k]}

Where pi is the probability of i-th category.

Scipy Library
Another important Python library for scientific computing is Scipy, which contains modules for optimization, integration, signal processing, linear algebra, special functions, interpolation, and statistical functions. One particularly useful function in scipy module for calculating probability distributions is stats.norm(). Here's an example of working with probability distributions in scipy library:

```python
from scipy import stats

x = np.linspace(-3, 3, num=100) # Generate samples from normal distribution
pdf = stats.norm.pdf(x, loc=0, scale=1) # Calculate normal distribution pdf
cdf = stats.norm.cdf(x, loc=0, scale=1) # Calculate cumulative density function

plt.plot(x, pdf) # Plot normal distribution pdf
plt.show()
```

## Statistics
Statistics is another important concept used in deep learning. We use statistics to analyze the performance of our models and make better predictions. Commonly used metrics include accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. Accuracy Score
Accuracy score calculates the proportion of correct classifications in a classification problem. It is calculated as follows:

accuracy=(TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN)

Precision
Precision measures the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances out of all positive predictions made. It is calculated as follows:

precision=TP/(TP+FP)

Recall
Recall measures the fraction of actual positives that were identified correctly. It is calculated as follows:

recall=TP/(TP+FN)

F1-Score
F1-score is a weighted average of precision and recall. It takes both false positives and false negatives into account. It is calculated as follows:

F1-score=2*(precision*recall)/(precision+recall)

ROC Curve
ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate at different threshold levels. It shows how well the classifier is able to identify positive and negative instances. An ideal classifier would produce a curve that lies on the top left corner of the graph, indicating high true positive rate with low false positive rate. A purely random classifier produces a curve that slopes randomly from the bottom left corner towards the upper right corner of the graph.
