Fertilizers are an essential part of food security in agriculture. Their increasing use has led to the development of novel fertilizer composition strategies that focus on specific nutrients or metabolic traits for better yield and productivity. However, traditional artificial intelligence (AI) models have limited capacity when it comes to addressing complex decision-making problems like optimizing fertilizer composition based on varying environmental conditions and cultural practices. This paper proposes a novel approach called Genetic Algorithm-based Optimization Model with a physiological concept embedded into its optimization process. 

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are one of the most popular metaheuristic algorithms used in solving optimization problems such as scheduling, routing, and resource allocation problems. They have been successful in solving these problems by applying their ability to mimic the genetic evolutionary process. In this study, we propose a GA-based optimization model that incorporates a physiological concept (nutrient transporter protein signaling pathway) from mitochondria into the selection process during GA optimization. We present the details about our approach, which includes how we selected fitness functions, encoded genotypes using binary string representation, applied crossover operator, mutation operator, and elimination strategy. Additionally, we presented some experiments performed on different datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology compared to state-of-the-art AI methods.

Genetic Algorithm(GA): is a population-based metaheuristic search technique that mimics the process of natural selection where individual chromosomes (genotype) undergo variation and adaptation through natural selection, leading to improved solutions over time. It involves selecting parents from a population, applying operators to them, generating offspring by combining the parental chromosomes, evaluating fitness values of each chromosome, and finally replacing the worst performing chromosomes with new ones generated through random mutations and selections.     

Binary String Representation: A binary string is a sequence of bits represented as strings consisting only two possible characters '0' and '1'. In this work, we represent each candidate solution (fertilizer composition) in the genetic programming paradigm using binary strings. Each bit position represents a nutrient and the value stored at each bit position represents whether that particular nutrient is included or not. For example, the binary string "101" means that nitrogen (nitrate), phosphorous (phosphate), and potassium (potash) are included while the rest of the nutrients are excluded.      

Physiological Concept Embedding: One common feature of living organisms is their ability to transmit signals across cell membranes. Mitochondria is the most abundant organelle in cells, responsible for energy production, metabolism, and most importantly, synthesis of a wide range of metabolites including amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. Nutrient transporters are enzymes found inside mitochondrial compartments that transfer nutrients from various sources (carbohydrates, lipids, etc.) to other cells within the body. We hypothesize that incorporating the transporter mechanism could be helpful in designing optimal fertilizer composition strategies.   

Fitness Function: A fitness function is a metric indicating the performance of a candidate solution (i.e., a fertilizer composition). Higher fitness scores indicate better performances, and hence, more desirable fertilizer compositions. Our fitness function combines multiple factors including the reduction in overall crop losses due to excess fertilizer application, reduced bioavailability of certain nutrients, increased viability of the resulting plant material, decreased adverse effects, and ease of administration.    

Crossover Operator: During the course of genetic operations, individuals are randomly combined to create offspring who inherit characteristics from both parents. To generate diverse offspring, we apply a crossover operation to selectively combine portions of the first parent's gene with those of the second parent's gene. There are several crossover techniques available such as single point, two point, uniform, and k-point crossover. 

Mutation Operator: Mutation is a genetic process that alters the DNA sequence of an individual by introducing errors and variations in the gene pool. When a candidate solution fails to improve the fitness score, it may become inadequate because of many reasons such as low quality, high cost, and unsuitable soil conditions. Thus, a mutation operator can introduce small changes in the genotype to enhance its suitability for further evaluation. 

   Elimination Strategy: Once a generation of candidates has been evaluated, the weakest members of the population need to be removed before proceeding to the next generation. The survival rate determines the percentage of fittest individuals that make it into the next generation. Population size plays an important role in determining the efficiency of the optimization process.
