## Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration (CI) refers to a software engineering practice where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository. Developers commit their code changes regularly, and multiple developers work together to merge these commits into a central location called the mainline branch several times a day. Each check-in triggers a build server that compiles and tests the application. If any errors occur during testing, the developer is notified immediately so that he/she can fix the issue. Once all checks pass successfully, the latest version of the application is deployed to the testing environment for user feedback and testing purposes. Once the application passes both manual and automated testing, it is then promoted to the next stage of deployment - typically to a production environment. By integrating frequent builds and automated testing throughout the development process, developers can catch problems earlier and prevent regressions from being introduced into the application. 

## Static Analysis 
Static Analysis is a technique used to analyze code without executing it. It involves performing a series of tasks such as syntax checking, formatting validation, and potential vulnerabilities detection. The output generated by the tool shows areas of concern, including design flaws, security vulnerabilities, and logical errors. These issues must be addressed before releasing the application to production. 

## Unit Testing
Unit testing is one of the most important aspects of mobile app testing. It helps to detect bugs early in the development cycle and provide a clear picture of what has been implemented and what still needs to be done. There are two types of unit testing: Automated testing and Manual testing. Automated testing uses automation frameworks that simulate clicks, input fields, and other actions within the application under test. The purpose of this type of testing is to find coding errors, logical mistakes, and performance bottlenecks quickly. On the other hand, manual testing involves examining each feature manually and ensuring that everything works correctly. Both types of testing are essential components of mobile app testing strategy.  

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on writing automated tests first. Developers write automated tests before actually implementing anything related to the system's functionality. TDD encourages good programming principles, improves communication between developers, and reduces defects due to missing requirements. TDD can save significant amounts of time compared to traditional waterfall development methods since there is no requirement for design documents and architecture reviews before implementation starts. Using TDD can result in better designed systems that meet customer requirements faster and with fewer bugs. 

## Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA)
Quality Assurance (QA) refers to the role responsible for making sure that products meet specifications and expectations. It includes different roles involved in developing, managing, and supporting software systems' quality. QA activities include inspection, verification, and validation of software applications. While some organizations may have dedicated QA staff who focus solely on verifying software functionality and usability, others use more general roles like product owner, project manager, or line manager to support entire organizational processes.

In this section, we will walk through practical steps on how to implement various features required to improve the quality of mobile app code using Continuous Integration tools. Specifically, we will cover automated testing, static analysis, and unit testing techniques to identify issues early in the development cycle before release. We will also explore strategies for addressing these issues and improving future releases even further. Let’s get started!

## 3.1 Automated Testing
Automated testing plays an essential role in improving the quality of mobile app code. To achieve this, we need to automate functional and non-functional tests using appropriate tools and platforms. Here are the recommended steps to perform automated testing:

1. Choose the right platform for your test automation framework. Android Espresso and iOS XCUITest are popular choices for testing native mobile apps on mobile devices.
2. Set up the test infrastructure. You should provision test devices, emulators, and simulators, depending on your target platforms. Make sure that the device(s) can run your specific mobile app version. Also, make sure that the necessary drivers and dependencies are installed on your machine.
3. Write test cases. You can create separate test suites for each feature or module in your mobile app, based on the business logic and interaction flow. For example, if your mobile app offers a login screen, create a suite of test cases that validate username and password inputs. 
4. Implement test execution. Use test scripts written in your preferred scripting language to execute the test cases against your mobile app. The test scripts should trigger various actions in the mobile app, such as clicking buttons, tapping screens, swiping pages, etc., and assert whether the expected results are achieved.
5. Integrate with build pipeline. Configure your build servers to automatically trigger automated testing whenever a change is committed to the source code repository. Include the test results alongside the app binary file to facilitate post-mortem debugging and troubleshooting.
6. Monitor test results. Ensure that the test results are consistent across all environments and that failures are detected promptly. Identify any intermittent failures and address them appropriately.

Once automated testing is enabled, developers can easily identify regression issues and fixes them rapidly. By automating test cases, you can reduce the amount of manual testing needed, thereby reducing overall testing costs and enabling quicker turnaround times.

### Sample Java Test Case
Here is a sample JUnit test case for validating username and password inputs in a Login Screen of a mobile app:

```java
public class LoginScreenTest {

@Rule
public ActivityTestRule<LoginActivity> activityRule =
new ActivityTestRule<>(LoginActivity.class);

@Before
public void setUp() throws InterruptedException {
Thread.sleep(10000); // wait for emulator to boot
}

@Test
public void testValidUsernamePasswordInput() throws Exception {

onView(withId(R.id.username)).perform(typeText("testuser"));
onView(withId(R.id.password)).perform(typeText("testpass"));
onView(allOf(instanceOf(Button.class),
withParent(withId(R.id.login_button)))).perform(click());

intended(hasComponent(HomeScreen.class.getName()));
}

@After
public void tearDown() {
closeSoftKeyboard();
}
}
```

This test case consists of three sections: setup, test case execution, and teardown. The `setUp()` method waits for the emulator to finish booting, allowing the test case to begin execution. Then, the `@Test` annotation defines a single test scenario that validates a valid username and password combination. After pressing the "Log In" button, the test verifies that the Home Screen component is launched. The `tearDown()` method closes the keyboard after running the test case.

To execute this test case, follow the standard procedure for running JUnit tests in your IDE or build script. The results will show either PASS or FAIL status, indicating whether the test passed or failed. Failed test scenarios can be debugged to pinpoint the root cause of failure.


## 3.2 Static Analysis
Static Analysis involves analyzing code without executing it. It helps to detect common coding errors, poor coding style, design flaws, and security vulnerabilities. Popular tools for static analysis include Checkstyle, Findbugs, PMD, Lint, and SonarQube. They allow developers to catch coding errors before runtime and improve code quality. 

Here are the recommended steps to enable static analysis in your mobile app development lifecycle:

1. Install the plugin in your favorite IDE or text editor.
2. Create rule sets for your project according to the guidelines provided by your team. These rules should cover common coding errors, bad practices, and security vulnerabilities.
3. Run the analysis periodically, especially before submitting a pull request.
4. Fix any identified issues before merging code changes into the master branch.
5. Regularly review and update the rule sets based on the findings from the recent scan.

By enforcing coding conventions and using static analysis tools, you can reduce technical debt, increase code quality, and eliminate many bugs. With proper enforcement of coding standards, you can avoid common pitfalls and simplify collaboration among developers.

### Example Lint Rule Configuration File
Here is an example of a lint configuration file with basic settings for a typical mobile app project:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<lint>
<issue id="HardcodedText">
<!-- Disable lint warning about hard-coding strings -->
<ignore path="res/*/values/*.xml"/>
</issue>
<issue id="UnusedAttribute">
<!-- Ignore unused attribute warnings in XML layouts -->
<ignore regexp="\w+:drawable="@dimen/\w+" />
<ignore regexp="\w+:src="@drawable/\w+" />
</issue>
<issue id="MissingPrefixResource">
<!-- Ignore resources not prefixed with 'app_' -->
<ignore name="**/values-*/**/*.xml" />
<ignore name="**/*notimportant.xml" />
</issue>
<issue id="ButtonStyle">
<!-- Disable View convention violations when using AppCompat widgets -->
<ignore regexp="[^\.]*Button.*"/>
</issue>
</lint>
```

This file disables certain lint warnings about hardcoded string literals, unused attributes in layout files, resource naming prefixes, and view styling conventions. Other options available in the lint configuration file allow you to fine-tune the behavior of the linter. When adding additional libraries or modules to your project, you may need to adjust the rule set accordingly.

You can customize the severity levels of individual rules as well, giving developers flexibility in selecting the strictness level for different types of issues. For example, you might want to treat missing prefix warnings as errors instead of warnings. Similarly, you may choose to disable certain classes of warnings altogether.

Once the rule set is configured, you can launch the analysis manually or schedule it as part of your build pipeline. Whenever new code is checked in or submitted for review, the analyzer scans the affected files and generates a report with any found issues. You can examine the report and resolve any reported issues before merging the code changes back into the master branch.

## 3.3 Unit Testing
Unit Testing is one of the most critical parts of mobile app testing strategy. It helps to detect bugs early in the development cycle and provide a clear picture of what has been implemented and what still needs to be done. There are two types of unit testing: Automated testing and Manual testing. Automated testing uses automation frameworks that simulate clicks, input fields, and other actions within the application under test. The purpose of this type of testing is to find coding errors, logical mistakes, and performance bottlenecks quickly. On the other hand, manual testing involves examining each feature manually and ensuring that everything works correctly. Both types of testing are essential components of mobile app testing strategy.

### What Is A Unit?
A unit is the smallest independent piece of code that can be tested independently. Often, a unit refers to a function, a class, or a module. Units are usually small enough to fit within a programmer’s working memory, manageable in a short period of time, and isolated from other units. Good unit testing involves breaking down large components into smaller pieces, mocking external dependencies, and testing edge cases. Additionally, automated testing tools often require unit tests to run fast, meaning they should minimize the number of tests executed and the duration of each test case. The ideal unit size depends on factors such as complexity, speed of execution, and availability of test data.

#### How Do I Structure My Tests?
When structuring your unit tests, keep the following considerations in mind:

1. **Focus:** Keep your test cases focused on testing one thing at a time. Avoid unnecessary interactions with the rest of the system and focus only on the portion of the code that is currently under test. This makes your tests easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
2. **Coverage:** Try to cover all possible outcomes for a given action or input. Don't hesitate to add extra test cases if a certain outcome cannot be triggered easily. Focus on corner cases and boundary conditions to catch unexpected behaviors.
3. **Naming Conventions:** Naming your tests clearly and concisely can significantly improve readability and clarity of your code. Follow a standardized format that describes the objects under test, the action performed, and the expected results.
4. **Data Driven:** Instead of repeating the same set of test cases with minor variations, try to use data driven testing. Data driven testing allows you to define groups of similar test cases that share the same inputs and outputs. This saves time and avoids redundancy.

Here are examples of simple unit tests:

```java
// Test case for a trivial math operation
@Test
public void testGetAverage() {
assertEquals(getAverage(new int[]{1, 2, 3}), 2);
}

// Test case for calculating Fibonacci numbers
@Test
public void testGetFibonacciSequence() {
assertArrayEquals(getFibonacciSequence(7), new int[]{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5});
}
```

These tests cover a range of functions and algorithms used in the mobile app. More complex operations can be tested in larger test suites organized around individual components or features of the mobile app.

#### Mocking Dependencies
Mobile app code often interacts with third party APIs or services to retrieve or store data. Mocking dependencies ensures that your unit tests do not depend on external resources and behave consistently regardless of network connectivity or response time. Some approaches for mocking dependencies include:

1. **Stubbing:** Stubbing replaces real dependencies with fakes, usually implemented as lightweight implementations that return fixed values or throw exceptions. This approach enables you to isolate your unit tests from outside factors and exercise the core functionality of your code.
2. **Mocking:** Mocking creates fake instances of interfaces or classes that record calls to its methods and can specify the desired behavior of those calls. This approach enables you to test complex workflows and indirect interactions between your units.
3. **Faking:** Faking creates simplified versions of actual hardware or software components that produce predetermined responses to requests. This approach simplifies integration testing and eliminates the need for real devices or cloud resources during testing.

#### Coverage Metrics
Testing coverage measures how much of your codebase is covered by your test cases. There are several ways to measure code coverage:

1. **Line Coverage**: Measures the percentage of lines of code executed by your test cases. Higher percentages indicate better test coverage.
2. **Branch Coverage**: Measures the percentage of branches (such as decision points) in your code executed by your test cases. Lower percentages indicate incomplete or inconsistent test cases.
3. **Mutation Testing**: Mutation testing involves modifying your code randomly and testing the effect on your tests. An increased mutation score indicates untested code paths and suggests refactoring opportunities.

Overall, higher test coverage results in greater confidence in your mobile app code, reduced bug risk, and improved stability. Following best practices like test-driven development can help ensure that your code base remains clean, reliable, and easy to maintain.
