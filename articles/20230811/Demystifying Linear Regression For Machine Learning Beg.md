Linear regression is one of the most commonly used statistical techniques in machine learning for predicting continuous variables based on input features. It can be useful in various applications such as forecasting, prediction, and trend analysis. In this article, we will learn about linear regression from a mathematical perspective, how it works, and why it’s important to understand its fundamental principles before applying them to real-world problems. We'll also use Python programming language to implement simple linear regression algorithm to demonstrate its working mechanism.

Before moving forward, let's discuss some basic concepts and terminology that are essential to understanding the topic better:

1. Linear Relationship: A relationship between two or more variables is called linear if there exists a straight line (a one-dimensional curve) that passes through all points with equal intervals along both axes (independent and dependent variable). Mathematically, we say that a set of points {x1, x2,..., xi} are linearly related to another set of points {y1, y2,..., yi} when there exist real numbers β0, β1,..., bni that satisfy the equation: 

yi = β0 + β1*xi + εi

where εi denotes the error term associated with each point. 

2. Simple Linear Regression: Simple linear regression is an approach to find a best fit line that explains the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable. The goal is to establish a linear relationship between these variables by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the actual and predicted values.

3. Slope and Intercept: The slope of a line can be defined as the change in the dependent variable per unit change in the independent variable. On the other hand, the intercept represents the value of the dependent variable at which the line intersects the y-axis. 

Now that you have learned about these basic concepts and terminologies, let’s dive into the detailed explanation of simple linear regression and see what happens underneath the hood. 
# 2. Core Concepts
## 2.1 Data Preparation
The first step in implementing any machine learning algorithm is to prepare the data appropriately. In case of simple linear regression, we need to ensure that our dataset contains only numeric data without missing values. Let’s consider an example: Suppose we want to build a model to predict sales based on advertising budget. Our dataset might look something like this:

| Advertising Budget | Sales |
|--------------------|-------|
|    $10k            |  500  |
|    $15k            |  750  |
|    $20k            | 1000  |
|    $25k            | 1250  |
|    $30k            | 1500  |

In order to apply linear regression to this problem, we need to convert the ‘Advertising Budget’ feature into numerical format using one-hot encoding technique since this feature has categorical nature. After preparing the dataset, our final table would look something like this:


| Advertising Budget_10k | Advertising Budget_15k | Advertising Budget_20k | Advertising Budget_25k | Advertising Budget_30k | Sales |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
|              1          |               0         |                0        |                0       |                 0      | 500   |
|              0          |               1         |                0        |                0       |                 0      | 750   |
|              0          |               0         |                1        |                0       |                 0      | 1000  |
|              0          |               0         |                0        |                1       |                 0      | 1250  |
|              0          |               0         |                0        |                0       |                 1      | 1500  |

Note that the advertisement budget column is now splitted into multiple columns representing different categories. Each row now represent a unique observation with corresponding independent and dependent variable pairs. This is the standard practice for handling categorical variables in linear models.  

After performing this step, we are ready to proceed with training our linear regression model. 

## 2.2 Algorithm Overview
Simple linear regression uses a least squares approach to estimate the coefficients β0 and β1 that minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Start by randomly initializing β0 and β1 with small random values.
2. Use the formula for linear regression to calculate the predicted value for every observation i:

pred_i = β0 + β1 * x_i

3. Calculate the difference between the predicted and actual value for each observation i:

diff_i = pred_i - y_i

4. Find the mean of the differences:

mean_diff = sum(diff_i)/n

5. Update the coefficients β0 and β1 using gradient descent rule:

β0 := β0 - alpha * mean_diff
β1 := β1 - alpha * dot_product(mean_diff, xi) / n

6. Repeat steps 2-5 until convergence, which means the updates to β0 and β1 become smaller than a certain threshold.

where:
* alpha: The learning rate parameter controls the size of the update step taken during gradient descent.
* n: Number of observations in the dataset.
* xi: Independent variable for observation i.

We can further simplify the above process by rearranging the formula for calculating gradients and updating the parameters. Instead of computing the mean of differences separately, we can compute their average directly while taking care of bias terms. Finally, the iteration stops when the absolute change in the loss function becomes very small, indicating convergence.

## 2.3 Loss Function
To measure the performance of the model, we need to define a metric that quantifies the degree of discrepancy between the predictions and the true values. One common choice is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which computes the square root of the average squared deviation between the predicted and actual values divided by the number of samples in the dataset. Therefore, a lower RMSE indicates better accuracy in making predictions.

In addition to RMSE, we can also use the R-squared score, which measures the proportion of variance explained by the model. Specifically, R-squared tells us how much of the variation in the outcome variable is explained by changes in the predictor variable(s). When R-squared increases, we expect the model to perform better, especially if the increase is significant compared to the overall variability of the outcome variable. However, it’s not always possible to achieve perfect R-squared, so the score cannot truly capture the quality of the model. Nevertheless, R-squared gives us an idea of how well the model fits the data.

It's worth noting that even though simple linear regression may seem like a simple concept, it takes many iterations and tuning of hyperparameters to converge towards optimal solution. Understanding the underlying mathematics behind linear regression is critical in ensuring efficient and accurate results.
