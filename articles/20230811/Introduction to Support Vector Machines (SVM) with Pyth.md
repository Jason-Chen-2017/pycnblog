# 1.简介
         

Support vector machines (SVMs), short for support vectors, are supervised learning models that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. SVMs are powerful classifiers in machine learning because they find a hyperplane between the data points where it is possible to separate them into two groups or classes of objects based on their features. The key idea behind SVMs is that if we plot all the data points together, then any straight line that goes through most of these points will also go through the middle point of separation. This means that SVMs try to maximize this margin as much as possible by moving the hyperplane from one side to another until there is no more misclassification. We can use different kernels such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid, etc., to transform our data before finding the best separating hyperplane.

In this article, we will learn about how to implement Support Vector Machine Algorithm in Python programming language and its implementation details using Scikit-Learn Library. We will see various types of kernel functions, their mathematical formulas, usage of regularization parameters and its significance in decision boundaries, overfitting problem and its solution techniques, etc. After reading this article, you should have an understanding of how to apply SVM algorithm in your machine learning projects effectively.

By the way, I am not an expert in computer science but I always try to contribute my knowledge towards building better worlds using technology. So if you found anything wrong or want me to explain something further, feel free to ask! Just send me an email at <EMAIL> :)


# 2.相关术语及概念
## 2.1 支持向量机(Support Vector Machine, SVM)
支持向量机是一种二分类、多分类或回归模型，它在特征空间中找到一个最优分离超平面将输入空间划分为不同的区域。它与其他机器学习方法如逻辑回归（Logistic Regression）、神经网络（Neural Networks）等不同之处在于，其不仅可以看做是一个分类器，还可以用来进行预测。SVM解决的问题就是如何在高维空间中找到一个最好的划分超平面，使得样本点到超平面的距离最大化。支持向量机通常用于处理高度非线性的情形，并且它可以有效地实现类别间的数据分布模糊、分类性能不稳定和小样本下的泛化能力。

## 2.2 线性支持向量机(Linear Support Vector Machine, Lasso)
Lasso是一种线性的支持向量机，又称为最小绝对值回归（Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator）。其基本思想是在求解训练误差和测试误差之前加入一个正则项，使得参数估计变得更加稀疏。

对于给定的输入变量X和输出变量Y，Lasso通过使某些参数估计为零而产生稀疏解，因此Lasso可以作为特征选择的一种方法。Lasso的目标函数如下：


其中，λ是正则化参数，即控制模型复杂度的参数。由上图可知，当λ取0时，Lasso退化成普通最小二乘法，此时无惩罚项。λ越大，表示模型越简单。Lasso参数估计会得到稀疏解，即估计结果仅包含几个重要的参数。

## 2.3 核技巧（Kernel Trick）
核技巧是利用核函数将非线性数据集映射到高维空间，从而可以应用线性SVM算法。核函数是一个定义在特征空间中的实值函数，接受两个相同维度的向量作为输入，返回一个标量值作为输出。通过核技巧，我们可以将原始低维不可分的数据集，转化为高维线性可分的数据集，从而获得线性SVM算法的效果。

核函数有很多种类型，常用的有如下几种：

1.线性核函数：即计算内积，公式如下：

k(x,y)=x^Ty

2.多项式核函数：将特征空间中的向量映射到高维空间，通过求解特征组合的系数来构造新的特征，再用线性核函数计算内积。公式如下：

k(x,y)=(gamma*<x,y>)^(d+1)

3.径向基函数（Radial Basis Function, RBF）核函数：采用径向基函数（Radial Basis Function），也叫高斯核函数，其表达式如下：

k(x,y)=exp(-gamma|x-y|^2)

4. sigmoid核函数：将径向基函数映射到sigmoid函数，因此也可以被视作径向基函数的变体。公式如下：

k(x,y)=tanh(gamma*<x,y> + r)

## 2.4 感知机（Perceptron）
感知机是1957年Rosenblatt提出的神经网络模型。感知机是一种基于人脑神经元工作方式的线性分类模型，它的特点是在输入空间上的线性决策边界。其基本假设是对输入实例点进行分类，属于正类的实例点的输出记为1，属于负类的实例点的输出记为-1。其输出规则如下：


如果输出值为1，则输入实例点属于正类；若输出值为-1，则输入实例点属于负类。感知机学习算法的目标是学习出一个权重向量w，使得输入实例点的输出与期望的标签完全一致。

# 3.算法原理
Support Vector Machine is a popular classification method that uses a hyperplane to divide the feature space into classes. It works well when we have clear boundaries between different classes. However, when the boundary is complex, the results may not be very accurate. To make predictions, we need to calculate the distance of each sample point from the decision boundary and assign it to the class which has the maximum distance value. 

The following figure shows the working principles of SVM:




1. Firstly, we train the model using labeled dataset of input instances along with their corresponding output labels.
2. Then, we choose a hyperplane that splits the feature space into two parts called “support vectors” and “margin”. 
3. Next, we select the best hyperplane among many possible ones by tuning the parameter values using optimization algorithms like gradient descent. 
4. Finally, we predict the label of new unseen test instances by calculating the distances from the test instance to the decision boundary. If the distance is less than some threshold value, we classify the instance as positive, otherwise negative.

Now let’s understand the working of Linear SVM with Kernel trick.

## 3.1 Linear SVM without Kernel Trick
For the linear case, the equation of the hyperplane becomes:

```
w = argmin || w|| 
− yi (xi • w)   i=1…n
```

where `w` is the normal vector to the decision surface that maximizes the margin around the support vectors. In order to solve this problem, we introduce slack variables ξij that allow some violations of the margin constraint. Intuitively, the larger ξij is, the greater the violation allowed and hence the smaller the margin. The optimized objective function with slack variables is given below:

```
min   0.5 ||w||² 
s.t.   yi(xi•w) ≥ 1 - ξi 
ξi ≥ 0, i = 1... n
```

This optimization problem can be solved using quadratic programming solvers like CVXOPT or gurobipy libraries. Once the optimal weights are obtained, the decision boundary can be calculated using the following formula:

```
sign(w • x) = 1, if w • x > 0
sign(w • x) = -1, else
```

where x denotes a new testing instance.

## 3.2 Linear SVM with Kernel Trick
When dealing with non-linear problems, we can map the data into higher dimensional space using the help of kernel functions. One approach is to use the dot product of the original input vectors mapped into higher dimension space instead of computing the inner product directly. The resulting high-dimensional representation makes it easier to separate the data using the hyperplane in the transformed space. The generalized version of the dot product can be written as follows:

```
K(x, y) = ρ(x)^T ρ(y)
```

Here rho() is a kernel mapping function. A commonly used kernel is the Gaussian Radial Bias Function (RBF). When applying the kernel trick to the linear SVM problem, we change the inner product operator from • to K(). For example, for a training instance xi with label yi, the weight vector can be updated using the formula:

```
w = argmin ||w|| 
−yi[K(xi, xj) * (xj • w)]   j=1..m  
```

Similar to the previous formulation, we add some additional constraints to ensure that all instances are correctly classified and within the margin of error. The final formulated linear SVM with kernel trick looks like:

```
min    0.5 ||w||² 
s.t.   yi[K(xi, xj)*wj] >= 1 + (wj • xi)-ξi 
ξi >= 0, i=1..n
```

Once again, solving this optimization problem requires minimizing a convex quadratic function subject to certain linear constraints. There are several existing optimization libraries in Python that provide ready-to-use interfaces to perform the required computations efficiently. Here's a code snippet using sklearn library to demonstrate the above steps:
