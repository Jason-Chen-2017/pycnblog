Lasso regression is a regularization technique that involves shrinking the coefficient of certain variables to zero during model training and thus helps in reducing the complexity of the model. It has been used extensively for feature selection and data preprocessing tasks as it can eliminate irrelevant or redundant features while retaining only those features that contribute significantly towards the prediction outcomes. The Lasso penalty adds an additional cost term that represents the sum of absolute values of the coefficients being shrunk to zero, which forces them to be smaller than some threshold value $\lambda$. Therefore, the optimization problem becomes minimizing the objective function:

$$ \underset{\beta}{\text{minimize}}
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\beta^Tx_i)^2+\lambda ||\beta||_1 $$

where $X$ is the design matrix containing input features and output variable, $Y$ is the target vector, $\beta$ are the parameters to be learned by our algorithm, $x_i$ and $y_i$ denote the i-th row of $X$ and $Y$, respectively, and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the Lasso penalty.

In this article, we will go through the basic concepts, terminologies, and operations involved with Lasso Regression, including how to implement it using Python libraries like scikit-learn and statsmodels. We will also explore its advantages over other linear models such as ordinary least squares (OLS), ridge regression, and elastic net and compare their performance on various datasets. In the second part of this series, we will discuss ways to handle multicollinearity issues and apply Lasso Regression in a real-world scenario where we need to predict the response variable based on multiple predictor variables and select the most relevant ones accordingly. 

Before we start, let's understand why and when should one use Lasso Regression? To answer this question, let’s first consider OLS and Ridge Regression. Both these techniques try to minimize the error between predicted values and actual values given a set of independent variables. However, they have different approaches to achieve this goal:

1. **Ordinary Least Squares**: This method tries to fit a line through the data points, but at the same time tries to minimize the errors between the fitted line and the original data points along all possible lines. Thus, it does not take into account any prior knowledge about the underlying relationships present within the data.
2. **Ridge Regression**: This method adds a small amount of bias to the OLS estimate of the parameter estimates. It tries to reduce the variance of the estimate so that the estimated coefficients do not change too much across different samples or runs of the algorithm. On the other hand, it puts more emphasis on the overall smoothness of the relationship rather than individual data points.

The main difference between OLS and Ridge Regression lies in the presence or absence of a penalty term added to the loss function. While Ridge Regression imposes a penalty term on all the coefficients, Lasso Regression restricts the effectiveness of the penalty to only a few selected variables. For example, if there are many variables in a dataset, adding the Lasso penalty may cause some variables to drop out altogether without having enough impact on the final outcome.

Finally, it is worth noting that Elastic Net is another popular technique that combines both the Ridge and Lasso penalties to obtain a balanced combination of goodness-of-fit and sparsity. Its primary advantage over the Lasso is that it can effectively control the balance between these two effects, whereas the Ridge tends to produce results with reduced variance even though it can lead to unimportant variables dropping out completely.

With this overview, we now move on to discussing the mathematical details behind Lasso Regression. Let us begin by understanding what the symbol “∥β∥₁” means.
