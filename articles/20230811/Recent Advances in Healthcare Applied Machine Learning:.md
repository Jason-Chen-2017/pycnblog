The field of healthcare appliied machine learning (HAM) is an emerging field that aims to develop intelligent algorithms to improve the quality of human care by analyzing medical data. In recent years, there have been many breakthroughs in various areas of HAM research such as diagnosis prediction, treatment recommendation, drug dosing, etc., with applications in fields such as medicine, dentistry, nursing, orthopedics, etc. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the most recent advances in HAM research from both academia and industry, highlighting their current status and future directions. We will first discuss the basic concepts and terminologies used in HAM, followed by detailed explanations on key algorithmic principles and mathematical formulations. Finally, we will illustrate how these principles can be implemented using popular programming languages such as Python and R. Specifically, we will use publicly available datasets and code implementations to demonstrate the practical application of each methodology. This paper also includes a brief discussion of open-source software development models for HAM, including the importance of open access datasets and collaborative coding environments. Overall, our goal is to contribute valuable insights into the current state of HAM research and guide future research efforts towards realizing significant improvements in patient outcomes through better understanding of disease symptoms and treatments. 

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminologies
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding massive amounts of training data to machines, allowing them to identify patterns and make predictions about new data instances. In the context of HAM, machine learning methods are applied to analyze medical data to produce useful insights, which can help doctors make better decisions and manage patients more effectively. Here are some important terms and concepts related to HAM:

1. Data: Medical data refers to any information collected during medical procedures that is relevant to improving health outcomes. These data include demographics, laboratory tests, clinical notes, imaging results, vital signs, prescription records, surgical reports, hospital records, etc. The amount and complexity of data has increased significantly over the past decades due to the need for better diagnostic tools, improved therapy, and faster diagnoses. Therefore, it becomes essential to utilize advanced techniques like data analysis, mining, and modeling to extract actionable insights from large quantities of data.

2. Label: A label is a piece of information associated with a data instance that indicates its true classification or value. For example, if we want to train a model to recognize different types of tumors, we would need labeled examples of healthy and unhealthy tissue samples. Similarly, in HAM, labels indicate the presence or absence of certain diseases or abnormal conditions at a given time point, which allows us to create predictive models based on patient behavior or medical history. 

3. Feature: A feature is an individual attribute or property of a dataset that influences the outcome variable. For example, when classifying skin cancer, we might consider different features like cell size, cell shape, texture, margin, area, nuclei, and glandular pattern. Features are extracted from raw data before training a machine learning model, and they may involve complex transformations and aggregations of existing variables. 

4. Model: A model represents a hypothesis function that maps input features to output labels. When developing models in HAM, we typically start with domain expertise and iterate over multiple iterations of experimentation and refinement until the performance metrics meet our expectations. Once a suitable model architecture is determined, we fit it to the training data and evaluate its accuracy on a validation set. Based on the evaluation results, we tweak the model parameters and repeat the process until convergence. During inference, we apply the trained model to new data instances to obtain predicted labels or probabilities.

5. Training: The process of fitting a machine learning model to a dataset involves adjusting its internal weights or parameters so that it produces accurate predictions on new data instances. During training, we minimize the error between predicted values and actual values by adjusting the parameters of the model using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.

6. Validation: Validation is the process of evaluating the performance of a model on a separate dataset that was not seen during training. It helps detect overfitting, where a model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, previously unseen data. To perform validation, we hold out part of the training data and use it to evaluate the model's generalization ability on new data.

7. Testing: After obtaining a high level of confidence in the model's performance, we test it on a final testing set to estimate its robustness to changes in the real world. By doing this, we ensure that the model accurately reflects the performance of humans in real-world settings, which could lead to better clinical decision-making.

8. Hyperparameters: Hyperparameters are configuration options that control the training process of a machine learning model, such as the choice of learning rate, regularization strength, batch size, optimizer, activation function, number of hidden layers, etc. Hyperparameter tuning is necessary to achieve optimal performance of the model, and it often requires a combination of trial-and-error experiments and grid search strategies.

9. Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, resulting in suboptimal performance on new, previously unseen data. It happens when a model learns the idiosyncrasies of the training data instead of capturing the underlying patterns that generalize well to new data. To prevent overfitting, we split the original dataset into two parts - a larger training set and a smaller validation set - and use the former to optimize the model hyperparameters while monitoring the latter's performance.

10. Underfitting: Underfitting occurs when a model cannot capture the relationships among the input features and the target variable well enough to make accurate predictions. Underfitting usually happens when a model does not have enough capacity to represent all possible functions that map inputs to outputs. To address underfitting, we can try increasing the capacity of the model (e.g., adding additional hidden layers or changing the architecture of the network), selecting different architectures or loss functions, or introducing regularization techniques such as L2 or dropout.

# 3.Key Algorithmic Principles and Mathematical Formulations
In this section, we will explore several fundamental ideas in HAM that have had major impacts on recent progress. We begin by looking at three fundamental problems in HAM: diagnosis prediction, treatment recommendation, and drug dosing. Each problem addresses a specific challenge faced by modern healthcare organizations. We then present four main ideas behind each of these problems, along with mathematical formulations and practical implementation details using popular programming languages. 

1. Diagnosis Prediction: Diagnosis prediction is the task of identifying the cause of a disease based on patient symptoms. Traditional approaches to diagnosis prediction rely on rules-based systems that examine longitudinal histories of patients' medical records, physical examination findings, lab results, and routine observations. However, these methods suffer from low accuracy, lack interpretability, and scalability. One approach to solve this challenge is to leverage big data sources and deep neural networks, which can automatically analyze large volumes of medical data and generate informative disease profiles.

2. Treatment Recommendation: Treatment recommendation is the task of suggesting personalized medicines or procedures to patients based on their prior medical history, lifestyle, and risk factors. Despite widespread interest in automated treatment recommendation, few researches have focused on developing effective models that integrate heterogeneous data sources, such as electronic health record data, genetics data, social media interactions, and mobile phone sensor data. A promising solution is to adopt reinforcement learning techniques to jointly optimize patient preferences, side effects, compliance rates, and cost savings across multiple datasets. 

3. Drug Dosing: Drug dosing is the process of administering medicines to patients at appropriate intervals according to their needs and tolerance levels. While traditional pharmacokinetic dosing protocols based on fixed time points or continuous infusion have shown good efficacy, more flexible dosing regimens such as IV infusion with dynamic bolus sizes offer richer representations of patients' responses and better control over dosage. A novel approach to design efficient dosing protocols is to incorporate feedback mechanisms into dosing strategies, such as continual monitoring and self-adaptive policies.

4. Personalized Medicine Delivery: Patient-specific medicine delivery systems aim to adaptively deliver personalized medicines to individual patients based on their physiological and psychological states, safety concerns, or fitness goals. Currently, there are a few studies focusing on leveraging mobile sensor data, eye tracking data, and text messages to develop personalized medicine delivery solutions. A feasible strategy is to leverage causal graph reasoning and machine learning techniques to infer patient preferences and behaviors, and to select the best medicine delivery strategy that balances patient satisfaction and medicine effectiveness.

Based on the above four topics, we now turn to explain the mathematical formulation and practical implementation of each idea using Python and R. Note that the exact technical details vary depending on the programming language and dataset used.

### 3.1 Diagnosis Prediction
Diagnosis prediction is a binary classification task that takes medical records and symptoms as input, and outputs whether the patient has the disease or not. Let X = {x1, x2,..., xi}, where xi is a sample representing one visit to the hospital. The input symptoms are denoted Y = {y1, y2,..., yn}, where yj is either positive or negative indicating the severity level of j-th symptom. The goal is to predict P(yi=1 | xi, Y) for every i in X, indicating the probability of having each disease given the symptoms at that visit.

To build a diagnosis prediction model, we follow the following steps:

1. Collect and preprocess data: First, we collect a large volume of medical records containing symptoms, demographic information, and other diagnostic markers. Then, we preprocess the data by cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, standardizing numerical variables, and generating synthetic features derived from existing ones.

2. Select features: Next, we choose relevant features for prediction. Some common features for diagnosis prediction include age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, family history, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and education level. Other features may be computed directly from the medical records or indirectly inferred from external data sources, such as DNA sequencing or microbiological markers.

3. Split data: Before building a machine learning model, we randomly partition the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set consists of 70% of the total data, the validation set consists of 15%, and the testing set consists of 15%. We keep the same proportion of positive and negative cases in each set to avoid biased sampling.

4. Train model: With the selected features and partitions, we train a deep neural network classifier using a variety of algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and convolutional neural networks. We use early stopping techniques to monitor the validation loss and stop training when it stops reducing.

5. Evaluate model: Once the model is trained, we evaluate its performance on the testing set using commonly used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. We tune the threshold of the binary predictor by comparing the false positive rate and true positive rate at different thresholds, and report the confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve.

Here is an example code implementation using Python and Keras library for diagnosis prediction:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

np.random.seed(0) # fix seed for reproducibility

# load data
X =... # list of medical records
Y =... # list of symptoms and their severities

# preprocessing step 1: remove missing values
X = [x[~np.isnan(x)] for x in X]

# preprocessing step 2: encode categorical variables
for i in range(len(X)):
X[i][:, cat_cols] = encoder.transform(X[i][:, cat_cols])

# preprocessing step 3: standardize numerical variables
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)
X = scaler.transform(X)

# generate synthetic features
for i in range(len(X)):
X[i] = add_synthetic_features(X[i],...)

# split data into training, validation, and testing sets
kfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=0)
train_idx, val_idx, test_idx = [], [], []
for i, (_, idx) in enumerate(kfold.split(X, Y)):
train_idx.append(idx[:int(len(idx)*0.7)])
val_idx.append(idx[int(len(idx)*0.7):int(len(idx)*0.85)])
test_idx.append(idx[int(len(idx)*0.85):])

# define neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=32, activation='relu', input_dim=num_features))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(units=16, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))

# compile model with binary crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
optimizer='adam')

# train model with early stopping
best_val_auc = float('-inf')
for epoch in range(100):
for fold in range(5):
model.fit(X[train_idx[fold]], 
Y[train_idx[fold]],
epochs=1,
batch_size=64,
verbose=False,
callbacks=[EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3)],
validation_data=(X[val_idx[fold]],
Y[val_idx[fold]]))

# evaluate model on validation set
proba = model.predict([X[v] for v in val_idx]).flatten()
auc = roc_auc_score(Y[test_idx].ravel(), proba)

# update best validation AUC
if auc > best_val_auc:
best_val_auc = auc
best_proba = proba

# evaluate model on testing set with optimized threshold
threshold = np.mean(best_proba)
fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(Y[test_idx].ravel(), best_proba)
print('AUC:', auc)
print('Threshold:', threshold)
print('TPR:', tpr[np.argmin(abs(fpr + (1-tpr)/2 - threshold))] * 100)
print('FPR:', fpr[np.argmin(abs(fpr + (1-tpr)/2 - threshold))] * 100)
confusion_matrix(Y[test_idx].ravel(), best_proba >= threshold)
```

This code implements a simple neural network with two hidden layers and dropout regularization for diagnosis prediction. It uses k-fold cross-validation and early stopping to prevent overfitting. The `roc_auc_score` metric is used to calculate the area under the ROC curve, and the threshold that maximizes balanced sensitivity and specificity is chosen for evaluation.
