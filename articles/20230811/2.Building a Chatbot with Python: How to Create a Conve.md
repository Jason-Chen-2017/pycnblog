Chatbots are emerging as the next big trend in modern technologies. The use of chatbots has revolutionized various businesses such as banking, e-commerce, travel, food delivery, and many others. With an increasing interest around Chatbots, more and more companies are looking for skilled developers who can develop these bots using Natural Language Processing techniques. However, building a chatbot requires expertise in both machine learning algorithms and programming languages like Python or JavaScript. This article will guide you on how to create a conversational AI bot using Google’s Dialogflow NLP platform and Flask web framework in Python. In this article we will be creating a simple chatbot that can answer basic questions about movies. 

Let's get started!

## 2.1 Introduction 
The purpose of this article is to provide detailed information on how to build a conversational AI bot using Google’s Dialogflow NLP platform and Flask web framework in Python. We will also cover step by step tutorials on implementing each component of our chatbot including training data creation, webhook configuration, intent creation, fulfillment setup, API integration, and testing. At the end, we will discuss some of the challenges faced while developing the chatbot, and future improvements we could make. By following this tutorial, readers should gain insights into the process of building a chatbot from scratch.

Before starting this project, it is essential to have a good understanding of the basic concepts of Dialogflow and Flask frameworks. If you don't know what they are, feel free to read up their official documentation first. 

Dialogflow is a natural language processing tool developed by Google that allows us to design and train chatbots without having to worry too much about backend infrastructure. It offers an intuitive interface where we can easily model conversations between users and the chatbot, handle user input, integrate APIs, and customize responses. We can even train our chatbot to recognize different entities like movies, actors, genres, etc., making it even smarter.

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python which simplifies the development of web applications. It provides a lightweight, flexible way to create web applications based on HTTP requests and response objects. For example, when a client makes a request to our server through a URL, Flask will route the request to the appropriate function and send back its response. Flask has many built-in features that help simplify common tasks like routing and managing sessions. You can find more information about Flask at http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/.

## 2.2 Terms and Definitions 

We will now define some terms and definitions that may not be familiar to most readers:

- Intent: An action or task that the chatbot should perform. When users ask a question to the chatbot, the text they enter will be classified into one or multiple Intents depending on the context in which it appears. For instance, if someone asks “What movie do you recommend?”, there might be multiple Intents matching different parts of the sentence, such as “RecommendMovie” or “WhatAboutMovies”. 

- Training Data: A set of sample sentences that illustrate specific examples of human conversation along with expected outputs. These samples will be used by Dialogflow to learn patterns and correlations between user inputs and expected outputs, allowing the chatbot to understand and respond appropriately.

- Entity: Another term related to Intent recognition that refers to any type of meaningful object or concept mentioned in the dialog. For instance, if a user says "I want to see a horror movie", there would be two possible Intents but only one entity present - Horror Movie.

To summarize, the main components required to create a chatbot using Dialogflow and Flask include Intent recognition, training data, entity recognition, fulfillment, API integrations, and more. Let's move on to setting up our environment and installing necessary libraries.
