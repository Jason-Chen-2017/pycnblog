“Self-learner”这个词汇，可能是在你们看来并不陌生。尽管我知道它代表着一种新鲜感、冒险精神，但是我还是不免感到困惑。因为在英文中，self-learning通常被译作自学，但是却很少用作翻译。因为我认为更准确的翻译应该是“independent learner”，或者甚至更简单直接的“learn by doing”。意思就是说，独立的学习者。其含义可以概括为从零开始，无须依赖他人的指导和帮助。因此，这种学习方式也被称作自助学习或自学学习。不仅如此，自学还包括自创造性、自主决定自己学习哪些知识和技能。
那么，什么是“Professional coach”呢？它代表的是具备相关职业经验、良好沟通能力、协调能力、团队精神的教练型个人。在工作中，每个人都可以成为优秀的教练。许多成功的企业家、科学家、工程师等，都是由优秀的教练带领着他们走向成就。事实上，教练型个人的出现，是为了满足日益增长的竞争压力。目前，越来越多的年轻人选择了专业教练，而非自学。然而，对于刚刚起步的学生来说，如何做出正确的选择，仍是一个难题。在本文中，我将阐述两者之间的区别、优劣势，并且给出一些适合自学的资源、方法和建议，以帮助你更好地选择自己的人生道路。

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Leaning Techniques
Leaning techniques are a set of tools or methods used to learn things efficiently. There are many learning techniques such as spaced repetition, active recall, mind maps, flashcards, study groups, and other effective ways to learn effectively. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages based on the student’s level, interest, and ability. Some of the most commonly used leaning techniques in schools include:

1. Spaced Repetition - In this method, students repeat the same information over a period of time to reinforce their memory. This approach helps students retain what they have learned more deeply. However, it can be challenging for beginners due to cramming.

2. Active Recall - In this method, students read material multiple times before being tested on it. The goal is to remember all the key points and concepts in a short span of time. While this method is efficient, it requires careful attention to detail and focus.

3. Mind Maps - These types of diagrams represent knowledge in a visual format that allows you to connect related ideas together. It makes it easier to understand complex topics and identify connections between different subjects. You can use these mind maps to create your own personal learning plan.

4. Flashcards - These cards contain two sides: one side displays an image or text word, while the other shows its definition or meaning. Students flip through the cards and try to remember both sides correctly. This technique also helps students practice listening and speaking skills. 

5. Study Groups - These sessions involve groups of students discussing specific areas of interest with experts from various fields. By sharing experiences and insights, students gain deeper understanding and improve their problem-solving abilities. 

## 2.2 Workplace Culture
The workplace culture influences how employees interact with each other and with external stakeholders. According to Lovett & Gonzalez (2013), there are four primary workplace cultures:

1. Socializing Culture - This type of culture encourages individuals to form close relationships with colleagues, fellow employees, customers, vendors, etc., even if they may not always agree with each other. Employees often get along better with people who share similar values, views, and backgrounds.

2. Delegation Culture - This culture involves giving tasks to others without expecting immediate gratification or results. Instead, employees assume responsibility for completing assigned tasks, but they don't hold monopolies on decision making authority. The emphasis is on teamwork, rather than individual achievement.

3. Commitment Culture - This type of culture promotes high levels of commitment, which comes from years of hard work and perseverance. It means that employees feel like they can achieve anything they put their heart into. They make big efforts and invest significant resources to become better at their jobs.

4. Accountability Culture - This type of culture recognizes mistakes made by employees and takes action to correct them. Employees are held accountable for their actions and decisions, even when those actions have negative consequences. 

Overall, the workplace culture impacts employee morale, productivity, motivation, performance evaluation, salary negotiation, and trust. As companies strive towards becoming more customer-oriented, the need for a strong workplace culture becomes greater.


## 2.3 Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation metrics provide a clearer picture of the effectiveness of a course or program. When evaluating courses or programs, there are several common metrics:

1. Grade Point Average (GPA) - This metric measures the average score earned by a group of students on an assignment or exam. GPA provides only a rough estimate of actual performance, so it should never be the sole basis for assessing student success.

2. Attendance - This metric reflects whether students attend class regularly. A lower attendance rate indicates poor engagement, inattention, and distraction.

3. Completion Rate - This metric refers to the percentage of students who successfully complete an activity or task within a specified period of time. In some cases, completion rates are calculated using deadlines instead of specific targets.

4. Course Rankings - These rankings measure the overall quality of education offered by a university or college. They are important in deciding whether a candidate should continue to pursue education in a particular field or institution.

In addition to these traditional evaluation metrics, new ones are emerging, including Learner Engagement Score (LES), student retention scores, and assessment interventions. All of these metrics aim to capture individual differences and contextualize data across different contexts. 


# 3. Learning From Others: Why Professional Coaches Are Different from Self-Learners?
## 3.1 Benefits of Becoming a Profesional Coach
As stated earlier, professional coaches bring valuable experience and expertise in a wide range of domains, including business, science, engineering, healthcare, marketing, and more. Here are some benefits of becoming a profesional coach:

1. Improving Career Potential – Professional coaching offers job opportunities in a variety of industries, including finance, technology, and media. It enables individuals to advance their careers, build social capital, and increase their earning potential.

2. Enhancing Employee Safety – Providing safe working environments and training employees on ethical behavior is essential to maintaining healthy workplaces. Providing practical guidance on conflict management, discrimination, and bias prevention can help reduce harmful consequences and promote positive outcomes.

3. Developing Leadership Skills – Professional coaching gives workers real-world experience in leading teams, communicating effectively, building consensus, and negotiating difficult issues. This can lead to increased job satisfaction, recognition, and tenure.

4. Building Relationships – Personal interactions with coach peers and clients provide valuable feedback about your work. Working closely with mentors and subject matter experts can enhance your communication and problem-solving skills.

5. Preparing for Future Careers – Professional coaching can help you break down career barriers and establish your long-term goals. It can also help you discover your passions and explore new horizons. 

## 3.2 Differences Between Self-Learners and Professional Coaches
Here are some key differences between self-learners and professional coaches:

1. Training Style – Self-learners tend to seek out courses, books, and online tutorials to learn new skills and techniques. Professional coaches train students on the principles, strategies, and techniques of successful leadership.

2. Skill Level – Self-learners are typically beginners and intermediate-level learners. Professional coaches have specialized skill sets that require extensive training and experience.

3. Methodologies – Both self-learners and professional coaches follow a structured curriculum designed to deliver high-quality content over a period of time. However, professional coaches usually adhere to established models and frameworks, while self-learners may adopt a unique methodology or style.

4. Consultation Support – Professional coaches offer direct consultations and guidance throughout the process of developing a coaching plan. Self-learners may find it difficult to access guidance from experienced professionals.

5. Long-Term Commitment – Self-learners may struggle to maintain ongoing dedication after graduation. Professional coaches are committed to providing coaching services for life, ensuring that their clients remain highly motivated and focused on improving their lives.

## 3.3 Choosing Your Own Personality Type
It's crucial to choose the right personality type for your coaching journey. Personalities vary significantly depending on factors such as age, gender, family status, occupation, etc. Some recommended personality types for professional coaches include:

1. Open Mindedness – This personality type is known for assertiveness, enthusiasm, optimism, creativity, positivity, and emotional intelligence. It leads to collaborative and compassionate interactions with colleagues and clients.

2. Communication Skills – This personality type is critical in managing interpersonal conflicts, addressing objections, and building rapport. Proficiency in written and verbal communication skills is necessary for working well with staff and clients.

3. Empathy – This personality type involves understanding and caring for others' feelings and experiences. People with empathy skills learn to see beyond selfish considerations and symptoms of stress and anxiety.

4. Team Player – This personality type is suited for organizations where collaboration and teamwork are crucial. Teams with diverse perspectives and skills work better because they come up with solutions together.

5. Problem Solver – This personality type is characterized by analytical thinking, logical reasoning, problem-solving capabilities, and strategic planning. Coaches with this personality type are skilled at identifying problems, breaking them down, and solving them effectively. 

Therefore, choosing the right personality type is essential for sustaining a good relationship with your coach and setting yourself apart from competitors. Once you've identified your personality type, next steps will depend on your current learning style and desired outcome.
