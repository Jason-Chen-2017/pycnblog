Data Science (DS) is the process of extracting insights from large amounts of structured or unstructured data using various techniques such as machine learning, statistical analysis, natural language processing, etc. In this article we will focus on understanding DS problems, identifying their root causes and solving them with an example-based approach. We have selected several popular DS problems that require a thorough understanding of concepts and algorithms to solve effectively. The reader can get an idea about how to approach DS problems in general and identify suitable examples based on their level of expertise and knowledge.
Introduction
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in Data Science (DS), due to its revolutionary potential for addressing complex real-world problems. With ever-increasing amounts of data generated across industries and sectors, DS plays a crucial role in analyzing these data to extract valuable insights that can be used to improve business outcomes, develop new products or services, and optimize customer experience. However, despite significant advancements made by DS researchers over the past few decades, it remains challenging to master all aspects of DS - including problem identification, concept and algorithm understanding, implementation and evaluation. This makes finding effective solutions to common DS problems time-consuming, error-prone, and resource-intensive. 

To address this challenge, we propose an example-based approach to solving DS problems. Our objective is to provide readers with clear guidelines and suggestions for tackling common DS problems, with particular emphasis on those requiring a thorough understanding of concepts and algorithms. By following a step-by-step methodology, our hope is to enable readers to quickly understand and implement effective solutions without being bogged down by unnecessary details or distractions. As part of this initiative, we also aim to contribute to advancing the field of DS education by creating accessible resources and curating tutorials, workshops, and educational programs for individuals and organizations seeking to become proficient in DS. These materials can serve as a foundation for teaching and mentoring students and practitioners, enabling them to harness the full power of DS to transform businesses, create value through data, and enhance human experiences.

2.相关研究
There are many existing studies on applying DS methods to specific domains or application areas, but relatively fewer dedicated to general DS problems. One exceptional study published in 2017 investigated anomalous behavior detection in IoT sensor networks using anomaly detection algorithms. Another study in 2019 explored scalability issues in distributed computing environments when running ML models at scale, suggesting that parallel execution strategies need to be carefully designed to handle large datasets while optimizing computation efficiency. Despite numerous works on individual DS problems, a comprehensive view of existing approaches and solutions remains lacking. In contrast, little attention has been paid to examining why certain DS problems arise, what factors affect their resolution, and how they could be solved efficiently using modern tools and techniques. 

3.目的
The goal of this paper is to provide practical guidance for dealing with typical DS problems, identifying their root causes, and developing efficient solutions. Specifically, we aim to guide learners who are starting out or experienced in DS to achieve the following objectives:

1. Understand fundamental principles underlying DS, particularly related to representing, manipulating, and storing data.

2. Develop an awareness of common DS problems, their origins, key characteristics, and salient features.

3. Identify appropriate examples to demonstrate skills and knowledge required for successfully resolving each problem.

4. Explore the use of relevant tools and technologies to build more robust and reliable DS systems.

5. Use best practices for system design, testing, deployment, and maintenance to ensure successful delivery of a high-quality solution.

This paper assumes a basic working knowledge of computer programming and linear algebra. It also provides a high-level overview of different types of DS problems, highlighting the importance of considering context, domain, size, complexity, and other factors when solving them. For each type of problem, we explain the core concepts and algorithms involved, highlight potential pitfalls, and discuss ways to avoid or mitigate them. Finally, we present case studies illustrating how to apply the discussed principles, tools, and techniques to actual problems encountered in the industry.
