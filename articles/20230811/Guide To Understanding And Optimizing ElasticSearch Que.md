Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine that makes it easy to store, index, and search data. It provides powerful full-text search capabilities along with rich filtering and aggregation features. As the leader in open source NoSQL databases, Elasticsearch has become one of the most popular solutions for enterprise-class search applications. In this guide, we will discuss how to optimize queries on Elasticsearch by understanding different factors like query types, indexing strategy, routing strategy, document structure, etc., and also present some basic algorithms and optimizations such as caching results, using filters instead of aggregations, controlling memory usage, reducing unnecessary workloads, etc. We will also provide sample code snippets for various programming languages to make it easier for developers to implement these recommendations in their projects.

## 2.1 ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
The ELK stack refers to Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine that stores data in indexes. Logstash is a tool used for collecting, processing, and shipping logs from different sources. Kibana is a graphical user interface used for visualizing data stored in Elasticsearch. The three components interact seamlessly to enable real-time monitoring of log data and making insights accessible via dashboards. 


## 2.2 Document Store
Document Stores are database systems designed specifically for storing and retrieving documents. Documents are collections of related fields often called key-value pairs. They differ from traditional relational databases in several ways including scalability, flexibility, and ease of use. A common example of a document store is MongoDB, which offers high availability, scalability, and flexibility over other document stores.

Documents are stored in collections within the database, each collection containing multiple documents. Collections function similarly to tables in traditional RDBMS systems where they group rows together based on shared attributes. However, unlike relational databases, documents don't need predefined schema; rather, they can vary in size and content depending on the application requirements. Additionally, documents support flexible querying through dynamic field mapping, automatic sharding, and unique IDs generated automatically.

A good practice is to keep related documents grouped together into a single collection. This helps ensure efficient retrieval and reduces redundancy since many applications require access to all related information simultaneously. Other benefits include faster indexing times, reduced disk space usage, and improved consistency guarantees when updating data across multiple nodes. 

## 2.3 Indexing Strategy
Indexing involves the process of converting raw data into a format suitable for searching. There are two main strategies for creating indices in Elasticsearch - Single Node Indexing and Shard Cluster Indexing.

### Single Node Indexing
Single node indexing involves having only one shard per index. When a new document is added to the index, Elasticsearch assigns it to a primary shard that holds a copy of the document. Queries can then be executed against any replica shards but not the primary shard itself, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

Pros:

- Simple configuration requires minimal hardware resources 
- Can support smaller datasets 
- Easy to scale horizontally

Cons:

- Slower than shard clustering 
- Less optimal for very large datasets 


### Shard Cluster Indexing
Shard cluster indexing involves dividing the dataset across multiple shards, allowing for greater parallelism and better distribution of load across machines. Each index typically consists of more than one shard, with each shard holding part of the entire dataset. Elasticsearch chooses the number and location of shards based on its configured settings.

Pros:

- Optimal for handling larger datasets 
- Higher throughput compared to single node indexing 
- Supports resilience to node failures 

Cons:

- Requires significant hardware resources 
- More complex setup and management 
- Adds complexity to managing replicas and routing 

## 2.4 Search Strategy
Searching involves identifying relevant documents based on a given query. In Elasticsearch, there are three main search strategies – classic, bool, and dsl (domain specific language).

### Classic Search Strategy
Classic search strategy involves analyzing keywords, stemming words, and building inverted indexes before executing the actual search. The resulting scores represent the relevance of each matching document. Results are sorted according to a scoring algorithm such as TF-IDF or BM25.

### Boolean Search Strategy
Boolean search strategy allows users to specify multiple terms or clauses separated by operators such as AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses. For example, “apple” AND (“banana” OR “orange”) means find documents that contain both “apple” and either “banana” or “orange”.

### DSL (Domain Specific Language)
DSL is a type of search strategy that uses specialized syntax and constructs to perform complex queries. Elasticsearch includes a powerful set of APIs that allow you to build custom queries and scripts using domain-specific language expressions. Examples of DSLs include Lucene's Query Parser and Elasticsearch's Filter API.

## 2.5 Routing Strategy
Routing determines how requests are routed to the correct shard(s), thus providing a way to distribute traffic evenly among shards. By default, Elasticsearch assigns each document randomly to one of the available shards. However, routing enables you to control exactly where certain documents are located and ensures consistent routing behavior regardless of the client making the request.

Two common routing strategies are hash-based and term-based routing. Hash-based routing uses a hashing function to deterministically map a value to a particular shard. Term-based routing routes documents based on a specified field value. Both strategies allow for granular control over where documents are located.

## 2.6 Aggregation Strategies
Aggregation involves summarizing data from multiple documents into a single result set. Elasticsearch supports four types of aggregations – bucket aggregations, metric aggregations, pipeline aggregations, and matrix aggregations. Bucket aggregations group documents into buckets based on a specified criterion, such as term or date range, while metric aggregations calculate statistics about the values of a specific field, such as max, min, sum, or average. Pipeline aggregations operate on the output of previous aggregations to produce further aggregate results. Matrix aggregations create cross-tabulated reports that show comparisons between different dimensions.

Common bucket aggregations include histogram, filter, and range aggregations. Histogram aggregates documents based on a fixed interval, while filter aggregates documents based on boolean conditions, and range aggregates documents based on numeric ranges. Common metric aggregations include max, min, avg, stats, extended stats, and cardinality.

Pipeline aggregations can be used to combine multiple metrics or calculations into a single result set. For instance, you might want to compute the maximum price of products sold by each brand, grouping them by category. Pipelines allow you to define multiple aggregations within a single stage, which simplifies the implementation and improves efficiency.

Matrix aggregations can be used to compare groups of documents across different dimensions. For instance, suppose you have data about sales figures for different categories and brands. You could create a matrix report showing the total sales for each combination of category and brand, ordered by descending total sales.

## 2.7 Filtering vs Aggregating
Filtering is the process of selecting records based on certain criteria, whereas aggregating involves calculating summary measures based on filtered records. Depending on the specific scenario, filtering may be quicker and simpler because it doesn't involve complex calculations. However, if you need to retrieve aggregated results, filtering can be less effective. 

To minimize impact of filtering, consider partitioning your data into logical groups and applying filters at the partition level rather than individual documents. For example, you could divide customers into low-income, mid-income, and high-income groups based on their income bracket and apply filters at the customer group level rather than individual customer documents. 

On the other hand, if you need to compute complex summaries or correlations, aggregating can be more appropriate. With aggregations, you can analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately.
