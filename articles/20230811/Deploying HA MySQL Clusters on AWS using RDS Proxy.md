Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. One of its features is support for deploying high availability clusters with multiple copies of data, known as replicas. These replicas are designed to be located in different Availability Zones within a region so that if one zone fails, other replicas can continue running without interruption of services. 

However, managing these replica databases manually or through some automated tool like Amazon Elastic Cache (ElastiCache), is cumbersome and time-consuming when you have many instances or a large cluster of them. Moreover, you may need to create new replicas during failover or maintenance events which can increase your total cost of ownership (TCO). To simplify this process, AWS released RDS Proxy, an Amazon Aurora feature that enables you to run SQL queries against your primary instance and read from any available replica within seconds. This greatly simplifies the management and operations of highly available MySQL clusters on AWS. In this blog post, we will see how to deploy a Highly Available MySQL Cluster using RDS Proxy.

MySQL provides numerous built-in features such as replication, backups, security, and monitoring that make it an ideal choice for web applications requiring a fast and reliable database solution. However, deploying a scalable, fault tolerant and highly available MySQL cluster on AWS requires a deeper understanding of various components such as networking, load balancing, clustering, and backup strategies. By following the steps outlined below, you will easily build out a MySQL cluster on AWS while also gaining insights into how RDS Proxy works underneath.


# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving deep into deploying a high-availability MySQL cluster on AWS, let's quickly go over some basic concepts and terms used by MySQL and RDS:


## Replication
Replication is the act of copying data from a source server to one or more target servers. It allows for the creation of multiple copies of the same data that are kept synchronized with each other. In MySQL, replication can occur at the row level, table level, or global level depending on the configuration. There are two types of replication supported by MySQL - binary log replication and GTID based replication. Binary log replication relies on the binlog file created whenever changes are made to the master server, whereas GTID based replication uses global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) to replicate transactions across multiple servers. Both methods allow for synchronous or asynchronous replication where the former ensures all changes are propagated to slaves before returning success to clients, whereas the latter does not wait for propagation but instead returns immediately after recording the change to ensure consistency. 


## Clustering
Clustering refers to the arrangement of servers involved in replicating data between them. Each node in a MySQL cluster acts both as a master and slave simultaneously, allowing for reads and writes to flow seamlessly between nodes. When a node goes down, another takes its place automatically without loss of data. 


## Galera Cluster
Galera Cluster is a common term used to refer to a specific type of clustering mechanism provided by MySQL. It consists of several nodes, called nodes, that form a cluster and coordinate their actions using consensus algorithms. The primary role of the primary node in a Galera Cluster is to manage the cluster topology and ensure there is always exactly one active node responsible for taking write requests. Any write request received by the primary node is then sent to the other nodes in the cluster to replicate the changes, ensuring data consistency throughout the cluster. 


## Load Balancer
A load balancer distributes incoming traffic among multiple backend servers. With RDS Proxy, we use an ELB to distribute connections to our primary and replica instances. We do this by creating a listener rule on the ELB that routes traffic to the appropriate port on either the primary or a healthy replica instance. ELBs typically work by maintaining a connection pool and sending traffic to backends based on health checks. If a backend becomes unresponsive due to a failure or restart, the ELB removes it from rotation until it comes back online. 


## Networking
Networking refers to the physical devices attached to a computer network that enable communication between computers. For example, your home network includes routers, switches, and wireless access points that connect your devices to the internet. Similarly, the VPCs created in AWS are physically isolated networks that must communicate with each other via a gateway device. 

When deploying a MySQL cluster on AWS, it is essential to configure the necessary networking components to ensure proper connectivity between the different components. Here are some key points to keep in mind while designing the network architecture:



* Use private subnets for all DB instances and related resources
* Avoid overlapping IP addresses in your VPC
* Use SSL/TLS encryption when connecting to MySQL instances
* Limit access to the RDS Endpoint only from authorized hosts or addresses
* Implement authentication mechanisms and authorization policies to control user access


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
Now that we've covered the basics of MySQL and RDS, let's dive deep into setting up a high-availability MySQL cluster on AWS using RDS Proxy. Here are the core algorithmic principles behind the setup process:


### Setting Up the Primary Instance
The first step is to provision a single primary instance in a multi-AZ deployment group. Once this is done, we can start configuring our replicas.


#### Launching an EC2 Instance
To launch an EC2 instance, follow the steps below:


1. Log into the AWS Management Console
2. Select the "Launch Instance" button
3. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for your operating system and select an instance type. Make sure to choose an instance type that supports enhanced networking, such as the newer generation EC2 instances with ENA support. For better performance, consider using a higher IOPS volume than the default General Purpose SSD.
4. Configure your networking settings. Create a new VPC or use an existing one and add a public subnet to host the instance. Assign a security group that allows SSH access from your local machine and incoming traffic on ports 3306 and 33060.
5. Add storage volumes. You should create separate EBS volumes for the root filesystem (/dev/sda1) and any additional data disks. Attach all required volumes to the instance at boot time.
6. Add tags. Provide descriptive metadata about your instance for easier tracking and management purposes.
7. Review and launch the instance. At the end of the process, verify that the instance has been launched successfully and is running.

Once the instance is up and running, proceed to the next step.


#### Configuring the Primary Instance
After provisioning the primary instance, we need to configure it for MySQL. Specifically, we need to perform the following tasks:


1. Install MySQL Server
2. Secure the MySQL Server installation
3. Set up replication
4. Start the MySQL Server
5. Enable the RDS Administration Port

Let's take a look at how we can accomplish each of these tasks in detail.


##### Installing MySQL Server
Installing MySQL Server is straightforward on most Linux distributions. Simply download the relevant package from the official website, install it using yum or apt-get, and reboot the system. Depending on the distribution, you might need to adjust the path to the mysqld executable file. On Ubuntu, it would be /usr/sbin/mysqld. Ensure that the latest version of MySQL Server is installed. After installing MySQL Server, you should update the password for the root account and disable remote root login.


```
sudo passwd root # Change the password for the root account
sudo sed -i's/^.*PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config # Disable remote root login
service sshd restart # Restart the SSH daemon
```


##### Securing the MySQL Server Installation
Securing MySQL Server involves several measures including setting strong passwords, locking down access permissions, and limiting unnecessary services. Below are the recommended steps for securing MySQL Server:



* Set a strong password for the root account using the `mysqladmin` command
* Remove the anonymous users from the MySQL installation using `mysql_secure_installation` script
* Adjust the access permissions for the MySQL directory and files
* Limit unnecessary services and ports to prevent attacks and vulnerabilities


Here's an example of how to secure the MySQL Server installation using `mysql_secure_installation`:


```
sudo debconf-set-selections <<< "mysql-server mysql-server/root_password password secret"
sudo debconf-set-selections <<< "mysql-server mysql-server/root_password_again password secret"
apt-get install mysql-server -y && sudo mysql_secure_installation
```


This will prompt you to enter the current password for the root account. Enter the desired password twice for confirmation. Next, the script will remove the anonymous users from the MySQL installation and adjust the access permissions for the MySQL directory and files. Finally, it will limit unnecessary services and ports to prevent attacks and vulnerabilities.


##### Setting Up Replication
Setting up replication involves three main steps: establishing a connection, configuring the master, and starting the slave(s).


###### Establishing a Connection
First, we need to establish a connection between the master and slave servers. This can be done by granting privileges to the slave accounts and adding the master as a trusted host.


```
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO'slave_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY'slave_pass';
GRANT RELOAD, PROCESS ON *.* TO'slave_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

# Add the master as a trusted host
SET GLOBAL validate_password_policy=LOW;
UPDATE mysql.user SET Host = '%' WHERE User ='master_user' AND Host LIKE '%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```


Replace `slave_user`, `slave_pass`, `master_user` with the respective credentials for the slave and master servers respectively. Also note that the above commands assume that the slave and master servers belong to different subnets inside the same VPC. You'll need to modify the commands accordingly if they belong to the same subnet.


###### Configuring the Master
Next, we need to configure the master server. First, stop the MySQL service using `systemctl stop mysql`. Then, edit the my.cnf file (`/etc/my.cnf`) to include the lines shown below. Replace `master_host`, `master_port`, and `master_user` with the respective values for the master server.


```
[mysqld]
server-id=1
log-bin=mysql-bin
relay-log=mysql-relay-bin
binlog_format=ROW
expire_logs_days=90
binlog-checksum=NONE
gtid_mode=ON
enforce-gtid-consistency=ON
skip-name-resolve
read_only=OFF
query_cache_type=0
query_cache_size=0
performance_schema=0
innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2
default_time_zone='+00:00'
character-set-client-handshake=FALSE
character-set-server=utf8mb4
collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
init-connect='SET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci'
wsrep_provider=/usr/lib/galera/libgalera_smm.so
wsrep_cluster_address="gcomm://master_host:master_port"
wsrep_slave_threads=1
wsrep_certify_nonPK=true
wsrep_max_ws_rows=131072
wsrep_max_ws_size=1073741824
wsrep_debug=0
wsrep_convert_LOCK_to_trx=0
wsrep_retry_autocommit=1
wsrep_auto_increment_control=1
wsrep_drupal_282555_workaround=0
innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog=1
```


Make sure to replace `master_host` with the correct hostname or IP address for the master server. Save the file and restart the MySQL service again using `systemctl start mysql`. Now, check the status of the slave using `SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;` and confirm that it is connected correctly.


###### Starting the Slave
Finally, we need to start the slave server(s). Stop the MySQL service using `systemctl stop mysql`. Edit the my.cnf file again and add the line `read_only=ON` under `[mysqld]` section. Save the file and restart the MySQL service once again using `systemcpy start mysql`. Check the status of the slave using `SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;` and confirm that it is synchronizing with the master. If everything looks good, you're ready to test the failover procedure.


### Creating the Replicas
With the primary instance configured for replication, we can now create one or more replicas. Follow the steps below to create a replica:


1. Provision a second EC2 instance in the same VPC and subnet as the primary instance. Repeat the previous steps to install MySQL Server and secure it.
2. Establish a connection between the primary and secondary instances. Use the same approach as described earlier. Note that you'll need to open TCP port 3306 on the secondary instance's security group.
3. Start the slave process on the secondary instance. Do not forget to add the `--report-host=` option with the internal DNS name or IP address of the secondary instance to the `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf` file on the secondary instance.
4. Wait for the replication to catch up and verify that the secondary instance is working properly using `SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;`.


Repeat the above steps to create more replicas as needed. As noted earlier, it's important to ensure that the secondary instances are placed in different AZs to provide redundancy. Additionally, we recommend placing them behind a load balancer or haproxy to balance the workload and improve resiliency. Keep in mind that you can use RDS Proxy to route traffic to any available replica within seconds regardless of which one was last promoted to primary status.


### Testing Failover
Testing failover involves simulating a failure scenario where the primary instance goes offline or otherwise becomes unreachable. You can simulate such scenarios using various tools, such as stopping the primary instance, blocking network traffic, disabling routing tables, or even terminating the instance altogether. Regardless of the actual cause of the problem, we want to ensure that the system continues to function normally without disruptions. Once the issue is resolved, we can promote a healthy replica to become the new primary instance and reconfigure the remaining replicas to synchronize with the new primary.


Follow the steps below to test failover:


1. Shut down the primary instance using `shutdown -h now` or terminate it altogether. Alternatively, block network traffic on the primary instance by updating the security group rules.
2. Allow enough time for the system to detect the failure and initiate automatic failover. Typically, failover happens within minutes but could take longer depending on factors such as network latency and replica lag.
3. Verify that the new primary instance is accepting client connections and displaying accurate replication status using `SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;`. If successful, the old primary instance should show a `Seconds Behind Master` value greater than zero indicating that it is still receiving updates from the old master.
4. Promote the new primary instance to normal operation by updating the DNS records and switching the master information in the application configuration.
5. Reconfigure the other replicas to synchronize with the new primary by executing a FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK statement followed by START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS statement. This can be achieved using custom scripts or tools, or directly executing statements using the mysql command line interface. Monitor the progress of the synchronization process using `SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;`.
6. Once the synchronization completes, switch off the temporary replication mode and verify that the system functions normally again. Switch the master information back to the original primary and repeat the recovery procedures for the other replicas as well.

Note that you don't need to manually switch roles between the primary and secondary instances as RDS Proxy handles all routing and load balancing automatically. However, you do need to monitor the replicas to ensure that they remain in sync with the primary and catch up if they fall far behind.
