Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that aims to train agents to perform a specific task by taking actions in an environment and receiving feedback on how well they did. It is known for its ability to learn complex tasks quickly and adapt to new situations rapidly. RL has been applied to many fields such as robotics, games, and medical diagnosis, making it one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. In this article, we will introduce the basic concepts and principles behind reinforcement learning and then present three main algorithms: Monte Carlo policy iteration, temporal difference learning, and Q-learning, which are commonly used in practice today. We will also explain their mathematical foundations and discuss some practical issues related to applying these algorithms to real world problems. Finally, we will conclude with suggestions about future directions and challenges in reinforcement learning research.

## 2.1 马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）
Reinforcement learning is based on Markov decision processes (MDPs). MDPs consist of a set of states, actions, rewards, and transitions between them. At each state, the agent can take any number of possible actions. The action taken at each state results in either a reward or a transition to another state, but not both. This leads to a stochastic process where different outcomes may occur depending on the history of choices made previously. An MDP typically consists of the following components:
- States: S = {s1, s2,..., sn} represents all possible states an agent might encounter while interacting with the environment. Each state could be characterized by various features or attributes. For example, in a gridworld, each cell could correspond to a state, and the attribute could be whether there is a wall, pit, or goal located within that cell.
- Actions: A(s) = {a1, a2,..., am} represent all possible actions an agent can choose when facing a particular state s. Different actions could have different effects on the next state the agent ends up in. For instance, if an agent is standing on a cliff and tries to move forward, it cannot go anywhere without hitting something, so its only option would be to stay still. On the other hand, if the agent is hungry and needs to eat, it might decide to swim across the lake or climb up onto a nearby mountain.
- Rewards: R(s, a) represents the reward obtained after the agent takes an action a in state s. Positive rewards indicate positive benefits, while negative rewards signal disadvantages. In general, the higher the expected value of rewards accumulated over time, the better the agent's performance. However, high rewards sometimes lead to unstable policies, especially in non-Markovian environments like complex driving scenarios.
- Transitions: P(s' | s, a) represents the probability distribution of the next state s' resulting from taking action a at state s. If multiple actions result in the same next state, the probabilities should add up to one. 

In summary, the key feature of an MDP is that it specifies what happens in every possible state and allows the agent to make decisions based on uncertainty. The entire system is dynamic and changes continuously due to random events, making it difficult to model deterministically using traditional techniques like linear algebra. Therefore, modern RL algorithms use approximation methods like neural networks and search algorithms to handle the complexity of large MDPs. 


## 2.2 Value function
The value function V(s) measures the total amount of expected reward an agent can accumulate starting from state s. Formally, given an MDP and an initial state s0, the value function can be defined recursively as follows:
V(s) = E[R + gamma * V(s')], where E denotes the expectation operator and gamma is a discount factor between [0, 1] representing the importance of future rewards vs current ones. By evaluating the value function for all states s, we obtain a complete description of the expected returns the agent can expect from being in any state during the course of an episode.

Value functions provide insights into what kind of behaviors are optimal for achieving maximum cumulative rewards under certain conditions. Intuitively, states with high values correspond to states that offer the highest payoff, while those with low values suggest potential risks or dangers. Thus, we often seek to find good policies that map states to actions that maximize our expected return in the long run.


## 2.3 Policy
A policy π determines the action to be taken at each state according to a fixed strategy. A policy maps states to distributions over actions, specifying the likelihood of selecting each available action in each state. Intuitively, the goal of a policy is to determine what the agent should do in order to achieve the highest expected returns from all possible actions. A common approach is to use a table that assigns probabilities to all possible pairs of state-action pairs. For instance, π(s1, a1) could represent the probability of selecting action a1 at state s1. By optimizing the parameters of the policy network, we can generate policies that act more intelligently and efficiently than randomly selected actions.


## 2.4 Return
Given a sequence of states and actions performed by an agent, the return G is simply the sum of all the rewards received along the way, multiplied by a discount factor gamma. The discount factor indicates how much weight should be given to future rewards versus immediate ones. Mathematically, the formula for computing the return is G_t = R_{t+1} + gamma * R_{t+2} +... + gamma^n * R_{t+n}, where n is the length of the trajectory and t=0 represents the start state. The discount factor gamma is typically chosen small enough to ensure convergence of the value function estimate, yet large enough to capture potential long-term rewards. 

Returns help us understand the agent's performance in terms of the magnitude of the expected gain from taking a series of actions in a particular scenario. Since we want to maximise our return, we should focus on finding policies that maximize expected returns rather than individual rewards alone. Additionally, returns are a crucial concept in reinforcement learning because they directly relate to the extent to which we trust our current predictions. Imagine two identical policies that always select action 1 at all times. One policy may generate very few exploits, but it may outperform the second policy on average by accumulating a lot of high-reward trajectories. Consequently, it makes sense to evaluate the risk-return trade-offs involved in making decision-making decisions, even in simple settings like gridworlds.


## 2.5 Bellman equation
The Bellman equation provides a powerful tool for analyzing the properties of value functions and calculating optimal policies. It describes the value of being in a given state as the expected return if we were to follow a particular policy pi. More precisely, let δ(s, a) represent the difference between the actual reward collected at state s and the value function evaluated under the policy in state s, i.e., δ(s, a) = r(s, a) - V(s). Then, the Bellman equation tells us that the value function satisfies the following recursion relation:
V(s) = E[r(s,.) + gamma * E[δ(s',.)]], where the first term inside the expectation signifies the immediate reward obtained after taking an arbitrary action from state s, and the second term represents the value function evaluated in the next state s'. We can derive the update rule for the value function using this equation and gradient descent optimization. Given an initial guess for the value function V, we can iteratively improve it until convergence, at which point we know that it converges to the optimal value function.


## 2.6 Q-function
The Q-function Q(s, a) represents the predicted utility of choosing action a in state s under a particular policy pi. We define it similarly to the value function V(s), except instead of considering the entire expected return, we consider the expected reward obtained after taking action a in state s. Mathematically, the Q-function can be written as:
Q(s, a) = E[r(s, a) + gamma * E[max_a' Q(s', a')], where we take the argmax of Q(s', a') to reflect the fact that we want to select the action with the highest expected reward in the next state s'. We can calculate the optimal Q-values using the Bellman equation, but since the optimal policy is unknown, we need to use a variation called Q-learning to iteratively refine our estimates of Q.


## 2.7 Exploration and Exploitation
In reinforcement learning, exploration refers to the process of experimenting with different actions in hopes of finding the best one. Exploitation, on the other hand, involves taking actions that seem to work well based on past experience. To balance these conflicting objectives, we need to explore parts of the state space that haven't been explored before, but nevertheless exploit regions of high value. Ideally, we want to choose actions that minimize the amount of unnecessary exploration, while ensuring that we don't get stuck in suboptimal policies. 

One technique that helps address this issue is the epsilon-greedy algorithm. With probability ε, the agent chooses a random action, otherwise it selects the greedy action according to the current estimated value function. By adjusting the hyperparameter ε throughout training, we can control the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Alternatively, we can implement a soft-max exploration mechanism that considers the degree to which each action can contribute to the overall reward, leading to greater diversity of behavior in the face of highly uncertain situations.

Another important aspect of exploring new states is the curiosity-driven exploration method, inspired by the behavior of animals who constantly investigate new territory and try to discover new experiences. Instead of attempting to reach the destination at once, the agent slowly moves towards interesting regions until it finds one. Similarly, we can encourage the agent to explore novel states by giving it intrinsic motivation, such as moving towards unexpected objects or stimulating sensory inputs with repeated sequences of movements. These strategies can significantly boost the agent's exploration rate and increase its chance of finding reward-rich states.
