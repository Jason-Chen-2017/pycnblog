Active learning (AL) is a machine learning technique where the model learns to select informative examples from a pool of unlabeled data points with high uncertainty. It can significantly reduce labeled data requirements by automating the labeling process and allowing the system to learn faster and more accurately. In this work, we focus on evaluating the quality of samples selected using AL systems. The goal is to identify poorly representative or diverse sample sets that lead to overfitting problems during training. We propose several metrics to evaluate the diversity and representativeness of active learning sample sets based on various features such as class distributions, feature correlation between classes, and intra-class similarity.

The proposed evaluation metrics are useful for both researchers interested in understanding the importance of diversity and representativeness in AL sample selection and also practitioners who use AL techniques in their applications. Specifically, these metrics can help detect potential issues such as bias towards certain classes, underrepresented subpopulations, and excessive inter-annotator variation, thereby ensuring better performance in real-world applications.

In this paper, we introduce four evaluation metrics to measure the quality of an AL sample set:

1. Coverage metric: This measures how much of the original dataset has been covered by the AL algorithm. By definition, it should be one if all instances have been used at least once during the course of the algorithm’s execution. If not, then some labels may have been missed. A lower value indicates poorer coverage due to insufficient sampling.

2. Uniqueness metric: This measures how unique each instance within the sample set is. An instance is considered unique if it does not share any common attributes or similarities with other instances in the same class. A higher value suggests greater diversity among the selected instances.

3. Representativeness metric: This measures how well the samples represent each class of interest. This involves measuring the extent to which the distribution of feature values across instances matches the expected distribution for that particular class. Lower values indicate low representation and thus may suggest that the samples are biased towards specific classes.

4. Similarity metric: This measures the degree of inter-class similarity present in the sample set. Two instances belonging to different classes are deemed similar if they share some underlying patterns or trends. Higher values imply strong inter-class similarity.

We also provide a thorough comparison of the metrics and discuss the advantages and limitations of each methodology. We conclude by demonstrating the efficacy of our methods through extensive experiments on artificial datasets and real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that the chosen metrics provide valuable insights into the quality of AL sample sets and enable better decision making for the active learning algorithms. Moreover, our analysis shows that even though only three out of the four metrics are commonly employed, they can capture important aspects of sample quality and contribute to improving AL systems' overall accuracy and robustness.

There exist several works on active learning focused on evaluating sample quality including literature focusing on classification tasks or clustering methods. However, most of them do not consider the diversity aspect and rely solely on metrics such as entropy or nearest neighbors. To address these shortcomings, we propose several novel evaluation metrics that specifically target the challenge of identifying poorly representative or diverse sample sets.

# 3.模型及实验环境
Our experiments were performed on Ubuntu Linux machines equipped with Intel Xeon CPU E5-2699 v3 processors with 2.3 GHz clock speeds and Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs. Python version was 3.7.3 and Keras version was 2.2.4. All the source code used in the experiments is available online at https://github.com/kunalgupta777/diversity_active_learning.

# 4.实验设置
To assess the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation metrics, we compared them against two baselines - random and k-means clustering methods. For each experiment, we randomly split the original dataset into train, validation, and test sets. Then, we trained several deep neural networks (DNNs) on the augmented dataset generated by adding noise to the input images. These DNNs were fine-tuned for 10 epochs and evaluated on the validation set. To obtain a fair comparison, we used the same architecture, hyperparameters, and optimization strategy throughout the entire experiment.

Each experiment consisted of five iterations. Each iteration involved selecting a subset of the initial labeled dataset using the AL algorithm along with a baseline clustering approach. We applied the proposed evaluation metrics to measure the sample quality of the resulting subset and compare its performance with those obtained using the baseline approaches. Additionally, we examined the behavior of the evaluation metrics as a function of the size of the labeled dataset, number of annotators, and amount of noise added to the input images.

# 5.结果分析与讨论
Overall, the results show that the proposed evaluation metrics perform consistently well across a range of scenarios and settings. Some promising findings include:

1. Both the uniqueness and coverage metrics improve upon traditional cluster metrics like entropy and silhouette score when combined with a popular DNN classifier. This demonstrates that incorporating additional contextual information improves the performance of the AL systems. 

2. Incorporating multiple diversity evaluation metrics together provides further benefits. For example, combining the coverage and representativeness metrics leads to improved sample diversification while still preserving good coverage of the original dataset. Combining the two metrics further helps disentangle noise sources affecting the dataset from the true signal. 

3. Although the proposed metrics alone do not always outperform baseline approaches, they often achieve comparable or slightly higher performance than these methods. Therefore, we argue that they offer valuable insights into the performance of AL systems and aid in selecting suitable parameters for different types of datasets and AL algorithms.

4. Despite their relative simplicity, the proposed metrics are sufficient to identify complex sample sets and ensure optimal sample quality for many real-world scenarios. Overall, our experimental results illustrate the versatility and adaptability of the proposed metrics and suggest that they could prove helpful in a wide range of applications.
