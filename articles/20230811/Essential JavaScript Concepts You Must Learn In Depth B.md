# 2.数据类型

In JavaScript, there are six fundamental data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and object. These data types behave differently and have different characteristics based on how they are used in code. Let's go over each data type and explore their differences: 

1. String
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single or double quotes. Strings can contain letters (upper and lowercase), numbers, symbols, spaces, and special characters like!@#$%^&*()_+-={}|[]\:";'<>,.?/ This data type is commonly used to represent text content in web pages. Here's some example usage:

```javascript
var firstName = "John";
var lastName = 'Doe';
var message = "Hello World!";
```

2. Number
A number is any numerical value, either integer or floating point. Numbers include positive integers (-10), negative integers (-5), decimals (3.14), scientific notation (1E10), and infinity (+Infinity/-Infinity). The numeric data type is often used to perform mathematical calculations or store values with decimal points. Here's some example usage:

```javascript
var age = 30;
var price = 2.99;
var temperature = Infinity;
```

3. Boolean 
A boolean is a logical data type that represents true or false. Booleans are often returned by comparison operations or conditions in if statements. They are also frequently used as parameters to certain function calls. Here's some example usage:

```javascript
var isStudent = true;
var isValid = false;
if(age >= 18) {
console.log("You're old enough to vote!");
} else {
console.log("Sorry, you must be 18 years old.");
}
```

4. Null
Null represents the absence of a value. There is only one instance of null - the keyword null itself. A variable set to null does not refer to anything and can be assigned to another variable without error. However, attempting to use any method or property of null will result in a TypeError being thrown.

5. Undefined
Undefined means that a variable has been declared but no value has been assigned to it yet. Variables initialized to undefined typically mean that they haven't received a value from somewhere else in the code beforehand. Trying to access properties or methods of undefined results in a ReferenceError being thrown.

6. Object 
An object is a collection of related variables and functions that encapsulate data and behavior. An object can contain multiple properties and methods, which can be accessed and modified using dot notation or bracket notation. Properties can hold various data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or other objects. Methods can be standalone functions defined inside an object, or functions stored as properties of the object. Objects are created using the Object constructor or literal notation {}. Here's some example usage:

```javascript
// Creating an empty object using Object constructor
var person = new Object();

person.firstName = "John"; // Adding a property to the object
console.log(person.firstName); // Output: John

// Creating an object with initial properties using literal notation
var car = {
make: "Ford",
model: "Mustang",
year: 1964,

displayDetails: function(){
console.log(this.make + " " + this.model + ", " + this.year);
}
};

car.displayDetails(); // Output: Ford Mustang, 1964
```

Note that in both cases above, the object was created outside of a function scope. If an object needs to be used inside a function, it should be passed into the function as a parameter instead. 

# 3.语法

Syntax refers to the structure and rules that determine how programs are written in JavaScript. Common syntax errors include missing semicolons at the end of lines, incorrect indentation, and improperly closed parentheses and brackets. Let's explore common syntax issues and how to avoid them:

1. Missing Semicolon
When writing multi-line statements in JavaScript, it's usually good practice to end each line with a semi-colon ;. This ensures proper execution order and prevents unexpected bugs caused by misinterpreting statements. Forgetting to add a semicolon after a statement could cause the interpreter to run the subsequent line of code, leading to runtime errors. Here's an example:

```javascript
function greetings() {
alert("Welcome");
return "Goodbye" // Missing semicolon here!
}
greetings(); // Output: Goodbyealert("I'm sorry, I couldn't catch your meaning.")
```

2. Incorrect Indentation
Indentation refers to the spacing at the beginning of a line. When coding in JavaScript, it's important to indent blocks of code correctly. Otherwise, the interpreter may interpret unintended parts of the code as belonging to a previous block. Improperly indented code can lead to difficult-to-read and debuggable code. Here's an example:

```javascript
for(var i=0;i<5;i++) {
console.log(i); // Incorrect indentation causes bug!
}

// Corrected code below:

for(var i=0;i<5;i++) {
console.log(i);
}
```

3. Improper Closing Parentheses and Brackets
Similar to correct indentation, improper closing of parentheses and brackets can lead to runtime errors when executing the code. JavaScript uses punctuation marks (){}[] to group and organize statements and expressions, so every opening mark requires a corresponding closing mark to form a valid grouping. Misplaced closing marks can cause the parser to stop parsing prematurely and throw errors. Here's an example:

```javascript
function multiply(x, y){   // Opening parenthesis is properly matched with closing brace
var sum = x * y;    // Expression inside parentheses is evaluated successfully
console.log(sum);
}

multiply(2+3,4{});      // Error: Unexpected token '{'
```

# 4.运算符

Operators are special symbols that operate on values to perform arithmetic, logic, comparison, or other actions. Here's a list of common operators used in JavaScript along with examples:

1. Assignment Operator
The assignment operator (=) is used to assign values to variables or elements of arrays. It works similarly to other math operators like multiplication (*), division (/), addition (+), and subtraction (-). Here's an example:

```javascript
var num = 5;          // Assigning a simple number to a variable
num += 2;             // Using compound assignment operator to increment by 2
console.log(num);     // Output: 7

var arr = [1, 2];     // Assigning an array to a variable
arr[1] *= 2;          // Multiplying second element of the array by 2
console.log(arr);     // Output: [1, 4]
```

2. Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value indicating whether the first value is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to the second value. Here's an example:

```javascript
var x = 10;           // First value
var y = 5;            // Second value
var z = x == y;       // Returns false because x is not equal to y
console.log(z);      // Output: false
```

3. Logical Operators
Logical operators combine conditional statements and return a single boolean value depending on the evaluation of individual operands. Here are some examples:

&& (AND): Returns true if both operands are true, otherwise returns false.
|| (OR): Returns true if either operand is true, otherwise returns false.
! (NOT): Negates the given operand.

Here's an example combining comparison and logical operators:

```javascript
var score = 70;       // User's test score
var passOrFail = score >= 60 && score <= 100? "Passed" : "Failed";
// Using ternary operator to check if score is between 60-100
console.log(passOrFail);  // Output: Passed
```

4. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform basic arithmetic operations on numerical values and return a result. Examples include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Here's an example:

```javascript
var x = 5;        // First value
var y = 2;        // Second value
var z = x / y;    // Division operation
console.log(z);  // Output: 2.5
```

5. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators manipulate individual bits of binary numbers. They work with whole numbers rather than decimals or fractions. Here are some bitwise operators:

& (AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation between two values.
| (OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation between two values.
^ (XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR operation between two values.
~ (NOT): Reverses the bits of a value.
<< (Left Shift): Shifts the bits of a value left by a specified number of positions.
>> (Right Shift): Shifts the bits of a value right by a specified number of positions.

Here's an example demonstrating shifting values:

```javascript
var x = 5;         // Value to shift
var shiftedX = x << 2;
// Left shift by 2 positions to the left
console.log(shiftedX); // Output: 20 (decimal equivalent)
```

# 5.控制结构

Control structures allow programs to execute different blocks of code depending on different conditions or inputs. JavaScript provides three main control structures: conditionals (if...else), loops (while, do...while, for), and switches (switch, case, default). Let's take a closer look at each control structure and see how they work:

1. Conditionals (If...Else)
Conditionals allow programs to execute specific pieces of code based on certain conditions. If a condition is met, the code block following the if statement executes. If the condition is not met, the optional else clause executes instead. Example usage:

```javascript
if(score > 80) {
console.log("Congratulations, you scored excellent!");
} else if(score > 60) {
console.log("Well done, keep going!");
} else {
console.log("Unfortunately, you failed.");
}
```

2. Loops (While, Do...While, For)
Loops repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. While loops repeatedly execute the code block while a condition is true. Do...While loops are identical to regular while loops except that the code block is executed once before checking the condition. For loops iterate over a range of values and execute the code block once for each iteration. Example usage:

```javascript
// Increment counter by 1 until reaching 10
var count = 0;
while(count < 10) {
console.log(count);
count++;
}

// Same loop as above using do...while construct
var count = 0;
do {
console.log(count);
count++;
} while(count < 10);

// Iterate over an array using for loop
var myArray = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
for(var i=0; i<myArray.length; i++) {
console.log(myArray[i]);
}
```

3. Switches (Switch, Case, Default)
Switches provide alternative execution paths based on a switch value and a series of possible matches. Each match falls into one of three categories: case (matches a particular value), break (skips remaining cases and continues with the next statement), or default (executes if none of the cases match). Example usage:

```javascript
var color = "blue";
switch(color) {
case "red":
console.log("Stop!");
break;
case "green":
console.log("Go!");
break;
case "yellow":
console.log("Be cautious!");
break;
default:
console.log("Unknown color.");
}
```

# 6.函数

Functions are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the function keyword followed by a unique name and a set of parameters in parentheses. Functions can accept zero or more arguments, perform operations on those arguments, and return a result. Example usage:

```javascript
function addNumbers(x, y) {
return x + y;
}

console.log(addNumbers(2, 3));  // Output: 5
```

# 7.对象

Objects are collections of key-value pairs where keys are strings representing identifiers and values are any valid JavaScript expression. They enable programs to store and manage complex data structures with methods that can be called upon to perform tasks. Example usage:

```javascript
var person = {
firstName: "John",
lastName: "Doe",
getFullName: function() {
return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
},
address: {
street: "123 Main St.",
city: "Anytown",
state: "CA"
}
};

console.log(person.getFullName()); // Output: Doe Smith
console.log(person.address.street); // Output: 123 Main St.
```

# 8.原型

Prototypes are a way to define shared behaviors among multiple objects. When an object creates a new property or method, it searches for that property or method in its own local object. If it doesn't find it, it moves up the prototype chain until it finds the desired property or method. Example usage:

```javascript
// Defining Animal class
function Animal(name, sound) {
this.name = name;
this.sound = sound;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
console.log(this.sound);
};

// Creating Dog subclass inheriting from Animal class
function Dog(name) {
this.barkSound = "Woof woof.";
Animal.call(this, name, this.barkSound);
}

Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
Dog.prototype.sayBark = function() {
console.log(this.sound);
};

// Create instances of Dog class
var max = new Dog("Max");
max.speak();              // Outputs: Woof woof.
max.sayBark();            // Outputs: Woof woof.
```

# 9.事件处理

Event handling allows programs to respond to user input or trigger events in real time. Events are triggered by user interactions like clicking buttons, typing text, pressing keyboard keys, or moving mouse cursor. Listeners attach themselves to DOM nodes and listen for specific events, then execute a callback function whenever the event occurs. Example usage:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Handling Events</title>
<script src="app.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<button id="clickBtn">Click me!</button>

<div id="clickOutput"></div>
</body>
</html>

<!-- app.js -->
document.getElementById("clickBtn").addEventListener("click", function() {
document.getElementById("clickOutput").innerHTML = "Button clicked!";
});
```

# 10.AJAX 请求

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It enables programs to retrieve data from servers asynchronously without having to refresh the entire page. XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is a native browser feature that makes HTTP requests to a server and retrieves data in response. XHR supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and OPTIONS request methods. Example usage:

```javascript
// Make an HTTP GET request
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
xhr.onload = function() {
if(xhr.status === 200) {
console.log(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
} else {
console.log("Request failed");
}
};
xhr.send();

// Make an HTTP POST request
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("POST", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
xhr.onload = function() {
if(xhr.status === 201) {
console.log("Post successful");
} else {
console.log("Post failed");
}
};
xhr.send(JSON.stringify({
title: "My New Post",
body: "This post contains lots of interesting information."
}));
```

# 11.闭包

Closures are inner functions that maintain access to variables in their outer scope even after the outer function has completed execution. In JavaScript, closures are created whenever a nested function references a variable in its parent scope. Example usage:

```javascript
function showMessage() {
var message = "Hello world!";
setTimeout(function() {
console.log(message);
}, 1000);
}

showMessage();                      // Prints "undefined" due to closure issue
```

# 12.异步编程

Asynchronous programming involves performing non-blocking operations (like making HTTP requests) and processing the responses later. Web workers offer a way to offload computationally expensive tasks to a separate thread to prevent blocking the UI thread. Promises are constructs introduced in ES6 that simplify working with asynchronous code. Example usage:

```javascript
// Define async function using promises
async function fetchData() {
try {
const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
} catch(error) {
console.log(`Fetch failed: ${error}`);
}
}

fetchData();                        // Output logs JSON data retrieved from API
```

# 13.模块模式

Module pattern is a design pattern for organizing code around modules that hide internal implementation details. Modules encapsulate functionality and expose APIs that can be consumed by other modules or the application layer. One advantage of using modules is that they can improve scalability and reduce coupling between components. Example usage:

```javascript
// Define MathUtils module
const MathUtils = (() => {
const PI = 3.14159265359;

function square(n) {
return n * n;
}

function cube(n) {
return n * n * n;
}

return {
areaOfCircle: r => PI * square(r),
volumeOfSphere: r => (4/3) * PI * cube(r)
};
})();

// Use MathUtils module
MathUtils.areaOfCircle(5);               // Output: 78.53981633974483
MathUtils.volumeOfSphere(5);             // Output: 523.5987755982989
```
