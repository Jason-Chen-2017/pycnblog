# 1.背景介绍


人类已经进入了一个信息时代，这个时代带来的变化主要是数据量的增长、分布式网络、移动互联网、云计算等新型技术的崛起以及人类的生活方式的转型。人们需要从根本上调整自己的生存方式，追求更高质量的人类生活。我们今天所接触到的大多数产品和服务都是被设计出来满足我们的特定需求，并非如同古希腊的哲学家那样，通过科学的逻辑去思考如何去改造这个世界，而是通过短期的满足我们的需要，以及长远的眼光，来把握科技前景的未来方向。因此，“人类技术变革”显得尤其重要。过去几十年间，人类在探索和开发技术方面取得了巨大的成就，取得成功的案例也越来越多，但是长远的看，仍然存在很多问题没有解决。
近些年来，环境保护和可持续发展成为全球各个领域关注的焦点。很多国际组织和机构也纷纷跟踪监测该领域的最新发展，并提出相应政策建议，希望能推动相关行业的发展。环境问题日益突出，并对人类健康、社会和经济产生直接或间接影响，对于国家、企业、个人都是一个难题。如何利用现有的技术手段，加强人类保护环境的努力，是当前以及未来需要重视和关注的课题。
人类技术变革简史：环境保护与可持续发ustainability and sustainable development in humans has become a hot topic these years. There are many organizations around the world dedicated to monitoring and evaluating the latest developments in this field and proposing corresponding policies or actions to promote their progression. Environmental issues have become increasingly prominent as they directly or indirectly affect human health, social, and economic well-being. How can we leverage existing technologies to strengthen efforts on protecting the environment for all humankind? This is an urgent and important issue that needs to be addressed by policymakers and researchers alike. To address this crucial problem, I would like to write an article entitled "Human Technology Change: Environment Protection and Sustainable Development in Humans". In this article, I will discuss various concepts related to human technology change and focus on two specific areas of interest - Environment protection and Sustainable Development (SD). 

In this article, I will first introduce some background information about the history of technological advancement and its implications for environmental protection and SD. Then, I will provide definitions and basic principles behind the key terms used throughout the article - "Technology", "Environment", "Sustainability" etc. I will also describe how recent trends in computer science and biology impacted our understanding of the problems of environmental protection and SD. Next, I will explain the importance of continuous improvement in the face of global challenges, focusing on the role of AI/ML in addressing the problems of SD. Finally, I will conclude with some future outlook and suggestions for further research.

Overall, this article aims to give a comprehensive account of the evolution of technical advances over the past decades, with special emphasis on environmental protection and sustainable development (SD) in particular. It provides an idea-based exposition of the relevant concepts and highlights the significant challenges facing humanity today. Within this framework, it is hoped that readers can gain an informed perspective on emerging directions in environmental protection and SD and adopt practical solutions to meet the challenges ahead.
