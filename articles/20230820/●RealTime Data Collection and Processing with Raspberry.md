## 3.1.Sensor Setup
To set up the sensors, we need to connect them properly so that their output can be read by the Raspberry Pi board. For this project, we have used two types of sensors - temperature and humidity sensors as well as LDR (light dependent resistor) which measures the brightness of the environment around the robot. Both of these sensors provide us with information about the temperature, humidity, light conditions, etc., which can help us determine whether there are any issues in the product being inspected. 

The temperature sensor we used is DHT11 which works on the principle of sensing changes in the electrical signals generated by heat. It consists of one digital signal pin for sending and receiving data through a communication protocol and another analogue signal pin which outputs a voltage proportional to the temperature detected by the sensor. To work with this type of sensor, we first send a request command to the sensor over the serial interface and wait for its response which contains both the measured temperature and humidity values. Once we receive the response, we store the temperature and humidity values locally.  

On the other hand, the LDR sensor gives us information about the ambient light level within the vicinity of the robot. By measuring the intensity of visible light, it can tell us if there is something obstructing the path of the laser beam emitted from the camera lens. We connected the LDR sensor to the GPIO port of the Raspberry Pi which allows us to read the value of the resistance applied across the circuit by the LDR sensor. Since the strength of the visible light depends upon the distance between the LED and the object, we take into account this effect while calculating the brightness levels.

## 3.2.Communication Protocol
Once we have configured all the required sensors, we need to establish a communication channel between the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino microcontroller. To do this, we have used the Serial Communications module provided by the Arduino library. This module enables us to transmit data between two devices via a virtual COM port. 

When the Raspberry Pi receives data from the Arduino, it sends a signal to the Arduino’s built-in LED indicating that it has received the message. Then, it reads the incoming bytes one at a time until no more bytes remain. Each byte sent by the Arduino corresponds to some input parameter of the program running on the Arduino such as temperature, humidity, or the brightness level of the environment. These parameters are then stored in memory by the Raspberry Pi for later processing.

## 3.3.Collecting Data 
Once the communication channel is established, the Raspberry Pi continuously polls the Arduino for input data. As soon as it receives any data, it stores it in local storage for further processing. During each poll interval, the Raspberry Pi records the timestamp associated with each measurement alongside the corresponding values obtained from the sensors. This ensures that the recorded data remains accurate even when delays arise due to wireless communication or processing speed limitations of the system. 

## 3.4.Preprocessing Data 
After collecting the raw data, the next step involves preprocessing it. Preprocessing refers to the process of cleaning, formatting, structuring, and enhancing raw data prior to feeding it into a machine learning algorithm. In this case, we perform several operations on the raw data to extract useful features that can be fed directly into the ML model.

For example, let's say we want to build a classifier that can identify the presence of a deficiency in a piece of metal. Suppose we have taken measurements of the metal pieces at various ambient temperatures, humidities, and light levels. Our goal is to train a machine learning model to accurately classify these pieces based on their unique characteristics. 

One possible feature we could use to represent this characteristic would be the ratio of the current temperature divided by the operating temperature of the device. If the metal piece we are inspecting does not behave normally under these conditions, then this feature should show a significantly higher value compared to the ones observed in normal operation. On the other hand, if the metal piece exhibits abnormal behavior even under optimal conditions, this feature may show relatively lower values than those observed in typical operation. Using this feature effectively in conjunction with other relevant features can help improve classification accuracy.

Similar pre-processing steps can be performed for different application scenarios. One thing to note here is that appropriate normalization techniques must be employed depending on the nature of the features involved. Some features may require scaling while others may need to be binned or normalized differently.

## 3.5.Analysing Data using Machine Learning Algorithms
After obtaining the preprocessed dataset, we move onto applying machine learning algorithms to explore the patterns and make predictions on potential problems. Here, we use several popular classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Trees. 

Each algorithm explores the patterns in the dataset and produces a series of models. Depending on the choice of algorithm, we tune hyperparameters to optimize performance. After training the models, we evaluate them on a test set to measure their ability to generalize to unseen data. Based on the results, we select the best performing model and deploy it for online monitoring of the product under inspection.

Here's a brief overview of the main components of a typical machine learning pipeline: 

1. Splitting the data into training and testing sets: This is crucial to ensure that the model cannot simply memorize the input data but instead learns the underlying pattern. A commonly used split ratio is 70% for training and 30% for testing.

2. Feature selection: Selecting the most informative features for modeling improves the overall accuracy of the model. Common approaches include filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods.

3. Algorithm selection: Choosing the right algorithm can have a significant impact on the final outcome. Popular algorithms include SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, KNN, and Gradient Descent.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Tuning hyperparameters refers to adjusting the internal parameters of the chosen algorithm to achieve better performance. This involves experimentation to find the optimum settings for each hyperparameter based on the given data.

5. Model evaluation: Evaluating the trained model requires splitting the original dataset into multiple subsets such as training, validation, and test sets. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix are commonly used to evaluate the performance of the model. 

## 3.6.Result Interpretation and Decision Making
Finally, once the model has made a prediction, we need to interpret the result and decide what action needs to be taken. There are many strategies available to automate the decision making process including feedback loops, rule-based systems, and statistical analysis. However, since the goal of this project is to provide insights into the state of the product being inspected, a simpler strategy involving thresholds and alerts might be sufficient. 

A threshold mechanism can define certain criteria for indicating a condition that requires immediate attention. For instance, if the predicted probability of failure exceeds a particular threshold value, the operator can be alerted immediately. Alternatively, if the actual rate of occurrence of the condition falls below a certain threshold, additional inspections can be scheduled. 

If the situation requires deeper analysis, statistical analysis tools can be used to gather more detailed information on the distribution of the measured features, correlations between variables, and dependencies among different sources of error. From this information, the root cause of any anomaly can be determined and addressed accordingly.

Overall, by implementing real-time data collection and processing on visual inspection robotics platforms using Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards, we have successfully developed a highly effective and cost-effective solution for visual inspection.
