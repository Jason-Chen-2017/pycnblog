# 1.简介
  

统计分析(statistical analysis)是指对数据进行收集、整理、分析、呈现、模型拟合和预测的一系列过程。数据分析在金融、经济、生物医疗、交通运输、制造等领域都有着广泛应用。本文将向读者提供一个关于R语言统计分析的入门教程。首先，我们将介绍一些基础知识，然后重点讲述数据的导入和处理，包括数据结构、数据抽样、缺失值处理、变量转换等。接下来，我们将学习R语言中的基本统计分析方法，包括概率分布、回归分析、聚类分析、方差分析、多元分析等。最后，我们将通过一些实际案例，用R语言实现一些经典的数据分析任务，比如线性回归、多元回归、聚类分析、决策树和随机森林等。通过本文，读者可以了解R语言的统计分析工具的用法，掌握数据分析的基本流程和技巧，并能够自如地运用到自己的分析中去。
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Data Structure
### 2.1.1 Vectors
Vectors are the basic data structure in R programming language which can store numeric or character values together. There are two types of vectors - numerical vector (numerical data like integers or decimals), and factor vector (categorical data). Numerical vectors can be created using `c()` function, while factor vectors can be created using `factor()` function. Here is an example code snippet that creates a numerical vector called "x" containing five numbers:

```r
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
```
To create a factor vector called "y", we need to specify the levels of categories before creating it. For example, if there are three categories 'A', 'B' and 'C', then we can use the following code to create the vector:

```r
y <- factor(c('A','B','C','A','C'))
```
Here, each category value is converted into its corresponding level based on its position in the given order ('A' becomes level 1, 'B' becomes level 2, etc.). We will discuss factors more in detail later. 

### 2.1.2 Matrices and Data Frames
Matrices and data frames are two other important data structures in R programming language. A matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements of any type, while a data frame is a collection of columns where each column can have different modes (numeric or categorical). To create a matrix, we can simply use the `matrix()` function with rows, columns, and optional filling value as arguments. For example, the following code creates a 3 x 3 matrix filled with zeros:

```r
m <- matrix(0, nrow=3, ncol=3)
```
Similarly, we can create a data frame by specifying the number of rows and columns, along with their names and mode (numeric or factor). The following code creates a sample data frame with four columns: name, age, gender and income:

```r
df <- data.frame(name = c("John","Mary","Tom","Peter"),
                 age = c(25,30,27,32),
                 gender = factor(c("Male","Female","Male","Male")),
                 income = c(50000,60000,55000,70000))
```
In this data frame, we used the `factor()` function to convert the string variable "gender" from categorical to ordinal variable. Ordinal variables take on specific ranks instead of just labels, so they can be treated as quantitative variables. 

### 2.1.3 Lists
Lists are another data structure in R programming language which stores groups of objects of various data types. They are similar to arrays but unlike them, lists do not have predefined dimensions. Lists can contain matrices, data frames, functions, logical expressions, symbols, characters, dates and times. Lists can also be nested inside one another. Here is an example code that creates a list with two matrices and a data frame:

```r
mylist <- list(mat1 = matrix(1:9, nrow=3),
               mat2 = matrix(runif(9), nrow=3),
               df = df)
```
In this list, we added two matrices and a data frame under distinct names ("mat1" and "mat2") respectively. This allows us to access these individual components easily.

## 2.2 Sampling and Variables Transformation
### 2.2.1 Variable Selection
Variable selection refers to identifying relevant variables among the ones available in the dataset. It involves choosing only those variables that contribute significantly to our goal of predicting outcomes. One approach to perform variable selection in R is to use statistical tests such as t-test, ANOVA, correlation coefficient and chi-square test. However, there may be instances when manual inspection of the data and plotting of graphs provide better insights about the relevance of variables. 
For instance, let's say we want to analyze the impact of temperature on daily energy consumption of households. In this case, we might start by checking whether there exists any correlation between the variables. Specifically, we would check scatter plots, boxplots, correlation coefficients and histograms of both temperature and energy consumption. If the correlation exists, we would consider including temperature in our model otherwise exclude it. Similarly, if there is no strong relationship between the two variables, we could use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression or decision trees to explore further possibilities for prediction.
