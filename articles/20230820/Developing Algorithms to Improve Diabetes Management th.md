> **Background:** A significant number of people worldwide live with type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a condition that causes high blood sugar levels and affects millions every year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, one in three men and one in five women will develop T2D over the next decade due to poor nutrition or insufficient exercise. Despite early detection methods available for this disease, it remains challenging to prevent and treat this disease effectively throughout life, especially in low-income communities. Therefore, there is a need for novel treatment strategies that can improve patient outcomes and promote long-term healthcare access to T2D patients. 

The aim of this research project is to identify new ways to improve diabetes management through data science and deep learning techniques. The proposed algorithms should be able to automate processes such as screening, monitoring, predicting risk factors, assessing lifestyle changes, educating community members on diet guidelines, and providing personalized guidance for managing their disease. This article provides an overview of the challenges and opportunities faced by the medical community when trying to address these complex problems. We also discuss how our algorithms could potentially play a role in addressing them and offer insights into the future development of this area of research.

## 2. Problem Statement
Diabetes mellitus is a serious and prevalent disease affecting millions of individuals around the globe. It is caused by insulin resistance, which occurs because cells in the pancreas produce too much insulin. When insulin is not enough, cells accumulate in the body, resulting in hypoglycemia - a condition where the glucose level in the blood is too low. Eventually, glycated cells within the liver cause damage to tissues and organs, leading to death. To manage diabetes efficiently, there are several key components: 

1. Screening for diabetes amongst healthy adults at an early stage;
2. Continuous monitoring of diabetes symptoms and physical activity to ensure wellness and corrective measures are taken;
3. Identifying risk factors associated with diabetes using various tests such as fasting glucose, serum insulin levels, BMI, family history, etc.;
4. Assessing lifestyle changes that may impact diabetes outcomes such as eating patterns, alcohol consumption, stress reduction activities, regular exercise, and weight loss;
5. Educating community members about diet guidelines and behaviors to maintain optimal glycemic control; and finally,
6. Providing individualized advice on effective diabetes management plans based on patient's specific needs and goals. 

It has been estimated that approximately 90% of T2D cases occur between 40 and 60 years old, making it particularly difficult to detect early on and provide prompt intervention. Over the course of the disease, the person experiences multiple symptoms, including increased hunger, thirst, weakness, and frequent urination. People living in lower socioeconomic status face higher healthcare costs, further aggravating the problem of T2D. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and therapy, managing T2D remains a challenge for many individuals across the country. 

One possible approach to solving this challenge is to implement data-driven algorithms that help identify areas of interest in clinical data and generate actionable insights for treating diabetes more effectively. However, implementing robust machine learning models requires expertise in both statistical analysis and programming languages such as Python and TensorFlow. Additionally, dealing with large amounts of data and building scalable systems require extensive computing resources. This makes it difficult to apply cutting-edge AI technologies quickly to solve real-world problems. In this context, we propose developing automated algorithms for improving diabetes management through data science and deep learning techniques. These algorithms should enable us to automate processes such as screening, monitoring, predicting risk factors, assessing lifestyle changes, educating community members on diet guidelines, and providing personalized guidance for managing their disease.
