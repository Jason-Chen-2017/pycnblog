Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is a type of dimensionality reduction technique that aims to find a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data while minimizing information loss due to noise and outliers. It was introduced by Vapnik in 1997 as an extension of principal component analysis (PCA), wherein rather than being based on maximum variance or covariance between variables, PPCA considers both these factors together with uncertainty in the underlying probability distributions. 

In this article, we will be discussing the following topics related to probabilistic PCA:

1. Mathematical foundation - We'll start our discussion by understanding how we can compute a mean vector and covariance matrix from the original data set. 

2. Inference procedure - Next, we will learn about the inference procedure used by PPCA algorithm which involves finding the optimal values of latent variables that minimize the reconstruction error. 

3. Model selection criteria - In addition to selecting the number of components for the reduced space, we need to choose the model parameters that best fit the training data distribution. We'll explore different criteria for model selection such as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). 

4. Conclusion - Finally, we'll summarize what we have learned so far and discuss some potential future directions for research. 

We hope you enjoy reading through this detailed article! If you have any questions or want further explanation, feel free to comment below.

The mathematical foundations of probabilistic PCA are closely related to PCA, but also introduce some new ideas and tools that help us to deal with uncertainty in the data. The main idea behind PPCA is to model the joint distribution of the input features and their corresponding target variable using a mixture of Gaussians. This allows us to take into account uncertainty and generalize beyond the observed data points. To do this, we define two sets of random variables – the latent variables $z$ and the observation variables $\xi$. 

$$\begin{align*}
  &X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_X, S_X)\\
  &Y = f(X) + \epsilon \\ 
  &= X'w + \epsilon\\
  &z_{ik} \sim Bernoulli(\phi_{ik})\\ 
  &\phi_{ik} \sim Beta(\alpha_{k}, \beta_{k})\\
  &\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I)\quad i=1,\ldots,n\\
  &\forall k = 1,\ldots,K:\;\; \sum_{i=1}^n z_{ik} = N\\
  &\forall j = 1,\ldots,p:\\
  &\qquad w_j = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{ij}y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{ij}}\\
  &\qquad \mu_X = \mathbb{E}[X] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\prod_{k=1}^K \theta_{ik}\\
  &\qquad \text{where } \theta_{ik}=\frac{(1-\phi_{ik})\mu_Z+\phi_{ik}x_i}{\sqrt{(1-\phi_{ik})^2S_Z+(1-\phi_{ik})(1-\phi_{ki})S_Z}}\quad k=1,\ldots,K,\; i=1,\ldots,n\\
  &\qquad S_X = \mathbb{E}[XX^\top]-\mathbb{E}[X]\mathbb{E}[X]^\top\\
  &\qquad S_Z = (\mu_Z-m)(\mu_Z-m)^T+S_Z^{1/2}\left[(I-\rho_{ZK})\Lambda_{ZK}((I-\rho_{ZK})^TS_Z^{1/2})^{-1}\right](\mu_Z-m)((I-\rho_{ZK})^TS_Z^{1/2})^{-1}\\
  &\qquad m = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^Km_k\phi_k\mu_Z\\
  &\qquad K = \sum_{i=1}^nz_{ii}
\end{align*}$$
  
Here, $f$ represents the mapping function that takes the inputs $X$ and produces the output $Y$. Assuming that there are $K$ classes, the latent variables $z$ indicate whether each sample belongs to each class. Let $\Omega$ denote the set of all possible class assignments. Therefore, we assume that $z_{ik}$ takes one of two values: either 1 or 0 depending on whether the $i$-th sample belongs to the $k$-th class or not. 

Now, consider the second block of equations starting at line 4, which computes the conditional expectation of $X$ given $z_{ik}$. Since each value of $z_{ik}$ comes from a Bernoulli distribution, its conditional distribution has support {0,1}. Hence, we can use a logistic regression approach to predict $X$ conditioned on $z_{ik}$. Specifically, we train a linear model of the form $(1-\phi_{ik})X+phi_{ik}z_{ik}$, where $z_{ik}$ indicates whether the $i$-th sample belongs to the $k$-th class or not. Note that when $z_{ik}=1$, we treat the corresponding feature as missing, since it does not affect the prediction. 

Finally, the third block of equations defines the prior distributions over the latent variables $z_{ik}$. Specifically, $\phi_{ik}$ is a beta distribution, which captures the uncertainty regarding whether the $i$-th sample belongs to the $k$-th class. Specifically, $\alpha_{k}$ and $\beta_{k}$ are positive constants that represent the shape and scale parameters of the beta distribution respectively. By setting $\alpha_k = p$ and $\beta_k = q$ for all $k$, we get a uniform distribution among the $K$ classes. Intuitively, increasing the values of $\alpha_k$ increases the degree of uncertainty towards belonging to the $k$-th class, and decreasing the values of $\beta_k$ increases the likelihood of the $k$-th class being selected even if the samples do not completely agree with the corresponding class label. Similarly, changing $\alpha_{k}$ and $\beta_{k}$ simultaneously controls the balance between strong prior beliefs and uninformative priors.  

Overall, this framework introduces several important improvements compared to standard PCA methods. Firstly, we incorporate uncertainty in the data into the model. Secondly, we use a mixture of Gaussians to capture complex relationships between the input features and target variable. Thirdly, we allow for incomplete observations and handle them appropriately during the modeling process. These changes make PPCA more powerful, accurate, and flexible for handling real-world datasets.
