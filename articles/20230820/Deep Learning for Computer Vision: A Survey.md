By reading this paper, users will gain an understanding of the core principles, methods, and models used in modern computer vision, as well as get a sense of the latest developments and challenges. In addition, they can identify appropriate uses of these technologies in different fields such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, natural language processing, and healthcare. Moreover, this review will be helpful for researchers, engineers, and developers who are interested in applying or extending deep learning algorithms for computer vision. Overall, the aim of this work is to bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing a systematic framework for understanding and utilizing the power of deep learning technology in computer vision.

# 2.Introduction
Computer vision involves extracting meaningful information from digital images or videos, which includes both acquisition and analysis. Traditional approaches involve handcrafted feature extraction methods such as SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), Harris corner detector, etc., but it becomes increasingly difficult to extract rich visual features accurately using traditional methods for large scale imagery. As a result, the need for automated tools that can automatically learn to extract important features from raw image data arises. However, existing machine learning techniques have limited scalability and accuracy when applied directly on image data. To address these issues, several deep learning based approaches have been proposed in recent years. These include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The main idea behind these methods is to use a hierarchical structure of multiple layers to extract high-level features while modeling the underlying distribution. One common characteristic of all these approaches is that they use end-to-end training frameworks where input and output data flows through the entire network without requiring any intermediate supervision or manual intervention. For instance, CNNs are often used for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, RNNs are commonly used for motion tracking and speech recognition, and GANs are typically used for generating realistic synthetic data. 

In this article, we focus specifically on analyzing deep learning for computer vision and explore its potential benefits over other approaches in terms of performance, efficiency, and effectiveness. We start by summarizing some basic concepts and terminology relevant to deep learning and computer vision, including the history of deep learning, its application areas, and common types of architectures. Next, we go into detail about the state-of-the-art deep learning models used for computer vision, starting with CNNs and RNNs. We then discuss the key advantages and drawbacks of each model type and summarize their strengths and weaknesses across different tasks. Finally, we present our perspective on future directions for deep learning in computer vision and suggest a set of recommendations for researchers and practitioners to adopt deep learning methods for practical computer vision applications. 


# 3.Concepts and Terminology
## 3.1 History of Deep Learning
Deep learning (DL) was first introduced by <NAME> and colleagues in 1957 during a conference titled “Backpropagation and Other Mathematical Methods of Neural Networks”. It came to prominence after Nervana Systems' groundbreaking research demonstrated the feasibility of training artificial neural networks using backpropagation. During the next few decades, DL has emerged as one of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, enabling powerful machines to perform complex tasks like image and speech recognition. DL techniques have become more sophisticated and accurate than ever before thanks to improvements in hardware architecture, mathematical optimization algorithms, and the availability of massive labeled datasets.

The development of DL started initially with shallow feedforward networks and artificial neurons. Although these early models were able to solve simple tasks like logical functions and pattern recognition, they suffered from two major limitations - i.e., slow convergence time and difficulty in capturing complex patterns. Later, LeCun et al. presented the first successful convolutional neural network (CNN) in 1989, which showed great promise in dealing with raw image data. They also made crucial contributions to the field of natural language processing and reinforcement learning. Today, deep learning has evolved rapidly with new models, applications, and methodologies emerging every day.

## 3.2 Applications of Deep Learning
In recent years, DL has exploded in popularity among many industries. Here are just a few examples:

1. Autonomous Driving
2. Medical Imaging
3. Natural Language Processing
4. Healthcare 
5. Video Analytics 
6. Recommendation Engines
7. Image and Video Understanding

As mentioned earlier, DL techniques have shown impressive results in image and video analysis tasks. These include object detection, image/video synthesis, and anomaly detection. Additionally, deep learning has helped advance computer graphics and augmented reality by enabling them to produce realistic virtual environments that closely match those seen in the real world. It has also paved the way for autonomous vehicles that can detect obstacles and navigate safely around them. Similarly, DL has helped improve medicine by leveraging unprecedented amounts of data available in biomedical imaging, allowing doctors to diagnose diseases faster, cheaper, and better. And finally, DL's use cases in natural language processing continue to grow with exciting opportunities such as automatic translation and sentiment analysis.
