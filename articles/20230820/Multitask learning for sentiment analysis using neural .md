Sentiment Analysis (SA) is one of the most fundamental natural language processing tasks that has a significant impact on various applications like social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis and many more. In this article, we will explore multi-task learning technique to improve the performance of SA models by utilizing additional information available in different data sources. We will also implement Attention Mechanisms into our model to capture the important features from each source separately and then combine them to get better results.

Multi-Task Learning (MTL), which involves training multiple related tasks simultaneously, has become an effective approach to learn from diverse datasets together. However, MTL was originally proposed only for image classification where it can potentially help in improving the accuracy of deep neural network classifiers. It has been shown that other natural language processing tasks such as text classification or named entity recognition can benefit from MTl too. 

Attention Mechanism is another commonly used mechanism in Neural Networks to focus on relevant parts of input data while encoding information from all inputs at once. Attention Mechanism has been successfully applied in several NLP tasks including machine translation, question answering and chatbots.

In this paper, we will propose a novel framework called Multi-task learning for Sentiment Analysis (MT-SA) using Attention Mechanism. This new architecture takes advantage of both MTL and Attention Mechanism techniques to achieve improved performance over single task baseline models. The key idea behind this framework is to train separate models for each target class but use shared feature extraction layers trained on different domains such as product reviews and twitter tweets. These domain specific feature extractors are further fed through an Attention Layer that selects important features from each source based on their respective relevance scores. Finally, these contextualized features are combined to form predictions by a classifier layer that learns to map the joint representations learned from both sources to target classes. The experimental results show that the proposed MT-SA framework achieves comparable or even outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across different benchmarks. Our work suggests that incorporating diverse knowledge extracted from multiple data sources may lead to significantly improved performance in sentiment analysis tasks.

Previous works have focused primarily on building general purpose models that are capable of handling different types of data. For example, GCN [1] uses graph convolutional networks to process heterogeneous graphs containing multiple node types and edge types. GraphSAGE [2] combines a neighbor sampler algorithm to generate multiple embeddings for each node based on its neighbors within a local region. FastText [3] is a popular embedding method that applies word n-gram models to learn semantic vectors capturing both morphology and context. Similarly, previous approaches have demonstrated that combining multiple auxiliary tasks may lead to improved performance in certain settings. Some examples include CoLA [4], SST-2 [5], MNLI [6] and RTE [7].

However, few papers have explored applying these auxiliary tasks specifically for sentiment analysis. Zhang et al. [8] introduces sentiment lexicons which serve as external resources for annotating polarity labels for words. They evaluate the effectiveness of sentiment lexicons on three downstream sentiment analysis tasks: AFINN [9], SentiWordNet [10] and VADER [11]. Nonetheless, they do not provide any guidance towards how to leverage external resources effectively during training. Similarly, BERT [12] uses pre-trained language models that were trained on large corpora of unstructured text to solve a wide range of natural language understanding tasks. BERT encodes text sequences in contextualized vector space which captures syntactic and semantic information about the text. However, there has been little exploration on leveraging external resources during training with BERT for sentiment analysis tasks.

Our work falls under the same category as these existing methods because we seek to enhance traditional sentiment analysis models with external resource information without relying on handcrafted feature engineering. Moreover, since we aim to handle two different domains instead of just one domain, we compare two distinctive aspects of sentiment analysis - i.e., features obtained from individual domains vs. their combination.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural Language Processing is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research focusing on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and manipulate human languages naturally rather than programming codes, making it the core area of research in modern AI. It involves processing, analyzing, and generating human language and speech to enable computers to interact intelligently with users and converse with each other. Examples of NLP applications include automatic summarization, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, dialogue systems, and chatbots.

### Tokenizer
Tokenizer is responsible for breaking down the input text into smaller units known as tokens, which represent meaningful elements such as words, phrases, punctuation marks etc. Different tokenizers have been designed to tokenize text according to specific criteria such as character level, sentence level, word level etc.

### Stop Words Removal
Stop words are those common words which add no meaning to sentences and carry very little weightage. Removing stop words before performing any type of NLP processing helps in reducing the size of vocabulary and improves overall efficiency. There are several strategies to remove stop words:

1. Custom stop list: This strategy involves maintaining a custom list of stop words that contains the frequently occurring stop words in the corpus. 

2. Common stop words lists: There exist several built-in stop word lists in NLTK library that contain the most frequent English stop words such as "the", "and", "is" etc. These lists can be downloaded using NLTK's download() function. Alternatively, you can create your own stop word list and pass it to the tokenizer object.

3. Stemming & Lemmatization: Both stemming and lemmatization involve converting words to their root form. Stemming is done using simple rules while lemmatization involves selecting the appropriate dictionary form of the word based on part of speech tagging.

### Part-Of-Speech Tagging (POS tagger)
Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging is the process of assigning a part of speech to each word in a given text. POS tags play a crucial role in the construction of a comprehensive grammar that describes the syntax and semantics of a sentence. Popular POS taggers include Stanford Parser, TreeTagger, TnT, OpenNLP, Spacy etc.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and categorizing named entities in a text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, times, quantities, monetary values etc. Most popular NER tools include StanfordNER, Apache Stanford CoreNLP, spaCy, MITIE, CRF++ etc.

## Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning (ML) refers to a set of algorithms developed to allow computers to automatically discover patterns in data without being explicitly programmed to do so. ML is widely used in numerous fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). Here, we focus on NLP applications involving sentiment analysis.

### Sentiment Analysis (SA)
Sentiment Analysis (SA) is the interpretation and identification of attitude, opinion, intentions, evaluations, or emotions in a piece of text. SA requires the comprehension of complex linguistic features and interactions between different factors like tone, mood, inflection, usage etc. SA is often performed as a standalone task but can also be combined with other NLP tasks such as named entity recognition, topic modeling, and relation extraction to derive insights and gain deeper understanding of user preferences and behavior.

### Text Classification
Text Classification is the process of sorting texts into different categories based on predetermined keywords or themes present in the text. Text classification models predict the probability distribution of text belonging to each category or class. Two main types of text classification models are supervised and unsupervised.

Supervised learning: Supervised learning models require labeled data consisting of input-output pairs, where output represents the correct label associated with the input. Traditional supervised learning models include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, Naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors.

Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning models identify structure and patterns in data without any prior knowledge of the problem domain. Traditional unsupervised learning models include clustering, density estimation, and dimensionality reduction.

### Multilabel Text Classification
Multilabel Text Classification is similar to ordinary text classification, except that it allows each document to be assigned multiple binary labels indicating multiple topics or concepts present in the document. A multilabel text classification system assigns each document to a subset of possible labels. Two popular frameworks for multilabel text classification are LIBLINEAR and RAKEL.

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that operates on sequential data such as time series or natural language. It consists of repeated copies of the same neural network block along a sequence, allowing information to persist across time steps. Many variants of RNN exist with different architectures, activation functions, and optimizers. Variants of RNN used in sentiment analysis include vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM, and BiLSTM.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is another type of neural network that processes images and videos. It operates on two-dimensional grid structures, typically employing filters that scan over the input signal and produce outputs. CNNs are widely used in computer vision applications for pattern recognition, detection, and recognition. Variants of CNN used in sentiment analysis include regular CNN, residual CNN, and CNN with attention mechanisms.

### Long Short-Term Memory Cell (LSTM)
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell is an extension of Recurrent Neural Network that is capable of learning long-term dependencies in the input sequence. It consists of four interacting gates that control the flow of information through the cell. An LSTM network is able to keep track of longer term dependencies that may be difficult to detect using standard RNN cells alone. Variants of LSTM used in sentiment analysis include original LSTM, peephole LSTM, and stacked LSTM.

### Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is an LSTM variant that can take advantage of the foward and backward passes to obtain robust features from the input sequence. Instead of treating each word independently, BiLSTM processes each word depending on its preceding and succeeding contexts. Variants of BiLSTM used in sentiment analysis include uni-directional BiLSTM, bi-directional BiLSTM, and higher-order BiLSTM.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network that has multiple layers of neurons arranged in parallel. Each layer receives input from the previous layer, passes it through an activation function, and generates an output. The final output layer produces the final prediction. Variants of MLP used in sentiment analysis include fully connected MLP, sparse connected MLP, and deep belief nets.

### Dropout Regularization
Dropout regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. During training, dropout randomly drops out some neurons in each iteration of the training process to simulate the presence of noise or uncertainties in the data. Dropout rates vary depending on the application but generally fall below 0.5%. Dropout regularization prevents the co-adaptation of neurons due to the fact that they share weights amongst different layers. Variants of dropout regularization used in sentiment analysis include inverted dropout, variational dropout, and gaussian dropout.

### Attention Mechanisms
Attention Mechanisms are the central concept underlying the success of recent advances in NLP. Attention mechanisms assign greater importance to relevant parts of the input sequence when processing the data. They facilitate memory maintenance by storing and retrieving information relevant to the current step of computation. Attention mechanisms have been shown to be particularly useful in tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and question answering. Variants of attention mechanisms used in sentiment analysis include dot-product attention, softmax attention, multiplicative attention, and additive attention.

### Domain Adaptation
Domain adaptation is a semi-supervised learning paradigm where the model is trained on a small labeled dataset and tested on a larger unlabeled dataset. To make the model invariant to variations in the test dataset, we need to adapt the model parameters to match the characteristics of the target domain. In sentiment analysis, domain adaptation is especially critical if we want to capture non-local relationships between the input features and the target variable. Other domains could contain differences in terms of text length, style, vocabularies, and terminologies that would affect the performance of the model.

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that allows us to reuse a pre-trained model on a different task with minimal fine-tuning. It saves valuable computational resources and boosts the speed of convergence compared to training a completely new model. With transfer learning, we can apply advanced techniques such as pretraining on large scale unlabelled data followed by finetuning on limited labeled data. Transfer learning has already been demonstrated to improve the performance of several natural language processing tasks including text classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. Variants of transfer learning used in sentiment analysis include feature-based transfer learning, distilled transfer learning, and adversarial transfer learning.

The proposed MT-SA framework is composed of three components namely Feature Extractor, Attention Mechanism and Classifier. 

Feature Extractor module comprises multiple domain-specific feature extractors trained on different data sources such as Product Review Corpus and Twitter Corpus. Each extractor learns to extract contextual features that capture the essential nature of text in each domain. The output of these feature extractors are passed through an attention layer to selectively select relevant features from each source. Finally, the contextual features selected from each source are concatenated to form joint representation that is used as input to the classifier.

Attention layer is responsible for taking in the joint representation generated from the concatenation of feature vectors from different sources and returning a weighted representation that highlights the important features from each source based on their relative importances. By doing so, the model learns to attend to different domains sequentially and captures their unique properties accurately.

Classifier module is responsible for mapping the joint representation to the target class either directly or via a decoder layer. Decoding layer maps the output of the classifier back to the target class domain.

Overall, the entire architecture is illustrated in the figure below.
