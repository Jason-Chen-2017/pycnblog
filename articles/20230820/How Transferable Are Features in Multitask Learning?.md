Multitask learning is an important problem in machine learning that involves the simultaneous training of multiple tasks with shared representations. One way to achieve multitask transferability across different tasks is by using task-specific features for each task and allowing them to interact with each other through a shared latent space. In this paper, we study how well task-specific features can be transferred from one task to another, and whether they can act as experts or hinder generalization when used jointly for multiple tasks. We propose a new metric called feature importance to quantify the contribution of individual features towards predicting on multiple tasks and show that it outperforms previous metrics based on correlation or mutual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on two real-world datasets: CIFAR-100 and ImageNet classification. Our results indicate that the use of task-specific features significantly improves performance over single-task learning while also enabling cross-task transfer. The ability to distinguish between task-specific expertise and generic cognition may lead to better generalization than simply aggregating the predictions of all tasks together.
In summary, we introduce a new concept of multitask transferability, where task-specific features are learned for each task and allowed to interact with each other via a common latent space. Using these features, we develop a novel evaluation metric called feature importance, which shows that task-specific features have higher predictive power than generic ones under multitask scenarios. This work provides a fundamental step towards understanding the role of specialized representation for multitask learning, and offers insights into designing more effective algorithms for dealing with its challenges.

## Multitask learning (MTL)
Multitask learning refers to the problem of simultaneously learning multiple tasks using shared representations. It has been shown to improve accuracy, reduce human effort required, and increase flexibility in natural language processing systems such as speech recognition and image classification. The basic idea behind MTL is to train models on multiple related tasks at once rather than solving each task independently. MTl has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its advantages of being data efficient, reducing overall error rate, and improving interpretability of the system. However, achieving good transferability between tasks remains challenging.
## Task-specific features
Task-specific features refer to the subspaces within the shared latent space that correspond to each specific task. They consist of semantically meaningful units that capture relevant aspects of the input data for the corresponding task. Often, these features can be learned automatically during model initialization or pretraining using unsupervised methods such as autoencoders, transformers, or PCA.
## Latent spaces
Latent spaces represent a high-dimensional vector space obtained after applying some dimensionality reduction technique to the raw input data. These low-dimensional representations allow us to simplify complex relationships in the original inputs and provide a compact encoding that captures salient features. By projecting inputs onto their shared latent space, we are able to learn task-specific features without requiring any prior knowledge about the target task or domain. When combined with task-specific features, we obtain a powerful tool for transferring knowledge between related tasks.
## Feature importance
Feature importance refers to the degree to which a particular feature contributes towards predicting on multiple tasks or generating accurate outputs. Intuitively, if a feature helps predict multiple tasks, then it should be considered valuable. Previous works have relied heavily on correlations or mutual information measures to measure the importance of features but these do not take into account the fact that certain features might perform better or worse depending on the context. For example, an unimportant feature that performs very well on one task but does not help predict others might still contribute positively towards predicting on both tasks. On the contrary, an important feature that fails to accurately predict many examples in a given task may still be irrelevant. Thus, we need a more granular measurement of feature importance that takes into account both the strength and direction of the relationship between features and tasks. We propose a simple yet intuitive method called pairwise consistency to measure the extent to which a feature consistently produces correct predictions on distinct pairs of tasks. Pairwise consistency considers only those pairs of tasks for which there exist positive and negative samples belonging to each class. If a feature consistently outperforms the rest of the features, then it should be regarded as valuable. Finally, we use this metric to compare various approaches for feature selection in multitask learning, ranging from standard techniques like PCA, Lasso, and ridge regression, to more advanced techniques like attention networks and autoencoders.
