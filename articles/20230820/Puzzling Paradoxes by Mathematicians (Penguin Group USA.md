Puzzling paradoxes are a rare class of mathematical phenomena that arise in unexpected and counterintuitive ways. These paradoxes usually involve some logical or set-theoretic reasoning that is not explained or justified logically, but can be shown to have fascinating properties that surpass even the most basic understanding of set theory. In this article, we will focus on puzzling paradoxes in which there is an unsolved conjecture that appears implausible at first sight, yet upon closer inspection provides some new insight into the world around us. We will explain how these problems were discovered and analyze their behavioral characteristics such as randomness, symmetries, nonlinearity, and multimodality. Finally, we will present a few classic examples from mathematics, physics, and computer science where they occur frequently and offer valuable insights for further research and development.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Puzzling paradoxes often involve two types of objects: sets and relations. Sets are collections of elements with no duplicates and order does not matter; while relations represent relationships between pairs of elements, typically represented using ordered pairs. For example, {1, 2, 3} represents the set containing three distinct integers, and (a, b) represents the relation "a is related to b." Relations may also have multiple roles, such as (a, b) representing both "b is the ancestor of a" and "a belongs to b's family". The symbol ∘ denotes composition of functions, and □ denotes the powerset of a set. 

Most puzzling paradoxes are symplectic, meaning that they feature a pair of counterparts that behave similarly. For instance, the left coset lattice of any group G is isomorphic to its right coset lattice, and vice versa. Symplectic puzzles include many familiar ones like Schröder-Bernstein conjectures and Brouwer fixed point theorem. Other classes of puzzles exhibit unique behaviors that cannot be explained simply using elementary set theory. Examples include higher dimensional versions of the witness problem, the bouquet problem, and quantum knots.

Sometimes puzzles are quite complex and require significant mental effort to understand. The process of disentangling them requires a combination of intuition and creativity, as well as careful observation and analysis. Some authors suggest that this complexity is partly due to the fact that puzzles tend to come with hidden assumptions or subtleties, which must be recalled and explored during the course of solving the puzzle. However, even brilliant mathematicians sometimes face challenges when trying to find unusual solutions or break down seemingly obscure concepts. Nonetheless, puzzling paradoxes provide a unique opportunity for learning about the principles behind natural phenomena, the foundations of logic, and the underlying structure of reality. As such, they form a rich source of inspiration and enlightenment for scientists, engineers, and philosophers alike.

The following sections outline several classic examples of puzzling paradoxes, explaining their behavioral characteristics and highlighting features common to all puzzling paradoxes. Each section starts with a brief explanation of the puzzle itself, followed by a description of its behavioral characteristics, including its type (symplectic vs. hyperbolic), dimensions, difficulty level, known non-classical solution, etc. We then discuss possible approaches to finding a solution and analyze the results obtained. Next, we explore how the puzzle fits within the broader field of algebraic geometry and set theory. Finally, we review previous works on the topic and highlight open questions that remain unanswered.
