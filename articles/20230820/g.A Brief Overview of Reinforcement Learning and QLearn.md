Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with its environment by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. In this article we will cover two widely used RL algorithms: Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). We'll also give some details on how these algorithms work under the hood and demonstrate their use using open source libraries such as Keras and OpenAI Gym.

Q-learning is one of the most commonly used reinforcement learning algorithms that involves finding the optimal action to take given current knowledge of the state space and a reward function. It works by updating the estimated value function for each state-action pair based on previous experience and the discounted future reward. The algorithm uses a table called "Q" to store the estimated values of all possible states and actions. After training, it can be used to select the best action to take at any given time depending on the current state of the system. 

Deep Q-Networks (DQN), introduced by Mnih et al., are variations of Q-learning that leverage deep neural networks instead of simple tables to estimate the value of each state and action. DQN combines ideas from supervised and unsupervised learning, such as backpropagation through time and replay memory, to learn complex relationships between states and actions. DQN has demonstrated impressive results in several games, including those from Atari, Go, and Starcraft.


In this article, we will go over the basic concepts behind reinforcement learning and explain what they mean in context of AI. Then we'll dive into the theory and mathematics underlying both algorithms, showing you exactly how they update the Q-table or network parameters during training. Finally, we'll show you code examples using popular open-source libraries such as Keras and OpenAI gym to train agents in environments like CartPole and Pong. By the end of the tutorial, you should have a good understanding of how to implement your own versions of these algorithms and feel confident applying them to new problems and projects.


To get started, let's introduce some key terms and concepts related to reinforcement learning: 


## Markov Decision Process (MDP)

A Markov decision process (MDP) is a tuple $(S, A, P, R)$ consisting of: 

* $S$: a set of states
* $A$: a set of actions
* $P(s'|s,a)$: the probability of transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$ when performing action $a$. This is known as the transition model.
* $R$: a reward function that gives a scalar value to each state-action pair. This is often represented as $R(s,a)$ but could also include the expected future reward if we were to take a particular action in a particular state. 

The goal of an RL agent is to find an optimal policy $\pi^*(s)$ mapping from states to actions, which maximizes the long-term expected reward. We assume that there exists a perfect equilibrium policy $\pi_*$, meaning that every non-zero probability mass is assigned to a unique action.


## Value Function and Policy

Given an MDP, we define a state-value function $V^\pi(s)$ to represent the expected return from being in state $s$ following policy $\pi$ starting from the initial state distribution $\rho_0$. This is done recursively by considering the expected return starting from each successor state, weighted by the probability of entering that state given the current state and action. For example:

$$\begin{align*} V^\pi(s) &= \sum_{a} \pi(a|s) [R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V^{\pi}(s')] \\ &= \sum_{a}\pi(a|s)[R(s,a)+\gamma \sum_{s',r}p(s',r|s,a) r] \end{align*}$$

where $\gamma$ is a discount factor that determines how much we care about future rewards. Intuitively, we want to avoid getting stuck in local maxima while still exploring other parts of the state space. 

We then define the action-value function $Q^\pi(s,a)$ to represent the expected return starting from state $s$ and taking action $a$ according to policy $\pi$. Again, we compute this recursively by summing up the expected returns from each successor state multiplied by the probability of reaching that state given our current choice of action:

$$Q^\pi(s,a) = \sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)[r+\gamma V^{\pi}(s')]$$

With these definitions in mind, let's move on to the core algorithmic concepts and techniques involved in reinforcement learning.
