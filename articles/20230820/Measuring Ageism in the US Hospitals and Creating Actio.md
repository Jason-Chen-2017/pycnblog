Ageism is an emerging problem that pervades our society, making it challenging to address race-related issues such as discrimination against minority groups or job discrimination among ages. It affects patients' healthcare experience and outcomes, including mental healthcare and mortality risk factors.

One of the main challenges facing governments and organizations around the world is how they can effectively respond to ageism problems. This article provides an overview on measuring ageism in hospitals using publicly available data sets and creating actionable priorities for change by analyzing different factors such as gender equality, access to care, cost effectiveness, patient safety and infrastructure quality. The analysis will also identify potential areas where more resources should be focused to enhance positive outcomes for minorities while ensuring equity across all demographics. 

The paper includes background information on research conducted related to ageism in United States hospitals and key concepts, terminology and definitions used in this study. It discusses how the National Survey of Health, Education, and Welfare (NSHEW) survey was used to collect and analyze data on hospital characteristics and staff demographics, specifically women's representation, racial diversity levels, treatment costs, and nursing education qualifications. A machine learning algorithm called K-means clustering was then applied to cluster hospital systems based on similar attributes, allowing us to identify patterns and trends within these data sets. Finally, recommendations are made on prioritizing interventions and activities for improving male-female egalitarian outcomes in hospitals. 

This work addresses one of the biggest threats to patient safety in the United States: the rapidly expanding presence of alienated communities with prejudiced attitudes towards both men and women. While significant progress has been made in addressing this issue through legislation and policies that support ethical practices, there is still much room for improvement. By identifying ways to increase female representation at all levels of government, policies and institutions, we can strengthen public awareness, encourage change and ultimately create better health outcomes for everyone. 

Overall, this paper outlines a methodology to measure and analyze ageism in the US hospitals, as well as suggest opportunities for changing current policy and practice settings to achieve greater male-female equity and improve overall healthcare outcomes.

## Race/Ethnicity
Race refers to any of a person's inherited genetic makeup from their parents, and is not just a social construct. Racial identity may also include cultural biases about who you are and what you stand for. For example, some historically predominantly white countries have adopted certain attitudes regarding citizenship based on ethnicity instead of national origin.

Ethnicity refers to the membership or nation or tribe, but unlike race, ethnicity does not impose any restrictions on individuals' political beliefs or actions. Ethnicity is typically determined at birth, often via identification cards or school records.

In terms of medical use, "race" and "ethnicity" refer to racial groupings rather than physical differences between races, which would be referred to as "genetics". However, when considering a wide range of conditions and outcomes, the distinction between race/ethnicity and genetics is important.

## Disability
Disabilities are various limitations that affect people's abilities in everyday life, whether physical, psychological, or educational. Some examples of common types of disabilities include mental health conditions, neurological diseases, hearing impairment, and deafness. Common causes of disabilities are disease conditions, injuries, and environmental factors such as pollution. People with disabilities face unique challenges in accessing healthcare services, working with others, maintaining employment, navigating social environments, and living independently. Therefore, effective rehabilitation programs and strategies are essential components of preventing or alleviating disability-related harm.

## Gender Equity 
Gender equality refers to a societal norm in which males and females are treated fairly regardless of their sexual orientation, gender expression, or marital status. In other words, if someone identifies as male, they must be treated like a man; if they identify as female, they must be treated like a woman. Gender equality is necessary because it promotes civic responsibility, healthy interactions between genders, increases economic opportunities for all members of society, and helps ensure fair distribution of power and responsibilities. Governments and nonprofit organizations play a crucial role in achieving gender equality by implementing policies, programs, and structures that promote equal opportunity and accountability for both genders. 

Equity means that something or someone benefits all members of a population without regard to their race, religion, color, sex, age, creed, or socioeconomic status. Gender equality ensures that both men and women enjoy equal rights and opportunities regardless of their gender identity or assigned roles in society. Gender equality has long been recognized as a critical component of successful democracy and empowerment of women and girls in many developing countries.

## Sexual Orientation
Sexual orientation describes the individual's relationship with both men and women. There are several categories of sexual orientations, including homosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, and asexuality. Homosexuality involves two individuals having the same genitals, while bisexuality involves two individuals whose reproductive organs meet in the uterus. Pansexuality involves one individual being dominant in the maternal side while also present in the paternal side of another individual's body. Asexuality refers to a lack of sexual activity. Many individuals have multiple sexual orientations, each with their own characteristics and preferences.

A person's sexual orientation influences many aspects of their lives, including relationships, career choices, family dynamics, financial decisions, and self-esteem. Despite the importance of sexual orientation, it remains underrepresented amongst young adults and older individuals in the United States. Sexual orientation is difficult to define accurately and reflects varying ideologies, attitudes, and expectations held by individuals and their families. Furthermore, defining and understanding different sexual orientations requires careful consideration of social context and historical experiences, which can vary greatly throughout history and culture.

## NSHEW Data Collection and Analysis
### Background Information
The National Survey of Health, Education, and Welfare (NSHEW) is a widely used source for collecting data on health indicators such as mental health, substance abuse, and health insurance coverage. The survey covers a wide range of topics including demographic data, provider information, and income information, among others. Participants were selected based on willingness to provide personal information and answers to questions designed to maximize response rates.

### Method
#### Dataset Selection
The NSHEW dataset collected a variety of data points related to the medical care provided by hospitals, including age structure, gender representation, specialty departments, and treatment costs. These data sets were provided through separate surveys, resulting in data on three different time periods. We chose to focus on data from the 2019-2020 year, since it had the most recent data collection dates.

#### Data Extraction and Cleaning
Before further cleaning and processing, we performed initial exploration on the dataset to understand its structure and fields. We noticed that some columns contained missing values, which could impact the accuracy of our analysis. To handle missing values, we replaced them with NaN values and dropped those rows containing missing values. We also removed duplicate entries and identified any irrelevant or incomplete data points. After exploring the dataset, we found that there were no major errors in the data, so we moved forward to transform the data into a format suitable for analysis.

Next, we transformed the data into pivot tables to view the gender and ethnicity distributions at different hospital system levels. This allowed us to see the breakdown of each demographic group at each level of the hierarchy, and identify any patterns or clusters. Next, we used a correlation matrix to visualize the strength and direction of correlations between variables. This helped us identify any potential multicollinearity between variables. Based on our findings, we decided to keep only relevant variables, selectively remove irrelevant ones, and normalize numerical variables.

After cleaning and transformation, we analyzed the dataset using descriptive statistics techniques such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, minimum value, maximum value, quartile ranges, boxplot diagrams, scatter plots, histograms, and frequency tables to gain insights into the distribution and spread of the data. We compared the results across the entire sample and across specific subgroups to assess the significance of our observations and identify any potential associations. We also explored the effects of categorical variables on continuous variables and vice versa using statistical tests such as ANOVA, t-tests, and chi-squared tests.

Finally, we created regression models to predict the number of men and women enrolled in each hospital system given the demographic features and hospital system type. Specifically, we used logistic regression to model binary responses indicating enrollment in each category, and linear regression to estimate continuous outcomes such as total enrollment, treatment costs, and racial diversity index. We evaluated the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, and MAE.

We concluded that our analysis identified several factors associated with increasing the proportion of men and women in the US medical community. Our analysis suggested that increased representation of women and women's entrepreneurial skills and expertise, combined with improved transparency and communication, are critical drivers for reducing gender inequality in the US medical industry. Specifically, increased attention paid to women's needs, inclusive labs and facilities, and better training and awareness of potential bias and harassment risks could significantly contribute to improving female representation in medical care. Further, by focusing on female-specific initiatives, we can begin to build momentum towards eliminating gender segregation in the future.
