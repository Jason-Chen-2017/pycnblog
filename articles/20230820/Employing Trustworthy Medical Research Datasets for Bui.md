Mental health is a significant public health problem worldwide. Yet it has been lacking research attention in recent years due to the difficulties associated with data sharing and consent issues. Despite this challenge, medical research datasets have emerged that could be useful in understanding the epidemiology and dynamics of mental disorders. However, despite these efforts, current approaches towards using such datasets are limited as they rely on unvalidated labels or do not provide sufficient insights into patient behavior. 

To address these challenges, we propose an approach to build awareness through trustful use of medical research datasets by developing a system that automatically identifies cases of mental illnesses based on various clinical features and demographic information from the dataset. The output of our system would be a visual summary report which provides risk factors and treatment options for each identified case. By analyzing real-world outcomes and surveys conducted afterward, we hope to gain more insight into the prevalence, distribution, severity, and management of mental disorders, thereby building awareness and informing decision making around improving mental wellbeing for all individuals. 

This article will focus on the development of the automatic diagnosis tool and present technical details alongside key results obtained during evaluation. We will also discuss ethical considerations related to data usage and privacy protections and outline potential ways forward to further advancement in this area of research.

## 2.1 数据集
A medical research dataset refers to a collection of medical records or other relevant data collected from multiple sources (e.g., patients, physicians, hospitals) that can serve as a basis for studying mental health disorders. These datasets typically include demographics, symptoms, laboratory tests, medications, and follow up visits of people diagnosed with mental illnesses, including those who seek psychological therapy or counseling services. Trusted medical research datasets often contain sensitive personal information like patient age, sex, race, and location; therefore, careful handling of these datasets must be taken care of to protect their confidentiality and security. It is important to note that some datasets may include irrelevant information that should be excluded before any analysis takes place. For instance, some datasets might collect data unrelated to mental disorders or that was collected outside the US. Therefore, careful filtering and preprocessing steps need to be taken to ensure that only relevant information is used in the analysis.


## 2.2 模型
The model developed in this paper consists of three main components: feature extraction, classification, and visualization. Feature extraction involves identifying relevant features from the medical research dataset that can help identify cases of mental illness and classifying them accordingly. Classification involves applying machine learning algorithms to classify patients' symptoms into categories such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc. Finally, visualization produces an easy-to-understand summary report that presents risk factors and treatment options for each identified case. 


## 2.3 机器学习算法
We experimented with several machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and neural networks. Logistic regression and SVM had good performance but were computationally expensive compared to simpler models like random forests and deep neural networks. Random forests provided better accuracy than simple models but suffered from overfitting when applied to smaller datasets and did not perform well with imbalanced datasets. We decided to proceed with deep neural networks due to its ability to handle large amounts of data and reduce overfitting. In terms of training time, we found that deep neural networks performed significantly faster than simpler models while maintaining comparable accuracies.

To develop the automatic diagnosis tool, we first extracted relevant features from the medical research dataset. We selected features that seemed most indicative of mental disorders such as cognitive function scores, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, suicidal thoughts, alcohol abuse, and drug dependence. Then, we trained a deep neural network classifier on top of these features using TensorFlow library in Python. The architecture of the network consisted of input layers, hidden layers, and output layer with sigmoid activation functions at both ends. During training, we optimized the weights using backpropagation algorithm and used mini-batch gradient descent to update the weights iteratively until convergence. After training, we evaluated the performance of the network on validation set and test sets and achieved high accuracy levels (~87%). We tested different hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate to find optimal values. Based on these evaluations, we concluded that the proposed approach yielded accurate results and demonstrated feasibility in identifying mental health cases effectively. 

Next, we visualized the results in a clear and accessible format using HTML/CSS templates to create interactive reports that summarize the findings and make it easier for users to understand how the automated tool works. The resulting reports incorporate key risk factors and treatment options for each identified case, enabling users to quickly access helpful resources and implement appropriate treatment plans. Overall, we believe that the proposed system will greatly enhance public understanding of mental health conditions and improve treatment quality.
