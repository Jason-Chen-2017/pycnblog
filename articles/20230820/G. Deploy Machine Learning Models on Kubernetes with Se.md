Machine learning (ML) is becoming increasingly popular in today's society as it enables businesses to make better decisions based on large amounts of data by analyzing patterns within the data. However, deploying ML models into production environments can be challenging since it requires a strong understanding of containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.

To address these challenges, we are often faced with two main approaches when it comes to deploying ML models:

1. Microservice-based deployment - A microservices architecture is commonly used for deploying complex applications, making it easier to manage and scale services independently of each other. Within the microservices architecture, individual models or components are deployed separately as independent containers that communicate with each other through APIs.

2. Serverless/Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)-based deployment - FaaS platforms offer a simple way of developing and managing cloud functions without having to worry about server management, scaling, load balancing, etc., making it ideal for model serving scenarios.

In this article, we will focus on the second approach called "Serverless/Function-as-a-Service" (FaaS)-based deployment, specifically using AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, or any other FaaS provider supported by Seldon Core. We'll also use Seldon Core, an open-source framework built around Kubernetes and its API conventions, which provides a straightforward interface for deploying models in production environments.

Seldon Core is designed to work seamlessly with all major cloud providers, including AWS EKS, GKE, AKS, Azure AKS, OpenShift, IBM Cloud, ROKS, and more. It supports stateful deployments, multi-armed bandits routing, advanced analytics like outlier detection, metrics monitoring, tracing, and more. It also offers powerful features like model auto-scaling, A/B testing, canary releases, shadow traffic, and more. Finally, it has an extensive documentation library covering topics ranging from installation to customizing the deployment process.

Overall, Seldon Core is an excellent choice for deploying ML models into production environments due to its ease of use, scalability, support for multiple cloud providers, and wide range of advanced features. Let's get started!


# 2.核心概念术语说明

Before we dive into the details of deploying machine learning models on Kubernetes using Seldon Core, let's clarify some key concepts and terms you need to know:

1. Containerization technology - Docker is a widely used containerization technology that allows developers to package their software into lightweight containers that can run anywhere, whether it's locally on your computer or in the cloud. Kubernetes is another important containerization technology that manages containerized application deployments across a cluster of nodes. Both Docker and Kubernetes are essential for deploying machine learning models onto Kubernetes.

2. Cluster orchestration tool - Orchestrators such as Kubernetes provide the necessary tools for scheduling and managing containers across a cluster of nodes. They allow users to easily manage containerized applications, automate tasks, and improve resource utilization. For example, they help ensure that containers are restarted if they fail, automatically assign resources based on requirements, and enable blue-green deployments for zero downtime upgrades.

3. Helm chart - Helm charts are templates that define the configuration settings for different applications and their dependencies. The helm chart format is easy to read and understand, making it easy to configure and customize certain aspects of an application's behavior. Helm charts are typically packaged together with the application code so that the end user only needs to install one command to set up everything required for the application to function correctly.

4. YAML file - YAML files are human-readable text files that contain structured data in a readable format. YAML files are typically used for configuring various aspects of an application, such as environment variables, ports, volumes, secrets, and more.

5. Kubeflow - Kubeflow is an open-source project dedicated to making it easier to build, deploy, and manage machine learning workflows on top of Kubernetes. Kubeflow provides a combination of tools and components that simplify the process of building and running machine learning pipelines. Kubeflow includes several projects, including TensorFlow Operator, PyTorch Operator, JWA, Katib, Notebooks, MXNet Operator, Apache Airflow, and Kubeflow Pipelines.

6. Model serving - Model serving refers to the process of hosting the trained machine learning model(s) and providing access to them over a network. In the context of Kubernetes, model serving involves packaging the model alongside its dependencies and then exposing it through a REST endpoint that clients can interact with. Common approaches include deploying the model directly as a pod inside the same cluster or creating a separate service outside the cluster to handle requests and forward them to the model pod.

With these key concepts in mind, let's move on to the specific steps required to deploy our machine learning model using Seldon Core.
