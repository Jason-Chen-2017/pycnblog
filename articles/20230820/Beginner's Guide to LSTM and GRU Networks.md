# 1.简介
  

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks are two of the most commonly used neural network architectures in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and speech recognition applications. Both models have been successful at addressing some key challenges associated with deep learning. In this article, we will review these two popular models from a beginner’s perspective by providing an introduction, explanation of terms, detailed steps for implementation, and code examples. The goal is to provide the reader with a comprehensive guide on how to use both models effectively within their NLP projects or other contexts.

# 2.背景介绍
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that can learn complex non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs using multiple layers of neurons, making them ideal for many applications such as image classification, text analysis, speech recognition, and predictive modeling. However, DNNs suffer from several drawbacks including high computational complexity, vanishing gradients, and sensitivity to initialization parameters. These shortcomings make it difficult to train large-scale neural networks for real-world tasks without carefully tuning hyperparameters and regularization techniques.

One way to address these issues is to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs allow information to persist over time through sequential connections among units, which makes them particularly suitable for modeling sequence data such as sentences, texts, audio signals, and video frames. There are two main types of RNNs: long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Each type has unique properties that enable it to handle different kinds of problems better than others. 

In this article, we will discuss the details of both LSTM and GRU networks and compare their pros and cons alongside various aspects of practical application. We will also demonstrate step-by-step procedures for implementing each model using Python libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Finally, we will discuss potential future directions for these models and explore ideas for further research.

Before we proceed to discuss the specifics of LSTM and GRU networks, let us first understand some basic concepts and terminology related to RNNs. 

## A brief overview of RNNs

An RNN consists of repeating modules called cells that process input sequences one element at a time. At each step of processing, the cell takes an input vector and its previous state as inputs, and generates an output vector and a new state that represents the cell’s current context. The overall processing is repeated iteratively for all elements in the sequence, allowing the network to capture temporal dependencies between events or elements in the sequence. 


### Inputs and Outputs

The input to an RNN is typically a sequence of vectors representing observed events, such as words, images, or sounds. The length of the sequence is often variable and may range from few milliseconds to seconds or minutes depending on the nature of the task being addressed.

The output of an RNN at each timestep is typically a single vector, but it could also be a sequence of vectors if necessary. For example, when training an image captioning system, the output might be a sequence of word vectors representing the predicted sentence. Similarly, when analyzing speech, the output would be a sequence of feature vectors representing the mouth movements.

### Hidden States

The hidden states of an RNN represent the internal memory of the cell during the course of processing the input sequence. At any given point in time, the state of the cell contains information about what has been processed so far, as well as what remains to be processed. During training, the hidden states are updated based on the error computed at each step against the desired target value(s). After training, the final hidden state(s) provides a summary representation of the entire sequence.

A typical architecture diagram for an RNN looks something like this:


In this diagram, the input sequence passes through the input layer, where each element in the sequence is mapped to an input vector via a transformation function. This input vector is then passed through the first hidden layer of the RNN, where each element in the sequence is combined with its corresponding hidden state and transformed into an output vector. The output vector is then passed through another fully connected layer before generating the final output prediction. 

In practice, there are usually more layers involved in the network, with each subsequent layer taking the output of the previous layer as input. The number of hidden units per layer varies depending on the problem being addressed. Typically, deeper RNNs (with more layers and larger hidden units) require more computation resources but perform better on challenging tasks involving longer input sequences.

## Sequence Data

Sequence data refers to sequential data points where the order matters. Examples include natural language text, stock prices, and sensor readings. It is important to note that sequence data is distinct from traditional data because it involves interactions between the individual elements. Traditional datasets, on the other hand, only contain a collection of independent observations. 

To deal with sequence data, RNNs employ special structures that allow them to maintain contextual relationships between the input elements. The underlying idea behind an RNN is that each element depends on the previous elements in the sequence, enabling the model to capture complex patterns in the data. By maintaining a record of past events, the RNN learns to generate accurate predictions even when faced with sequences that have not seen before.

Another advantage of RNNs over standard feedforward neural networks (FNNs) is their ability to process input sequences of arbitrary lengths. Standard FNNs do not consider the ordering of the input features and cannot accurately leverage the sequential nature of the input data. On the other hand, RNNs can easily handle variable-length inputs because they can keep track of their position in the sequence while processing each element.

## Backpropagation Through Time

Training an RNN requires backpropagating errors through the entire sequence, rather than just the last element. To achieve this, the RNN uses a technique called “Backpropagation through Time” (BPTT) that allows the gradient of the loss function to propagate backward through the entire sequence. BPTT enables the RNN to adjust its weights incrementally throughout the sequence, leading to faster convergence and improved accuracy compared to updating weights after processing each element independently.

## Common Types of RNNs

There are three main types of RNNs: vanilla RNNs, LSTM RNNs, and GRU RNNs. Vanilla RNNs are the simplest type of RNNs, consisting of a set of unidirectional or bidirectional cells that take the same input at each step. While simple, these models are unable to handle long-term dependencies due to the limited amount of memory available to them. Additionally, they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which means that small changes to the weights cause the activations to become virtually zero, causing the model to lose accuracy.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs offer a solution to this issue by introducing a “cell state” that acts as temporary memory to store relevant information across timesteps. The cell state is responsible for storing long-term dependencies in the input sequence. LSTMs are composed of four separate components:

1. Input gate: Determines how much information should be added to the cell state based on the input and previous cell state
2. Forget gate: Determines how much information should be removed from the cell state based on the input and previous cell state
3. Output gate: Determines how much information should be emitted from the cell state based on the input and previous cell state
4. Cell update: Computes a new value for the cell state based on the input, forget, and output gates and the previous cell state.

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are similar to LSTMs, but simpler since they don’t involve the additional gating mechanisms required for the forget and output gates. They consist of two gates that control whether the input, forget, or output values are added to the cell state. GRUs are generally considered to be slightly faster and less memory-consuming than LSTMs, especially for smaller networks.
