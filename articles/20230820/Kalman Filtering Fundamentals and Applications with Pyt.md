# 1.简介
  

Kalman过滤器（Kalman filter）是一个经典的滤波器，它的功能是在线性系统中预测和纠正不确定性。在跟踪移动物体时，它被广泛应用于自动驾驶、无人机、船舶导航等领域。

相比其他滤波方法，比如贝叶斯滤波（Bayesian filtering），卡尔曼滤波具有更好的抗噪声性能。它适用于高维非线性系统，并可以处理动态环境中的复杂多变性。同时，卡尔曼滤波对噪声的鲁棒性也很强。

本文将详细介绍卡尔曼滤波算法的基本原理，并基于Python语言用代码示例展示其实现过程。希望能够帮助读者快速理解卡尔曼滤波及其应用。

# 2. KALMAN FILTERING FUNDAMENTALS AND APPLICATIONS WITH PYTHON CODE
## 2.1 Introduction to Kalman Filters 
Kalman Filter is a type of linear regression used in the estimation of dynamic systems. The basic principle behind it involves taking into account noisy measurements from a dynamical system and generating estimates based on these measurements. 

The process of Kalman filtering can be summarized as follows: 

1. Prediction step - generate predictions of state variables at times t+1 using the previous values of the estimated state variables
2. Measurement update step - incorporate new measurement data into the prediction by updating the estimate of the state variable(s) being tracked
3. Correction step - adjust any errors or biases that may have been introduced due to noise or sensor limitations during the two steps above.

To begin with, we need to understand the following key concepts of Kalman filters:

1. State Space Model - This model describes the dynamic behavior of a system as a set of states (X) and their corresponding rate of change (dX/dt). 
2. Linear Dynamical System - A dynamical system is said to be linear if all its equations are linear in terms of the states and time derivatives. In other words, if one equation contains another, then both must also contain the derivative term. We assume the existence of such a system given some initial conditions for its state variables X_0.
3. Process Noise and Sensor Noise - These are random disturbances added to the true dynamics of the system. They affect the current state of the system, but do not cause it to deviate significantly from what would happen without them. 

We will now go through each concept individually, along with an example to explain how they work together. Let's start by understanding the state space model. 

### State Space Model
A typical state space model has four main components:

1. States - denoted by x[k], where k refers to the time index. Each state captures a specific aspect of the system, which varies over time and depends on its history up to that point. It can be either observed directly or inferred indirectly via other measured inputs. Examples include position, velocity, acceleration, heading, yaw angle etc.

2. Dynamic Model - This consists of a set of differential equations that describe the relationship between the various states of the system at different points in time. We typically assume that the system changes slowly over time, so we only need first-order approximations of the equations. For instance, consider a simple model of a car driving on a straight road. Its states could be the location (x), speed (v), orientation (psi) and angular velocity (psidot) of the car. The dynamic model could look something like this:

   ```
   xdot = vcos(psi)
   ydot = vsin(psi)
   psidot = v/L * tan(steering input)
   
   ```
   Here, L is the distance between the front and rear axles of the car, steering input is the desired curvature of the path taken by the car. The resulting acceleration affects the direction of travel of the car and hence influences its future trajectory. 
   
   Note that the dynamic model does not depend explicitly on any external factors, like wind, weather, traffic signals etc., as these can be modeled implicitly as well. 

3. Control Input - These influence the dynamic behaviors of the system, allowing us to manipulate the system in response to changing circumstances. Examples include braking, accelerating, steering the vehicle etc. 

4. Observation Error - This represents any error in measuring the actual value of the states. It is assumed to be additive and Gaussian, i.e., normally distributed around the expected value with some variance. For instance, let’s say our car is tracking a target with constant velocity V=5m/s. If the actual velocity of the car oscillates slightly outside this range, then the observation error becomes non-zero.

Based on the above information, we can write down the full state vector as:
  
```
X[k] = [x,y,z,dx,dy,dz,dpsi,dpsidot,...,...] 
```

where dx, dy, dz represent the rates of change of the position vector. Similarly, dpsi and dpsidot represent the rates of change of the yaw angle psi and its rate respectively.

In summary, the state space model specifies the relationship between the different states of the system and provides us with ways to modify its behavior under control input.


Now that we have covered the basics of the state space model, let's move onto linear dynamical systems. 


## 2.2 Linear Dynamical Systems

Linear dynamical systems are characterized by a set of linear equations of motion, consisting of the form:

```
x[k+1] = Ax[k] + Bu[k] + w[k],     where    w[k] ~ N(0, Q)
y[k]   = Cx[k] + Du[k] + v[k],     where    v[k] ~ N(0, R)
```

Here, A is called the transition matrix, B is the control input matrix, u[k] is the input signal applied at time step k, and w[k] and v[k] are white noise processes representing the process and measurement noise respectively. The output y[k] is generated by applying a linear mapping function to the state x[k].

If there are multiple inputs u[k], then we use the block diagonal identity matrix I[k] instead of separate matrices U[k]:

```
u[k]   = sum_j Ui[jk]     ,    where I[jk] = eye(n), n is the number of inputs

w[k]   = sum_i Wi[ik]     ,    where W[ik] ~ N(0, QT)

v[k]   = sum_l Vi[lk]     ,    where V[lk] ~ N(0, RT)
```

Here, T is the total time horizon.

The linear nature of the system ensures that its evolution can be easily predicted using the formula `x[k+1] = Ax[k]` where x[k+1] and x[k] represent the next and present state vectors respectively. Hence, the system transitions from one state to the next in discrete time steps.

However, in practice, real world systems often exhibit nonlinearities and uncertainties. To capture these effects, we introduce the concept of a stochastic dynamical system, which assumes the presence of uncertainty in the input signals. This means that the system evolves according to a Markov chain with state transitions dependent on both past and present observations of the system.

This assumption allows us to express the probability distribution of the system as a conditional distribution given its previous state and input:

`P(x[t+1] | x[t], u[t]) = N(Ax[t] + Bu[t], Sigma)`

where x[t+1] is the predicted state at time t+1, x[t] is the current state, u[t] is the input at time t, A and B are the state transition and control matrices respectively, and Sigma is the covariance matrix capturing the uncertainties in the system.

Understanding the fundamental ideas behind Kalman filtering requires a solid background knowledge of linear algebra, probability theory, and statistics. However, we hope that by introducing the necessary mathematical concepts in simple language, we can provide a good foundation for anyone interested in learning more about Kalman filtering.
