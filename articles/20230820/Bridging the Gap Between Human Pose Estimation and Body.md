Human pose estimation (HPE) is one of the most popular tasks in computer vision field that aims to detect keypoints on a human body. In recent years, many researchers have proposed various methods for HPE, including approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep learning with graphical models, or handcrafted feature extraction techniques such as SIFT. 

The goal of this paper is to present an approach that bridges the gap between HPE and body model regression by introducing an additional loss correction step. We focus on the problem of correcting imbalanced sample distribution, where only a small number of samples are annotated with accurate labels while others are predicted from weakly-annotated data. To address this challenge, we propose an ensemble method called Stacked Multi-Task Learning (SMTL) framework, which consists of two stages:

1. Stage I: Prediction stage using weakly labeled training data to generate predictions for missing annotations. 
2. Stage II: Refinement stage using accurately labeled training data and predicted results generated in stage I to train a stronger classifier for predicting final poses.

Our experiments show that our SMTL framework can effectively handle imbalanced sample distribution during both stages and significantly improve performance over other state-of-the-art approaches for HPE. Moreover, we introduce a novel technique called "Distribution Matching" to automatically adjust the weights of different losses during training, making it possible to leverage more informative features without sacrificing accuracy on the minority class. The proposed method achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches under multiple evaluation metrics.


In conclusion, our work introduces a new machine learning architecture called SMTL that combines HPE and body model regression into a single unified pipeline. It proposes a simple yet effective way of handling imbalanced sample distribution by incorporating information from weakly labeled training examples while training a powerful classifier for refining predictions. This approach offers significant benefits when dealing with challenging real-world scenarios where only a small portion of samples are annotated with high quality. Our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple evaluation metrics. 


# 2.Background Introduction

We consider a set of $N$ images taken by a camera and their corresponding annotated human poses $\{(I_i, A_{ij})\}_{i=1}^{N}$ where each image contains at least $k$-number of human poses $(A_{ij})_{j=1}^k$. Let $p_i$ be the probability of any given pose being correctly identified by the human annotator, i.e., $p_i \in [0,1]$ for all $i$. For example, if there are $n_i$ good poses out of $k$ total annotations for each image, then $p_i = n_i/k$, and we assume that these $n_i$ poses correspond to those with highest probabilities of being recognized correctly.

Under this setting, the task of HPE can be formulated as follows: Given an input image $I_i$ with $m$ number of annotated poses, estimate a subset of $k$ poses and their corresponding joint locations $\hat{A}_i = (\hat{x}_j^I, \hat{y}_j^I)$, where $\hat{x}_j^I, \hat{y}_j^I$ denote the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the jth joint of the ith pose respectively. There are several challenges associated with solving this problem, some of which include occlusions, inconsistent annotation styles, partially visible objects, etc. These variations make it difficult to directly optimize for global pose estimates, but instead rely on heuristics or post-processing techniques to obtain reasonable results. However, even with proper care in annotating data and avoiding biases towards certain views, errors due to mistakes in labelling still occur, leading to uneven distributions of annotations among images. 

To address this issue, a common practice involves generating synthetic data using generative adversarial networks (GANs) that mimic the distribution of naturalistic images and synthesize diverse and balanced sets of annotated poses. Despite advances in this direction, such approaches suffer from a fundamental drawback: they require large amounts of manually created data, expensive computational resources, and the need for expertise in domain transfer to learn robust representations of complex shapes and structures. Moreover, their resulting models may not generalize well to unseen environments and cannot adapt to varying lighting conditions or viewpoint angles. Therefore, it remains an open question how well current methods perform on real world images.

Instead, we aim to build a system that can directly infer a dense set of joint locations from raw images without requiring any pre-training or fine-tuning steps. Specifically, we want to design an end-to-end learning model that takes in an image and outputs a set of joint positions and confidence scores describing the probability of each estimated pose belonging to the set of k best candidate poses. By leveraging off-the-shelf CNN architectures like ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet, we hope to achieve significant improvements over previous works that focused solely on optimization-based strategies for estimating pose parameters. While we will use convolutional layers for feature extraction, our main contribution lies in combining them with graph-based structure prediction algorithms that exploit the spatial relationships between body parts to infer complete and accurate pose descriptions. 

One way to bridge the gap between pose estimation and body model reconstruction is to apply multi-task learning (MTL) and stack two sub-tasks: pose estimation and body model regression. In particular, we first train a network to predict a set of keypoint coordinates for each human pose in an input image, treating this task as a classification problem. Once the initial stage has completed, we take the predicted results and augment them with ground truth annotations for the remaining keypoints. Next, we train another network to estimate the deformable mesh representation of the whole body based on these updated annotations, taking this task as a regression problem. Our overall objective is to minimize the difference between the predicted joint positions and actual ones, together with the difference between the estimated mesh and true underlying shape.  

To deal with the class imbalance problem, we use a combination of oversampling the minority class and undersampling the majority class. Oversampling consists of replicating instances from the minority class, while undersampling simply removes instances from the majority class. We also adopt a weighted cross entropy loss function during training that takes into account the relative importance of each individual loss term depending on the degree of difficulty in distinguishing between similar classes. Finally, we employ a novel regularization technique called Distribution Matching that automatically adjusts the weight of different loss terms so that they balance each other out during training. Overall, our strategy attempts to balance the amount of information provided by the two tasks, enabling us to increase the capacity of our model without increasing its complexity or memory requirements. 

While traditional MT and MTL frameworks have been shown to be effective in addressing general purpose object recognition problems, applying them to a highly specialized application involving human pose estimation requires further exploration. Our work provides insights into addressing the specific challenges of modeling human bodies and demonstrates the utility of stacking sub-tasks within a shared multitask learning framework for tackling this challenging problem.
