## Web Scraping Definition and Problem Statement
Scraping is the process of extracting information from a website by programmatically requesting it over the internet using automated scripts or tools. This information can be stored in a database for further analysis or used as part of a larger project to create new applications or services. 

However, scraping has many challenges that make it challenging to get complete data with high accuracy. Among these challenges are dynamic web pages, which load content through JavaScript, security measures such as anti-scraping mechanisms, and even server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, etc., all of which make scaping difficult. To address these issues, developers have started adopting more sophisticated methods for web scraping that involve technologies like Selenium and headless browsers like PhantomJS. These advanced techniques require significant expertise in programming and system administration to configure and use properly, however they allow for greater flexibility and control over scraping operations.

In this article, we will explore basic concepts and principles of web scraping using Python's Beautiful Soup library, a popular tool for parsing HTML and XML documents. We will learn how to extract data from websites based on specific tags and attributes, including text, images, links, and tables. We will also discuss best practices and pitfalls when working with web scraping. Finally, we'll apply our knowledge to some real-world examples and demonstrate how to use web scrapers to automate various tasks and collect large amounts of data.


## Prerequisites

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terms
Before diving into scraping websites with code, let's understand the fundamental concepts and terms involved.
## What is Website Scraping?
Website scraping refers to the act of gathering data from publicly available websites without the permission of the owners. It involves automating web browser actions performed manually by a user to access and extract data from web pages via their API (Application Programming Interface). In simpler words, it means obtaining unauthorized access to computer systems and copying data therefrom.

The purpose of website scraping is typically information extraction. Once obtained, the data may be analyzed, manipulated, and presented in a useful way. Oftentimes, website scraping is done for research purposes, marketing campaigns, business intelligence reports, and other professional uses. Some companies use website scraping to mine data for insights about customer behavior, competitors’ products, or market trends. For example, Amazon scrapes e-commerce sites looking for pricing details before selling them on their platform. Similarly, Google searches the web for relevant ads and builds a comprehensive index of the internet.

## Types of Website Scraping
There are three main types of website scraping: 

1. **Data collection**: Collecting structured data like CSV files or JSON objects. 
2. **Information Extraction:** Extracting specific pieces of data from a website based on predetermined criteria, usually specified by search queries or filters. Examples include social media monitoring, news articles crawling, price tracking, and product review mining.  
3. **Content Analysis:** Identifying patterns and relationships within the content of a webpage or set of webpages, usually in order to gain insight into brand sentiment, consumer preferences, or market dynamics. Examples include stock market analysis, scientific data mining, and opinion polls.  

While each type of website scraping requires different skills and approaches, they share several common characteristics: 

1. **Language-agnostic:** Website scraping is language-independent, meaning it works equally well with web pages written in any language supported by modern web browsers.
2. **Resilient:** Website scraping software should handle variations in website structures and formats gracefully, and adapt its algorithms accordingly to ensure reliable results.
3. **Scalable:** Website scraping projects often require processing multiple thousands of pages per day, so scalability is critical to keep up with demand.
4. **Automatable:** Website scraping software needs to be designed to run continuously and automatically, rather than relying on human intervention or operator assistance.

As with any technology, website scraping is constantly being improved and updated to become more efficient, effective, and cost-effective. Therefore, keeping up to date with the latest developments and best practices is essential to stay ahead of competition.
