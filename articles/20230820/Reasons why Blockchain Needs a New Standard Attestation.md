Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way of sharing and exchanging digital assets in recent years, leading to widespread use cases such as digital identity management, financial transaction processing, supply-chain traceability, and more. However, one key limitation is that it relies on trust between all participating entities for secure data integrity. In this regard, we need a new standard attestation procedure to ensure greater security and reliability in blockchain systems. 

This article will discuss the reasons behind the current shortcomings of existing attestation procedures and propose a novel solution through an intuitive understanding of three essential components: proof generation, verification process, and auditing mechanism. We will present code examples to illustrate how these components work together, enabling developers to easily build their own customizable solutions with ease. Finally, we hope this research can inspire other organizations and individuals to develop similar mechanisms to enhance their blockchain security.

In summary, our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing problems related to the blockchains' attestation approach, emphasize its importance for blockchain applications, and suggest an alternative system design using advanced cryptography techniques. With the proposed framework and methodology, blockchain developers will be able to choose from multiple attestation standards based on their specific needs and constraints while ensuring overall system security. This article aims to provide technical insight into the challenges and potential benefits of creating a new standard attestation protocol and invite readers to contribute to future research efforts.

Blockchain technologies have emerged as an integral part of modern society due to their ability to store and transfer large amounts of digitally represented information quickly and securely without intermediaries. While decentralization allows for easy access to various services and transactions, it also poses several unique security risks. One major problem is establishing trust among all network participants. 

A typical example of the trust issue arising in traditional systems is when two or more parties want to share confidential data over a shared medium such as a public network like the internet. Traditional approaches involve third-party certification authorities (CAs) who sign certificates which authenticate users' identities and verify their ownership over the data. The CAs act as trusted third parties who are responsible for issuing valid certificates and ensuring the authenticity of the data being transmitted. Despite the significant advances made by centralized certificate authorities in recent years, they still remain vulnerable to attacks due to their hierarchical structure and lack of automation capabilities. Furthermore, CAs can be subjected to fraudulent activities by hackers or malicious actors. Therefore, it is crucial for us to come up with better ways to establish trust between entities in decentralized networks. 

One popular solution to address the trust issue is called Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW involves solving complex mathematical puzzles during each block creation process to prove that the miner has sufficient computational resources to generate a valid block. By requiring miners to compete for a small amount of cryptocurrency as a reward, PoW ensures that only those who can afford to invest in hardware and power are granted permission to create blocks. Although PoW provides substantial protection against sybil attacks and unauthorized transactions, it is not perfect because miners have limited incentives to mine consistently since their rewards may decrease over time. Moreover, PoW consumes energy and requires significant capital investment.

The second area where blockchain technology faces issues is its scalability. As the number of nodes and transactions increase, the performance of existing consensus algorithms becomes impaired due to their quadratic complexity. To tackle this challenge, researchers have developed sharding schemes, which divide the network into smaller sub-networks to reduce individual node performance bottlenecks. However, this comes with its own set of problems such as increased latency and reduced throughput. Additionally, there is no guarantee that shards do not get separated over time, further increasing the risk of data loss or tampering. Thus, blockchain developers must continuously monitor the efficacy of different attestation protocols and upgrade them as needed.

In conclusion, blockchain technologies require extensive research to improve their resilience and security levels. There exists a need for a robust attestation scheme that enables true decentralization while providing sufficient guarantees about the integrity of shared data. Our proposal addresses these issues through an intuitive understanding of the three essential components of attestation - proof generation, verification process, and auditing mechanism. It introduces practical code examples showing how these components work together and enables developers to easily customize their attestation processes. Last but not least, we hope this research inspires others to pursue similar ideas and take steps towards building stronger blockchain infrastructure.
