# 1.简介
  

Named entity recognition (NER) is a popular technique used to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates in unstructured text data. The goal of NER is to automatically extract relevant information from the text that can be further processed by other algorithms or systems for better analysis and decision-making.

There are several open source NLP libraries available like Stanford NER Toolkit, Apache OpenNLP, etc., but most of them do not support spaCy’s high accuracy models which are capable of recognizing millions of named entities with high precision and recall rates. 

In this article, we will see how we can use the powerful features provided by the NLTK library alongside with spaCy library to perform NER tasks on English language texts. We will also discuss some implementation details about integrating these two libraries together and what could be future enhancements if any. Let's get started!

# 2. 基础知识
Before moving forward let us understand some basic terms and concepts related to Natural Language Processing and its applications in computer science.

 - Tokenization: It is the process of breaking down a sentence into words and sentences and then assigning each word or sentence an index or tag depending upon its function within the sentence. For example, "I am going to school" tokenization would result in ["I", "am", "going", "to", "school"]. 

 - Linguistic Features: These include various attributes associated with words such as their part of speech, tense, person, number, gender, mood, voice, degree of comparison, case, adjective position, and so on. In natural language processing, linguistic features help identify certain types of phrases or grammatical structures within the text.
 
 - Part-of-speech tagging: This refers to assigning a part of speech label to every single word in a sentence. Common parts of speech tags used in NLP include noun(nouns), verb(verbs), pronoun(pronouns), adjective(adjectives), adverb(adverbs), preposition(prepositions), conjunction(conjunctions), interjection(interjections). 
 
 - Stemming and Lemmatization: Both stemming and lemmatization refer to the process of reducing inflected words to their base form. However, they differ in how they achieve this reduction. 
   
   - Stemming: This involves removing suffixes or endings to the root word. For example, taking "running," "runner," and "run" as separate words where as stemming would reduce all three to the common root word "run."
   
   - Lemmatization: This is similar to stemming except it takes contextual cues into account when deciding whether a given word should be reduced to its lemma or kept as is. For example, both "runners" and "running" may be tagged as nouns, however lemmatization would convert them to singular noun "runner".

Now let us move towards our actual topic i.e. NER using NLTK and SpaCy libraries in Python.

# 3. 核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
1. Dataset Preparation: Before applying any machine learning algorithm, we need to prepare a dataset containing labeled examples of input text and corresponding output labels denoting different types of entities present in the text. The dataset must be well balanced with respect to size, distribution of classes, and distribution of tokens among different documents/examples. An appropriate corpus of news articles or research papers can be used as the training dataset. If you have your own dataset, make sure that it contains only free content without any license restrictions otherwise you cannot directly apply the techniques discussed below.

For this tutorial, we will use the Ontonotes v5.0 release, which contains over 5 billion tokens from more than 7 million newswire stories collected between January 1987 and December 2013. To save time and resources, I will select a subset of this dataset for demonstration purposes. 

2. Install Required Libraries: We will need to install the following python packages: nltk, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and spacy. You can install these packages using pip command. 
```python
pip install nltk numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib spacy
```

We also need to download required resources like trained models for both NLTK and spaCy. You can do that using the following commands: 

NLTK:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')
nltk.download('words')
```

SpaCy:
```python
import spacy
spacy.cli.download("en_core_web_sm") # Downloading small English model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')   # Loading the model
```

After installing and downloading required libraries, now lets load and preprocess our dataset.  

```python
from nltk import ne_chunk, pos_tag, word_tokenize
import re
import spacy

# Load the dataset
with open('/path/to/dataset', 'r') as file:
    raw_text = file.read()
    
# Cleaning up the text
clean_text = re.sub('\W+','', raw_text).lower().strip()

# Splitting the cleaned text into paragraphs
paragraphs = clean_text.split('. ')

# Extracting named entities using spaCy and NLTK
def extract_entities(doc):
    entities = []
    
    # Using spaCy for named entity recognition
    doc = nlp(doc)
    for ent in doc.ents:
        entities.append((ent.text, ent.label_))
        
    # Using NLTK for chunking named entities based on POS tags
    chunks = list(ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize(doc))))

    for chunk in chunks:
        if hasattr(chunk, 'label'):
            entities.append((' '.join([token[0] for token in chunk]),
                             chunk.label()))
            
    return entities

for paragraph in paragraphs[:1]:
    print('Paragraph:', paragraph)
    entities = extract_entities(paragraph)
    print('Entities:')
    for entity in entities:
        print(entity)
    print('-'*20)
```

Here, we first loaded our dataset and cleaned up the text by converting all characters to lowercase and removing special characters. Then, we split the cleaned text into paragraphs and defined a function `extract_entities` to extract entities from the paragraphs using spaCy and NLTK libraries. `spaCy` provides high-accuracy statistical models while `NLTK` uses rule-based approaches. Here, we first use `spaCy` to detect named entities in the document, and if there are none detected, we fall back to `NLTK`. Finally, we loop through all paragraphs and call the `extract_entities` function on each one. For testing purpose, we just selected the first paragraph from the dataset and printed out the extracted entities.
