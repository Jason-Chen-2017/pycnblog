Support vector machines (SVMs) are a popular and powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks in machine learning. SVM is particularly useful when the input data has complex non-linear relationships or when there are many irrelevant features that can distract the model from the actual relationship we want to learn. In this article, I will introduce you to support vector machines step by step using a simple example with linearly separable data points. This article aims at providing a clear understanding of how SVM works and how it compares to traditional linear regression approaches. We also discuss some practical issues such as choosing an appropriate kernel function and regularization parameters. Finally, we examine various hyperparameter tuning techniques like cross validation and grid search to optimize the performance of our models. At the end, we provide a discussion on potential future directions for SVM applications in real world scenarios.

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in machine learning. However, its main drawback is that it does not work well if the data contains complicated non-linear relationships between the independent variables. Therefore, SVM offers a more robust solution by incorporating kernels into the optimization problem. Kernel functions map the original feature space to a higher dimensional space where they become linearly separable. Once we have mapped our dataset onto a high-dimensional space, SVM learns a separate decision boundary that maximizes the margin between the two classes. 

In this article, we will use Python to implement SVM from scratch with the scikit-learn library. We start by exploring the basic concepts of support vector machines and then move towards implementing them through code examples. The following sections cover:

# 2. Basic Concepts of SVM
## 2.1 Problem Formulation 
Suppose we have a training set consisting of $N$ labeled samples $(x_i, y_i)$, where each sample consists of $p$ features $\vec{x}_i$. Let's assume that each sample belongs either to class "positive" ($y_i=+1$) or "negative" ($y_i=-1$). Our goal is to find a hyperplane which best separates these two classes. Mathematically, let's denote the set of positive samples as $\mathcal{P}=\{(x_j, y_j)\}_{j=1}^N$, and the corresponding set of negative samples as $\mathcal{N}=\{(x_j, -y_j)\}_{j=1}^N$. Then, we seek to solve the following optimization problem:

$$\text{minimize}\quad \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[1-y_iy_k(\vec{w}^T\vec{x}_i+\vec{b})]_{k=1}^N + C\sum_{i=1}^{N}\xi_i^2,$$

where $\vec{w}$ is the weight vector representing the normal vector of the hyperplane, $\vec{b}$ is the bias term, $\vec{x}_i=(x_{i1}, x_{i2},..., x_{ip})$ represents the i-th feature vector of the j-th sample, and $C>0$ is the cost parameter. The objective function measures the margin between the decision boundary and the nearest misclassified point, while the sum of second order terms ensures smoothness of the loss function. 

To make sure that the solution found by SVM is indeed the optimal solution, we add constraints on both sides of the equation, namely:

(1) $\forall i \in \{1,\cdots, N\}, \quad \xi_i\geqslant 0.$

This constraint guarantees that all violations of the margin are penalized equally, making the optimization problem convex. Moreover, since we do not know exactly what the value of $\vec{w}$, $\vec{b}$, and $\xi_i$ should be beforehand, we need to impose certain conditions on their values. For simplicity, we choose $\vec{w}$ to be perpendicular to the direction of maximum margin, so that $y_k(\vec{w}^T\vec{x}_i+\vec{b})\geqslant 1$ holds for any sample $i$ and any positive class $k$. Similarly, we fix $\vec{b}=0$, because otherwise it would shift the decision boundary without changing its shape. 

Finally, we note that solving the above optimization problem is NP-hard, which means that there exists no polynomial time algorithm known to date that solves it efficiently for arbitrary inputs. Therefore, several heuristics and approximation methods have been proposed over the years to approximate the solutions to the SVM problem. One such method called "kernel trick", allows us to transform our original feature space into a higher dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. We can write the transformed dataset as $Z = (z_{ij})_{i,j=1}^N$, where each $z_{ij}$ represents the inner product between the i-th feature vector $\vec{x}_i$ and the basis vectors defining the new space. Specifically, given a kernel function $K$, the transformed dataset Z can be computed as follows:

$$Z = K((x_i, y_i)) = (\langle\phi_1(\vec{x}_i), \phi_1(\vec{x}_j)\rangle,..., \langle\phi_q(\vec{x}_i), \phi_q(\vec{x}_j)\rangle)^T,$$

where $\phi_k(x):=\exp(-\gamma||x-\mu_k||^2)$ defines a radial basis function (RBF) centered at $\mu_k$. If $\gamma$ is chosen too large, it may cause overfitting; if $\gamma$ is chosen too small, it may lead to underfitting. To handle these challenges, we usually tune the value of $\gamma$ using cross validation or grid search during the model selection process. 

After computing the transformed dataset, we can apply standard linear algebra operations to solve the SVM problem using any of the solvers provided by the numpy or scipy libraries. These solvers include iterative solvers like gradient descent or Newton's method, and closed form solvers like Lagrange multipliers or quadratic programming.

## 2.2 Regularization Parameter C
The parameter C controls the tradeoff between fitting the training data perfectly and achieving good generalization performance. When C is very small, the optimization problem is likely to overfit the training data, resulting in poor generalization error. On the other hand, when C is very large, the optimization problem is likely to underfit the training data, leading to high variance but low bias. As mentioned earlier, SVM adds a penalty term to the optimization problem, which balances the tradeoff between errors due to overfitting and errors due to underfitting. Intuitively, smaller values of C correspond to stronger regularization, meaning that the algorithm attempts to minimize a larger margin instead of a smaller margin to avoid overfitting. In contrast, larger values of C correspond to weaker regularization, allowing the algorithm to fit the training data slightly better than random guessing.

## 2.3 Non-Separable Data Sets
One limitation of SVM is that it only works well when the data is linearly separable. This is because the SVM problem assumes that the data can be separated by a hyperplane. However, in practice, this assumption may sometimes fail. For instance, consider a scenario where the data looks something like this:


Here, we have two clusters of dots grouped together, and the blue line separating the two groups is actually a quadratic curve. It is impossible to find a straight line that separates the two clusters completely, even though we could project the points onto a lower dimensional subspace and obtain a linear separation. 

Therefore, in practice, SVM is often combined with additional tricks such as adding extra dimensions to capture the nonlinearity present in the data. Another approach is to use ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to combine multiple SVM classifiers with different hyperparameters, which can address the issue of non-separability effectively.
