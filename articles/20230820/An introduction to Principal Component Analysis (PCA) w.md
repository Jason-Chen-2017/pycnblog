# 1.简介
  

Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as empirical orthogonal functions, is one of the most widely used tools in data analysis for reducing dimensions. It can be thought of as a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms multi-dimensional data into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components (PCs). Each PC captures a different feature of the original dataset, making them useful for visualization and interpretation tasks. PCA is typically applied after exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data before further analyses are conducted. While not an exact method of finding underlying structure, it offers an alternative approach to traditional EDA that may provide more meaningful insights about the data. In this article, we will first discuss the basic concepts behind PCA and its applications. We will then review the algorithmic steps involved in performing PCA and explain how the mathematical formulas work. Finally, we will present some Python code examples demonstrating how to use PCA for various applications including clustering, anomaly detection, and image compression. We hope this article provides a good foundation for anyone interested in learning more about PCA.

# 2.基本概念与术语
## 2.1 概念
PCA stands for "principal component analysis," which is a popular statistical technique for reducing the number of variables in a large dataset while preserving most of the relevant information. The purpose of PCA is to identify the main directions or axes of variation in a dataset that contribute most significantly to the variance in the data, and to project the data onto these new axis(s) while minimizing the amount of lost information. By transforming the dataset into a smaller number of principal components, we can reduce the complexity and noise of the original data by eliminating redundant or irrelevant features. Additionally, by understanding the interplay between the principal components and their corresponding eigenvectors, we gain insight into the relationships amongst the original features. These insights can help us to make better decisions regarding our next steps when working with the data.

## 2.2 术语
**Sample:** A single observation from a dataset. For example, if we have measurements on two variables (X and Y), each sample could represent a person's height and weight, respectively. 

**Variable/Feature:** A measurable quantity that represents a characteristic of a sample. For instance, X and Y above are both variables that measure physical characteristics such as height and weight.  

**Data matrix:** A collection of samples and their corresponding values for each variable. This matrix usually has n rows (one per sample) and p columns (one per variable). 

**Covariance matrix:** A symmetric matrix that measures the covariation between pairs of variables in the data matrix. The element at row i and column j of the covariance matrix gives the joint variability of the i-th variable and the j-th variable, and is given by:

$$\Sigma = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n [(x_i-\bar{x}) (y_i-\bar{y})] $$

where $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are the means of $x$ and $y$, respectively. 

**Eigendecomposition of covariance matrix:** When the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is decomposed using eigendecomposition, we obtain two matrices ($U$ and $D$) where:

$$ U D^T = \Sigma $$

The diagonal elements of $D$ give the variances of the principal components, and the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors. Thus, the i-th column of $U$ corresponds to the i-th principal component, and the eigenvalues along the diagonals of $D$ determine the proportion of explained variance by each principal component.

**Standardized data:** Data scaled so that each variable has zero mean and unit standard deviation. This allows us to interpret the coefficients of the eigenvectors directly as measures of the contribution of each variable to each principal component.

## 2.3 PCA的应用场景
PCA can be used in many application areas including:

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): PCA helps to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. Common methods include correlation matrix plots and scree plots, which show the relative contributions of each variable to each principal component, and allow us to estimate the number of principal components needed to capture most of the variance in the data. 

2. Clustering: After applying PCA to preprocess the data, we can cluster the observations based on their similarity in terms of the principal components. There are several clustering algorithms available that take advantage of the resulting projections, including K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.  

3. Dimensionality reduction: Once we have identified the important features in our dataset, we can use PCA to extract a subset of the most informative features and discard the rest. This can be especially helpful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets that contain many redundant or irrelevant features. 

4. Outlier detection: If there are any unexpected or anomalous data points in our dataset, we might want to detect and remove them before proceeding with further analysis. One way to do this is to apply PCA to the data and examine the distribution of the data points along the principal components. Points that fall outside certain percentiles of the distribution are considered anomalies. 

In summary, PCA is a powerful tool for exploring and analyzing multidimensional data by identifying the underlying structure and extracting important features that account for most of the variance in the data. It can be used in a variety of settings, depending on the nature of the data being analyzed and the specific problem being addressed.
