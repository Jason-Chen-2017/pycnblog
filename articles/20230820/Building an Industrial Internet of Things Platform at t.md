# 1.简介
  

Industrial internet of things (IIoT) is a critical technology for unlocking industrial intelligence and revolutionizing manufacturing processes across all sectors. It has become essential to improve efficiency in various aspects of production such as process control, monitoring, quality management, asset management, supply chain optimization, waste reduction and material processing. This article will provide you with information on how to build an industrial IIoT platform that can connect multiple devices from different vendors seamlessly without any configuration required on the devices themselves. We will discuss the technical challenges faced while building this system and explore several solutions to overcome these challenges using cloud computing techniques.

This article assumes a basic understanding of IIoT concepts and terminology. If you are not familiar with these terms or need a refresher, please refer to other articles available online. 

We will also assume some familiarity with Cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure etc., programming languages like Python, Java, C++, Node-RED, MongoDB, Redis etc., networking protocols like TCP/IP, MQTT, OPC UA etc. 

At the end of this article, we hope to shed light on how cloud technologies can be used to develop an industrial IIoT platform. Please share your feedback with us if there is anything missing or incorrect in this article.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology 
In order to understand what an industrial internet of things platform actually entails, it’s important to have a clear understanding of its core components and key concepts. Let’s quickly review them below: 

1. Device Connectivity: Devices communicate with each other to exchange data by sending messages via wireless communication protocols like LoRaWAN, ZigBee, Wi-Fi Direct, etc.

2. Data Storage: Data generated by the devices needs to be stored somewhere so they can be retrieved later when necessary. There are many options to choose from including relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, NoSQL databases like Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, DynamoDB, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), etc. 

3. Message Routing: The data received by the devices needs to be routed appropriately based on the purpose. For example, temperature data should only be sent to certain endpoints for display purposes but not to endpoints related to machine learning models training.

4. Message Filtering: The incoming messages need to be filtered before being processed further to avoid duplicates, errors or unwanted noise. 

5. Event Processing: Once the data is properly filtered, it needs to be processed accordingly. Machine Learning algorithms, decision trees, statistical models, etc. can be trained on this data and then used to make predictions about future events. These predictions can help trigger specific actions within the machines themselves. 

6. Cloud Integration: To integrate the systems together, we need to use cloud services. Cloud providers offer a wide range of services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, etc. which can be easily integrated into our solution. 

By now, we know what makes up the foundation of an industrial IIoT platform. Next, let’s dive deeper into each component and see exactly how they work together.<|im_sep|>|>im_sep|>

# 3. Architecture & Components 
The following diagram depicts the overall architecture of the industrial IIoT platform:<|im_sep|>|>im_sep|>





As shown above, the platform consists of several components that interact with each other to achieve real-time data collection and analysis. Each device connects to the edge gateway through a variety of communication protocols like WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, LTE CAT M1, GSM, etc. A message broker receives these messages and routes them to the appropriate destination. The message filtering component checks for duplicate messages, error messages, or outliers to ensure accurate results. Finally, the event processing component analyzes the data and triggers appropriate actions in the machine itself. 

Now, let’s go ahead and look more closely at each individual component and its role in achieving the desired functionality of the platform.
