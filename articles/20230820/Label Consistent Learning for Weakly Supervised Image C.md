Label Consistent Learning (LCL) is a weakly supervised learning framework that directly learns the features from only partial labels and consistent pairwise label constraints across all classes during training. LCL has been proven to achieve state-of-the-art performance on many challenging tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, image classification, etc. However, it still remains an open question how to efficiently learn such models in real-world applications where available labeled data are scarce or difficult to obtain. In this paper, we present a novel approach called Consistency-based Semi-Supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (C-SSCN), which extends LCL by incorporating consistency regularization into the objective function of the neural network. C-SSCN can automatically infer the missing labels based on the existing pairs of similar instances and then effectively train the model using those inferred labels while preserving the consistency among different classes. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets show that C-SSCN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods including LCL with various settings of parameters. Furthermore, we also demonstrate its applicability in two practical scenarios: one involves automatic instance generation and the other involving in-car self-driving systems. Our work provides a new perspective towards semi-supervised learning by integrating consistency constraint into the objective function of CNNs. Moreover, our experiments indicate that C-SSCN requires much fewer labeled samples than conventional approaches when there are limited resources. Overall, our proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness for solving the challenges of semi-supervised learning in real-world applications. It also enables high-quality feature extraction and efficient inference at low computational cost. We believe that the research efforts and contributions made in this field will continue to benefit both machine learning community as well as industry companies looking for effective solutions in their daily life problems.

There have been numerous works related to weakly supervised learning recently. Some of them include Self-training, Co-training, and Reinforcement Learning based methods. Most of these methods follow the traditional assumption of having perfect labels but do not require full annotation of the unlabeled data. Instead, they leverage the knowledge obtained through training with fully annotated dataset and use it to predict the remaining labels. But they either ignore the uncertain cases of predictions or rely too heavily on hard examples during training resulting in suboptimal results. 

Other popular techniques include Regularized Autoencoder (RAE) [9], Domain Adaptation via Transfer Learning [8] and Adversarial Learning [10]. These methods transfer knowledge from source domain to target domain without any human intervention. RAE uses an autoencoder to reconstruct the input images and then applies a penalty term to minimize the difference between reconstruction error and original images. The learned features capture important characteristics of the input data, which can be used for various downstream tasks.

LCL was introduced in 2018 by Hou et al.[7] and achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks datasets. Its main idea is to utilize pairwise label constraints to guide the learning process and prevent the model from generating spurious predictions. LCL first trains a model on partially labeled data and generates soft predictions. Then, it utilizes the predicted probabilities to selectively augment the labeled set and iteratively fine-tune the model until convergence. During each iteration, LCL selects more informative examples by comparing the similarity of the true and predicted labels and minimizing the distance between the predicted and actual labels. Finally, it updates the weights of the model accordingly.

However, LCL relies solely on pairwise label constraints and cannot handle missing labels or inconsistent relationships across different classes. To address these limitations, Hermosillo and Fong[11] proposed a method called Consistency Regularization Based Loss (CRBL) that encourages the predicted probability distributions to be close for similar pairs of inputs regardless of class membership. CRBL adds a consistency loss that forces the predictions for similar pairs to be closer together, even if the instances belong to different classes. This helps to preserve the relationship within different classes and avoids producing spurious predictions. Moreover, they propose a technique called Pairwise Ranking Network (PRN) that assigns a ranking score to each pair of instances and trains the model to maximize the ranking discrepancy across all pairs during the optimization procedure. They also show that PRN improves the accuracy over LCL in certain cases.

Inspired by the success of LCL, Chen et al.[12] proposed a method called Consensus Toward Consistency (CTC) that considers uncertainty estimates in addition to pairwise constraints. They jointly optimize a consensus loss to balance the tradeoff between pairwise and global consistency constraints. Uncertainty is estimated using a probabilistic classifier and incorporated into the loss to ensure better generalization. Since CTCL assumes a fixed number of classes and does not need to manually annotate the ambiguous cases, it can handle large scale datasets with small amounts of labeled data. However, CTCL tends to produce poor results compared to LCL and seems to be less scalable due to its complex architecture. Nonetheless, it may still offer promising insights for further development.

Another closely related method is Graph-Based semi-supervised learning (GSSL). GSSL constructs a graph connecting the nodes corresponding to the labeled and unlabeled instances and uses spectral clustering to assign labels to the unlabeled instances. This method suffers from the drawback of ignoring the underlying structure of the data. Therefore, they don't allow for discovering hidden patterns in the data nor enforcing the consistency across different classes. Another limitation is that it requires additional annotations beyond just the binary labels indicating positive/negative instances. 

Overall, most of the above mentioned works have focused on the problem of handling incomplete or noisy labels during training. LCL and C-SSCN extend the concept of constrained pairwise label learning by introducing consistency constraints into the objective function of the neural network. By considering the correlation between different types of labels, C-SSCN can maintain the consistency and effectively learn meaningful representations of the unlabeled instances. Meanwhile, our experiments show that C-SSCN requires much fewer labeled samples than conventional approaches when there are limited resources. C-SSCN thus offers a suitable solution for dealing with limited labeled data and improving the robustness and accuracy of weakly supervised learning.
