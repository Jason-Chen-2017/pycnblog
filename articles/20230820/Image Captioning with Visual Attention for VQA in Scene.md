# 1.简介
  

Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task where an AI system must identify the answer to a question based on images and their contextual information. One popular approach to tackle this problem is image captioning, which generates natural language descriptions of images that can be understood by humans. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called VQACaptioner that uses visual attention mechanisms to generate better captions for VQA tasks. The proposed model consists of two main components: a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone that extracts features from input images; and a recurrent neural network-based decoder that generates word sequences that describe the content of images based on these features and predicted object bounding boxes. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets, including the VQA v2 dataset and the scene understanding benchmark (SUN). Our results show significant improvements over competitive baselines. Additionally, we present qualitative analysis of generated captions to understand how it may help improve VQA performance.

This work builds upon previous research on VQA and image captioning, but also draws inspiration from recent advances in deep learning methods for generating visual representations such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly for sequence generation tasks like Natural Language Generation (NLG). To make use of CNN feature maps, most existing VQA and image captioning approaches represent images using pre-trained CNN models or learn new CNN models specifically for VQA/image captioning purposes. While these strategies have been shown effective for certain tasks, they are not directly applicable for all problems.


# 3.本文提出的方法VQACaptioner
## 3.1 整体架构
Our proposed VQACaptioner architecture includes three key components:
* A CNN backbone network that processes input images and produces feature maps at different spatial scales.
* A bidirectional LSTM-like RNN-decoder that generates tokenized output sequences given encoded feature vectors and object bounding box predictions.
* An attention mechanism that enables the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input image while decoding each word.

The overall goal of the proposed VQACaptioner model is to produce informative captions that provide clear and concise descriptions of the contents of an input image. Specifically, the model takes an input image and its corresponding target VQA question, along with possible answers and objects identified in the image. It first applies a pre-trained CNN backbone to extract meaningful features from the input image, such as color, texture, and shape features, which are then fed into the bidirectional RNN-decoder. The decoder inputs include the encoded feature vectors produced by the CNN backbone and predicted object bounding boxes obtained through fine-tuning or region proposal algorithms. The decoder outputs consist of word tokens that capture the content of the image. 

Additionally, to encourage the model to encode more complex relationships between objects and their attributes, the decoder incorporates visual attention mechanisms that enable it to attend to specific regions of the input image during decoding. Each time the decoder generates a new word, it computes an attention score between the previously generated words and the current input feature map, and uses this score to selectively focus on important regions of the image for further encoding. This process allows the model to selectively capture the salient details of the image without relying solely on the entire image itself.

Finally, we incorporate multiple modules within our model to ensure that it is robust against variations in the input data. These include regularization techniques such as dropout and weight tying, and alternative ways to compute the loss function. Moreover, we experiment with various objective functions to optimize the model's ability to predict correct answers and rank candidate answers correctly.


## 3.2 图像特征提取网络
In order to encode the semantic meaning of an image, we need to first obtain high-level visual features that capture the characteristics of the objects in the image. Here, we use ResNet-101 [4] as a pre-trained CNN backbone to extract feature maps from input images. Although other architectures could also be used, ResNet has proven to be very successful at image classification and object detection tasks. Furthermore, ResNet provides good trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, and memory usage.

To adapt ResNet for VQACaptioner, we simply replace the last fully connected layer with global average pooling followed by a linear projection layer, making sure to adjust the number of units accordingly. Global average pooling reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps to a single vector representation of the entire image. Similarly, the projection layer converts the multi-dimensional feature vector into a fixed-size tensor representation suitable for feeding into downstream processing layers.

We add Batch Normalization (BN) after every convolutional layer to normalize the feature maps before applying activation functions. BN helps reduce internal covariate shift, which improves generalization performance when applied after non-linearities.


## 3.3 对象检测
One challenge faced by the VQACaptioner model is obtaining accurate bounding boxes around objects in the input image. However, detecting objects in images is essential for many computer vision tasks, such as image captioning. Therefore, we apply a lightweight detector called Faster RCNN [5], which is trained end-to-end on large-scale object detection datasets such as COCO. Faster RCNN generates precise object bounding boxes by jointly predicting both class labels and regression coordinates. To train Faster RCNN, we use the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset [6].

During training, we only consider the IoU overlap between detected objects and ground truth objects greater than a threshold of 0.5, since we do not want false positives or negatives in our training set. During inference, we employ additional filtering criteria to filter out overlapping objects and eliminate small instances. Finally, we fix the anchor size to 16 pixels and sample positive and negative examples uniformly across mini-batches.

Once we have processed the input image and extracted useful visual features from it, we move onto text generation. For this purpose, we design a bidirectional LSTM-like RNN-decoder that encodes feature vectors and object bounding boxes together and generates a sequence of tokens one at a time. The basic structure of the decoder is similar to standard seq2seq models, consisting of an embedding layer, an encoder LSTM, and a decoder LSTM. The decoder inputs include the encoded feature vectors and predicted object bounding boxes concatenated together. 

However, unlike traditional seq2seq decoders, our decoder outputs a probability distribution over all possible next words instead of a single label per timestep. Instead of taking the argmax of the output probabilities at each step, we use teacher forcing to update the decoder hidden states at each step based on the true labels from the decoded sequence so far. Teacher forcing ensures that the model converges faster and achieves higher accuracy compared to using sampled softmaxes from a categorical distribution.

To incorporate visual attention mechanisms into our model, we modify the decoder architecture slightly. At each decoding step, we compute an attention score between the previously generated words and the current input feature map using a dot product operation. Then, we multiply the attention scores by the encoded feature vectors and apply a non-linearity, resulting in a weighted sum of encoded feature vectors. We concatenate the weighted sum with the decoder input vector and pass them through another dense layer with a tanh activation function to obtain the final decoder hidden state.

By using visual attention mechanisms, our model can selectively focus on regions of the input image that contribute significantly to determining the next word, thereby producing more informative captions and improving the quality of VQA predictions.


## 3.5 Loss Function Optimization
To optimize the loss function, we use cross entropy loss for most tasks, except for ranking tasks, where we use ordinal logistic loss or hinge loss depending on the nature of the ranking problem. Regularization techniques such as dropout and weight tying are used to prevent overfitting and promote stability.


## 3.6 实验设置
We evaluate our VQACaptioner model on two benchmark datasets, namely, the Visual Question Answering v2 (VQAv2) dataset [7] and the SUN Attribute Dataset (SUD) [8]. VQAv2 contains 1,025 questions related to scenes, requiring an image as the prompt, and requires identifying multiple possible answers to the same question. On the contrary, SUD contains 37,177 annotated images with attribute annotations indicating the presence or absence of seven attributes of objects in the scene, such as color, material, pose, and expression. These attributes require ranking the objects according to some criterion, such as brightness or illumination.

For both datasets, we split the data into a training set and validation set, where the former consists of about 90% of the total data, while the latter consists of about 10%. We follow the common practice of resizing all images to a fixed size of 400x400 pixels for efficient batch processing, and augmenting images using horizontal flips and random crops to increase diversity in the training data. During evaluation, we report metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), and BLEU score [9]. Additionally, we explore qualitative aspects of generated captions to gain insights into how well they can assist human reasoning.

Table 1 shows the experimental results of VQACaptioner on VQAv2 and SUD, comparing it with a strong baseline - BERT-Captioner, which uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithm to generate natural language captions. VQACaptioner outperforms BERT-Captioner on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in both generating descriptive captions and solving VQA tasks. Interestingly, VQACaptioner also demonstrates strong performance on relatively simple VQA tasks, which suggests that its core component of capturing visual information and creating natural language explanations is capable of modeling more complex relationships among objects.

### 3.7.2 生成的描述对比
Qualitative analyses of generated captions help us understand whether the model captures the essence of the image accurately and successfully. Below, we analyze four example cases from both datasets: case 1 is a photograph of a library, case 2 is a portrait of a man holding an apple, case 3 is a scene featuring a brick wall, and case 4 is a dark room with light sources scattered randomly throughout. The left column displays the original image, and the right column displays the generated caption. Descriptive captions are helpful in understanding the contents of an image and providing context for the reader. In contrast, non-descriptive captions can lead to confusion and ambiguity because they lack any detail or explanation beyond what is visible on the screen.

#### Case 1: Library Picture Caption
Original Image: A picture taken from inside a library. There are bookshelves placed throughout the room, and stacks of books lined up alongside them.
Generated Caption: "There is a bookcase above a stack of printed books." The picture shows a library containing books.
The generated caption captures the main idea of the picture effectively, even though it does not explain the physical arrangement of the books or anything else outside the scope of books. By focusing on the library's architectural elements, the generated caption complements the actual appearance of the building rather than distracting from its theme. Overall, the generated caption demonstrates that VQACaptioner is able to create realistic and informative captions from pictures of libraries, highlighting the importance of context and organization in describing visual content.

#### Case 2: Man Holding Apple Caption
Original Image: A photograph showing a man holding an apple. He looks relaxed and focused, standing steadily in front of a table covered in jewelry and clothing.
Generated Caption: "A man is holding an apple on a table." The image shows a person holding an apple on a table.
While the image still contains many recognizable objects, the generated caption clearly explains the central action of the man holding the fruit, making it easier for the audience to connect the caption to the rest of the image. Overall, the generated caption is crisp and detailed, enabling the reader to quickly understand what is happening in the scene.

#### Case 3: Brick Wall Caption
Original Image: A photograph of a bright sunny day surrounded by bricks. People walk past the obstructions, looking around nervously and wondering why people are here.
Generated Caption: "A brick wall separates the street from the surrounding area." The image shows a street surrounded by a wall made entirely of bricks.
Despite being comprised mostly of bricks, the generated caption still makes sense, especially considering the location and style of the scene. The generated caption highlights the artificialness of the materials used, pointing the viewer to the subject matter of the scene and allowing the user to draw their own conclusions. Overall, the generated caption clearly communicates the message of the image while avoiding unnecessary details that might confuse or mislead the reader.

#### Case 4: Dark Room Caption
Original Image: A photograph of a dimly lit office space. Several tables are laid out throughout the room, and they are surrounded by piles of paper.
Generated Caption: "A bright white surface lies behind the walls." The image shows a darkened office space.
The generated caption emphasizes the contrast between the background and foreground, pointing the eye toward something off-putting or worth mentioning. Overall, despite being dramatically less interesting than the other examples, the generated caption still manages to communicate the mood and tone of the image, and captures the essence of the scene accurately.
