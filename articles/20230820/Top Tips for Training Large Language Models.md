# 1.简介
  

The first generation of large language models (LMs) was based on neural networks that were trained end-to-end using backpropagation through time (BPTT). Despite their impressive results in language modeling and natural language understanding tasks, the limitations of such an approach are evident:

They suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, whereby small changes to the input cause drastically reduced gradients over a few layers and ultimately stop learning. This is particularly problematic when training LMs with long contexts, as this leads to longer memory requirements and thus higher computational costs than traditional recurrent architectures.

Moreover, BPTT requires computing the loss function at every step of the network forward pass and backward pass, which can be computationally expensive especially for larger models and/or large inputs. To address these issues, recent research has focused on more advanced techniques such as model compression, pruning, or quantization. However, there remains much work needed before state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on many NLP tasks.

In this article, we will explore six tips for training large language models effectively. These include reducing the memory footprint, optimizing the learning rate schedule, parallelizing across multiple GPUs and machines, using techniques like mixed precision training and distillation, regularizing the model against overfitting, and implementing effective early stopping strategies. By following these best practices, we can train powerful LMs that perform well on a wide range of NLP tasks while minimizing both compute and memory overhead. 

Note: In order to enable readers to follow along easily, all code examples will be provided as executable scripts. If you don’t have access to GPU hardware, you can still read through the text and run the code locally on CPU-only machines. Additionally, if you do not want to spend the time required to download the necessary data sets and install the necessary dependencies, I recommend checking out Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to run notebooks directly in your browser without any setup required.

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
## Memory Footprint
One key factor affecting the memory footprint of deep neural networks is the number of parameters involved. The deeper and wider the network, the greater the number of parameters and the higher the memory demands. As a result, it's important to consider how to reduce the memory footprint of our models during training. There are several approaches we can take to achieve this goal:

1. **Pruning**: We can use techniques like weight decay and layer-wise regularization to remove unimportant weights from the model and compress it into fewer but smaller weights. For example, instead of having one million parameters in a dense layer, we can prune some neurons or even entire hidden layers to reduce the overall size of the model by a significant margin. 

2. **Quantization**: One way to reduce the memory footprint of deep neural networks is to encode the float values of the weights using integer values called "quantized" weights. Quantization works by representing each floating point value as a discrete set of integers within a specified range. Compared to storing full-precision floating points, this reduces the storage space needed to store the model, resulting in faster computations and lower memory usage. However, since the model becomes less accurate after being compressed, quantization should only be used during fine-tuning rather than pretraining the model itself.

3. **Gradient Clipping**: Another technique for reducing memory consumption is to clip the gradients during backpropagation so they don't exceed a certain threshold. This ensures that we don't propagate gradients far too high, leading to instability during training. A common threshold value is between 1 and 4 times the standard deviation of the gradients. Gradient clipping can help improve the stability of the optimizer and prevent exploding gradients problems.

4. **Data Parallelism**: Another popular strategy for reducing the memory footprint of neural networks is to split them across multiple devices or nodes. Data parallelism splits the data onto different devices, allowing us to process it in parallel using different threads or processes. This can significantly reduce the amount of memory required to train very large models.

## Learning Rate Schedule
When training machine learning models, we often need to choose an appropriate learning rate schedule that determines how quickly the model learns during optimization. There are various strategies for choosing a good learning rate, including constant learning rates, piecewise linear schedules, exponential decay, and polynomial decay. Each strategy brings its own benefits depending on the specific task and dataset. Constant learning rates may be efficient for simple datasets or quick prototyping, but can lead to slow convergence or oscillations when applied to complex tasks. Piecewise linear schedules allow us to gradually increase the learning rate over a fixed period of iterations, while allowing finer control over the slope of the curve. Exponential decay schedules gradually decrease the learning rate as the training progresses, making it easier to find optimal solutions. Finally, polynomial decay schedules provide more flexibility in controlling the rate of change of the learning rate.

Choosing an appropriate learning rate schedule is critical for achieving good performance on challenging NLP tasks. Slowly increasing the learning rate over a few epochs helps to stabilize the training and prevent divergence. Using a polynomial decay schedule can speed up the initial warmup phase and help the model converge to better local minima. On the other hand, applying a large learning rate during the beginning of training can cause the model to skip around the optimum solution and get stuck in bad local minima. Empirically, however, it seems that most models benefit greatly from experimentation with different learning rate schedules.

## Parallelization
Parallelization refers to splitting a single program or algorithm into multiple concurrent parts or instances that can execute simultaneously. It offers several advantages, including increased throughput, improved utilization of available resources, and the potential for improved efficiency and scalability. When training large LMs, parallelization can dramatically reduce the time required for training and leverage multi-core CPUs or distributed systems consisting of multiple GPUs. Two main types of parallelization are data and model parallelism.

### Data Parallelism
Data parallelism involves splitting the input data across multiple processing units, or nodes. During training, each node operates independently on a subset of the input data, taking care not to interfere with the others. This makes it possible to distribute the workload across multiple machines or GPUs, resulting in faster training times. Data parallelism typically involves partitioning the dataset into subsets, replicating the model on each node, and synchronizing updates across the nodes. Examples of widely used libraries for data parallelism in NLP include Horovod, Megatron-LM, and PyTorch DistributedDataParallel.

### Model Parallelism
Model parallelism involves partitioning the model across multiple processing units, also known as micro-batches. Instead of processing the whole input sequence at once, the model partitions it into smaller chunks, or mini-batches, that can be processed independently by individual processors. This approach is commonly used in applications such as image recognition, where the spatial dimensions of the input images require tiling to avoid running out of memory. Similarly, in NLP, the contextual representation vectors generated by the transformer architecture can be partitioned into multiple blocks, each of which can be computed independently on separate GPUs. Model parallelism is commonly used in conjunction with data parallelism for further acceleration of training. Examples of widely used libraries for model parallelism in NLP include DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Mesh Tensorflow.

## Mixed Precision Training
Mixed precision training refers to the use of both single and half precision data formats during training. While single precision uses 32 bits per parameter, half precision uses 16 bits per parameter. In practice, this means we use either double precision (float64) or quadruple precision (float128) arithmetic throughout the model, whereas the activation tensors use either single or half precision format. This enables us to achieve better numerical stability and reduce memory usage compared to purely single precision training.

We can implement mixed precision training using libraries like Apex, NVIDIA/apex, or TensorFlow Automatic Mixed Precision. Within each iteration, we update the model using gradients in either single or half precision format, then cast the updated weights back to full precision for subsequent steps. Alternatively, we can apply dynamic loss scaling, which scales the gradients dynamically during training and adjusts the scale factors accordingly. Dynamic loss scaling can help prevent overflow errors due to excessively large gradients.

## Distillation
Distillation is a recently proposed method for transferring knowledge from a smaller, simpler model to a larger, more complex model. It consists of two stages: teacher training and student training. The teacher model takes in the original input data and predicts the target labels. The student model takes in the same input data as the teacher and predicts the output logits. Then, the student model applies a softmax function to convert the logits into probabilities. The cross entropy loss is calculated between the predicted probabilities and the actual label. The idea behind distillation is to assign a low probability to incorrect predictions made by the teacher, encouraging the student to focus on correct predictions instead. This can help reduce the complexity of the teacher and improve the accuracy of the final model.

Recently, researchers have demonstrated that distillation can improve the accuracy of existing large language models by approximately 0.7% on average on GLUE benchmark tasks. Some variations of distillation methods also show promise, such as Knowledge Distillation via Route Constrained Optimization (RKD-ROCO), Ensemble Distillation with Adaptive Soft Label Selection (EDAS), or Temperature Scaling (TS). All of these methods involve building a new model whose outputs are a weighted combination of the original model's outputs and those of another pre-trained model, usually a teacher model. In addition, RKD-ROCO can effectively alleviate catastrophic forgetting by adapting the importance of samples based on their teacher's confidence level.

To implement distillation, we simply replace the last layer(s) of the student model with the corresponding layers from the teacher model. We can use libraries like pytorch-lightning or fairseq for easy implementation. Here is an example script for training a RoBERTa model with distillation using fairseq library:

```python
import torch
from fairseq import checkpoint_utils, options, tasks, utils

parser = options.get_training_parser()
args = options.parse_args_and_arch(parser)
task = tasks.setup_task(args)
model = task.build_model(args)
teacher_path = '/path/to/teacher_checkpoint.pt' # path to the pretrained teacher model
state = checkpoint_utils.load_checkpoint_to_cpu(teacher_path, args.criterion)
teacher_model = state["model"]

for param in teacher_model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad_(False)
    
for name, module in model.named_modules():
    if 'output' in name:
        setattr(module, 'weight', getattr(teacher_model, f'{name}.weight'))
        setattr(module, 'bias', getattr(teacher_model, f'{name}.bias'))
        
optimizer = task.build_optimizer(args, model, state['optimizer_history'])
lr_scheduler = task.build_lr_scheduler(args, optimizer)

if state is not None and 'train_iterator' in state.keys():
    train_iterators = state['train_iterator']
else:
    train_iterators = [
        task.get_batch_iterator(
            dataset=task.dataset('train'),
            max_tokens=args.max_tokens,

                model.max_positions(),

                    trainer._get_max_positions(ds)['sentence'] 
                    for ds in ['train', 'valid', 'test'] 
                ] 
            ]),

        for epoch in range(args.start_epoch, args.epochs + 1)
    ]
    
    criterion = task.build_criterion(args)

    trainer.add_main_metrics_reported(lambda meters: {'loss': meters['train_loss'].avg})
    extra_meters = collections.defaultdict(utils.AverageMeter)
    for i, train_itr in enumerate(['train']):
        extra_meters[f"{i}_{key}"] = meter for key, meter in utils.log_every(
            iterator=train_iterators[i],
            print_freq=args.log_interval,
            log_fn=lambda x: meters.update(x)
        )
        
    # Save current training states
    checkpoint_utils.save_checkpoint(args, trainer, epoch, valid_losses[best_loss_index], save_dir)
    checkpoints.append((epoch - start_epoch, model.state_dict()))
