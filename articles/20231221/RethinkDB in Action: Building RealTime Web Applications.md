## 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

In this section, we will provide detailed code examples and explanations for building real-time web applications using RethinkDB.

### 4.1 创建RethinkDB数据库和表

To create a RethinkDB database and table, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const r = require('rethinkdb');

r.connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 28015 }, (err, conn) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  r.dbCreate('mydb').run(conn, (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;

    r.tableCreate('mytable').run(conn, (err, res) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      console.log('Database and table created successfully');
      conn.close();
    });
  });
});
```

This code creates a new RethinkDB database called `mydb` and a new table called `mytable`.

### 4.2 插入数据到RethinkDB表

To insert data into a RethinkDB table, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const r = require('rethinkdb');

r.connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 28015 }, (err, conn) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  r.table('mytable').insert({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 }).run(conn, (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;

    console.log('Data inserted successfully');
    conn.close();
  });
});
```

This code inserts a new record into the `mytable` table with the fields `name` and `age`.

### 4.3 查询RethinkDB表

To query data from a RethinkDB table, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const r = require('rethinkdb');

r.connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 28015 }, (err, conn) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  r.table('mytable').filter({ age: 30 }).run(conn, (err, cursor) => {
    if (err) throw err;

    cursor.toArray((err, results) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      console.log(results);
      conn.close();
    });
  });
});
```

This code queries the `mytable` table and filters the results based on the `age` field.

### 4.4 更新RethinkDB表

To update data in a RethinkDB table, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const r = require('rethinkdb');

r.connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 28015 }, (err, conn) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  r.table('mytable').filter({ name: 'John Doe' }).update({ age: 31 }).run(conn, (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;

    console.log('Data updated successfully');
    conn.close();
  });
});
```

This code updates the `age` field of the record with the `name` field equal to `John Doe`.

### 4.5 删除RethinkDB表数据

To delete data from a RethinkDB table, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const r = require('rethinkdb');

r.connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 28015 }, (err, conn) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  r.table('mytable').filter({ name: 'John Doe' }).delete().run(conn, (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;

    console.log('Data deleted successfully');
    conn.close();
  });
});
```

This code deletes the record with the `name` field equal to `John Doe`.
