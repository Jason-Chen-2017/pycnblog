### 4.1 Amazon Neptune

In this section, we will provide a detailed example of how to use Amazon Neptune to query graph data. We will use the following code snippet to create a graph database and insert some data into it:

```
CREATE (:Person {name: 'John', age: 30})-[:KNOWS]->(:Person {name: 'Jane', age: 25})
```

This code snippet creates a graph database and inserts two nodes (John and Jane) and a relationship (KNOWS) between them. The nodes have properties (name and age) and the relationship has a property (type).

To query the graph data, we can use the following code snippet:

```
MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(q:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'John'
RETURN q.name
```

This code snippet matches the nodes that are connected by the KNOWS relationship and returns the name of the node that is connected to John.
