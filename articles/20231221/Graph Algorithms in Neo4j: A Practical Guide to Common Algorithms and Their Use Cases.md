# 2. Core Concepts

In this section, we will introduce the core concepts related to graph algorithms, such as graphs, vertices, edges, and paths.

## 2.1 Graphs

A graph is a collection of vertices (nodes) and edges (links) that represent relationships between vertices. Graphs can be directed or undirected, depending on whether the edges have a direction or not.

### 2.1.1 Vertices

Vertices are the elements of a graph that represent entities or objects. They can be thought of as points or nodes in the graph.

### 2.1.2 Edges

Edges are the connections between vertices in a graph. They represent relationships or links between vertices. Edges can be directed or undirected, depending on whether they have a direction or not.

### 2.1.3 Paths

A path is a sequence of vertices and edges that connects two vertices in a graph. A path can be directed or undirected, depending on the direction of the edges.

## 2.2 Core Concepts in Neo4j

Neo4j provides a native graph data model that supports the core concepts of graphs, vertices, edges, and paths.

### 2.2.1 Nodes

In Neo4j, vertices are represented as nodes. Nodes can have properties, which are key-value pairs that store data associated with the node.

### 2.2.2 Relationships

In Neo4j, edges are represented as relationships. Relationships can have properties, which are key-value pairs that store data associated with the relationship. Relationships can also have directions, which determine the direction of the relationship.

### 2.2.3 Paths

In Neo4j, paths are represented as a sequence of nodes and relationships. Paths can be directed or undirected, depending on the direction of the relationships.

# 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Operations

In this section, we will discuss the core principles behind common graph algorithms, such as shortest path, centrality, and community detection.

## 3.1 Shortest Path

The shortest path algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. The most common shortest path algorithms are Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* algorithm.

### 3.1.1 Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights. The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of vertices, where the priority is based on the current shortest distance from the starting vertex. The algorithm iteratively selects the vertex with the lowest priority and updates the distances to its neighbors.

### 3.1.2 A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the remaining distance to the goal. The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of vertices, where the priority is based on the sum of the current shortest distance and the heuristic estimate. The algorithm iteratively selects the vertex with the lowest priority and updates the distances to its neighbors.

## 3.2 Centrality

Centrality is a measure of the importance of a vertex in a graph. The most common centrality measures are degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality.

### 3.2.1 Degree Centrality

Degree centrality is a measure of the number of connections a vertex has in a graph. The higher the degree centrality, the more central the vertex is.

### 3.2.2 Closeness Centrality

Closeness centrality is a measure of how close a vertex is to all other vertices in a graph. The higher the closeness centrality, the more central the vertex is.

### 3.2.3 Betweenness Centrality

Betweenness centrality is a measure of how often a vertex lies on the shortest path between two other vertices in a graph. The higher the betweenness centrality, the more central the vertex is.

## 3.3 Community Detection

Community detection is the process of identifying groups of vertices that are more closely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. The most common community detection algorithms are the Girvan-Newman algorithm and the Louvain algorithm.

### 3.3.1 Girvan-Newman Algorithm

The Girvan-Newman algorithm is a hierarchical algorithm that iteratively removes the edge with the highest betweenness centrality from the graph. The algorithm stops when there are no more edges to remove, and the remaining vertices are grouped into communities.

### 3.3.2 Louvain Algorithm

The Louvain algorithm is a modularity-based algorithm that iteratively moves vertices between communities based on the modularity score. The algorithm stops when there are no more vertices to move, and the final communities are identified.

# 4. Code Implementation

In this section, we will provide detailed examples of how to implement common graph algorithms in Neo4j, including code snippets and explanations.

## 4.1 Shortest Path

To implement the shortest path algorithm in Neo4j, we can use the `shortestPath` function provided by the Neo4j graph algorithm library.

```cypher
CALL gds.shortestPath(
  {
    algorithm: "Dijkstra",
    relationshipWeightProperty: "weight",
    relationshipDirection: "UNDIRECTED",
    maxHops: 10
  },
  {name: "Alice"},
  {name: "Bob"}
)
YIELD path
RETURN path
```

In this example, we are using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices named "Alice" and "Bob". The `relationshipWeightProperty` parameter specifies the property that stores the edge weight, and the `relationshipDirection` parameter specifies the direction of the relationships. The `maxHops` parameter specifies the maximum number of hops allowed in the path.

## 4.2 Centrality

To implement centrality measures in Neo4j, we can use the `pageRank`, `degree`, `closenessCentrality`, and `betweennessCentrality` functions provided by the Neo4j graph algorithm library.

```cypher
// PageRank
CALL gds.pageRank(
  {
    algorithm: "louvain",
    relationshipWeightProperty: "weight",
    relationshipDirection: "UNDIRECTED"
  },
  "Person"
)
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN nodeId, score AS pageRank

// Degree
CALL gds.degree(
  {
    nodeLabel: "Person"
  }
)
YIELD nodeId, degree
RETURN nodeId, degree AS degreeCentrality

// Closeness Centrality
CALL gds.closenessCentrality(
  {
    nodeLabel: "Person"
  }
)
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN nodeId, score AS closenessCentrality

// Betweenness Centrality
CALL gds.betweennessCentrality(
  {
    nodeLabel: "Person"
  }
)
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN nodeId, score AS betweennessCentrality
```

In these examples, we are using the `pageRank`, `degree`, `closenessCentrality`, and `betweennessCentrality` functions to calculate the centrality measures for vertices with the label "Person". The `relationshipWeightProperty` and `relationshipDirection` parameters are used to specify the edge weight property and relationship direction, respectively.

## 4.3 Community Detection

To implement community detection in Neo4j, we can use the `community` function provided by the Neo4j graph algorithm library.

```cypher
CALL gds.community(
  {
    algorithm: "louvain",
    nodeLabel: "Person"
  }
)
YIELD communityId, nodeIds
RETURN communityId, nodeIds AS communityMembers
```

In this example, we are using the Louvain algorithm to detect communities for vertices with the label "Person". The `communityId` and `nodeIds` are returned for each community, where `nodeIds` represents the vertices that belong to the community.
