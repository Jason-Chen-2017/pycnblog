# 3. Core Algorithms, Operations, and Mathematical Models

In this section, we will dive deeper into FoundationDB's core algorithms, operations, and mathematical models. We will discuss the Raft consensus algorithm, the mathematical models used for performance optimization, and the specific operations supported by FoundationDB.

## 3.1. Raft Consensus Algorithm

FoundationDB uses the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure data consistency across all nodes in the cluster. Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm that provides strong consistency guarantees while maintaining low latency. It is designed to handle failures and ensure that the database remains available even in the face of node failures.

### 3.1.1. Raft Overview

Raft is composed of a set of servers called nodes. Each node contains a copy of the data and follows a set of rules to ensure data consistency. The algorithm consists of three main components:

1. **Leader Election**: One node is elected as the leader, and the others become followers. The leader is responsible for handling client requests and coordinating data replication.
2. **Log Replication**: The leader replicates its log to the followers. Each log entry contains a command that modifies the data.
3. **Safety**: Raft ensures that all nodes have the same data by requiring that all commands are applied in the same order on all nodes.

### 3.1.2. Raft Mathematical Model

Raft's mathematical model is based on the concept of "chains of commands." Each node maintains a log of commands, and the logs are ordered by the command indices. Raft ensures that all nodes have the same log order by using a "majority vote" mechanism.

### 3.1.3. Raft Performance Optimization

Raft's performance is optimized using techniques such as "leader election" and "log replication." These techniques allow Raft to handle a large number of requests simultaneously and provide low latency for gaming applications.

To delete a data object, you can use the `delete` method provided by the FoundationDB Client Library. This method takes a key as input and deletes the corresponding data object from the database.

```python
# Delete a data object
client.delete("John Doe")
```

## 4.2. Performing Transactions

To perform transactions in FoundationDB, you can use the `transaction` method provided by the FoundationDB Client Library. This method takes a callback function as input and executes the transaction in a single, atomic operation.

### 4.2.1. Transaction Example

```python
# Perform a transaction
def transaction_callback(transaction):
    # Read a data object
    data_object = transaction.get("John Doe")
    
    # Update the data object
    data_object["age"] = 32
    transaction.update("John Doe", data_object)

client.transaction(transaction_callback)
```

## 4.3. Performing Graph Queries

To perform graph queries in FoundationDB, you can use the `query` method provided by the FoundationDB Client Library. This method takes a Cypher query as input and executes the query on the graph data.

### 4.3.1. Graph Query Example

```python
# Perform a graph query
query = """
MATCH (a:User {name: "John Doe"})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(b:User)
RETURN b.name
"""

results = client.query(query)
for result in results:
    print(result["b.name"])
```
