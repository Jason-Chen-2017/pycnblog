JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that is primarily known for its role in web development. However, its applications extend beyond the browser, and it is now used in various domains such as server-side programming, mobile app development, and even in machine learning and artificial intelligence. One of the key features that has contributed to JavaScript's popularity is its ability to handle asynchronous operations, which is crucial for building responsive and efficient applications.

Multithreading is a concept that has been widely adopted in many programming languages, and it refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is a lightweight process that represents a single sequence of instructions in a program. Multithreading allows for better resource utilization, improved performance, and the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

In this comprehensive overview of multithreading in JavaScript, we will cover the following topics:

1. Background and Introduction
2. Core Concepts and Relationships
3. Algorithm Principles, Steps, and Mathematical Models
4. Code Examples and Detailed Explanations
5. Future Trends and Challenges
