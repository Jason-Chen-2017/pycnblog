## 1. Background and Introduction

The Lambda architecture was introduced by Nathan Marz in 2010. It is a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of both batch and real-time processing. The architecture is designed to handle large volumes of data and provide fast and accurate results.

The Lambda architecture consists of three main components:

- Batch Layer: This layer is responsible for processing large volumes of data in a batch manner. It is typically used for offline processing and can be run on a schedule or triggered by an event.

- Speed Layer: This layer is responsible for processing real-time data. It is used for online processing and can handle high volumes of data with low latency.

- Serving Layer: This layer is responsible for serving the processed data to the end-users. It can be used for querying, visualization, and other purposes.

Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system that is used for stream processing and event-driven processing. It is a powerful tool for implementing the speed layer of the Lambda architecture.

HBase is a distributed, scalable, big data store that is modeled after Google's BigTable. It is a powerful tool for implementing the batch layer of the Lambda architecture.

### 4.1 Lambda Architecture

The code example of the Lambda architecture is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Batch processing
batch_data = pd.read_csv('batch_data.csv')
batch_result = batch_data.groupby('key').sum()

# Real-time processing
speed_data = pd.read_csv('speed_data.csv')
speed_result = speed_data.groupby('key').sum()

# Merge the results
merged_result = pd.concat([batch_result, speed_result], axis=1)

# Serve the merged results
merged_result.to_csv('merged_result.csv')
```

The detailed explanation of the code example is as follows:

- The batch processing is done using the pandas library. The batch data is read from a CSV file and grouped by the 'key' column. The sum of the values is calculated for each group.

- The real-time processing is done using the pandas library. The speed data is read from a CSV file and grouped by the 'key' column. The sum of the values is calculated for each group.

- The merged results are obtained by concatenating the batch result and speed result along the columns.

- The merged results are saved to a CSV file.

# Define the topology
topology = TridentTopology("my_topology")

# Define the spout
spout = TridentSpout("my_spout", ["my_spout_id"])

# Define the bolt
bolt = TridentBolt("my_bolt", lambda record: record.emit(record.getField("key"), record.getField("value")))
