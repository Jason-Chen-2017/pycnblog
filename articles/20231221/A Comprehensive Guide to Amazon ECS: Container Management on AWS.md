- **Load balancing**: ECS provides built-in load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple containers and ensure high availability.
- **Auto-scaling**: ECS can automatically scale the number of containers based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
- **Service discovery**: ECS enables service discovery, allowing containers to discover and communicate with each other.
- **Security**: ECS provides security features such as IAM roles, security groups, and network access control lists to protect your containers and data.

### 1.4 How Amazon ECS Works

Amazon ECS works by managing containers within one or more clusters. A cluster is a logical grouping of resources that are used to run and scale containerized applications. Each cluster consists of one or more Amazon EC2 instances, which are the hosts for the containers.

Containers are deployed to tasks, which are the smallest unit of work in ECS. Tasks are defined by a task definition, which specifies the container image, memory, CPU, and other configuration settings.

ECS uses a task scheduler to place tasks on available instances within the cluster. The task scheduler can be either the ECS-optimized scheduler or the Fargate launch type, which is a serverless compute engine for containers.

### 1.5 When to Use Amazon ECS

Amazon ECS is suitable for deploying applications that require containerization, such as microservices, web applications, and batch processing jobs. It is also a good choice for applications that need to scale dynamically, as ECS provides built-in auto-scaling capabilities.
