Bigtable is a distributed, scalable, and highly available NoSQL database service. Its architecture consists of multiple servers, each containing multiple Bigtable instances. Each instance is composed of a set of tables, with each table containing rows and columns.

### 2.1.1. Servers

Servers are the physical or virtual machines that host Bigtable instances. They are responsible for storing and processing data, as well as managing communication between instances.

### 2.1.2. Instances

An instance is a logical grouping of tables within a single server. Instances are isolated from each other, allowing multiple tenants to share the same server resources.

### 2.1.3. Tables

A table is a collection of rows, where each row represents a unique record in the data. Tables are the primary unit of data storage and processing in Bigtable.

### 2.1.4. Rows

A row is a collection of key-value pairs, where the key is a unique identifier for the record and the value is the data associated with the record. Rows are the basic unit of data storage in Bigtable.

### 2.1.5. Columns

Columns are the attributes or fields within a row. They are identified by a column qualifier, which is a unique identifier for the column within the table.

## 2.2. Core Concepts and Relations in E-commerce

In e-commerce, Bigtable can be used to store and process various types of data, including user information, transaction records, product details, and more. The core concepts and relations in Bigtable can be mapped to e-commerce use cases as follows:
