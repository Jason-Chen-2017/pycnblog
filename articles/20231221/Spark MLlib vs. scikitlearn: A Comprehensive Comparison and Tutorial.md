### 3.1 Spark MLlib Algorithms

Spark MLlib provides a wide range of algorithms for various machine learning tasks. Some of the most popular algorithms include:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet powerful algorithm for regression tasks. The objective is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. The linear regression model can be represented as:

  $$
  y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon
  $$

  where $y$ is the target variable, $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ are the input features, $\beta_0, \beta_1, \cdots, \beta_n$ are the coefficients to be estimated, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

- **Logistic Regression**: A probabilistic model for classification tasks. The objective is to find the best-fitting line that separates the classes with a maximum likelihood estimation. The logistic regression model can be represented as:

  $$
  P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_nx_n)}}
  $$

  where $P(y=1|x)$ is the probability of the class label being 1 given the input features $x$, and $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm.

- **Decision Trees**: A non-parametric algorithm for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm recursively splits the data into subsets based on the input features, and the final prediction is made by traversing the tree.

- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and stability of the predictions.

- **K-Means Clustering**: A popular clustering algorithm that partitions the data into $k$ clusters based on the minimum within-cluster sum of squares.

### 3.2 scikit-learn Algorithms

Scikit-learn provides a wide range of algorithms for various machine learning tasks. Some of the most popular algorithms include:

- **Linear Regression**: Same as Spark MLlib's linear regression.

- **Logistic Regression**: Same as Spark MLlib's logistic regression.
