## 1. Background and Introduction

The financial services industry is a complex and highly regulated sector. Banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions must comply with a wide range of regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and sanctions screening. Additionally, these institutions must also protect their customers from fraud and other financial crimes.

Traditional relational databases are not well-suited to handle the complex relationships and large volumes of data that are common in the financial services industry. As a result, many financial institutions are turning to graph databases like Amazon Neptune to help them manage their data more effectively.

Graph databases like Neptune are designed to store and query complex relationships between entities. This makes them ideal for use cases like fraud detection and compliance, where understanding the relationships between entities is critical to success.
