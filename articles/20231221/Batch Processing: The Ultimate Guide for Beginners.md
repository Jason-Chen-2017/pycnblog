Batch processing is a method of processing a large number of similar tasks in a sequential manner, rather than processing them individually. It is commonly used in data processing, where large amounts of data need to be processed in a short amount of time. Batch processing is also used in other fields, such as manufacturing and finance.

The concept of batch processing has been around for a long time, with the first batch processing systems being developed in the 1950s. Since then, batch processing has evolved and improved, and it is still widely used today.
