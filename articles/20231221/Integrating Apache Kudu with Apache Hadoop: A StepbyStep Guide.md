### 2.1 Apache Kudu

Apache Kudu is an open-source, distributed columnar storage engine that is designed for real-time analytics on fast-changing data. It is optimized for use with Apache Hadoop, and can be used as a storage engine for Apache HBase, Apache Phoenix, or Apache Flink. Kudu is designed to be fast, scalable, and fault-tolerant, and can be used with a variety of data sources and formats.

### 2.2 Apache Hadoop

Apache Hadoop is an open-source, distributed computing framework that is designed for processing large datasets in a distributed and parallel manner. It is based on the MapReduce programming model, and includes a variety of components such as HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), and HBase (Hadoop's distributed NoSQL database).

### 2.3 Integration

Integrating Apache Kudu with Apache Hadoop involves several steps, including installation and configuration of both systems, data ingestion and querying. The integration allows for real-time analytics on fast-changing data, and provides a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for processing large datasets.

### 3.1 Installation and Configuration

To install and configure Apache Kudu and Apache Hadoop, follow these steps:

3. Configure Hadoop to use Kudu as a storage engine by adding the following lines to the `core-site.xml` file:

```xml
<property>
  <name>hadoop.kudu.master.address</name>
  <value>master-host:5050</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hadoop.kudu.table.name</name>
  <value>my_table</value>
</property>
```

4. Configure Kudu to use Hadoop as a data source by adding the following lines to the `kudu-site.xml` file:

```xml
<property>
  <name>kudu.hadoop.input.format.class</name>
  <value>org.apache.kudu.hadoop.KuduInputFormat</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>kudu.hadoop.output.format.class</name>
  <value>org.apache.kudu.hadoop.KuduOutputFormat</value>
</property>
```

5. Start both Hadoop and Kudu services.

### 3.2 Data Ingestion

To ingest data into Kudu, follow these steps:

1. Create a Kudu table by running the following command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name STRING,
  age INT
)
WITH (
  tablet_size_mb = '128',
  compression = 'snappy'
);
```

2. Insert data into the Kudu table using the following command:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_table (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 25);
```

3. Use Hadoop to read data from Kudu by running the following command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

### 3.3 Querying

To query data from Kudu, follow these steps:

1. Create a Kudu table by running the following command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name STRING,
  age INT
)
WITH (
  tablet_size_mb = '128',
  compression = 'snappy'
);
```

2. Insert data into the Kudu table using the following command:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_table (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 25);
```

3. Use Hadoop to read data from Kudu by running the following command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE age > 20;
```
