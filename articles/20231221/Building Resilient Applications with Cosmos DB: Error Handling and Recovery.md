Cosmos DB is a fully managed, globally distributed, multi-model database service provided by Microsoft Azure. It supports various data models, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph. Cosmos DB is designed to provide high availability, scalability, and consistency for modern applications. In this article, we will discuss how to build resilient applications with Cosmos DB, focusing on error handling and recovery.

## 2.核心概念与联系

### 2.1 Cosmos DB Error Handling

Cosmos DB provides a comprehensive error handling mechanism to help developers handle errors effectively. The error handling process includes the following steps:

1. Error detection: Cosmos DB monitors the system for errors and raises events when errors are detected.
2. Error reporting: Cosmos DB reports errors to the developer through various channels, such as the Azure portal, SDKs, and REST APIs.
3. Error handling: Developers can handle errors by implementing error handling logic in their applications.

### 2.2 Cosmos DB Recovery

Recovery in Cosmos DB refers to the process of restoring the system to a consistent state after an error has occurred. Cosmos DB provides several mechanisms for recovery, including:

1. Automatic failover: Cosmos DB automatically fails over to a secondary replica when a primary replica fails, ensuring high availability.
2. Manual failover: Developers can manually fail over to a secondary replica when needed.
3. Point-in-time recovery: Cosmos DB provides point-in-time recovery, allowing developers to restore their data to a specific point in time.

### 3.1 Error Detection and Reporting

Cosmos DB uses various mechanisms to detect and report errors, including:

1. Monitoring: Cosmos DB monitors the system using built-in metrics and logs.
2. Alerts: Cosmos DB raises alerts when errors are detected.
3. Diagnostics: Cosmos DB provides diagnostic tools to help developers analyze and troubleshoot errors.

### 3.2 Error Handling Logic

Developers can implement error handling logic in their applications using the following steps:

1. Catch exceptions: Catch exceptions thrown by Cosmos DB operations.
2. Analyze errors: Analyze the errors to determine the appropriate response.
3. Respond to errors: Respond to errors by taking appropriate actions, such as retrying the operation, logging the error, or notifying the user.

### 3.3 Recovery Mechanisms

Cosmos DB provides several recovery mechanisms, including:

1. Automatic failover: Cosmos DB automatically fails over to a secondary replica when a primary replica fails. The failover process involves the following steps:
   - Detect failure: Cosmos DB detects the failure of the primary replica.
   - Promote secondary: Cosmos DB promotes a secondary replica to become the new primary replica.
   - Update clients: Cosmos DB updates the clients with the new primary replica's address.
2. Manual failover: Developers can manually fail over to a secondary replica when needed. The manual failover process involves the following steps:
   - Identify issue: Developers identify an issue with the primary replica.
   - Fail over: Developers initiate a manual failover to a secondary replica.
   - Verify success: Developers verify that the failover was successful.
3. Point-in-time recovery: Cosmos DB provides point-in-time recovery, allowing developers to restore their data to a specific point in time. The point-in-time recovery process involves the following steps:
   - Identify issue: Developers identify an issue with the data.
   - Restore data: Developers restore the data to a specific point in time.
   - Verify success: Developers verify that the data restoration was successful.

## 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

### 4.1 Error Handling Example

In this example, we will demonstrate how to handle errors using the Cosmos DB SDK for .NET:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;
using System;

namespace CosmosDBErrorHandling
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            string connectionString = "Your Cosmos DB connection string";
            string databaseId = "Your database ID";
            string containerId = "Your container ID";

            CosmosClient cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(connectionString);
            Database database = cosmosClient.GetDatabase(databaseId);
            Container container = database.GetContainer(containerId);

            try
            {
                await container.ReadItemAsync<YourItemType>("Your item ID", new PartitionKey(YourPartitionKeyType));
            }
            catch (CosmosException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
                // Analyze the error and take appropriate action
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Recovery Example

In this example, we will demonstrate how to perform a manual failover using the Cosmos DB SDK for .NET:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;
using System;

namespace CosmosDBRecovery
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            string connectionString = "Your Cosmos DB connection string";
            string databaseId = "Your database ID";
            string containerId = "Your container ID";

            CosmosClient cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(connectionString);
            Database database = cosmosClient.GetDatabase(databaseId);
            Container container = database.GetContainer(containerId);

            try
            {
                await container.ReadItemAsync<YourItemType>("Your item ID", new PartitionKey(YourPartitionKeyType));
            }
            catch (CosmosException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
                // Identify the issue and initiate a manual failover
                // Verify that the manual failover was successful
            }
        }
    }
}
```
