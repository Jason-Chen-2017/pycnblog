OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It is designed to securely and easily authenticate users and obtain user profile information from social media platforms and other identity providers. This guide is aimed at developers who want to learn how to integrate OpenID Connect into their mobile applications.

## 1.1 Brief History of OpenID Connect
OpenID Connect was developed by the OpenID Foundation, an industry consortium, and was first published in 2014. It is based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which was also developed by the same consortium. The main goal of OpenID Connect is to provide a simple and secure way to authenticate users and obtain their profile information from identity providers.

## 1.2 Why Use OpenID Connect?
There are several reasons why developers should consider using OpenID Connect for their mobile applications:

- **Simplicity**: OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, which is already a widely adopted protocol for authorization. This means that developers can leverage their existing knowledge of OAuth 2.0 to implement OpenID Connect.

- **Security**: OpenID Connect provides a secure way to authenticate users and obtain their profile information. It uses public key cryptography and secure HTTP to ensure that the information exchanged between the client and the identity provider is secure.

- **Interoperability**: OpenID Connect is an open standard, which means that it can be used with any identity provider that supports the protocol. This makes it easy for developers to integrate OpenID Connect into their applications and work with multiple identity providers.

- **Flexibility**: OpenID Connect supports a wide range of use cases, from simple authentication to more complex scenarios such as single sign-on (SSO) and social login. This makes it a versatile solution for developers who need to support multiple authentication scenarios in their applications.

## 1.3 How OpenID Connect Works
OpenID Connect works by using the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate users and obtain their profile information from identity providers. The process typically involves the following steps:

1. The client application requests authorization from the user's identity provider.
2. The identity provider authenticates the user and obtains their consent to share their profile information with the client application.
3. The identity provider returns an access token and an ID token to the client application.
4. The client application uses the access token to obtain the user's profile information from the identity provider.
5. The client application uses the ID token to verify the authenticity of the access token and the user's identity.
