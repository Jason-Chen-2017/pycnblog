Chatbots are artificial intelligence (AI) programs that mimic conversational interactions with humans through text and voice inputs or outputs. They have become popular recently due to the advancement of chat-based applications such as messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, Telegram, etc., online shopping platforms such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, etc., social media platforms like Facebook Messenger, Instagram Story, Twitter DM, etc., and even personal assistants like Siri or Cortana on mobile devices. In this article we will build a simple Chatbot using Markov chains in Python language. This is just one of many possible ways to develop a Chatbot but it can be used as an introduction for beginners. We will use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library which provides tools for natural language processing tasks. NLTK supports various languages including English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Swedish and Chinese among others. The code implementation was done using Python version 3.7. We will start by installing the necessary libraries and importing them into our project workspace.<|im_sep|>

Before we dive into the actual coding part, let's understand some basic concepts about Markov chains and how they work. A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on its previous state rather than its future states [wiki]. 

In simpler terms, a Markov chain is a model where the present state only influences the future probabilities. At any given time step t, there is exactly one state s_t, denoted by γ(s_t), representing what happened at that point in time. However, when we look ahead to time step t+1, all we know is the current state s_t and we cannot predict anything about the next state until we see it. Hence, if we want to calculate the likelihood of the next state s_{t+1} being a particular value based on the past history {γ^j}(s_{j}), we need to consider all possible values of s_{j}, j < t. Therefore, the transition matrix A tells us the conditional probability distribution P(γ_{t+1}=v | γ_t=u).

Therefore, the main task of building a Markov chain-based Chatbot is to create a set of training data and then simulate the conversation flow according to these patterns. During simulation, the bot should output appropriate responses based on the input message received from the user. Once trained, the bot can continuously respond to incoming messages without having to retrain itself every time new conversations occur. By doing so, the Bot becomes more engaging and responsive over time because it knows the contextual clues within the dialog. Overall, building a simple Chatbot using Markov chains in Python requires knowledge of programming skills, machine learning algorithms, and text analysis techniques.
