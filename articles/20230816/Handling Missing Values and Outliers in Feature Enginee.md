# 1.简介
  

Data science is an important area of study that involves building models to predict outcomes from large amounts of data. In real-world applications, such as fraud detection, credit scoring, medical diagnosis, etc., missing values and outliers can be common challenges. This article will discuss the techniques used in feature engineering for handling these problems with a focus on machine learning models. We will also cover various Python libraries that are available for handling missing values and outliers efficiently. Finally, we will analyze some specific cases where dealing with these issues becomes critical in different application domains like image classification or text analysis. 

This article assumes readers have basic knowledge about machine learning concepts and terminologies, probability distributions, and their use in statistics. If you need a refresher course please refer to other resources online. Additionally, if you have experience working with Python programming language, it would be helpful if you could follow along while reading this article. 

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
In machine learning, features represent individual measurable attributes of the phenomenon being modeled. Features are usually numerical in nature but can also be categorical variables. Categorical variables can have multiple categories and may not have any intrinsic order. For example, gender can be either male or female and income level can be categorized into high, medium, and low income levels. While continuous variables typically fall under a normal distribution curve, there are exceptions to this rule. Continuous variables can take on values within certain ranges and therefore they do not always fit perfectly on a normal distribution curve.

Missing values occur when a value for a particular feature is unknown or unavailable. When missing values are present, statistical methods like regression cannot be applied directly because they assume complete data. Therefore, the best practice is to handle missing values before applying the model. The three main approaches to handle missing values are:

1) Imputation - filling in the missing values using statistical estimates or interpolation techniques. This approach takes advantage of the properties of the dataset to impute the missing values based on the patterns observed in the data. 

2) Deletion - removing rows or columns containing missing values. Depending on the size of the dataset, deletion can cause loss of information. Also, deleting missing values creates bias in the dataset since the remaining observations may not reflect the true distribution of the variable.

3) Abstraction - discarding incomplete rows or columns altogether. A better alternative to deletion is to create new features that capture the same information as the deleted features but exclude the missing values. For instance, instead of dropping columns, we can calculate the mean or median of each column excluding the missing values. This technique helps remove redundancy and noise in the dataset.

Outliers are points that deviate significantly from other points in the same set. They can lead to incorrect predictions by models and affect the accuracy of the results. There are several ways to identify outliers in datasets including visual inspection, statistical tests, and anomaly detection algorithms. Three types of outliers commonly found in datasets are:

1) Global Outliers - These are extreme cases where one observation dominates the entire dataset. One possible explanation could be measurement errors caused due to an unusually large or small sample size.

2) Local Outliers - These are points that belong to a specific group or category but behave differently compared to the rest of the dataset. It might be related to sampling error or measurement errors made during collection of the data.

3) Clouds of Outliers - These are regions in the data cloud that contain many outlier points. Unlike global or local outliers, clouds do not form single isolated points but rather a cluster of points around them.

Once identified, we need to decide how to deal with them. Four primary strategies to handle outliers include:

1) Exclusion - Exclude outliers from the dataset completely. This method may result in loss of valuable information and requires careful consideration of the context of the problem at hand.

2) Treatment - Assign anomalous values within a given range to a special category (e.g., "outlier") and treat them separately. This approach captures the uncertainty involved in the presence of outliers and makes meaningful inferences.

3) Detection - Use anomaly detection algorithms to identify outliers automatically and flag them for further investigation. This process generates more robust results than exclusion or treatment and allows us to focus our efforts elsewhere.

4) Replacement - Replace outliers with estimated values derived from the rest of the data. This approach avoids losing information and preserves the overall shape of the distribution. However, it requires domain expertise and careful tuning of the threshold parameters to achieve accurate replacements.

# 3.Core Algorithm and Operations
The core algorithm used for handling missing values and outliers is called Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithms (ISOFT). ISOFT iteratively eliminates all non-outlier points until no outliers are left or the desired number of iterations has been reached. ISOFT works by minimizing two penalties: the L1 penalty and the distance between adjacent soft thresholds. The L1 penalty encourages sparsity in the solution vector and the distance between adjacent soft thresholds promotes smoothness in the learned weights. Here are the general steps followed by ISOFT:

1. Normalize the input matrix X so that its entries vary between zero and one.

2. Initialize a binary mask M consisting of ones and zeros indicating which elements of X should be included in the final prediction. Set all initial values to zero except for those corresponding to the first row of X. This ensures that the algorithm does not eliminate any values in the first iteration.

3. Repeat until convergence or maximum number of iterations is reached:

   a. Compute the distances D between adjacent pairs of soft thresholds in the current mask M.
   
   b. Calculate the minimum distance between a point i and any neighbor j in the remaining subset of the mask M.
   
   c. Determine whether i should be eliminated according to the following criteria:

      I. Is i an outlier?
      
      II. Can the weight associated with i change without violating the constraint that its absolute value should not exceed the soft threshold defined by j?
      
   d. Update the value of M[i] accordingly. Set all neighboring cells j of i to zero unless another option exists (e.g., decrease the weight associated with i). 
   
4. Multiply the resulting binary mask M with the original matrix X to obtain the final predicted output Y.

To implement step 4, we simply multiply the resulting binary mask with the normalized input matrix X. If there are still missing values after processing the mask, we can choose one of the above mentioned techniques to fill them in. Similarly, if there are too many outliers to handle manually, we can run ISOFT multiple times with increasing numbers of allowed iterations to gradually eliminate them over time.

# 4.Python Libraries and Code Examples
There are several Python libraries available for handling missing values and outliers efficiently. Some of the popular libraries are pandas, scikit-learn, Statsmodels, NumPy/SciPy, and TensorFlow/Keras. Here are some code examples using these libraries to illustrate how to handle missing values and outliers using ISOFT in Python:

## Using Pandas Library
Pandas library provides a powerful interface to work with tabular data sets. It supports various operations such as merging, filtering, aggregation, grouping, reshaping, and pivot tables. Moreover, it includes support for missing value imputation and outlier detection using built-in functions. The following code shows an example implementation using the Titanic dataset:

``` python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from isoft_handler import iterative_soft_thresholding 

data = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv') # Load the dataset

# Drop unnecessary columns
data = data.drop(['Name', 'Ticket'], axis=1)

# Handle missing values using SimpleImputer 
imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='median')
data[['Age']] = imputer.fit_transform(data[['Age']])

# Define target variable and independent variables
y = np.array(data['Survived'])
X = np.array(data.drop('Survived',axis=1))

# Apply ISOFT algorithm to handle outliers
M, W, _ = iterative_soft_thresholding(X)
Xhat = M*W

print("Final predicted values:", Xhat[:5])
```

Here, we load the Titanic dataset using pandas `read_csv` function. Then, we drop the Name and Ticket columns since they don't contribute much to the survival rate. Next, we apply simple median imputation to handle missing Age values. After defining the target variable y and independent variables X, we call the `iterative_soft_thresholding` function provided by the `isoft_handler` module. The function returns the binary mask M, the inverse soft thresholding matrix W, and the number of iterations required to converge. Finally, we multiply M and W to get the predicted values Xhat, which we print out for the first five records.

Note that the iterative_soft_thresholding() function expects numpy arrays as inputs and outputs numpy arrays as well. So, we convert the pandas DataFrame objects to numpy arrays using `.values`. If the dataset contains string or categorical variables, we can encode them using OneHotEncoder or LabelEncoder respectively before passing the data to the iterative_soft_thresholding() function.

## Using Scikit-Learn Library
Scikit-learn is a popular open source machine learning library that provides implementations of most classical machine learning algorithms. It includes preprocessing functions such as missing value imputation, scaling, normalization, and encoding. Moreover, it provides modules for handling outliers using the EllipticEnvelope estimator. The following code shows an example implementation using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset:

``` python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from ellipticEnvelope import EllipticEnvelope
from isoft_handler import iterative_soft_thresholding 

# Load the dataset
cancer = load_breast_cancer()
df = pd.DataFrame(cancer.data, columns=cancer.feature_names)
target = cancer.target

# Scale the data using MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_size = int(len(scaled_data)*0.7)
X_train, X_test = scaled_data[:train_size], scaled_data[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = target[:train_size], target[train_size:]

# Build a random forest classifier and train it on the training data
rf = RandomForestClassifier()
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)
acc_rf = round(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred), 2)

# Build an SVM classifier and train it on the training data
svc = SVC(kernel='rbf')
svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = svc.predict(X_test)
acc_svc = round(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred), 2)

# Remove outliers using EllipticEnvelope estimator
ee = EllipticEnvelope()
ee.fit(X_train)
new_mask = ee.predict(X_train) == 1
X_no_outliers = X_train[new_mask,:]
y_no_outliers = y_train[new_mask]

# Apply ISOFT algorithm to handle missing values
M, W, _ = iterative_soft_thresholding(X_no_outliers)
X_no_mv = M*W
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_transformed = pca.fit_transform(X_no_mv)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
scatter = plt.scatter(X_transformed[:,0], X_transformed[:,1], c=y_no_outliers, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, alpha=0.9)
plt.title("PCA Plot of Breast Cancer Data without Missing Values and Outliers", fontsize=14)
plt.colorbar(scatter)
plt.show()
```

Here, we first load the breast cancer diagnostic dataset from scikit-learn using the `load_breast_cancer` function. Then, we scale the features using MinMaxScaler to ensure all features have similar scales. Next, we split the data into training and testing sets. We build a random forest classifier and train it on the training data. We then build an SVM classifier and train it on the training data. To remove outliers, we fit an EllipticEnvelope object on the training data and use it to predict which samples are inliers (non-outliers) and which are outliers (ones marked with a label of -1). We store only the inliers in separate matrices X_no_outliers and y_no_outliers. Then, we apply ISOFT algorithm to handle missing values using the `iterative_soft_thresholding()` function. Finally, we perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the cleaned up data and plot it using matplotlib.

## Summary
In summary, both pandas and scikit-learn provide easy-to-use interfaces for handling missing values and outliers. Both allow us to preprocess the data and extract relevant features. Furthermore, scikit-learn's EllipticEnvelope estimator can be used to detect and remove outliers from the data. Lastly, using the iterative_soft_thresholding() function provided by the isoft_handler module, we can remove any remaining missing values and outliers from the data efficiently.
