# 1.简介
  

在图像分类任务中，Transfer learning（迁移学习）技术得到广泛应用。其思想就是利用预训练模型提取出有用的特征，然后再将这些特征作为网络初始化参数，进而进行训练。这样既可以加速训练过程，又可以获得预训练模型已经学到的有效特征。迁移学习在图像分类、目标检测、人脸识别等领域均取得了成功。

本文将介绍如何通过TensorFlow实现迁移学习，并用CIFAR10数据集做实验。

## 2.1 Transfer Learning
Transfer learning refers to transferring knowledge learned from one domain or task to another problem of similar nature. For instance, if we want to classify images in the context of a specific type of animals, then transfer learning can help us learn useful features such as scales and shapes by training on large datasets such as ImageNet (ILSVRC) dataset, which contains millions of labeled images belonging to different species of animals. Once these features are learned, they can be used to train our model more efficiently and accurately for this particular set of animals. 

In general, transfer learning is an approach where we take advantage of pre-existing models that have been trained on a related task but with slightly different data distribution or fewer classes than our target task. We fine-tune these pre-trained models on our own task using the available data and update them with our new labels to further improve their accuracy. This technique has been proven successful in many applications including object recognition, speech recognition, face recognition, and gaming. It can significantly reduce the time and computational resources required for training deep neural networks. 
## 2.2 TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. It provides several APIs: high-level APIs like Keras, low-level APIs like tf.Session() and tf.Variable(), as well as tools like TensorBoard for visualization and debugging. In recent years, it has become increasingly popular among researchers working on various machine learning problems because of its ease of use and scalability. 

We will be using TensorFlow to implement Transfer Learning for image classification. The steps involved in doing so are outlined below. 
# 3.Core algorithm and operation process
## Step 1: Prepare Datasets
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. Here's how to load the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow API:


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()
```

Next, let's normalize pixel values between 0 and 1 and convert labels to one-hot vectors.


```python
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0

train_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(train_labels)
test_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(test_labels)
```

## Step 2: Load Pre-trained Model
We will be using VGG16 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset as base network. However, you can use any other pre-trained model or build your own custom model architecture based on the output layers of pre-trained model. Let's first load the pre-trained VGG16 model using the following code:

```python
base_model = tf.keras.applications.VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(32, 32, 3))
```

Here, `include_top` parameter specifies whether to include the fully connected layers at the top of the network or not. Setting it to False means that only the convolutional part of the model will be loaded while setting it to True includes both the convolutional and fully connected parts. 

After loading the model, we need to freeze all the weights except for the last layer since those correspond to our classification outputs. Also, we will add some dense layers on top of the pre-trained model. These layers will act as a regularizer during training and may prevent overfitting of the final classifier layers.  

```python
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False
    
x = Flatten()(base_model.output)
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)
```

Now, the pre-trained VGG16 model is ready to be trained on our CIFAR-10 dataset. 

## Step 3: Train Network
We will be using Adam optimizer along with categorical crossentropy loss function. To perform data augmentation during training, we will be using random horizontal flipping and random cropping. Finally, we will compile the model with specified metrics. 


```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

aug = ImageDataGenerator(horizontal_flip=True,
                         width_shift_range=0.1,
                         height_shift_range=0.1,
                         zoom_range=0.2,
                         rotation_range=20)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.001)

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit_generator(aug.flow(train_images, train_labels, batch_size=32),
                              epochs=50,
                              validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
```

Here, we are passing the data generator to fit_generator method instead of numpy arrays directly. Within the data generator, we apply randomly generated transformations to the original images to increase diversity of samples and also speed up the training process. Finally, after training the model for 50 epochs, we evaluate its performance on the test set. 

Once the training is complete, we save the model for future use.
