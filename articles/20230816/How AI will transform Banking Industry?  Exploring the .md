## 定义及目的
As technology continues to transform and disrupt finance, there is a critical need for banks to take advantage of these innovations. It has been shown that financial services can be enhanced by using artificial intelligence (AI). This industry-changing approach aims at automating complex processes, providing real-time insights, improving customer experience and reducing costs. However, it also poses several challenges to both banks and governments as well as their partners who provide banking solutions to customers worldwide. Therefore, it’s essential to explore how this technology will shape the future of banking industry.

To gain insights into the future of finance technology, we conducted an extensive research study on what challenges are being faced by banks today and potential approaches towards solving them. We analyzed different facets of banking, including customer behavior analysis, risk management, regulatory compliance, pricing and interest rate models, etc., which helped us identify the areas where AI technologies could have the most impact. We also explored various applications such as loan default prediction, credit scoring, portfolio optimization, sentiment analysis, market timing strategy, etc., that require cognitive processing capabilities to automate decision making. Our goal was to develop a comprehensive report that offers a holistic view of how AI technologies will revolutionize the banking industry.

Our study found three key issues facing banks: data silos, slow speed of decisions, and lack of transparency and accountability. Data silos occur when multiple organizations store separate datasets containing customer information or transaction records. Banks cannot make meaningful data-driven decisions based on incomplete sets of data leading to low accuracy, poor decision-making capacity, and increasing complexity of manual processes. Slow speed of decisions contributes to timely response required by customers but may result in losses due to overlooking crucial opportunities. Lack of transparency and accountability results in inconsistent performance and misuse of resources, causing unnecessary risks. To address these problems, our findings highlight the importance of establishing a unified framework across the entire organization and integrating AI capabilities with human expertise through cross-functional teams. Additionally, leveraging big data and advanced analytics techniques to improve predictive modeling would further enhance business outcomes while ensuring security and privacy protections. The pace of development in finance technology continues to accelerate, and more companies should join forces to create the next generation of finance technological products and services. By understanding the challenges and opportunities ahead, banks can effectively implement a strategic plan to ensure they remain competitive in an ever-changing digital economy.
