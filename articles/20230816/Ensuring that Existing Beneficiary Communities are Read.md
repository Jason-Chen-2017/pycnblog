COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is affecting millions of people around the world and is becoming one of the major challenges for global healthcare system due to its fast spread and high mortality rate. The COVID-19 outbreak has already put significant strain on human health systems with various organ failure, resulting in a massive loss of life, including those who were infected by COVID-19 or those who have been exposed to it. Therefore, effective strategies to manage this crisis need to be implemented quickly and efficiently to ensure public safety and long term survival of humanity's economy. 

However, managing such an unprecedented health emergency requires coordination between different stakeholders from government, industry, and medical organizations to achieve a swift recovery and sustainable development for countries. The following scenario provides an example of how beneficiary communities can respond effectively to ensure acceptance of new forms of birth during the COVID-19 pandemic:

 - A newly discovered Covid-19 vaccine candidate enters market leading to widespread adoption across the globe. 

 - With limited financial resources, some groups opt to take advantage of subsidies, loans, and grants provided by governments to support their clinical trials and accelerate access to Covid-19 vaccines. However, as more doctors receive the first injections, low capacity becomes a serious challenge since not all hospitals and clinics can accommodate all patients requiring treatment.

 - Without proper resource allocation mechanisms, these groups may find themselves forced to make difficult choices about which patients to prioritize. Some will choose to halt treatments until sufficient supplies are available, while others will continue without receiving the most important vaccine supply.

 - Despite uncertainty over future epidemic trends, there appears to be growing support for the use of routine immunization as a form of prevention against the next wave of the virus. Beneficiary communities may also be willing to adopt more stringent immunization protocols if they feel it is necessary to protect them from severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, even so, it may still be challenging to allocate scarce resources amongst different constituencies based on various preferences and needs.
 
 - Moreover, considering varying population demographics within each community, some areas may prefer face-to-face interviews with potential donors before going ahead with large-scale delivery of vaccines. Others may decide to wait for an estimated date when more testing capacity becomes available, which could potentially delay the start of the process.

  As we have seen, the COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges to existing beneficiary communities due to both financial and logistic constraints, alongside the stochastic nature of the epidemic itself. This article explores approaches and policies for ensuring successful acceptance of new forms of birth during the COVID-19 pandemic through discussion and illustration using concrete examples. Specifically, we consider four possible solutions to address these issues:

  1. Focused Support For Vaccine Delivery
  2. Resource Allocation Based On Demographics
  3. Protective Immunizations for Severe Illness 
  4. Pre-Testing To Avoid Delays And Missed Treatment

 We hope our analysis and recommendations provide valuable insights into how beneficiary communities can adapt and improve their preparedness and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 # 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## COV-19 Vaccine Efficacy and Availability
In order to understand better how best to approach beneficiary communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, let’s begin by understanding the basics of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COV-19). Simply stated, CORONAVIRUS IS A MORBID VIRUS THAT CAN INFECT PEOPLE AND CAUSE INFECTIONS RANGE FROM THE SMALL REMOTE AREAS TO HOSPITALIZED PERSONS. 

Most cases of COVID-19 occur in persons who meet three main symptoms: fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. These conditions usually last for several days but sometimes require hospitalization. The severity and duration of the infection can vary depending on the individual's health condition, but in general, severe cases cause respiratory failure and/or death, whereas mild cases result in only minor damage. When someone contracts COVID-19, they present serious symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, runny nose, sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion, which can include shortness of breath or dizziness.

The time period between infection and first symptoms is called incubation period, which ranges between five to eight days. Once a person has developed symptoms of COVID-19, they must remain isolated and monitored closely throughout the course of the disease. Only individuals who develop resistance to medications and follow appropriate hygiene measures can become fully infected. Currently, no vaccine exists to prevent or cure COVID-19; however, research is ongoing to develop antiviral drugs, stem cell therapies, and vaccines to combat the virus. 

The efficacy of the vaccine depends on many factors, including the vaccine composition, patient preference, patient age, and immunity response. Currently, two types of vaccines have been approved for COVID-19, known as mRNA vaccines and Vector-borne vaccines. Both mRNA vaccines and Vector-borne vaccines offer similar protection against COVID-19, but mRNA vaccines tend to have higher efficacy and lower side effects than Vector-borne vaccines. Furthermore, mRNA vaccines can be administered at lower cost compared to Vector-borne vaccines because of their shorter manufacturing cycle. Finally, mRNA vaccines are likely to be more widely available and readily accessible than Vector-borne vaccines, particularly in regions where personal protective equipment (PPE) distribution is limited or nonexistent.

To determine whether a specific vaccine candidate can produce acceptable results, clinical studies are conducted. Approximately half of all cases of COVID-19 develop in persons who have received an RNA vaccine. Successful clinical trials show that certain vaccine candidates can reduce the symptoms significantly and lead to improved overall outcomes in various diseases, including pneumonia, lung disease, heart attack, asthma, and other critical conditions.

Due to the lack of widespread use of any single vaccine candidate, several vaccine candidates are being tested concurrently to identify the most effective strategy. Currently, several companies, such as Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, are working together to coordinate the production, approval, and distribution of multiple vaccines. Each company produces customized vaccines targeting different populations with varying tolerances and dosages, which should help to balance the demand for high-quality vaccines with limited resources. By providing a diverse range of options to beneficiaries, the risk of infection can be reduced, even when individual families cannot afford to purchase a second dose.

## Different Types of Birth Assistance
When it comes to birth assistance, there are currently three main categories commonly used: cash assistance, informational assistance, and legal aid. In case of COVID-19 pandemic, cash assistance remains the primary source of assistance, followed by informational assistance and finally legal aid.

### Cash Assistance
Cash assistance refers to granting money or funds towards the payment of any medical expenses related to the child's care during the COVID-19 pandemic. It helps alleviate the financial burden placed upon families during this crisis, especially if it reduces the need for additional food or clothing during the duration of the stay. However, efforts to fund such services often leave little room for negotiation, especially when dealing with smaller families or budget cuts made by governments.

One way to mitigate the impact of cash assistance on children's health is to establish dedicated scholarships for parents to assist their children with living expenses like school fees, rent, and groceries. Another option is to create mobile health centers where elderly citizens can access care immediately online. These initiatives would further enhance the access to quality healthcare in remote areas and promote healthy habits early on in life.

Governments might also try to leverage data to inform funding decisions. For instance, recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a survey showing that up to $7.5 billion was spent on COVID-19 assistance through cash assistance. Although less comprehensive than official statistics, such data provides valuable insight into the priorities of government officials and highlights the importance of getting involved early during the pandemic.

### Informational Assistance
Informational assistance is another means of distributing information regarding COVID-19, making it easier for individuals to obtain the required information from local health authorities. This includes educational materials, guidance, mentoring sessions, and other helpful resources. While the content provided varies depending on the category of service requested, there are some common themes such as safe practices, contact tracing procedures, and precautionary measures.

It is essential to ensure that the information provided is accurate and useful to avoid creating confusion and disappointment. One option is to host virtual workshops or webinars to introduce key concepts and methods of COVID-19 management. Other ways to reach out to individuals include reaching out to social media platforms, volunteering at community centers, and encouraging others to share their stories. Governments and agencies can also sponsor programs to encourage adherence to safety guidelines, such as using hand sanitizers, washing hands regularly, wearing masks, and maintaining distance from others.

### Legal Aid
Legal aid involves providing family members with legal representation in the event of an emergency. Various lawsuits can arise due to the complexity of the situation, such as misunderstanding or conflict of interests, breaches of privacy, or illicit activities. Understanding and respecting the legal boundaries can be critical to success in the field of legal aid.

As part of the legal aid scheme, a parent can seek legal representation from counselors or law firms specialized in the field of healthcare during times of stress or trauma. Lawyers can advocate for a child's right to education, employment, and insurance coverage, among other benefits. They can also discuss alternative plans for supporting their family during the pandemic. Providing certified copies of documentation, such as birth certificates, can increase trustworthiness and enable parents to appeal their rights.
