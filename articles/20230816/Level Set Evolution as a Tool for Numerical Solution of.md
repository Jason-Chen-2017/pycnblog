# 1.简介
  
：
Level Set Evolution (LSE) is an algorithm used in the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). LSE has been proposed as a powerful tool to solve PDEs and provide accurate solutions with low computational cost. However, it requires careful consideration about parameter choice and implementation details, which can be challenging for beginners or experts who are not familiar with the underlying theory. In this article, we will introduce how LSE works and its advantages compared with traditional numerical methods such as finite difference method (FDM), finite element method (FEM) and finite volume method (FVM). We also discuss some common mistakes that new users encounter when using LSE and present several practical examples on solving PDEs numerically. Finally, we hope this article can help advanced users understand LSE better and encourage them to use it effectively in their research projects.

## 2.1 Level Set：
A level set function $\phi(x)$ represents the distance from a given point $p$ to the zero-level set of a scalar field $\psi$, i.e., 
$$\phi(p)=\inf_{\xi \in \mathbb{R}^n}|\psi(\xi)-\psi(p)|,$$
where $(\xi-\xi')=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}(p-\xi')$. The level set function $\phi$ determines all points $x$ where $\psi=0$. 

## 2.2 Level Set Evolution（LSE）:
In LSE, we first define a zero-centered implicit surface $\Omega+\delta\phi$, where $\delta\phi$ is defined by a level set function $\phi$. Then, we construct the solution $\Psi$ iteratively by updating $\phi$ based on the following equation:
$$\phi^{k+1}(x)=\min_{y\in\Omega}\left\{c_k^T\nabla\psi(y)+d_k-|\psi(x)-\psi(y)|+\eta\max_{z\in\Omega}|z-x|\right\}.$$
The notation above assumes that there are $m$ different constraints on the level set function, denoted by $(c_1,\cdots,c_m)\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$, $\eta>0$, and $(d_1,\cdots,d_m)\in\mathbb{R}_+^\times$. These parameters depend on the specific problem being solved. After each iteration, the magnitude of change between successive iterations is measured and compared to a specified tolerance value to determine if convergence has been achieved. If the maximum number of iterations have been reached without achieving convergence, then the process is terminated. At the end of the algorithm, the final value of $\phi$ gives us a signed distance function representing the boundary separating two parts of the domain, whose location and size may vary depending on the initial values of the constraint parameters.

## 2.3 Constraint Parameters：
As mentioned earlier, the constraint parameters $(c_k,\cdots,d_k)$ affect the shape of the level set function $\phi$. Specifically, they control whether the resulting implicit surface is inside or outside the domain $\Omega$, as well as the overall curvature and size of the object represented by the level set function. There are various ways to choose these parameters. One approach is to start with simple ones, e.g., a single constraint specifying only the sign of the level set function $\phi$, followed by more complex combinations involving multiple variables or other factors that might influence the behavior of the solution. However, care must be taken to ensure that the chosen parameters produce realistic results by accounting for the geometry and physics involved in the problem at hand. 

## 2.4 Time Integration Techniques:
Another important aspect of LSE is time integration techniques. Depending on the nature of the problem, the time step size and duration of the simulation may need to be adjusted accordingly. Commonly used techniques include explicit Runge-Kutta schemes, implicit midpoint scheme, and Crank-Nicolson scheme. Each technique produces slightly different results but generally converge to similar solutions within reasonable error bounds. It should be noted that choosing a good time integration scheme is often more critical than the choice of the constraint parameters since they can significantly impact the accuracy of the solution. Therefore, many experiments involve varying the time integration parameters over a range of values and comparing the resulting solutions to obtain insights into their effectiveness.
