This article discusses the benefits of moving to cloud-based solutions for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) from a technical perspective. SME is an acronym that stands for small and medium-sized enterprises. According to Gartner's latest report on IT modernization trends, SME companies account for about 49% of the global enterprise workforce in 2017. A large proportion of these organizations are currently under pressure to optimize their business processes or compete with larger players by offering unique value propositions or new products. As such, it’s essential for small businesses to be able to adapt quickly and effectively to changing market conditions while still remaining competitive. 

Cloud computing has emerged as a technology that addresses this problem by enabling organizations to scale up services without having to invest significant capital in hardware infrastructure. Additionally, the ease of deployment, scalability, flexibility, cost reduction, and low latency offered by cloud platforms make them ideal for smaller organizations looking to move fast and break things. However, SMEs face several challenges when considering migration to the cloud:

1. Security issues - cloud environments often involve high levels of security measures to protect sensitive information, but they can also introduce potential threats like data breaches or hacking attacks if not properly managed. 

2. Frequent changes in business needs - SME companies usually have shorter product cycles than those operating within a traditional corporate structure, which means that constant retraining and updating of employees is commonplace. This dynamic could cause delays or frustration when switching to a cloud-based platform. 

3. Vendor lock-in - Many SMEs rely heavily on third party software and applications, making it difficult to switch vendors at a later date. Some may find themselves stuck with one vendor even after trying out other options due to the investment required to migrate all applications. 

4. Complexity of integrating different systems - Migrating multiple applications across clouds requires careful planning and testing to ensure compatibility between all components. For example, integrating legacy systems running on physical servers with cloud-based services can be challenging. 

5. Restricted resources - SMEs often lack the necessary resources or authority to deploy complex cloud architectures. They may need to seek external help or hire additional staff to handle the workload of managing the platform. 

6. Intra-organizational communication overhead - While there are many online communities and support mechanisms available for SMEs who want to learn more about cloud technologies, building internal knowledge sharing networks can be challenging. In addition, established team structures might not lend itself well to rapidly evolving communication protocols. 

In conclusion, SMEs should carefully consider the advantages and tradeoffs associated with migrating to the cloud, as the long-term savings could far exceed the costs involved in establishing a full-scale cloud environment. Nevertheless, getting started with cloud migration will require dedicated teams focused on developing the skills needed to overcome barriers, such as security best practices, organizational change management, application portability, and integration testing. By focusing on core priorities related to people, process, and technology, SMEs can achieve significant gains through increased efficiency and improved business outcomes. Therefore, it is essential for small businesses to adopt a hybrid approach that combines local solutions with cloud-based alternatives to maximize their return on investment while meeting the specific challenges of each industry sector.
