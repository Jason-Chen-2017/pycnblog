Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of deep learning models that can process sequential data such as text or speech. They have been shown to perform particularly well on natural language processing tasks like language modeling and sequence prediction problems. This article will provide an overview of RNN-based text generation using the Python programming language and Google's Tensorflow framework. It will also cover important concepts like attention mechanisms, beam search decoding and other advanced techniques for improving performance and generating more accurate results. We'll be using examples from the literature to illustrate how these algorithms work and demonstrate their effectiveness through extensive experiments.

In this article, we will explore several types of recurrent neural network architectures suitable for text generation: vanilla RNNs, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and convolutional LSTM (Conv-LSTM). We will implement each model in TensorFlow and compare their performance in terms of speed, accuracy and generalization ability on standard benchmarks like Penn TreeBank dataset and Shakespeare dataset. 

We'll then go over some popular applications of RNNs for text generation, including machine translation, image captioning, conversational systems and sentiment analysis. Finally, we will discuss future research directions and challenges for realizing breakthroughs in text generation technology.

Before proceeding further, it is essential to mention that although this article will provide technical details about various text generation algorithms, its main purpose is not to provide an exhaustive account of all related topics in NLP. Instead, it focuses solely on the core concepts and implementation aspects of RNNs applied to text generation, which is already quite a vast field and would make this an impressive but still incomplete survey paper. Nevertheless, I hope it may be useful to readers interested in exploring new ideas and approaches in natural language processing. 

# 2.Background Introduction
The goal of text generation is to produce human-like texts with specific characteristics such as style, grammar and meaning. One way to approach this problem is by using RNNs, a type of deep learning model architecture designed specifically for processing sequential data. These models can analyze input sequences one token at a time, maintaining state information across multiple tokens. The key idea behind RNNs is to use the current inputs and previous states to predict the next outputs.

To generate text, we typically start with a seed word or sentence and feed it into our RNN-based system to get predictions for the next few words. In turn, we can choose the most probable output based on the probabilities assigned by the RNN, refine the input sequence by adding the predicted word(s) to it and repeat the process until we reach a desired length of generated text.

There are many different variants of RNNs suited for text generation, ranging from simple feedforward neural networks to complex recursive ones. In this article, we focus on three commonly used types of RNN architectures — vanilla RNNs, long short-term memory (LSTM) units and gated recurrent unit (GRU) cells. Each of these models has unique strengths and weaknesses, making them ideal for different types of tasks. For example, vanilla RNNs are easier to train than LSTMs and GRUs because they do not require specialized training techniques, while LSTMs offer better long-term memory capacity compared to GRUs. On the other hand, LSTMs are capable of handling variable-length input sequences better than vanilla RNNs, allowing us to create more coherent and informative output.  

Each variant of RNNs involves defining a set of weights and biases that determine the interaction between the inputs, hidden states, and output layers. Within these layers, there are additional operations such as activation functions, dropout regularization, batch normalization, etc., which add robustness and stability to the model during training and inference. Once trained, we can apply various post-processing techniques such as sampling, beam search decoding, or conditional probability estimation to improve the quality of the generated text.

We'll begin with a brief overview of RNNs before moving on to detail about the individual components of text generation with RNNs. Let’s dive in!
