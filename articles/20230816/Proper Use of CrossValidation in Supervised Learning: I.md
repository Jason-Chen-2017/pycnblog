Cross Validation (CV) is a popular method used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and to prevent overfitting problems. It consists of dividing the dataset into two subsets called training set and testing set. The model is trained on the training set and then tested on the testing set using CV techniques such as k-fold cross validation or leave-one-out validation. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of different types of CV methods, how they can be applied in supervised learning tasks, and why they are important for achieving high accuracy results. This article will also cover some key statistical concepts involved in CV, including bias, variance, and error. Finally, we will present several examples from literature that illustrate the importance of proper use of CV technique in various supervised learning scenarios. This paper is intended for technical experts who are working with machine learning algorithms in real-world applications. However, anyone interested in gaining insights about CV may find it helpful.

## 2.1. CV Overview
In order to understand CV better, let's first have a look at what exactly CV is. In general terms, CV involves breaking down a given data set into smaller parts and using them to train and test a predictive model while ensuring that each part represents the same underlying distribution of data points. There are many variations of CV, but the most commonly used ones are k-fold CV and leave-one-out (LOO) validation. 

### K-Fold Cross Validation
K-Fold Cross Validation (k-fold CV) involves splitting the original dataset into k non-overlapping subsets called folds, which are used as either training or testing sets during the training process. Each iteration considers one of the k folds as the testing set and uses the remaining k − 1 folds for training purposes. After all iterations are completed, the average accuracies or other evaluation metrics are calculated based on the final predictions made by the k models trained on each fold.


In k-fold CV, there are two main advantages compared to LOO validation:

1. Reduced variance: Since each subset is used only once to validate the model, the overall accuracy estimate is more reliable than with LOO validation, particularly when the number of samples in the dataset is small. 

2. Better estimation of out-of-sample performance: With k-fold CV, you can get a better idea of how well your model will perform on new data that was not used during the modeling process. You can see if your model has systematic errors or if its behavior changes significantly across the range of possible inputs.

### Leave-One-Out Cross Validation
Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOO CV), also known as iterated LOO (ILOO) is similar to k-fold CV except that instead of creating multiple subsets, it leaves out each sample in turn until the whole dataset is used for both training and testing purposes. The sample that is left out becomes the testing set, and the rest of the dataset is treated as the training set. At each iteration, the algorithm fits a separate model on the remaining n−1 samples, leaving out the nth sample. The goal is to obtain unbiased estimates of the out-of-sample error rate of the model.


The advantage of LOO CV is its simplicity. While k-fold CV can be computationally expensive for large datasets, ILOO requires only linear time complexity O(n). Additionally, since no repeated samples are used for testing, it avoids any potential issues associated with having too few samples in the testing set. On the other hand, LOO CV does not give as good an estimate of the error rate as k-fold CV because it relies on just a single sample being left out each iteration. Thus, if a particular sample contains unique characteristics or information not seen in the other samples, LOO CV may end up underestimating the accuracy.

Overall, k-fold CV seems like a more effective choice in practice, especially when dealing with complex data sets that require careful preprocessing steps before applying traditional ML algorithms. While LOO CV remains useful for certain situations where computational efficiency is critical or when the dataset size is very limited, its drawbacks make it less often used in modern ML applications.
