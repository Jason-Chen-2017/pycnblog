Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning algorithm that enables an agent to learn how to make decisions in complex environments by trial-and-error interaction with its environment. The goal of RL algorithms is to find the optimal action sequence or policy for each state and then maximize their long-term reward over time. In this article, we will introduce you to RL basics and some popular deep reinforcement learning algorithms including DQN (Deep Q Network), DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization). We hope this article can help you understand and apply deep RL techniques effectively on your projects.

In order to explain these algorithms, I assume readers have basic understanding of the following concepts:
 - Markov decision processes (MDPs): MDPs describe the dynamics of an environment where agents interact with each other and receive rewards based on their actions. A typical MDP contains states, actions, and transition probabilities between states, as well as immediate rewards and discount factors. 
 - Value functions and Bellman equations: Value function represents the expected return of taking a particular action in a given state under certain conditions. It is defined as the sum of expected future rewards from that state. We use Bellman equation to update the value function at each step of our agent's trajectory through the environment.

If you are familiar with these concepts, please skip directly to section 2. Otherwise, let's dive into it!
# 2. Basic Concepts of Reinforcement Learning
## 2.1 Agent and Environment
The agent and environment are the two main components of reinforcement learning. An agent takes actions in the environment according to a policy, which is defined as a mapping from state to action. At each timestep, the agent receives feedback about its performance and the next state it transitions to. This process continues until the episode ends when the agent reaches a terminal state or the maximum number of steps is reached. 

An example of such environment could be a grid world, where the agent moves around in a maze while collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. The agent starts at one corner of the maze and has four possible actions (up, down, left, right) to choose from. Whenever the agent takes an action, it may either move onto a new square or encounter an obstacle, causing the episode to end prematurely. The agent also receives a scalar reward for moving towards the treasure chest, but loses a small penalty for getting caught in an obstacle.

## 2.2 Rewards and Returns
Rewards are used to evaluate the agent's behavior and guide it toward achieving goals. Each time the agent completes an action, it gets a numerical reward signal. However, the true utility of the agent is determined not only by the cumulative reward received after the action, but also the costs associated with every previous state, action pair. This means that in addition to obtaining the current reward, the agent must also face the consequences of all previous actions in order to determine whether to take a particular action now.

To measure the agent's overall performance, we need to define what constitutes a successful episode and assign appropriate rewards accordingly. For example, if the agent needs to navigate a maze and collect all the coins without getting lost, it should get a high positive reward for reaching the final destination and zero reward everywhere else. On the other hand, if the agent needs to train an autonomous vehicle to follow traffic rules and avoid accidents, it should get negative penalties for crashing into pedestrians or violating road signs. Therefore, designing effective reward schemes requires careful consideration of both immediate and long-term benefits.

Return is the total amount of reward obtained by the agent starting from a specific state and performing a specific set of actions. Return is usually calculated recursively using future returns. Mathematically, we have:

$$G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \cdots = \sum^{\infty}_{k=0}\gamma^kR_{t+k+1}$$

where $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $R_t$ denotes the reward at time $t$. Discount factor determines the importance of future rewards relative to immediate ones, and allows us to control the tradeoff between exploring the unknown future and exploiting the present moment. By accumulating future returns, the agent learns more efficiently how to act based on the entire history of experience instead of focusing solely on the current situation.

## 2.3 State Representation
State representation plays an essential role in reinforcement learning. Unlike supervised learning where data samples consist of input variables and output labels, reinforcement learning deals with dynamic systems whose states change continuously. As a result, representing states as raw pixel values or even text strings would be impractical. Instead, we typically represent states using high-dimensional vectors called feature vectors or representations. Feature vectors contain information about the objectives, constraints, and internal states of the system, making them ideal candidates for state representations in RL problems.

Some common state representations include pixel observations, raw position coordinates, velocities, rotations, and joint angles. To extract features from complex visual inputs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Other types of structured or unstructured data such as natural language, audio signals, and social media messages are often represented using vector representations, sometimes known as embeddings. 

We can combine multiple low-level states into higher-order features, forming a composite state representation that captures important aspects of the underlying system. Some popular composite state representations include hierarchical structures like trees or graphs, learned abstractions like belief states, or hybrid models combining both symbolic and numeric representations. Overall, finding a good balance between richness and complexity of the state representation is crucial for successful reinforcement learning. 

## 2.4 Action Selection Strategies
Action selection strategies play an essential role in reinforcement learning because they dictate how the agent chooses actions to take in different situations. There are several ways to select actions in reinforcement learning, ranging from simple greedy policies to sophisticated probabilistic models that consider the uncertainty of the environment and the agent's past behavior. Despite the diversity of approaches, there are some fundamental principles shared among most action selection methods:

 - **Exploitation**: Exploitation refers to selecting actions that lead to a higher expected reward than those resulting from exploration. This involves balancing exploitation and exploration during training to ensure that the agent finds the best solution within the limited time and computational resources available. One way to achieve exploitation is to use softmax functions or temperature scaling to modify the agent's preferences for selecting deterministic actions. Alternatively, we can employ an epsilon-greedy strategy that randomly selects actions with probability ε and uses the current estimate of the optimal policy otherwise. 

 - **Exploration**: Exploration refers to taking actions that are uncertain or explore novel territory. Typically, we explore by generating random actions or using stochastic policies that sample actions from a distribution over possible actions. Random exploration helps increase the diversity of trajectories and provides robustness against suboptimal solutions, while optimistic exploration encourages the agent to explore potentially beneficial actions. Additionally, we can use multi-step bootstrap targets to smooth out noisy estimates of the value function. 

 - **Transferability**: Transferability refers to transferring knowledge acquired in one problem domain to another related problem domain. This is especially relevant in settings where training data is scarce or highly redundant. One approach to transfer learning is to freeze part of the model and finetune the remaining layers on target data that is similar to the original task but slightly different. Another option is to ensemble several trained models and average their predictions. Finally, we can leverage expert demonstrations to align the agent's prior preferences with those of the expert and encourage her to imitate them whenever she makes a mistake. 

Ultimately, the choice of action selection method ultimately depends on the requirements and capabilities of the specific task being addressed. While we cannot give a complete list of suitable action selection strategies, the above explanations provide a general framework for understanding the key ideas behind action selection in reinforcement learning. 
# 3. Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
Now that we have discussed the core concepts of reinforcement learning, we can start looking at various deep reinforcement learning algorithms that address challenging real-world problems. These algorithms build upon classical reinforcement learning techniques by introducing additional insights and theoretical guarantees. They utilize deep neural networks to map state space to action distributions, enabling them to handle high-dimensional inputs and complex action spaces. 

There are three broad categories of deep reinforcement learning algorithms, depending on how much emphasis is placed on speed, efficiency, or sample-efficiency: 

1. Model-based algorithms: These algorithms construct a model of the environment and optimize the action selection based on the estimated value of the future rewards. One prominent example of model-based RL is the Deep Q-Network (DQN), which applies a deep neural network to approximate the action-value function, allowing it to capture non-linearities in the environment's dynamics. DQN has been shown to perform particularly well in a wide range of domains, from simple grid-world games to robotic manipulation tasks. 

2. Actor-critic algorithms: These algorithms simultaneously learn an actor and critic function to improve their own estimations of the value function. The actor generates action proposals based on the current policy and the critic evaluates the quality of these proposals based on the current state and action. The advantage of this setup is that the critic can focus on evaluating the actions taken by the actor rather than relying on an external evaluation function. Several variants of AC algorithms have emerged, including Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), Proximal Policy Optimizaton (PPO), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). All of these algorithms share a central theme of off-policy updates that allow them to leverage sample efficiency by sampling from replay buffers rather than the actual environment. 

3. Hybrid algorithms: These algorithms blend elements of model-based and actor-critic algorithms, choosing to prioritize one or the other aspect of the learning procedure depending on the level of abstraction required for a particular application. Examples of hybrid algorithms include AlphaGo, which combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with deep neural networks to discover game-theoretic optimal strategies. Similarly, Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) augments the replay buffer with synthetic rollouts that enhance the value estimation of the recent events, leading to improved performance compared to standard DQN. 

All of these algorithms share the common characteristic of utilizing deep neural networks to represent state and action spaces, which offers several advantages including expressiveness and scalability. The choice of algorithm depends largely on the nature of the problem at hand, the size and complexity of the action space, and the computational resources available. Nevertheless, there remains significant room for improvement and development in these areas, and we expect that more advanced methods will emerge in the near future.
