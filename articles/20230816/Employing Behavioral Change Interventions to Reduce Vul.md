：COVID-19 pandemic has caused global concern around public healthcare infrastructure as well as individuals’ vulnerability towards the virus. The surge of cases in various countries has presented a crucial opportunity for professionals working in public healthcare to develop interventions that can effectively reduce these vulnerabilities and increase patient engagement during this challenging time. However, there is still much uncertainty about how best to achieve such impacts on patients while minimizing risks and achieving high compliance levels with guidelines established by national authorities. 

In this article, we will explore one approach known as "Behavioral Change Interventions" (BCI) which aims at providing strategies for both preventative measures and non-pharmacological solutions that may help improve public health outcomes while reducing risk aversion and vulnerability among patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, our goal will be to create a novel concept and design an intervention that helps improve the mental health status of patients who are most likely to contract the disease based on their demographics, clinical symptoms, and social factors, thus allowing them to receive appropriate care and treatment at home. 


We start by introducing relevant background information, such as: what exactly is behavioral change? What are its potential benefits and challenges? How does it compare to other approaches like prevention or medication management? We then explain the basic concepts behind BCI including why they work and how they interact with medical practices. Next, we describe the core algorithmic mechanisms used by BCI to target specific groups of patients based on their risk factors. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of BCI using real-world data from a large multi-center trial involving more than 7,000 patients across five US states. In conclusion, we discuss key lessons learned from this research and suggest ways forward to further advance this topic and expand its application beyond just the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.


# 2.Background Introduction
## Why Behavioral Change Interventions?
The term 'behavioral change' refers to any strategy that involves changing someone's behavior over time in order to optimize or enhance some aspect of their life. For instance, psychologists use behavioral changes to help people identify negative behaviors and turn them into positive traits. Similarly, marketing professionals often employ behavioral changes to attract new customers or retain existing ones by changing consumer preferences or persuading them to adopt new behaviors. 

However, when it comes to addressing issues related to COVID-19, traditional approaches have not been effective. Health officials need to adapt quickly so that critical public health resources are available and able to support the population in a safe and effective manner. Moreover, there is a growing concern that behavioral change could be a powerful tool for addressing public health concerns such as depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety. In short, the urgency and scale of this emerging public health challenge require new approaches to address current barriers and ensure long-term success.

The purpose of this study is to propose a novel concept called Behavioral Change Interventions (BCI), which provides strategies for both preventative measures and non-pharmacological solutions that can help improve public health outcomes while reducing risk aversion and vulnerability among patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Therefore, BCI is an evolutionary approach that combines two main components - intervention strategies and targeting criteria - together to provide targeted personalized treatment plans that optimize patient outcomes. It targets individuals who are most at risk and those who possess unique characteristics who are especially vulnerable due to several medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cataract, epilepsy, etc., enabling them to receive optimal care and treatment. As a result, BCI aims to minimize the effects of COVID-19 on healthy individuals through improved mental health outcomes and alleviate pain associated with the disease. Overall, BCI offers a cost-effective and sustainable solution that can contribute significantly towards solving the health problems caused by COVID-19.

## Key Principles of BCI
BCI relies on four key principles to target individual groups of patients and optimize treatments accordingly:

1. Patient Satisfaction and Autonomy: Despite the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, BCI must focus on developing interventions that provide greater autonomy and satisfaction to affected individuals without compromising essential services such as medical care, grocery shopping, or education. This requires creating new systems of care coordination and communication between providers, families/caregivers, and patients, all of whom play a vital role in receiving and understanding medical care.

2. Tailored Care Plans: To meet the needs of different populations, BCI must consider varying demographic factors, symptom severity, cultural backgrounds, access to healthcare resources, income level, etc., when selecting and tailoring therapeutic options to individuals. These factors are fundamental to the development of better treatments and experiences for each patient, ensuring that patients receive the right type of care at the right time according to their preferences and abilities.

3. Social Factor Influence: Because the COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges for society, it is essential to leverage human interactions and networks to reach out to individuals who are most in need and to train them on proper safety protocols. By utilizing familiar social norms, lifestyle choices, values, beliefs, and goals, BCI can guide individuals to prioritize important tasks and promote healthy living styles.

4. Continuous Monitoring: Once an individual receives the necessary treatment, monitoring and evaluation should continue throughout their journey to maintain optimal functioning. Medical professionals should continuously monitor the progress of patients to ensure they remain safe and healthy. At the same time, patients should also be provided with ongoing feedback and counseling on how to manage their condition and their recovery.

Based on these principles, BCI seeks to target patients who are most at risk and those with unique attributes such as obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cataract, and epilepsy, based on factors such as age, gender, location, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immunocompromised status, medical history, and clinical outcome. 

# 3.Core Concepts and Terms
## Patient Satisfaction and Autonomy
One of the biggest challenges facing BCI is ensuring that affected individuals do not experience discomfort or frustration during their interaction with the provider, family members, or caregivers. To address this issue, we must establish clear expectations regarding the duration and nature of the session(s). In addition, we must encourage patients to share their own experiences and feelings with others if possible, encouraging them to reflect on their mistakes and successes. This approach ensures that individuals remain empowered to make decisions about their care independently after being given the option to choose from multiple options.

Additionally, BCI can involve third parties involved in delivering care, such as medical staff, hospitals, or nursing homes. By providing clear instructions and monitoring calls regularly, providers can ensure that individuals follow procedures safely and responsibly and avoid unnecessary side effects. Furthermore, having direct contact with individuals throughout the process can enable them to express their opinions, seek clarification, and get the support they need when needed.

## Personalized Therapies and Mental Health Outcomes
To optimize the therapy delivery process, BCI recommends considering several factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, medical condition, medical history, physical and mental health status, mobility, educational attainment, and income level. Based on these factors, BCI can recommend personalized therapies tailored specifically to the patient. Examples include acupuncture for neurological disorders, herbal remedies for addictions, psychotherapy for depression, music therapy for depression, exercise techniques for chronic pain, massage therapy for stress relief, hypnotherapy for anxiety, etc.

It is essential to note that it is impossible to predict the exact impact that each therapy will have on the patient’s quality of life. Therefore, BCI strives to evaluate and refine the therapies offered over time to ensure they provide optimal results. Additionally, BCI can utilize peer review to analyze therapies and determine whether they offer meaningful improvements in outcomes.

By incorporating social and emotional factors into the treatment plan, BCI hopes to foster a sense of belonging and community acceptance, which promotes loyalty and reduces the likelihood of isolation. To do this, BCI can include playful activities and interactive programs that promote social connection, self-esteem, and mental health.
