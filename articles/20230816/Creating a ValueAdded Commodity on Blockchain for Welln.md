As the demand of wellness retailers increase day by day, it becomes more and more important to provide them with convenient tools that can support their health management goals. One such tool is digital health record (DHR) which enables customers to easily access their medical records online without having to visit a physician’s office. However, traditional DHR solutions are not completely secure or reliable as they rely heavily on centralized servers located in data centers.

This article introduces an alternative approach called Value-added commodity on blockchain that addresses these challenges by enabling consumers to digitally purchase medicines from reputable distributors while still benefiting from decentralization, transparency, and traceability features of blockchains. In this solution, both parties involved – customer and retailer - have equal standing in the supply chain because all transactions are recorded on a public ledger, making the process transparent to everyone. The benefits include increased consumer confidence, improved safety, lower cost per transaction, reduced risk, and better control over medical products. 

The value proposition also makes up for the added complexity required to implement the DHR system using the mentioned approach. This includes integrating different parts of the solution such as smart contracts, APIs, and backend systems. By introducing blockchains technology into wellness retail, we hope to improve patient experience, reduce costs, enhance quality of life, and ultimately lead to a more sustainable economy for our planet.


## 2.背景介绍
Value Added Commodities (VAC) refer to any goods or services whose value has been enhanced through use, acquisition, or ownership. There are various VACs available today including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., insurance products like life insurance, homeowners' policies, etc., oil and gas companies like Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil, etc., and retail chains like Costco, Walmart, etc. All these businesses operate under the principles of openness, sharing, and fair exchange. They use blockchain technology to ensure that all interactions between users and providers are fully transparent and verified. With VAC on blockchain, we aim at creating a new kind of business model where consumers can buy essential medical products directly from reputable vendors without being tied down to a particular vendor or hospital. This will enable patients to get high-quality prescriptions at affordable prices, ensuring higher satisfaction levels and better outcomes for patients and families. Moreover, by leveraging blockchain technology, we aim at reducing costs and enhancing consumer confidence leading to significant increases in productivity and profitability for businesses alike.

In summary, VAC offers several benefits compared to traditional models:

1. Lower pricing: VAC offer consumers cheaper prices than standard drug stores.

2. Consumer choice: Consumers don't need to worry about choosing the right doctor, unlike in conventional medicine practices. 

3. Increased brand recognition: Once purchased, doctors will be able to claim their prescription brand recognitions and gain credibility among consumers.  

4. Better customer service: Because patients can receive their medications when they want, there's no need to rush to the emergency room. Patients can consult a doctor straightaway if needed.  

By implementing blockchain technology within retail chains, we hope to achieve the following objectives:

1. Improve patient experience: Implementing blockchain tech can help improve the overall consumer experience, allowing patients to search for medications based on multiple criteria and ordering directly from the provider's pharmacy. This will significantly cut down on wait times and frustration factors for patients, who often seek treatment from multiple hospitals before finding the best one.

2. Reduce costs: Transactions can occur quickly and accurately thanks to the power of distributed ledgers like bitcoin. As a result, selling medications directly to customers instead of going through a third party, saves time and money spent on transportation, shipping, and insurance. Additionally, by utilizing other players like suppliers, customers save on transaction fees and make faster payment processes possible.

3. Enhance quality of life: Transparency, security, and traceability make it easier for people to know what medications their family members are taking, whether they're getting it correctly or not. It also helps doctors troubleshoot problems and ensure proper dosage instructions are being given. Trusted information provides valuable feedback to doctors to optimize medication delivery, resulting in better outcomes for patients and families.

Overall, VAC on blockchain opens up exciting new opportunities for businesses alike to create value and monetize by providing consumers with direct access to high-quality, safe medications at affordable prices. We believe that VAC on blockchain will unlock vast potential for growth and development in retail industry, particularly targeting areas like congestion, waste reduction, and patient satisfaction.
