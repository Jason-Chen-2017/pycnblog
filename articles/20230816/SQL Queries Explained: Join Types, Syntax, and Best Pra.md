Welcome to my blog post on SQL queries! In this article we will explore different join types in SQL, syntax for writing joins, best practices when it comes to joining tables in a relational database system, as well as some code examples and explanations of the algorithms behind them.

Before diving into these topics let's first understand what is a relational database? A relational database stores data in a structured format using rows and columns. Each row represents an entity such as customer, order or product, while each column contains data related to that specific entity. These entities are linked through relationships such as one-to-many or many-to-one, which helps maintain data integrity and provide contextual information. The main components of a relational database system include its schema, table, index, view, query optimizer, and transaction manager. 

A SQL (Structured Query Language) statement typically consists of SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN clauses along with other optional clauses like GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, LIMIT etc., depending on the task at hand. We can use SQL to perform various operations such as insert, update, delete, select, create, drop, alter on databases and tables. SQL allows us to access and manipulate relational data stored in multiple sources including files, flat text files, and spreadsheets, among others. 

In this article we will focus on understanding how to write efficient joins between tables in a relational database system. Efficient joins improve overall performance by reducing unnecessary reads from disk, minimizing the amount of data transferred over the network, and avoiding redundant processing. Therefore, optimizing your joins is critical to achieving optimal performance in any application. Let’s get started exploring the various join types available in SQL.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before we proceed further, let’s quickly cover some basic concepts and terminology used in SQL.

## 2.1 Database
Database - A logical container for storing and organizing data. It is also called "database" but technically refers to collection of schemas, tables, views, indexes, triggers, and other objects.

## 2.2 Table 
Table - A set of related records stored in a particular structure where each record has fields representing attributes of the object being described. Tables are organized hierarchically based on their relationship to one another, usually consisting of columns and rows.

## 2.3 Column
Column - An individual attribute of a particular object represented by a named field within a table. Columns have unique names and contain values of a single data type.

## 2.4 Row/Record
Row/Record - A single unit of storage within a table. Each row contains one or more cells containing data, with each cell corresponding to a separate column. Rows are identified uniquely by their primary key(s).

## 2.5 Primary Key
Primary Key - A special column or combination of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row of data within the table. By default, all tables in SQL have a primary key defined; if none is explicitly specified, then a hidden column called 'rowid' is automatically assigned as the primary key.

## 2.6 Foreign Key
Foreign Key - A column or combination of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table to establish links between tables. This establishes a link between two tables without needing to duplicate data across both tables, resulting in optimized storage and retrieval times.

## 2.7 Index
Index - An index is a data structure designed to speed up searches and retrieve data in ascending or descending order based on a specified column or group of columns. Indexes help ensure that data retrieved by queries is accurate and efficiently sorted before delivery.

Indexes play a crucial role in optimizing data retrieval time, especially for large datasets. They allow quick searching and filtering of data sets based on specific criteria, improving query performance. There are several types of indexes, including B-tree, hash, and XML indexes.

## 2.8 View
View - A virtual table created by combining the result-set of one or more underlying base tables. Views act as simplified copies of the actual data but do not store any additional data. Instead, they provide a way to abstract complex queries and present a consistent interface to end users.

Views enable developers to control access to sensitive data, protect the database structure from unauthorized modifications, and simplify complex reporting requirements.

## 2.9 Join Type
Join Type - Refers to the method or algorithm used to combine rows from multiple tables based on their commonality. The most commonly used join types in SQL include INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN.

INNER JOIN - Returns only those rows from both tables where there is a match in the joined columns. This is the standard inner join operation.

LEFT OUTER JOIN - Returns all the rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table. If there are no matches, NULL is returned in place of the missing value.

RIGHT OUTER JOIN - Returns all the rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table. If there are no matches, NULL is returned in place of the missing value.

CROSS JOIN - Combines every row from one table with every row from the other table, creating a cartesian product. This results in a table with Cartesian product of number of rows in both input tables.

FULL OUTER JOIN - Returns all the rows from both tables, matching pairs of rows where possible, and returns any remaining combinations, whether there is a match or not. If there are no matches, NULL is returned in place of the missing value.

The choice of join type depends on the requirements of the query being executed. For example, if you need to return all the customers who either placed orders or made purchases, you would choose an outer join because you want to include all customers regardless of whether they placed orders or made purchases. On the other hand, if you need to find out the total sales revenue generated by each product category, you would choose an inner join because you only care about products that were sold.
