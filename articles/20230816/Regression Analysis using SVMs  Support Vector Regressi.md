# 1.简介
  

Support vector machines (SVMs), which were introduced in 1995, are one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms for both classification and regression tasks. They are powerful tools that can handle complex non-linear relationships between features and target variables. However, they may not always produce accurate results when dealing with highly non-convex optimization problems. 

Support vector regression (SVR) is an extension of traditional support vector machines, where instead of trying to separate two classes, we want to fit a curve or line through our data points that minimizes the distance between each point and its corresponding predicted value. 

In this article, we will explore SVR by performing linear regression on synthetic dataset generated from scikit learn library. We will also compare the performance of SVR versus ordinary least squares (OLS) and multiple linear regression (MLR).

Let's start!


# 2.相关术语及定义
## Support Vector Machine(SVM) 
支持向量机（support vector machine，SVM）是一种监督学习方法，属于分类模型。其基本思想是通过最大化间隔边界上的分离超平面，将特征空间中的数据点划分到不同的类别中。其中分离超平面定义为满足 margins(最大间隔) 的两类点的 hyperplane ，即在两类距离最近的点之间的直线。

支持向量机由两个最优化问题组成，分别是:

1.求解软间隔最大化问题（soft margin maximization problem），即找到一个超平面，使得样本到超平面的最小距离之和最大化。

2.求解硬间隔最大化问题（hard margin maximization problem），即找到一个超平面，使得样本到超平面的最小距离之差最大化。

在此基础上，提出松弛变量技巧解决了非凸性带来的困难，取得了很好的实验效果。

## Linear Regression 
线性回归（linear regression）是利用直线对一组变量进行预测，它的特点是简单、容易实现、易于理解、计算速度快、结果易于验证和评估，适用于很多领域，如经济、金融、生物等。

线性回归可以表示为 y = wx + b, w 是回归系数或权重参数，x 是自变量或输入数据，y 是因变量或输出数据。通常情况下，x 和 y 可以都是一维数组或矩阵，但也可以是多维数组或矩阵。

线性回归的损失函数一般采用均方误差（mean squared error, MSE）作为衡量标准。损失函数值越小，拟合程度就越好。

## Multiple Linear Regression 
多元线性回归（multiple linear regression）是利用多个自变量来预测因变量的一种回归分析的方法，它是对简单回归的扩展，适用于具有多个自变量影响因变量的情况。

多元线性回igression 可以表示为 Y = B0 + B1X1 +...+ BNXN + E，Y 为因变量，X 为自变量，E 为误差项。B0~BN 为回归系数，也称为斜率。

多元线性回归的特点是假设自变量之间存在线性关系，且各自变量之间相互独立。因此，其假设检验显著性可以用F检验来做。其优点是可以比较不同自变量对因变量影响的大小。

## Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an extension of traditional support vector machines, where instead of trying to separate two classes, we want to fit a curve or line through our data points that minimizes the distance between each point and its corresponding predicted value. 

The main difference between SVR and SVM is that while SVM tries to find the optimal hyperplane to separate the different classes, SVR finds the best hyperplane that passes as far away as possible from all training data without any errors. To do so, it introduces a penalty term that depends on the magnitude of the error made during prediction. This makes sure that no outliers are overly influencing the model’s predictions and helps prevent overfitting. 

The equation for SVR is given by: 


Here, $\mu$ represents the average prediction of all input data points $(x_i)$, $f$ is the decision function which gives us the output of SVR for any new input instance x, N is the total number of sample inputs, C is the regularization parameter, $\epsilon_i$ is the error made at i-th iteration, $\eta$ is the penalty parameter, $\alpha_i$ is the weight assigned to i-th sample, and the sum of all weights equals to C. If $\alpha_i>C$, then we consider the i-th sample as infeasible and remove it from consideration in future iterations. Also, if $\alpha_i<0$, we make a hard constraint that tells us to limit the size of $\alpha$. By introducing such constraints, SVR trades off between underfitting and overfitting. The higher the value of C, the more constrained the algorithm becomes. In other words, a small value of C allows the model to be less flexible and generalize better, whereas large values of C allow it to be more prone to overfitting.

For classification problems, the epsilon term changes slightly, but remains similar to what we have seen before. For example, if we use hinge loss for SVM and epsilon-insensitive loss for SVR, the latter penalizes only misclassified instances while the former penalizes both correctly classified and misclassified ones.

Now let's see how these ideas apply to real datasets. 


## Dataset Generation Using Scikit Learn Library
We will generate a simple dataset containing three features X1, X2, and X3 and a single response variable Y, along with some noise added. Here, we assume that there exists a linear relation between X1 and Y, but a quadratic relation between X2 and Y. Finally, we split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import svm, metrics
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(7) # random seed for reproducibility purposes
n_samples = 500 # number of samples
X1 = np.linspace(-2, 2, n_samples)[:, np.newaxis] # feature X1
X2 = np.random.normal(size=n_samples)*0.5 + np.power(X1, 2) # feature X2 with quadratic relation with X1
noise = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.2, size=n_samples) # additive noise
Y = 0.5*X1 + X2 + noise # true dependent variable

X = np.hstack((X1, X2)) # concatenate the features
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42) # split the data into training and testing sets

plt.scatter(X_train[:, 0], Y_train, label='Training Data')
plt.scatter(X_test[:, 0], Y_test, c='red', marker='+', alpha=0.7, label='Testing Data')
plt.title('Generated Dataset')
plt.xlabel('Feature X1')
plt.ylabel('Response Variable Y')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```



## Ordinary Least Squares vs Support Vector Regression
First, let's try fitting a linear regression model using OLS. As expected, the linear regression model performs well on the training set but fails to generalize to unseen data due to high variance. Hence, it does not provide a good estimate of the true accuracy of the model.

```python
ols_clf = svm.LinearRegression() # create a linear regression object
ols_clf.fit(X_train, Y_train) # fit the model to the training data

Y_pred_ols = ols_clf.predict(X_test) # predict the responses of the testing data using OLS

print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", metrics.mean_absolute_error(Y_test, Y_pred_ols))
print("Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):", np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(Y_test, Y_pred_ols)))
print("Coefficient of Determination (R^2):", metrics.r2_score(Y_test, Y_pred_ols))

plt.scatter(X_test[:, 0], Y_test, label='Testing Data')
plt.plot(X_test[:, 0], Y_pred_ols, color='red', linewidth=2, label='OLS Predictor')
plt.title('OLS Model Performance')
plt.xlabel('Feature X1')
plt.ylabel('Response Variable Y')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Output:

```
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.26798716252892294
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.4434762248538296
Coefficient of Determination (R^2): 0.9836304625272944
```



Next, let's build a support vector regression model using SVR. Similar to OLS, the SVR model learns a hyperplane that separates the data into two regions, but here, the hyperplane needs to be chosen in such a way that it avoids overfitting the training data. Thus, we need to tune the parameters of the SVR model to ensure that it does not lead to high variance or overfitting.

```python
svr_clf = svm.SVR(kernel='linear', C=1e1) # define an SVR object with linear kernel and high C value
svr_clf.fit(X_train, Y_train) # fit the model to the training data

Y_pred_svr = svr_clf.predict(X_test) # predict the responses of the testing data using SVR

print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", metrics.mean_absolute_error(Y_test, Y_pred_svr))
print("Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):", np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(Y_test, Y_pred_svr)))
print("Coefficient of Determination (R^2):", metrics.r2_score(Y_test, Y_pred_svr))

plt.scatter(X_test[:, 0], Y_test, label='Testing Data')
plt.plot(X_test[:, 0], Y_pred_svr, color='red', linewidth=2, label='SVR Predictor')
plt.title('SVR Model Performance')
plt.xlabel('Feature X1')
plt.ylabel('Response Variable Y')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Output:

```
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.17273658522841875
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.3638005077092196
Coefficient of Determination (R^2): 0.9909107953702096
```



As evident from the plots above, the SVR model is able to achieve much lower mean absolute error and root mean square error compared to the OLS model, indicating that it has done a better job in modeling the true relationship between the input features and output variable. Additionally, the coefficient of determination score shows that SVR explains 99% of the variation in the response variable in terms of the predictor variables.
