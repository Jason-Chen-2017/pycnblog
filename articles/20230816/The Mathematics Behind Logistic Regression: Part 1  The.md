Logistic regression, also known as logistic model or logit regression is a type of linear regression used to predict the probability of an event occurring based on one or more predictor (input) variables. In this article, we will go through the basic mathematical background and core algorithm behind logistic regression by studying the sigmoid function. We will start with a brief overview of binary classification problems before diving into the details of sigmoid functions. 

# 2.Binary Classification Problems
## What is Binary Classification? 
Binary classification refers to the problem of classifying data points into two groups according to their features. This could be useful in many real-world applications such as spam filtering, fraud detection, disease diagnosis, etc.

Let's say we have a dataset consisting of medical records that contains information about patients' symptoms including whether they have cancer or not. We want to develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies patients who are likely to have cancer from those who don't. To solve this problem, we would first need to understand how we can classify data points into two categories. 

In binary classification, there are only two possible outcomes for each data point. For example, if we're trying to distinguish between people who like movies and dislike them, then our outcome variable could be either "Likes" or "Dislikes". If instead, we're trying to identify whether an image contains a cat or a dog, then our outcome variable might be "Contains Cat" or "Contains Dog".

Each category can be represented by its own set of unique attributes (such as age, gender, location, etc.). These attributes together make up our input variables. In the case of medical records, our input variables might include things like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, history of diseases, family history, etc. 

To create a binary classifier, we simply train it using a labeled dataset containing examples of both classes. Once trained, the classifier can take new unlabeled data as inputs and output a predicted probability indicating which class the data belongs to. 

## Probability Estimation
Before moving forward, let's review some important terms related to probability estimation and conditional probability. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables, where $X$ represents our independent variable(s), while $Y$ represents our dependent variable. $P(X)$ denotes the probability distribution of $X$, while $P(X \mid Y=y_i)$ denotes the conditional probability distribution of $X$ given $Y=y_i$. 

We often use the notation $\mathbb{E}[X]$ to represent the expected value of $X$, which measures the average value of $X$ over all possible values of the random variable $X$. Similarly, $\mathrm{Var}(X)$ represents the variance of $X$, measuring the degree of variation of $X$ around its mean. 

Given a binary classification problem, we assume that $X$ takes on one of two values, which we call "positive" and "negative", corresponding to our positive and negative classes. Thus, $Y\in \{+1,-1\}$. The goal is to estimate the probability of the positive class ($Y=+1$) given some observed feature vector $x$. This is usually written as follows:

$$p(y=+1|x)=\frac{\text{exp}(f^T x)} {1 + \text{exp}(f^T x)},$$
where $f$ is a parameter vector representing our estimated coefficients for the input variables. 

This formula represents the likelihood function for observing $x$ and assuming that $Y=+1$. It calculates the ratio of the exponential of the dot product of $f$ and $x$ to $(1+\text{exp}(f^T x))$, since multiplying small numbers can lead to overflow errors when computing $\text{exp}(f^T x)$. Since we are interested in estimating the probability of $Y=+1$, we can ignore the denominator term and focus on the numerator:

$$p(y=+1|x)=\sigma(f^T x),$$
where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid function defined later in the article. 

This formula gives us a way to convert any score into a probability using the sigmoid function. Intuitively, the sigmoid function maps scores to probabilities by squashing them onto a common scale. Scores near zero correspond to low probabilities (equivalent to a very confident decision), whereas scores closer to infinity give higher probabilities (equivalent to a very uncertain decision). Note that the output of the sigmoid function lies within the range [0,1], making it a valid probability measure. Finally, note that this formula assumes that the score $f^T x$ is well-calibrated (i.e., approximately reflects the true probability of the positive class). There may still be some uncertainty in the estimated probability due to factors such as noise in the training process or imperfect predictions made by the classifier.
