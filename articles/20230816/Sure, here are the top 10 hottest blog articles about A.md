Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a popular topic of interest in manufacturing industry for many years now. With the advent of automation and robotics technologies, new challenges have emerged that require more powerful machines to perform complex tasks faster. However, it is important to note that Artificial Intelligence (AI) does not replace human beings completely; rather, it serves as an assistant or a support system that makes a process or task easier while enhancing human capabilities.

With this article, we will explore some of the key concepts, algorithms, techniques, and applications of AI in manufacturing. We hope that by sharing our understanding with you, you can start taking advantage of this technology and create better products and services. Let’s dive into the world of AI in manufacturing!

# 2.Key Concepts and Terminology
## Understanding Cognition and Computation
Before diving into technical details, let us understand what exactly is cognition and computation? 

Cognition refers to the ability to perceive, analyze, interpret, synthesize, abstract, and remember information and ideas. It involves breaking down a problem into smaller parts, recognizing patterns, and then solving them. The goal of cognition is to make sense of the world around us and transform it into useful knowledge and intelligence.

Computation on the other hand, is the activity of translating input data into output results using mathematical formulas. It involves applying math logic and rules to problems to arrive at a solution. The goal of computation is to solve problems efficiently and accurately so that they can help us achieve our goals.

Therefore, both cognition and computation play vital roles in AI development, especially when it comes to machine learning. Machine Learning uses statistical analysis to develop models based on training datasets which enable computers to learn from existing data and extract insights, patterns, and relationships within it. This allows computers to predict outcomes based on new inputs, making them very helpful in decision-making processes.

The following diagram summarizes these two components of AI:


## Types of AI Techniques
Now that we know what cognition and computation mean, let's talk about various types of AI techniques available in manufacturing. These include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Each type of technique targets different issues related to solving problems through artificial intelligence.

### Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is where the algorithm learns from labeled data. This means that the computer knows the correct output for each input provided. In essence, the algorithm teaches itself how to recognize patterns in data by feeding examples of correct outputs paired with input data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new, similar cases based on their features. For example, if the model was trained to distinguish between cats and dogs, it could be used to identify new animals found in nature. Supervised learning is widely used in pattern recognition, image classification, sentiment analysis, and forecasting problems.

Here's an illustration of how supervised learning works:


In the above scenario, there are three categories of animals: dogs, cats, and birds. The green dots represent labeled input data, while the red dots represent labeled output data. The black line represents the classifier function learned by the algorithm. As long as the points fall below the black line, the algorithm would classify them correctly. If the points fall above the line, however, it would consider them incorrect and adjust its weights accordingly to improve its accuracy. By repeating this cycle over and over again, the algorithm gradually becomes proficient at recognizing patterns in data without being explicitly taught how to do so.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning is where the algorithm finds patterns in data without any prior labels. Rather than relying on pre-existing labels, the algorithm discovers clusters of similar elements in the dataset. This can help organizations organize data into meaningful groups such as customers, products, transactions, and assets. Unsupervised learning methods also allow companies to detect anomalies and outliers in large datasets. Here's an illustration of how unsupervised learning works:


In the above scenario, we have a dataset containing multiple instances of customers' purchasing behavior. Without knowing anything about the underlying structure of the data, we use clustering algorithms like K-Means to group customers together based on their purchase history. Using this grouping, we can segment customers into distinct marketing campaigns, target specific stores, and design targeted offers. Another application of unsupervised learning is anomaly detection, where the algorithm identifies abnormal behaviors that don't conform to expected patterns. Anomaly detectors can be used to detect fraudulent activities, security incidents, and breaches.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is another type of AI technique used in manufacturing. Reinforcement Learning involves an agent interacting with an environment to learn how to optimally take actions in order to maximize rewards. The agent receives feedback in the form of positive or negative reward signals and must learn to select actions that result in high cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is commonly applied to environments ranging from games to factory automation systems. Here's an illustration of how reinforcement learning works:


In the above scenario, we have an agent who needs to find a way to get a certain objective. The agent interacts with the environment by selecting actions that increase its total reward, which might involve navigating through mazes or completing assembly lines. Over time, the agent learns to choose actions that lead to higher cumulative rewards and eventually solves the problem altogether. Reinforcement learning enables autonomous systems to adapt to changing conditions, improving performance over time.

### Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a relatively new approach to AI that combines several neural networks layers to create increasingly sophisticated models. Neural Networks are connected units that receive input, process it through various functions, and produce output. Similar to biological neurons, these units are organized into layers, allowing complex representations of data to be learned and modeled. They work by analyzing patterns in data, extracting valuable features, and using those features to make predictions or classifications.

Deep Learning models are often developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). These models combine multiple layers of processing nodes designed to extract complex features from input data. CNNs typically consist of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the data before passing it to fully connected layers. LSTMs add memory cells to retain contextual information across previous steps in the sequence, enabling LSTM networks to handle sequential data better than traditional RNNs. RNNs utilize feedback loops to propagate error back through the network and update parameters to minimize loss during training.

By combining these techniques, deep learning can provide accurate predictions and decisions based on vast amounts of data and capable processors. In manufacturing, deep learning has the potential to revolutionize entire industries, from retail to transportation to healthcare. However, proper implementation requires significant expertise and resources, including extensive programming skills and large quantities of data. Therefore, one thing that should always remain constant is customer empathy and awareness.
