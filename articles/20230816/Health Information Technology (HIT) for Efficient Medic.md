Healthcare industry is one of the most complex industries in the world today due to the enormous amount of data being generated by patients every day. The medical record management has been a major challenge for health care organizations with limited resources and increasingly demanding customer expectations. To meet this requirement efficiently, HIT can play an essential role in improving patient access, better utilization of resources, and improving overall quality of care delivery. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview on HIT technologies for efficient medical record management and access control. 

The objective of this article is to provide a complete understanding of how health information technology (HIT) can be used effectively for efficient management and access control of medical records across various stages in the clinical workflow. We will first explore what are some core concepts, terms, and functionalities that should be considered while designing HIT based solutions for managing and controlling medical records. Next, we will present brief theoretical knowledge about different machine learning algorithms and their techniques for predictive modeling of medical outcomes, which can help improve accuracy and efficiency of medical decision making. Finally, we will demonstrate practical examples of using HIT-based solutions for efficient medical record management and access control through real-world scenarios such as intelligent virtual personal assistants, automated electronic health record systems, or mobile health applications. In conclusion, this survey paper provides a comprehensive framework for exploring HIT technologies, with its focus on effective medical record management and access control capabilities in the healthcare ecosystem. It also highlights important research opportunities for further development in the field of HIT in the near future.

In order to manage and control the medical records efficiently and accurately, several key factors need to be addressed, including:

1. Data security: To protect sensitive health information from unauthorized access, the organization must establish appropriate security measures like encryption, access control lists, and authentication mechanisms.

2. Medical history audit: Many hospitals face challenges when it comes to verifying if the patient's medical history is up-to-date and accurate. Traditional manual processes take time, cost, and expertise. The use of HIT technologies would significantly reduce these costs and make it easier for doctors to review and update patient histories. 

3. Patient safety: With increased prevalence of emerging infectious diseases and other serious health conditions, patient safety becomes more critical than ever. The introduction of HIT technologies like voice biometrics, facial recognition, etc., can provide real-time monitoring and risk assessment of individuals entering the hospital. 

4. Improve patient adherence: Even though patient adherence plays a crucial role in maintaining good healthcare outcomes, not all patients have the ability to follow instructions on their medical records correctly. As a result, they may become frustrated, hesitant, or even dissatisfied with the outcome. Therefore, HIT technologies could enable providers to automate verification of patient compliance via text messaging and telemedicine sessions between physicians and patients, thereby improving the satisfaction level of both parties. 

5. Enable decision support tools: Increasing numbers of patients and nurses increase the complexity of tasks performed during care at any given time. The introduction of intelligent virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana, Alexa, etc., can ease the burden of providing clinical guidance to these individuals. These platforms can analyze patient symptoms, assess lifestyle changes, recommend medications, or suggest alternative treatments based on past medical history, current condition, and physical exam findings. 

6. Better patient engagement: When it comes to interacting with patients on a daily basis, traditional methods like phone calls or emails can quickly become tedious and inefficient. By implementing interactive and multimedia communication channels, patient interactions can be made much more efficient. For example, with the use of chatbots, virtual assistants, and social media integration, patients can easily receive updates about upcoming appointments, notifications, procedures, reminders, etc., all without waiting in line. 

In summary, HIT technologies can help improve the overall healthcare experience by enabling organisations to manage and control medical records more efficiently and accurately. They can also promote patient safety by integrating advancement biometric technologies and provide additional value-added features like interactive and multimedia communications channel, improved patient engagement, and decision support tools. Overall, the evolution of the healthcare industry over the last decade has driven the emergence of new technologies like digital health, cloud computing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and augmented/virtual reality, which require new approaches towards solving problems related to medical record management and access control.
