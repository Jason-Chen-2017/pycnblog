Transformer-based language models (T-BERTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, machine translation, question answering, sentiment analysis etc. In this article, we will discuss about the position encoding technique used in T-BERT and its significance for improving model's learning ability. We also briefly explain token embeddings introduced by BERT architecture and how they help to improve downstream task performance. Additionally, we discuss why it is crucial to fine-tune pre-trained transformer based language models for specific tasks and what are some ways to effectively fine-tune them towards different tasks without any significant loss of accuracy or performance. Finally, we explore a few other techniques that can be applied to further enhance the performance of transformer-based language models. These include leveraging powerful data augmentation techniques like mixup and cutmix, using external knowledge sources like ELMo, adding positional encodings to character sequences, replacing attention heads with SRU units, applying label smoothing regularization and implementing a self-supervised training approach similar to SimCLR.

The popular transformer-based language models such as BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLNet all use encoder-decoder architectures where an input sequence is processed through multiple layers of transformers which produce a fixed dimensional representation called context vector. The context vectors capture the overall meaning of the sentence and can be fed into subsequent layers to generate predictions. In addition to these core components, there are several techniques being explored to incorporate additional information beyond just the raw tokens into the learned representations. Some examples of these techniques are:

1. **Positional Encoding:** This involves adding sine and cosine functions to the embedding dimension of each word/token. These functions encode the relative or absolute positions of the words in the sequence and thus provide more contextual information for the model to understand the relationships between words within a sentence.

2. **Token Type Embeddings:** This consists of separate embeddings for sentences, paragraphs and documents. Each type of document gets assigned a unique embedding while the same word may have slightly different meanings depending on their role within the corresponding sentence/paragraph/document. 

3. **Subword Embeddings:** This allows us to represent individual words as combinations of subwords. For example, "university" can be represented as ["uni", "versity"] and get assigned a separate embedding from the original word. 

These techniques make up the foundation of modern transformer-based language models and play important roles in achieving state-of-the-art results across many natural language processing tasks. However, none of these techniques alone can fully capture the complexities and nuances involved in understanding sentences, especially when dealing with long sequences. As a result, research has been focused on designing new techniques and methods that combine both traditional linguistic cues and deep neural network features for improved performance.

In this paper, we focus on two main topics related to T-BERT - position encoding and token embeddings. Specifically, we aim to analyze the importance of position encoding and show how it can significantly impact the performance of T-BERT. Moreover, we will discuss the effectiveness of token embeddings provided by BERT architecture and propose improvements to its usage. Lastly, we present recent works that employ various tricks and approaches to effectively fine-tune T-BERT for a variety of natural language processing tasks. Overall, our goal is to summarize key ideas, insights, and challenges from the latest advances in T-BERT literature so that readers can quickly grasp the full picture of how the model works under the hood and identify potential future directions.

We start with background introduction and define terms used in the article. Then, we introduce the basic concept of T-BERT and highlight its strengths over conventional sequence-to-sequence models such as LSTMs and GRUs. Next, we describe the motivation behind using position encoding in the first place and compare its performance against other techniques including learned embeddings. Afterwards, we elaborate on how token embeddings work in BERT and demonstrate their effectiveness by showing improvement in F1 score on a benchmark dataset. Finally, we conclude with discussions on why it is essential to fine-tune pre-trained transformer-based language models for specific tasks and explore a few techniques that can further enhance their performance.
