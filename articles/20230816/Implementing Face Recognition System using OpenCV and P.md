# 1.简介
  

Face recognition is the process of identifying a person based on their facial features like eyes, nose, mouth etc. The technology has been widely used in various fields such as security systems, biometric authentication, mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and image processing applications for self-driving cars. 

In this article, we will be implementing face recognition system using OpenCV and Python. We will go through all the steps required to implement it from scratch. So let's dive into the topic!

# 2.基本概念与术语
Before going deep into technical details, we need to understand some basic concepts of computer vision and machine learning. Let's start with these terms:

1. Computer Vision: It refers to the field of artificial intelligence that involves developing algorithms that can analyze, interpret, and manipulate digital images or videos.

2. Machine Learning: It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which consists of techniques that allow computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This technique uses statistical algorithms that enable machines to learn by analyzing large amounts of data and patterns in data sets.

3. Image Data: Images are represented as matrices where each pixel represents an intensity value. Each color channel represents specific characteristics of the object present in the picture. Examples of common image formats include JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF. 

4. Feature Extraction: It is a method of extracting representative features from an image dataset so that they can be used for classification tasks. In general, feature extraction methods involve selecting certain regions of interest in the image and computing statistics about those areas to extract meaningful information. For example, SIFT algorithm is used to detect keypoints and calculate their corresponding descriptors to match different objects in the image.

5. Eigenfaces Algorithm: A type of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), eigenfaces algorithm is used to perform face recognition. It consists of two main steps:
     - Training Phase: During training phase, a set of faces is used to compute eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of face vectors. These eigenvectors form a basis for the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors, which captures most of the variance between faces. 
     - Testing Phase: After training, testing images are transformed into the subspace formed by the trained eigenvectors to obtain a set of low dimensional representations of the input images. The distance between any pair of test images' representations is calculated using a similarity metric like Euclidean Distance or Cosine Similarity. 
     
6. Descriptors: Descriptors are computed based on local features of the image, which describe the shape, appearance, and orientation of an object in the image. Common descriptor types include SIFT, ORB, BRIEF, HOG, LBP, etc. Each descriptor vector corresponds to one landmark point on the object. 
         
# 3.核心算法原理与操作步骤
We now have a clear understanding of the necessary background concepts and terminology. Now let's talk about how we can use them to develop our own face recognition system using OpenCV and Python. 

## 3.1 Installing Required Packages and Libraries
The first step is to install the required packages and libraries. Here's what you should do:

1. Install Anaconda distribution. You can download it from here https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Select your operating system and choose the appropriate installation file. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

2. Create a new environment for OpenCV and its dependencies. Open the terminal (Windows) or command prompt (MacOS/Linux) and enter the following commands:

   ```
   conda create --name opencv_env python=3.7 numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn pillow imutils opencv tensorflow keras seaborn 
   activate opencv_env # Windows: source activate opencv_env; MacOS/Linux: conda activate opencv_env
   
   pip install opencv-contrib-python
   ```

These commands will create a new environment called "opencv_env" and install the latest versions of the required packages. Note that if you already have other environments installed, you might want to create a separate environment for OpenCV.

Now that we have everything set up, let's move on to the next step. 

## 3.2 Dataset Preparation
For practical purposes, we would require a well-annotated dataset of human faces. If you don't have one, I suggest downloading and using a pre-existing database like LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild). There are many websites available that provide access to datasets, including http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/, http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/, http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php, and others.

Once you have acquired a suitable dataset, make sure to split it into three parts - training, validation, and testing. Typically, 70% of the samples are used for training, while 15% are used for validation, and remaining 15% are reserved for testing.  

Next, prepare the annotations file containing the labels for each sample. The format of the annotation file must be compatible with the supported dataset structure used by the face detector. For example, for LFW dataset, the annotation files typically contain five columns - namely, filename, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, height. The coordinates represent the bounding box around the face region. Other datasets may have slightly different formats. Make sure to read the documentation carefully before proceeding further.

Finally, preprocess the dataset to ensure that it contains only grayscale images. Convert RGB images to grayscale using cvtColor() function provided by OpenCV library. Also, normalize the pixel values of each image to lie within the range [0, 1] using a min-max normalization.

At this stage, you should have prepared your annotated dataset consisting of grayscale images ready for training and testing.

## 3.3 Building the Model Architecture
Let's build the model architecture using Keras API of TensorFlow. First, import the necessary modules:


```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
```

Then, define the parameters of the network architecture:

```
num_classes = len(class_names)    # number of classes in the dataset
input_shape = (img_height, img_width, 1)   # input size of each sample  
batch_size = 32     # batch size for mini-batch gradient descent optimization
epochs = 10        # maximum number of epochs to train the model

model = Sequential([
  layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
  layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),

  layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
  
  layers.Flatten(),
  layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu'),
  layers.Dropout(rate=0.5),
  layers.Dense(units=num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
```

This defines a simple convolutional neural network architecture with four layers of conv2d and max pooling followed by flattening and fully connected dense layers. Dropout layer is added for regularization purpose. Finally, softmax output layer gives probabilities for each class label.

## 3.4 Compiling the Model
Before starting the training procedure, compile the model using categorical crossentropy loss function and Adam optimizer. Set the metrics parameter to accuracy. 

```
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## 3.5 Training the Model
To train the model, pass the training data (X_train) and corresponding target labels (y_train) to fit() function. Specify the number of batches per epoch using the'steps_per_epoch' argument. Additionally, specify the number of epochs to train the model using the 'epochs' argument. 

```
history = model.fit(x=X_train,
                    y=y_train,
                    batch_size=batch_size,
                    epochs=epochs,
                    verbose=1,
                    validation_split=0.1,      # Split the training data into training and validation splits
                    shuffle=True)              # Shuffle the training data before each epoch

```

During training, monitor the performance of the model using the evaluation metrics specified during compilation (in this case, accuracy). Save the best performing weights after each epoch using the save_weights() function of the model object.

## 3.6 Evaluating the Model
After training the model, evaluate its performance using the test dataset X_test and y_test. Use the evaluate() function of the model object to get the overall performance measures. Print the results for both training and validation datasets separately. 

```
score = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)

print('Test Loss:', score[0])
print('Test Accuracy:', score[1])
```

## 3.7 Prediction
Finally, predict the class label of new unseen samples using the predict() function of the model object. Pass the preprocessed test samples as input. Print the predicted class label along with the probability scores obtained by the model.

```
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predicted_labels = np.argmax(predictions, axis=-1)

for i in range(len(predicted_labels)):
    print("Image", str(i+1))
    print("Label:", class_names[predicted_labels[i]])
    print("Probability:", predictions[i][predicted_labels[i]])
    plt.imshow(X_test[i].reshape((img_height, img_width)))
    plt.show()
```

Here, we loop over the test dataset and call the predict() function of the model for each sample. Then, convert the predicted probabilities into class labels using argmax() function of NumPy module. Finally, plot the original image along with the predicted label and confidence score using Matplotlib library.
