# 1.简介
  

August 25th is a big day for the launch of Apple's new iPad Pro, iPhone XS Max, the release of Valve's Steam Link streaming service, the Apple Watch Series 3 being unveiled and more! All of these events will further popularize augmented reality (AR) technology in museums and provide exciting opportunities for developers and designers alike. 

In this article, I'll explore how to build an AR museum experience using Unity and Vuforia SDKs in order to give users a unique way to interact with exhibits at their museum without having to touch or interact physically with any technology beyond their smartphones. 

By the end of this tutorial, you should have built your own customizable AR museum app that includes features such as:

1. Placing virtual objects within real-world environments
2. Enabling object tracking based on markers placed within the environment
3. Adding interactivity such as button clicks, swipe gestures, and voice commands
4. Combining both visual and audio effects to create immersive user experiences
5. Allowing users to record their visit through camera functionality

Before we dive into building our project, let's first go over some basic concepts and terms used when developing with AR/VR technologies.

# 2. Concepts and Terms
## Augmented Reality
Augmented reality (AR) refers to a combination of digital information presented alongside the physical world around it. This can include images, videos, text, music, sounds, or other sensory stimuli. The goal of AR is to enhance the perceptions and interactions between humans and machines. By adding additional information, systems can present more than just the shape of an object but also its contextual meaning and properties. For instance, a marker could be added onto a sculpture to indicate what kind of material was used during creation. Similarly, speech recognition software could enable visitors to perform actions directly in the virtual space rather than navigating through static menus. Additionally, AR devices like Google Cardboard offer immersive views of the surroundings from afar. These devices allow people to see the same viewpoint from different angles and feel connected to the surrounding environment.

## Virtual Reality
Virtual reality (VR) is a type of computer graphics simulation created using hardware technology. In contrast to traditional 3D models, VR simulates the presence and movement of real-world objects inside a simulated environment. It allows users to explore unknown or unfamiliar spaces, complete tasks faster, and harness the creative potential of modern technologies. VR gadgets typically use head-mounted displays (HMDs), which are devices that attach to the user's eyes and act as monitors, much like regular televisions do today. A wide range of applications has been developed for virtual reality, including entertainment, training, healthcare, industrial automation, and manufacturing.

## Marker Tracking
Marker tracking is the process of determining where a specific marker has been placed within a scene. This enables the system to place virtual objects anywhere within the real-world environment. Marker tracking algorithms work by analyzing a video feed or picture taken by the device, detecting the markers' positions relative to each other, and then mapping them back to their original position in the real-world. There are many different types of markers available, including fiducials, QR codes, printed tags, and holograms.

## Anchor Points
Anchor points are special points in the real-world environment that track markers. When a marker is tracked against an anchor point, it becomes fixed to that location even if it moves later. Anchor points can be set manually or automatically depending on the requirements of the application. They help to ensure accurate placement of virtual objects within the environment.

## Vuforia
Vuforia is a leading provider of software development kits (SDKs) for augmented reality and virtual reality applications. Vuforia offers several tools and services, including image recognition, cloud-based databases, face detection, object identification, and geolocation. Developers can integrate Vuforia APIs into their mobile apps or websites to add interactive and engaging AR content to their existing projects. Vuforia currently has offices in San Francisco and Seattle, and is headquartered in Mountain View.
