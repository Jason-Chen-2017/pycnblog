Goodyear Energy Solutions (GES) is one of the largest providers of energy management software solutions in the world, offering a range of services including smart grid automation, energy efficiency optimization, demand response, and solar panel management. In this article, we will explore how GES’s energy management platform, named Goodyear EcoSense, uses an Internet-of-Things (IoT) approach to transform communities by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving overall energy efficiency in every home, building, and business. We will also discuss its impact on social health outcomes such as mortality rates, air pollution levels, and climate change mitigation efforts. Finally, we will highlight some lessons learned from using IoT for community regeneration through energy efficiency improvements and environmental sustainability.

In April 2019, GES announced that it had launched the Goodyear EcoSense Smart Grid Automation Platform, which provides industry-leading smart grid operations capabilities with advanced analytics, real-time monitoring, and automated control for over 100 customers across various industries and geographies. The platform includes three key components:

1. Demand Response
2. Distributed Energy Resources Optimization
3. Solar Panel Management

The goal of these components is to enable communities to seamlessly transition from fossil fuel powered homes/buildings to more efficient alternatives such as PV panels or batteries. However, many homeowners are worried about their carbon footprint and concern about energy waste. To address these concerns, GES developed two main strategies:

1. Addressing Greenhouse Gas Emissions through Carbon Offsetting
2. Reducing Energy Waste through Energy Efficiency Improvements 

However, relying solely on green energy technologies alone does not guarantee better results. In fact, it has been shown that electricity usage can have significant indirect effects on other areas such as air quality, climate change, mental health, and sleep quality. Therefore, GES is investing in additional energy storage options such as hydrogen or battery technology, which have the potential to provide greater power flexibility and reliability while reducing cost. Overall, Goodyear’s strategy is to leverage IoT technologies to create long-term value for all stakeholders involved in the energy management process – from consumers to utilities to governments.

Before diving deeper into specific concepts and terms, let's first go over some general definitions and terminologies used throughout the article:

**Smart Grid:** A system consisting of multiple electrically connected devices, programs, and networks where individual devices exchange information and controls among themselves to achieve certain objectives, typically to maintain consistent electrical conditions within a predefined tolerance level. It enables systems like water heaters, heating pumps, and appliances to work together optimally and responsively to reduce energy consumption and improve life satisfaction. Examples of smart grids include those associated with utility companies, retail businesses, and offices.

**Energy Consumption:** The amount of electricity consumed over a period of time by an entity, whether household appliance, business, or building, measured in kilowatt hours (kWh). 

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** An industrial process that emits large quantities of gases when burned or converted during combustion processes involving carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and other pollutants. These gases can cause numerous harmful effects on human health, the environment, and the natural economy. 

**Carbon Offset:** A type of financial investment in the form of credits that can be made to offset the direct emissions of CO₂ caused by generating energy such as oil, coal, gasoline, and renewables. This method involves buying offsets from organizations who purchase credits equivalent to the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by a generation project and sell them back at a discount to compensate for any damage they might incur due to decreased production capacity. 

**Renewable Energy Sources:** Natural resources that do not require human energy input, such as wind, solar, geothermal, waves, tidal, or hydropower. Renewable energy sources offer several advantages, such as reduced costs, low-carbon emmisions, and zero-emission technologies, making them ideal for future energy use scenarios.

Now that we have covered basic concepts and terminologies related to GES' ecoSense platform, we can proceed to explain how it achieves its goals by leveraging IoT technologies. 

## 3.1 Demand Response 
Demand response refers to the act of responding to fluctuations in customer demand for electricity by quickly adjusting output to meet increasing needs. It helps ensure that excessive energy usage doesn't occur without causing inconvenience or affecting the customer experience. 

To implement demand response, GES uses algorithms based on historical data and statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends in usage and predict future behavior. The algorithm then identifies underutilized energy sources such as old non-grid electric appliances or unused loads in the local area network (LAN) and shuts down the most wasteful ones until the load is reduced below a specified threshold.

For example, if there are seven appliances in the LAN but only five are currently being used, GES may shut down four of the six remaining appliances until the total number of active appliances falls below six. By doing so, GES reduces energy consumption and ensures that each appliance receives the appropriate amount of electricity.  

## 3.2 Distributed Energy Resources Optimization
Distributed energy resources (DER) refer to electrical equipment that consumes electricity directly from a source rather than transferring it through distribution points. Examples of DERs include photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, batteries, and thermal energy systems such as heat exchangers.

One challenge for DERs is that they usually come equipped with fixed characteristics such as maximum capacity, rating, and lifetime, making it difficult to optimize their operation to adapt to changing markets and demand. For instance, solar panels often produce higher amounts of electricity than they can supply, leading to high peak electricity prices. Moreover, small installations can lead to unstable and intermittent performance, which can make it challenging to deliver reliable power.

To address these issues, GES offers distributed energy resource management tools that allow users to dynamically modify the operating parameters of DERs based on current market conditions and demand. One such tool is called PowerGenie, which monitors daily electricity consumption and automatically adjusts the operational parameters of installed DERs to ensure that they always operate within limits set by the user. 

PowerGenie works by analyzing past usage data, calculating the average daily output rate of each DER, identifying outliers that exceed a specified deviation threshold, and scaling up or down the corresponding DER accordingly to correct the imbalance. By using the latest weather reports and forecasts, PowerGenie can also optimize the placement of DERs to maximize the profitability of the system. 

Overall, GES’s plan for addressing energy waste through DER management relies heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that analyze historical data, learn from experience, and adapt to constantly evolving market conditions. With machine learning models trained on massive datasets, PowerGenie can accurately predict and manage the optimal functioning of DERs to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, energy waste, and negative impacts on climate change.  

## 3.3 Solar Panel Management
Solar panel management refers to the planning, installation, maintenance, and operation of solar energy systems, especially those located in buildings or farms. GES employs a hybrid solar energy management system that combines cloud-based scheduling and self-consumption approaches to provide customized recommendations to optimize solar panel deployment and yield.

Cloud-based scheduling allows GES to automate the provisioning of solar energy to avoid idle periods when no one is using the power generated. Self-consumption permits GES to save money on the purchase of expensive solar panels by letting customers choose when they want to use it and turn it off whenever they need to. 

By aggregating data from multiple sensors, GES can understand the patterns and behaviors of different groups of residents and tailor recommendations to optimize the layout, size, and location of installed solar panels. Based on historical data and forecasts, GES can even detect sudden changes in demand and react immediately, ensuring that solar panels are properly positioned to generate electricity when needed and conserve power when not required.  

Overall, GES aims to deliver smarter, more personalized solutions that combine renewable energy sources with modern technologies to transform communities into greener, more affordable and energy-efficient places. By leveraging IoT technologies along with AI algorithms, GES’ solution improves energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and social health outcomes through increased comfort, energy security, and improved well-being.
