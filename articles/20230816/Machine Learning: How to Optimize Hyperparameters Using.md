# 1.简介
  

In the past decade, machine learning has experienced a revolutionary development driven by the advent of powerful computational hardware and algorithmic advancements. Despite this explosion, many practitioners still struggle with optimizing hyperparameters such as those that control model complexity or regularization strength. In fact, selecting the best values for these parameters is often time-consuming and error-prone even for experts who are familiar with the subject matter.

This article will cover how to optimize hyperparameters using grid search in Python. We will start by defining what hyperparameters are and why they need optimization. Then we'll discuss how grid search works and provide code examples for implementing it on different datasets. Finally, we'll summarize the key points covered throughout this article and address some common questions.


# 2.基本概念
## Hyperparameter Optimization
Hyperparameters refer to the adjustable parameters used during training that influence the performance of a machine learning model. They can range from simple thresholds like the threshold value for classification algorithms, to more complex ones like the number of hidden layers in neural networks. The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to find the set of hyperparameters that result in the best performance on a given dataset. For example, when building an image recognition system, you might want to experiment with various values for the learning rate, the batch size, and the number of filters in your convolutional layer(s). All of these factors affect the accuracy of the final model, so finding the optimal combination requires fine-tuning through a process of trial and error. 

In general, there are two types of hyperparameters:
1. Model hyperparameters - These define the architecture of the model itself, including the number and type of layers, activation functions, dropout rates, etc. These parameters must be tuned based on the specific requirements of the task at hand.
2. Training hyperparameters - These determine how the model is trained, such as the learning rate, optimizer, weight initialization strategy, momentum factor, etc. These parameters control the behavior of the gradient descent algorithm, and should also be optimized over a wide range of values to achieve good results.

Generally speaking, model hyperparameters require much deeper understanding of the problem being solved and may require significant GPU resources, while training hyperparameters typically do not require expertise in deep learning but rather domain knowledge. It's worth noting that just because one parameter can be tweaked affects its importance relative to others. As a rule of thumb, most important hyperparameters have a large impact on both precision and efficiency of the model, making them critical components of any machine learning project.

## Grid Search
Grid search is a widely used technique for searching over a discrete space of possible values for hyperparameters. At each iteration of the search, the algorithm evaluates all combinations of hyperparameter values specified by the user, and selects the combination that produces the highest objective function value (e.g., mean validation loss) within a predefined tolerance level. The advantage of grid search lies in its simplicity and ease of use. However, it does come with some limitations. One major issue is that the number of evaluations required grows exponentially with the number of hyperparameters considered, which makes it impractical for high-dimensional spaces where it becomes computationally prohibitive. Another limitation is that local minima can occur, especially if the search space contains non-convex regions.

# 3.核心算法及代码实现
We will implement grid search to optimize hyperparameters on a regression problem using scikit-learn library in python. The following steps outline our approach:

1. Load data and preprocess
2. Define model hyperparameters
3. Define training hyperparameters
4. Build pipeline
5. Perform grid search
6. Evaluate results

Let's get started!

Firstly, let's import necessary libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn.
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, make_scorer
from scipy.stats import uniform
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
Then, we load boston housing prices dataset from scikit-learn library. This dataset includes information about the houses sold between Boston and around the world, such as crime rate, age of house, distance to employment centers, etc. Here's the code snippet to do so:

```python
# loading dataset
boston = load_boston()
X, y = boston['data'], boston['target']
```
Next, we split the dataset into train and test sets using `train_test_split` method from scikit-learn. By default, 75% of samples will be used for training and 25% for testing.

```python
# splitting data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
```
Now, we create a pipeline consisting of preprocessing step (`StandardScaler`) followed by ridge regression model (`Ridge`). Note that we're creating a separate instance of `Pipeline` class for every combination of hyperparameters to avoid caching issues later.

```python
pipe = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                 ('ridge', Ridge())])
```
Here's the list of hyperparameters we wish to tune:

| Parameter      | Description                                  | Range                    | Type     | Default Value           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| alpha          | Regularization strength                      | [0.001, 10]              | float    | 1                       |
| solver         | Algorithm for ridge regression               | ['auto','svd', 'cholesky', 'lsqr','sparse_cg','sag','saga'] | str   | auto                   |
| max_iter       | Maximum iterations                            | [100, 1000]              | int      | None                    |
| tol            | Tolerance for stopping criterion             | [1e-3, 1e-4]             | float    | 1e-3                    |
| normalize      | Whether to normalize input features           | [True, False]            | bool     | True                    |

Note that we've defined the ranges and allowed values for each hyperparameter, along with their respective data types. Each row corresponds to a single hyperparameter. We'll generate all possible combinations of these hyperparameters using `product()` method from itertools module. For example:

```python
from itertools import product
params = {'alpha': np.logspace(-3, 1, 10),
         'solver': ['svd', 'cholesky'],
         'max_iter': [100],
          'tol': np.logspace(-4, -1, 4),
          'normalize': [True]}
          
param_grid = dict(zip(['alpha','solver','max_iter', 'tol', 'normalize'],
                      product(*[v for v in params.values()])))
```
The above code creates a dictionary called `param_grid`, containing all possible combinations of hyperparameters. For each combination, a new instance of `Pipeline` is created and then passed to `RandomizedSearchCV` object for cross-validation evaluation.

Finally, we evaluate the best model obtained after performing grid search using `best_estimator_` attribute of the fitted `RandomizedSearchCV` object. To measure the quality of the predictions, we'll compute the $R^2$ score between true and predicted target values. Let's put everything together:
