Memory-augmented policy optimization (MOP) is a reinforcement learning technique that augments the agent’s memory with previous observations and actions to optimize the agent’s action selection process in a supervised way. The key idea behind MOP is to learn a latent representation of the environment through observation and action sequences stored in the agent’s memory, which can be used as an auxiliary input for the policy function during training to avoid making unnecessary state transitions or producing invalid actions. 

In this article, we will introduce Memory-augmented policy optimization method using actor-critic framework on OpenAI Gym Mujoco environments such as HalfCheetah-v2 and Ant-v2, and compare it against other existing RL algorithms such as A2C and PPO.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Definition
Memory-Augmented Policy Optimization (MOP), also known as Neural Process (NP) algorithm, is a model-free policy gradient approach that uses neural networks to represent functions of high-dimensional inputs. It combines two important ideas from both deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and probabilistic programming languages: experience replay and random sampling. In contrast to DQN and its variants, MOP does not use replay buffer to store and sample experiences. Instead, it learns the implicit probability distribution over states and actions from unstructured data collected by the agent's interactions with the environment.

To achieve efficient exploration under high-dimensional continuous spaces, MOP first trains a neural network encoder $f_{\theta}(s_{t},a_{t})$ to map state-action pairs to feature vectors of fixed size $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$. Then, it randomly samples a subset of episode trajectories $\{\tau=(s_0^k,a_0^k,\dots,s_{T^k}^{k})\}_{k=1}^K$, where each trajectory consists of multiple time steps $(s_t^k,a_t^k)$ generated by executing a uniformly sampled policy in the environment until termination. These sampled trajectories serve as training examples for the encoder. To train the policy function $\pi_\phi(.|x;\theta)$, MOP uses a neural critic function $Q^\pi_{\theta'}(s_t,a_t)$ trained jointly with the actor function, and minimizes the following loss:

$$L(\theta,\phi)=\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim p(\cdot|\theta)}[(Q^{\pi_\phi}(s_t,a_t)-r_t)^2]+\lambda I_{\text{KL}}[q(s_t,a_t)||p(s_t)]+\gamma \int_{x} d x'\log \left[\sum_{y}\exp\{f_{\theta}(x',y)\frac{(y-\mu_\phi(s_t))^2}{\sigma_\phi^2}\right]\mathbb{I}[|x-x'|>\epsilon]$$

where $\mathbb{I}$ denotes indicator function, $\mu_\phi(s_t)$ and $\sigma_\phi^2$ are mean and variance parameters of the target distribution $p(s_t|x)$, respectively, $f_{\theta}$ represents the encoder function, $\tau=(s_0^k,a_0^k,\dots,s_{T^k}^{k})$ represents a trajectory, $\theta$ represents the parameter vector of the policy function, $\phi$ represents the parameter vector of the critic function, $Q^\pi_{\theta'}$ is the Q-function learned jointly with the policy function, $\lambda$ controls the tradeoff between KL divergence term and reconstruction error, $\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter controlling the smoothness constraint on feature space, and $r_t$ is the reward obtained after taking action $a_t$ at state $s_t$.

In summary, MOP constructs a probabilistic model of the world based on interaction with the environment, then uses it to train an agent to select actions optimally given a current state. Unlike traditional methods like DQN, it avoids storing individual experiences and requires only a small amount of training data to achieve good performance.

## 2.2 Key Ideas
### Experience Replay
Experience replay stores previous experience tuples and allows the agent to learn from them without being affected by catastrophic events like falling down or getting stuck in local minima. This improves the stability and generalization of the agent, especially when facing complex tasks with sparse feedback signals. In MOP, instead of storing entire experience tuples, the agent stores only subsets of trajectory segments, called mini batches. Each mini batch contains several similar trajectory segments, allowing the agent to explore different parts of the task space more efficiently than if it were to only interact with one segment. However, mini batches may lead to higher correlation within the dataset compared to full episodes due to the lack of diversity. Therefore, MOP introduces noise to prevent any single trajectory dominating the distribution produced by the model, and applies dropout to the output layer of the encoder to prevent overfitting.

### Random Sampling
Random sampling refers to choosing actions and states according to a probability distribution derived from some prior knowledge or modeling of the environment. In MOP, the agent generates a sequence of actions by executing a uniform random policy, while selecting appropriate states from those observed during execution using their corresponding features produced by the encoder function. By doing so, the agent explores new regions of the state space and compensates for partial observability of the environment. During training, MOP constructs approximate distributions for all state-action pairs, enabling it to leverage insights from past experience to guide future decisions.

### Latent Representation
A latent variable is a source of uncertainty in statistical models. The goal of variational inference is to infer hidden variables (latent factors) that explain the observed data well enough to enable downstream prediction tasks. In MOP, the encoder produces a low-dimensional embedding of the state-action space by projecting input sequences onto a shared basis set, thereby capturing information about the underlying dynamics. This enables the agent to reason about the value of each state and action pair relative to others, thus facilitating better decision-making and improving robustness against unknown perturbations. Additionally, using a generative model for the environment implicitly enforces a regularizing effect that discourages the agent from attempting dangerous actions or entering impossible situations. Overall, MOP provides principled solutions to challenging problems of RL that require explicit reasoning and planning beyond simple lookup tables and black boxes.

## 2.3 Environment Setting and Framework
This section will briefly describe our setup and terminology. We assume that readers have some familiarity with RL concepts such as policies, value functions, and rewards. We will further elaborate upon specific terms and components later.

We will work with OpenAI Gym MuJoCo environments, specifically HalfCheetah-v2 and Ant-v2, but the principles apply equally well to most modern RL benchmarks. HalfCheetah is a musculoskeletal model of a simplified quadruped robot, which must balance forward and backward stances along its front legs, climb up walls, and run around obstacles. Ant, a hierarchical biped robot, must navigate a terrain composed of ravines, forests, and lava fields while avoiding poisonous snakes. Both environments exhibit rich sensory modalities, including RGB images and proprioceptive states such as joint angles and velocities. Our objective is to design an agent that can perform both locomotion and exploration tasks autonomously. Specifically, we aim to develop an agent that can effectively learn to balance and escape from various obstacles while learning skills that transfer across domains.

Our framework uses an actor-critic style architecture consisting of a policy function $\pi_\phi(.|x;\theta)$ that takes in a state $x$ and outputs a probability distribution over actions, and a value function $V_\psi(x;\theta')$ that evaluates the expected return starting from state $x$. The agent learns to maximize the discounted sum of future returns, which captures the agent's long-term interest in achieving maximum cumulative rewards. We use REINFORCE algorithm, a popular variant of policy gradients, to update the policy function parameters $\theta$ based on the agent's observations and actions. Similarly, we use temporal difference (TD) updates to update the value function parameters $\psi$ using the Bellman equation.

During training, we collect a stream of data points generated by the agent interacting with the environment using the current policy. We use standard off-policy techniques such as importance sampling and prioritized experience replay to handle the bias introduced by bootstrapping. We also clip the loss values to prevent numerical instability and normalize advantages using running estimates of mean and variance. Finally, we add a bonus term to encourage exploration by reducing the entropy of the policy distribution.

After successful training, we evaluate the agent's performance on test sets to measure its success rate and fairness. Since both locomotion and exploration tasks involve navigating physical environments, we calculate metrics such as forward progress, collision rates, average energy consumption, etc., which provide crucial feedback for evaluating the agent's performance. We also visualize the agent's behavior in real-time using tools such as video recording and camera inputs, providing valuable insights into how the agent adapts to changing conditions and copes with failures.
