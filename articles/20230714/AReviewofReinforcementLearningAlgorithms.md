Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that involves an agent interacting with an environment to learn how to take actions to maximize their reward in that environment. It has many applications in robotics, gaming, trading, and decision-making problems where it can help agents learn complex behaviors without being explicitly programmed. The RL algorithms have emerged as one of the most popular techniques in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which combines recent advances in artificial intelligence, optimization methods, and deep neural networks. In this article, we will review some common RL algorithms used for continuous control tasks such as car racing or mountain car problem. We will also discuss some key issues involved in designing effective RL systems and potential solutions to them. Finally, we will provide a general roadmap on how to use RL algorithms to solve real-world problems and put these ideas into practice by creating our own DRL models.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before going into the details of various RL algorithms, let’s first understand some basic concepts related to RL and its terminology:

1. Agent: An entity that interacts with the environment using actions to generate rewards. It takes actions in response to observations provided by the environment. Examples include robots, players, traders, drones, and AI assistants.

2. Environment: A world or scenario where the agent operates. It provides feedback through observations and receives input from the agent via actions. The environment consists of states, actions, and rewards. For example, the game board in video games, the simulated world in robotics, and the stock market are all environments where RL can be applied.

3. Action space: The set of possible actions that the agent can take at each time step. Each action can be discrete or continuous depending on whether they represent movements in different directions or adjustable parameters like speed and steering angle. For example, in the mountain car problem, the action space contains three actions: accelerate left, accelerate right, and do nothing.

4. Observation space: The set of observable values in the current state of the environment. The observation may contain information about the position, velocity, orientation, etc., of the agent and other objects present in the environment. For example, if you want to train an agent to play a game, the observation space might contain pixel data representing the screen image, the player’s current position, and the location of surrounding objects.

5. Reward function: The measure of success or failure achieved by the agent after taking an action in the environment. The reward function typically gives negative rewards for invalid actions or high penalties for performance degradation. However, the exact definition depends on the specific task and context.

6. Policy: The behavior of the agent given a particular state. It specifies what action the agent should take based on the observed state of the environment. In simple terms, the policy maps the state of the environment to the probability distribution over actions. When training the agent, the policy is updated iteratively according to the reinforcement learning algorithm.

Now let's look at some common RL algorithms and how they work. These algorithms enable us to teach an agent to solve a variety of challenging tasks in the environment while also ensuring robustness against exploration and exploitation tradeoffs. 

## 3.1 Value-based Methods
Value-based methods try to estimate the value function V(s) for each state s in the environment, which represents the expected return when starting from that state and performing any action. The value function tells us how good it is to start in a certain state, regardless of the sequence of actions taken later. Therefore, the goal of these methods is to find the optimal policy π* = argmaxa Q(s, a) ∀s∈S, where a is any action in the action space, s is any state in the state space, and Q(s, a) is the estimated action-value function. This means finding the best way to act within a given state without knowing the future outcomes. There are several variations of value-based methods such as linear quadratic approximation, TD-learning, n-step bootstrapping, and Monte Carlo methods. 

### Linear Quadratic Approximation (LQG)
The LQG method estimates the value function using the Bellman equation:

V(s) ≈ E[R + γE[V(s')]]

where R is the reward received after taking an action in state s, V(s') is the expected value of the next state, and γ is the discount factor, which discounts future rewards more heavily than immediate ones. The update rule for estimating V(s) is:

V(s) ← (I - αLS)V(s) + α(R + γE[V(s')])

where I is the identity matrix, LS is the least squares solution, alpha is a scalar, and s is a state in the state space. This method requires knowledge of the dynamics of the system and works well under perfect model assumptions. However, it cannot handle stochastic transitions or infinite horizon problems.

### Temporal Difference (TD) Learning
The TD learning method estimates the value function V(s) for each state using a dynamic programming approach called temporal difference (TD) error:

TDerror_t+1(s,a) := r_t+1 + γV(s_t+1) - V(s_t)

where s_t is the current state, a_t is the current action, s_t+1 is the resulting state, r_t+1 is the corresponding reward, and γ is the discount factor. This formula defines the difference between the predicted value of the next state and the actual value obtained after following the current policy. The update rule for estimating V(s) is:

V(s) ← V(s) + αTDerror_t(s,π(s))

where π(s) is the current policy, and α is a scalar weight parameter that controls the importance of new experiences versus old ones. Unlike MC methods, TD updates rely only on immediate rewards and can handle both finite and infinite horizon problems. However, it does not exploit uncertainty or explore random actions effectively unless the agent knows the true transition probabilities.

### N-Step Bootstrapping
N-step bootstrapping is similar to TD learning but uses multiple steps instead of just the next step. The update rule is slightly modified to include the estimated value of the intermediate states:

V(s) ← V(s) + α/n∑_i=1^nγ^(n-i)TDerror_t+i

where i is the timestep offset, n is the number of steps used for estimation, and gamma is the discount factor. N-step updates improve sample efficiency compared to full-batch updates because they avoid bootstrapping errors caused by moving far ahead in time.

### Monte Carlo (MC) Methods
Monte Carlo methods involve simulating episodes to estimate the value function V(s). The policy π is often deterministic in these methods, so we don't need to estimate the transition probabilities separately. Instead, we can simply simulate the episode starting from the initial state until termination and count the total reward collected during the episode. Then we divide this total reward by the number of visits to the state s to get the average return:

V(s) ← Σr_j / N(s)

where j is the index of the timestep visited by the agent, r_j is the reward at that timestep, and N(s) is the number of times the agent visited state s. Since there is no rollout or planning step in MC methods, they require complete trajectories to estimate V(s). They can handle both finite and infinite horizon problems since they accumulate samples throughout the episode.

## 3.2 Model-based Methods
Model-based methods use a learned model of the environment to predict the next state and calculate the expected return. Models capture all aspects of the environment, including the transition probabilities and noise in the environment. These methods can learn policies directly from demonstrations and achieve higher levels of accuracy due to their probabilistic nature. Some commonly used model-based methods include Dynamic Programming, Gaussian processes, and Hierarchical Bayesian models. 

### Dynamic Programming (DP)
Dynamic programming is another model-free RL algorithm that learns the optimal policy directly from the current state. DP finds the maximum expected return starting from every state in the environment recursively. The value function V(s) is defined as follows:

V(s) := max_{a}Q(s,a)

where Q(s,a) is the action-value function that measures the expected return starting from state s and taking action a. The policy pi is then chosen by selecting the action that maximizes the value function:

pi(s) := argmax_aQ(s,a)

To implement DP, we define two functions: the value function V(s) and the policy pi(s). Initially, we initialize the value function V(s) to zero and evaluate the expected returns Q(s,a) for all s and a using the Bellman equation:

Q(s,a) := sum_{s',r}(P(s'|s,a)[r + γV(s')])

Once we have calculated the value function and policy for each state, we can proceed with the standard update rules for value-based methods. The main advantage of DP is that it can handle large, stochastic environments easily because it doesn't make any assumption about the underlying model. It also works well with sparse and low-dimensional representations of the environment.

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)
In MDP, we assume that the agent observes the current state s and selects an action a. Based on this selection, the environment transitions to a new state s' with a reward r and a probability p. The objective is to learn a policy π that leads to the highest long-term reward while minimizing the expected cost (expected length of the path taken to reach the goal). Given this framework, we can formulate the value iteration equations:

V(s) := max_{a}sum_{s'}P(s'|s,a)[r(s,a,s') + γV(s')]

π(s) := argmax_aV(s)

where P(s'|s,a) is the probability of transitioning to state s' given state s and action a, and r(s,a,s') is the reward obtained by transitioning from state s to state s' with action a. To implement MDPs, we again define two functions: the value function V(s) and the policy pi(s). Again, we use the standard update rules for value-based methods to refine the estimates.

### Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN)
This algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios where the dimensions of the state and action spaces are large and unknown beforehand. LMNN maintains a set of prototype vectors, which are organized based on their similarity to other vectors in the same subspace. The idea is that prototypes closer to each other tend to correspond to similar states or actions. The distance metric used here is the cosine similarity coefficient, which measures the angular separation between two vectors in a subspace. The update rule for a prototype vector p(k) is:

p(k) ← (1-α)p(k) + αθ(s_t,a_t)

where p(k) is the kth prototype, s_t is the current state, a_t is the current action, α is a hyperparameter that determines the rate of change towards the mean direction, and θ(s_t,a_t) is the gradient of the margin loss wrt to the prototype vector:

margin loss(p_k) := |cos(θ(s_t,a_t), p_k)| - δ

δ is a threshold value that prevents the prototype from growing too fast and causing oscillations. By maintaining a collection of prototypes that lie along appropriate manifolds, LMNN can approximate the Q-function or policy function efficiently even when the dimensionality is very high.
