Decision Trees (DTs) are widely used in a variety of applications from fraud detection to market analysis and image recognition. However, DTs may have several limitations when it comes to handling complex datasets. In particular, they can be prone to overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on training data but poorly on new unseen data. Moreover, DTs do not perform well for high dimensional or noisy data as their accuracy decreases significantly as the number of features increases.
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using Deep Learning techniques for improving performance of Decision Trees. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers have shown great promise for this purpose. This article will explain how these models can be incorporated into traditional decision tree-based algorithms to achieve significant improvements in accuracy while avoiding overfitting. The final objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of such hybrid approach by comparing its performance with that of standard DT approaches.

# 2.基本概念术语说明
Deep Learning: A type of machine learning technique based on artificial neural networks where layers of computation are stacked to learn abstract representations of inputs. The aim is to create powerful feature extractors that can capture complex patterns in raw input data. 

Decision Tree: A supervised machine learning algorithm that works by building a hierarchy of if-then statements to predict the outcome of a question based on given conditions. It recursively splits the space along one axis according to some chosen attribute until each region contains only instances belonging to one class.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A type of deep learning architecture typically used for computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, dense layers, and activation functions.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): A type of deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing sequential data, such as text or speech. It processes sequences of inputs at every time step through hidden states, and learns to output a probability distribution over possible outcomes at each time step.

Transformer: An attention-based deep learning architecture that applies self-attention and feedforward networks to encode source and target sentences into a fixed-length representation that captures important information. It uses multi-head attention mechanisms to assign different weights to different parts of the sentence, allowing the model to pay more attention to relevant elements.

Ensemble Method: A method of combining multiple base models to improve generalization performance. Popular ensemble methods include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking. Each individual base model makes predictions on test data, and the ensemble combines them together to produce a final prediction.

To enhance decision trees with deep learning capabilities, we use two approaches - Feature Engineering and Model Ensembling.

1. Feature Engineering: We preprocess the original dataset to obtain engineered features that better capture the underlying structure of the problem. Some common pre-processing steps include dimensionality reduction using PCA, kernel embedding using SVM or k-NN, or feature selection using RFECV. These transformations help train CNN and Transformer models effectively and prevent overfitting. 

2. Model Ensembling: To combine the outputs of multiple models, we first train separate models using various hyperparameters and selecting optimal architectures. Then, we build an ensemble by combining the outputs of all the trained models. Common ensemble methods include Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking. Each individual model is trained on a subset of the training data and produces predictions on the corresponding validation set. Finally, we combine the predictions of all the models to generate a single ensemble prediction. This approach helps to reduce variance and improve overall accuracy.

Here's how the process looks like in detail:

1. Data Preprocessing:
Before starting the experiment, we split our dataset into training and testing sets. During preprocessing, we normalize the numerical features, one hot encode categorical variables, apply outlier detection, handle missing values, etc. We also transform the original dataset using Feature Engineering techniques to get better insights about the underlying structure of the problem. For instance, we could calculate correlation between features using Pearson's r coefficient or compute mutual information between pairs of features using mutual_info_classif function from sklearn.feature_selection package. After applying the transformation, we save the processed dataset as csv file so that we don't need to repeat these operations during model training and evaluation.


2. Traditional Decision Trees: 
We start by implementing regular decision trees without any deep learning components. We fit the decision tree classifier on the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data. Initially, we might find that regular decision trees work reasonably well on simple datasets like iris or breast cancer. But as we increase the complexity of the data, we observe issues like overfitting and low accuracy due to limited capacity of decision trees. 

3. Adding Deep Learning Components: Once we identify that traditional decision trees cannot handle complex datasets, we add CNN and/or transformer layer(s). We then compile and train the model using the same pipeline we used earlier to train non-deep models. Here, we use cross-validation to select the best hyperparameters, tune the architecture, and fine-tune the model before making final predictions on the testing set. Below are the detailed steps:

    a. Training CNN model:
    First, we define a convolutional network consisting of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, dense layers, and activation functions. We choose appropriate filter sizes, number of filters, strides, padding, dropout rate, etc., based on the nature of the task at hand. Next, we load the transformed dataset saved in previous step and preprocess the data using ImageDataGenerator module provided by Keras library. We pass the preprocessed data to the defined CNN model and compile it using categorical crossentropy loss function and Adam optimizer. We use batch size equal to 32 and train the model for a few epochs.
    
    b. Training Transformer model:
    Similar to CNN model, we define a transformer network consisting of encoder blocks, decoder blocks, and normalization layers. We specify the d_model, num_heads, and other parameters as required based on the nature of the task. Again, we load the preprocessed dataset and initialize the necessary modules of the transformer model. We implement positional encoding as introduced in Attention Is All You Need paper and tokenize the text data accordingly. We use masking to avoid accessing future tokens when decoding. Lastly, we train the transformer model using masked language modeling loss function and Adam optimizer.
    
    c. Combining Models:
    Finally, once both CNN and transformer models have finished training, we can combine their outputs by either averaging or concatenating their features. We also use a linear regression layer to adjust the weight of the combined features before passing it through a softmax function to make final predictions. We evaluate the performance of the combined model on the testing set using metrics like accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC score, etc.
    
4. Comparing Results: We compare the results obtained by traditional decision trees vs. hybrid decision trees using CNN+Transformer and traditional decision trees alone. While traditional decision trees perform well on simpler datasets, they often struggle with very large and complex datasets like medical images or natural language texts. Hybrid models with deep learning components perform much better than traditional models because they can leverage the power of deep learning models for complex pattern extraction and hierarchical partitioning of the feature space. Hence, hybrid models can significantly outperform traditional decision trees in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise and overfitting. Additionally, hybrid models provide an efficient way to integrate various types of data into a unified framework.
