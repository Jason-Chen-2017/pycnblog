### Facial recognition is the use of biometric technologies to identify or verify a person's face. It has become an increasingly important technology in society as it can help individuals to sign in, unlock secure devices, and access various online services more easily. While facial recognition systems are becoming more powerful day by day, they also bring new risks with them such as privacy breaches and data theft. 

Recent research shows that despite technological advances, there still exists many vulnerabilities associated with facial recognition technology. Researchers from different fields have found numerous issues related to facial recognition system security, including privacy breaches, data theft, fake identities, and model stealing. These issues have made it difficult for organizations to ensure the confidentiality and safety of their sensitive information using facial recognition technology. This paper will provide an overview on these privacy-related problems faced by facial recognition users and how developers should address them accordingly.

In this article, we will review several popular facial recognition technologies, explain basic concepts and terms used in facial recognition, discuss core algorithms and operations steps involved in face detection and identification process, demonstrate code examples and explanations to better understand technical details behind the scenes, and conclude with future trends and challenges of facial recognition technology. Finally, we will explore some common questions and answers raised around facial recognition security issues. 

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
Before we start our analysis of facial recognition security issues, let’s briefly go over some basic concepts and terms used in facial recognition. 

## Types of Facial Recognition Systems
There are two main types of facial recognition systems based on the methodology used for processing images: 

1. **Local feature matching:** In this type of system, features like eyes, nose, mouth, etc., are detected and matched between the query image (the one being analyzed) and all known faces stored in the database. This approach works well when the subject(s) whose faces need to be recognized are frontal, clear, and not occluded heavily.

2. **Deep neural networks:** In this type of system, deep learning models learn complex representations of objects within images. They extract features such as edges, shapes, textures, colors, etc. which are then used to classify subjects. This approach provides accurate results even if the subjects are partially covered, obscured, or have multiple expressions or background clutter. 

It is worth noting that modern facial recognition systems often combine both local feature matching and deep neural network techniques to achieve high accuracy while avoiding privacy concerns. 

## Databases 
A facial recognition database contains a collection of cropped faces, called biometrics, of people who have been registered under an organization’s account. Each biometric consists of a set of characteristic vectors describing the face, such as appearance, emotion, pose, glasses, etc. Biometric databases are usually built either manually or automatically using computer vision methods, which analyzes each individual's face image and extracts relevant features that uniquely define them. Once created, the database remains static and read-only until updated by a manual registration process conducted by trained staff members.  

Database breach attacks occur when unauthorized parties gain access to a database containing personal biometric data. This includes hacking attempts through stolen passwords, viruses transmitted via email attachments, or even physical intrusion into employee workstations. A successful attack could result in compromise of valuable identity data, ransomware payments, or even complete data loss. 

To prevent such threats, organizations must implement strong authentication policies and regularly update their databases by adding newly hired employees or updating existing ones with latest face images. Additionally, organizations may consider deploying advanced intrusion detection systems (IDPS) to detect potential attacks early and notify security teams. 

## Face Detection 
Face detection refers to the process of locating and identifying the human face within an image. Depending on the resolution and quality of the input image, a variety of algorithms can be applied to detect faces. Popular face detection algorithms include Haar cascades, HOG, CNN, and SVM. However, due to variations in lighting conditions and other factors, certain aspects of a face, such as its position or angle, can be distorted or misaligned during the detection stage. To mitigate such issues, face detectors can employ post-processing algorithms, such as affine transformations, interpolation, and scaling, to align the detected face region with the true face location. 

When it comes to privacy concerns, the biggest challenge facing facial recognition technology lies in protecting user privacy and ensuring the integrity of collected biometric data. One way to do this is to carefully select the face detection algorithm that best fits the needs of your application. For example, you might choose a simpler model like Haar Cascades when the target audience is mostly office workers, or you might require higher accuracy at the cost of slower processing speeds. Similarly, you can also leverage advanced techniques like blur detection and background subtraction to reduce the risk of false positives and improve overall performance. 

Additionally, you can also use active monitoring techniques to continuously monitor user behavior and detect suspicious activity that could indicate a potential breach. You can capture videos of suspected breaches, analyze them using machine learning tools, and trigger alerts and notifications if necessary. Moreover, you can also encrypt the captured videos before storing them offline to prevent any further access. 

However, keep in mind that face detection alone cannot completely eliminate all security risks associated with facial recognition systems. For instance, it is possible for malware or other malicious software to exploit weaknesses in the detection logic or perform man-in-the-middle attacks against the camera hardware. Therefore, it is essential to establish procedures to maintain security measures throughout the entire lifecycle of the biometric data, including data collection, storage, management, and sharing.
