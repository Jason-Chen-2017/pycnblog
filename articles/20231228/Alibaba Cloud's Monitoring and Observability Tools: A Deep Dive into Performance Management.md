## 2.核心概念与联系
### 2.1 Monitoring vs Observability
Before we dive into the specific tools and technologies, let's first clarify the difference between monitoring and observability.

**Monitoring** refers to the process of collecting and analyzing data from a system to detect and diagnose issues. It typically involves setting up metrics, alerts, and dashboards to keep track of the system's health and performance.

**Observability**, on the other hand, is a more holistic approach to understanding the behavior of a system. It involves collecting and analyzing various types of data, such as logs, traces, and metrics, to gain insights into the system's internal state and behavior. Observability enables you to detect and diagnose issues more effectively, even in complex and distributed systems.
