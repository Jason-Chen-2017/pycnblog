# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

In this section, we will provide detailed code examples and explanations for the Sigmoid Core technology.

## 4.1 Sigmoid Activation Function

The sigmoid activation function can be implemented in Python as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
```

This function takes a real number `x` as input and returns a value between 0 and 1.

## 4.2 Backpropagation

Backpropagation can be implemented in Python as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def backpropagation(x, y, weights, learning_rate):
    # Forward pass
    predictions = sigmoid(np.dot(x, weights))
    loss = np.mean(y * np.log(predictions) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - predictions))

    # Backward pass
    gradients = np.dot(x.T, (predictions - y) * sigmoid(predictions) * (1 - sigmoid(predictions)))
    weights -= learning_rate * np.dot(x, gradients)

    return loss, weights
```

This function takes a set of input features `x`, target values `y`, initial weights `weights`, and a learning rate `learning_rate` as input. It performs a forward pass to calculate the predictions and loss, and then performs a backward pass to update the weights.

## 4.3 Gradient Descent

Gradient descent can be implemented in Python as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(x, y, weights, learning_rate, epochs):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        loss, weights = backpropagation(x, y, weights, learning_rate)
    return weights
```

This function takes a set of input features `x`, target values `y`, initial weights `weights`, a learning rate `learning_rate`, and the number of epochs `epochs` as input. It performs gradient descent to minimize the loss function.

## 4.4 Big Data Analytics

Big data analytics can be implemented in Python using the `pandas` and `scikit-learn` libraries. For example, you can use the `pandas` library to read a large CSV file and the `scikit-learn` library to perform clustering on the data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

data = pd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv')
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
data['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(data)
```

This code reads a large CSV file into a `pandas` DataFrame, performs clustering on the data using the `KMeans` algorithm, and adds a new column to the DataFrame containing the cluster assignments.
