在这里，我们以一个简单的Python程序来演示如何使用数据科学方法和工具进行生物信息学分析。这个程序是一个基因序列比对程序，使用了Needleman-Wunsch算法。

```python
def needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2):
    len1 = len(seq1)
    len2 = len(seq2)
    score_matrix = [[0] * (len2 + 1) for _ in range(len1 + 1)]
    gap_penalty = -1
    match_reward = 1

    for i in range(1, len1 + 1):
        for j in range(1, len2 + 1):
            score_matrix[i][j] = max(
                0,
                score_matrix[i - 1][j] - gap_penalty,
                score_matrix[i][j - 1] - gap_penalty,
                score_matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + match_reward if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1] else match_reward
            )

    align1 = ""
    align2 = ""
    i, j = len1, len2
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if score_matrix[i][j] == score_matrix[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        elif score_matrix[i][j] == score_matrix[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1]:
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            if seq1[i - 1] == "-" or seq2[j - 1] == "-":
                align1 += "-"
                align2 += "-"
            elif seq1[i - 1] == " " or seq2[j - 1] == " ":
