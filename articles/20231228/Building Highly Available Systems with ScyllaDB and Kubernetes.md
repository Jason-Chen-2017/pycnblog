ScyllaDB is an open-source distributed NoSQL database that is compatible with Apache Cassandra. It is designed to provide high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to build highly available systems using ScyllaDB and Kubernetes.

## 1.1. Background on ScyllaDB
ScyllaDB is a drop-in replacement for Apache Cassandra, which means that it is designed to be compatible with the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) and can be used interchangeably with Cassandra. ScyllaDB is known for its high performance, low latency, and high throughput. It is suitable for use cases such as real-time analytics, IoT, gaming, and financial services.

### 1.1.1. Key Features of ScyllaDB
- **High Performance**: ScyllaDB is designed to provide high performance by using a customized storage engine that is optimized for flash storage. It also uses a lock-free, non-blocking memory architecture to ensure high throughput and low latency.
- **High Availability**: ScyllaDB provides high availability through its distributed architecture, which allows for automatic failover and data replication.
- **Easy Scalability**: ScyllaDB can be easily scaled horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. It also supports dynamic schema changes, which allows for easy adaptation to changing data requirements.
- **Compatibility with Apache Cassandra**: ScyllaDB is compatible with Apache Cassandra, which means that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for Cassandra without requiring any changes to the application code.

### 1.1.2. Use Cases for ScyllaDB
- **Real-time Analytics**: ScyllaDB is suitable for real-time analytics use cases, such as monitoring and alerting, because of its high performance and low latency.
- **IoT**: ScyllaDB can be used in IoT applications to store and process large volumes of sensor data in real-time.
- **Gaming**: ScyllaDB is used in gaming applications to store and retrieve player data quickly and efficiently.
- **Financial Services**: ScyllaDB is used in financial services applications to process large volumes of transaction data in real-time.

## 1.2. Background on Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes is designed to provide a portable, extensible, and open platform for containerized applications, and it supports a wide range of use cases, including microservices, IoT, and CI/CD pipelines.

### 1.2.1. Key Features of Kubernetes
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **High Availability**: Kubernetes provides high availability through its distributed architecture, which allows for automatic failover and data replication.
- **Easy Scalability**: Kubernetes can be easily scaled horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster.
- **Extensibility**: Kubernetes is designed to be extensible, which means that it can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of different applications.

### 1.2.2. Use Cases for Kubernetes
- **Microservices**: Kubernetes is commonly used in microservices architectures to manage the deployment and scaling of individual microservices.
- **IoT**: Kubernetes can be used in IoT applications to manage the deployment and scaling of IoT devices and applications.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Kubernetes is used in CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment and scaling of containerized applications.

## 1.3. Why ScyllaDB and Kubernetes?
ScyllaDB and Kubernetes are a powerful combination for building highly available systems. ScyllaDB provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability, while Kubernetes provides container orchestration, high availability, easy scalability, and extensibility. By combining these two technologies, you can build highly available systems that can handle large volumes of data and provide low latency and high throughput.

In the next section, we will explore the core concepts and principles behind ScyllaDB and Kubernetes, and how they can be used together to build highly available systems.
