### 4.1 Creating and Updating Graph Data
To create and update graph data in FoundationDB, we can use the following code example:

```
import foundationdb as fdb

# Connect to FoundationDB
client = fdb.client()

# Create a new key-value store
key_value_store = client.create_key_value_store()

# Create a new graph data entry
graph_data = {
    "nodes": [
        {"id": 1, "label": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Alice"}},
        {"id": 2, "label": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Bob"}},
    ],
    "edges": [
        {"id": 1, "source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Friend", "properties": {"since": "2010"}},
    ],
}

# Update the graph data
key_value_store.set(graph_data)
```

### 4.2 Querying Graph Data
To query graph data in FoundationDB, we can use the following code example:

```
import foundationdb as fdb

# Connect to FoundationDB
client = fdb.client()

# Create a new key-value store
key_value_store = client.create_key_value_store()

# Query the graph data
query = """
MATCH (n:Person)-[:Friend]->(m:Person)
WHERE n.name = "Alice"
RETURN m.name
"""

# Execute the query
result = key_value_store.query(query)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

### 4.3 Performing Graph Analytics
To perform graph analytics in FoundationDB, we can use the following code example:

```
import foundationdb as fdb
import networkx as nx

# Connect to FoundationDB
client = fdb.client()

# Create a new key-value store
key_value_store = client.create_key_value_store()

# Read the graph data
graph_data = key_value_store.get("graph_data")

# Convert the graph data to a NetworkX graph
G = nx.Graph()
for node in graph_data["nodes"]:
    G.add_node(node["id"], **node["properties"])
for edge in graph_data["edges"]:
    G.add_edge(edge["source"], edge["target"], **edge["properties"])

# Perform graph analytics
centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)

# Print the result
print(centrality)
```
