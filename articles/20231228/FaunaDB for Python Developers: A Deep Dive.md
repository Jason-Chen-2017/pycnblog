### 3.1 Data Models

FaunaDB supports four data models: key-value, document, wide-column, and graph. Each data model has its own strengths and use cases.

- **Key-Value**: The key-value data model is simple and efficient, and it's a good choice for storing simple data, such as configuration settings or user preferences.
- **Document**: The document data model is a more structured version of the key-value model, and it's a good choice for storing complex data, such as JSON or BSON documents.
- **Wide-Column**: The wide-column data model is designed for high-write workloads, and it's a good choice for storing large amounts of data, such as time-series data or logs.
- **Graph**: The graph data model is designed for relationships between data, and it's a good choice for applications that require complex relationships, such as social networks or recommendation engines.

### 3.2 Distributed Architecture

FaunaDB's distributed architecture allows it to scale horizontally, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and traffic. The distributed architecture is based on a set of core concepts:

- **Sharding**: Sharding is a technique for distributing data across multiple nodes, and FaunaDB uses sharding to distribute data across a cluster of nodes.
- **Replication**: Replication is a technique for creating multiple copies of data, and FaunaDB uses replication to ensure that data is available even if a node fails.
- **Consistency**: FaunaDB uses a variety of consistency algorithms to ensure that data is consistent across the cluster.

### 3.3 ACID Transactions

FaunaDB supports ACID transactions, which means that it provides strong consistency guarantees for your data. ACID transactions have four key properties:

- **Atomicity**: Atomicity means that a transaction is either completely successful or it fails. If a transaction fails, it's as if it never happened.
- **Consistency**: Consistency means that a transaction must start and end with the same data. If a transaction changes data, it must do so in a way that maintains the integrity of the data.
- **Isolation**: Isolation means that transactions must be executed in isolation from other transactions. This means that one transaction cannot interfere with the execution of another transaction.
- **Durability**: Durability means that a transaction's results must be permanent. If a transaction succeeds, its results must be stored permanently in the database.

### 3.4 Security

FaunaDB provides a variety of security features, including encryption, access control, and auditing.

- **Encryption**: FaunaDB encrypts data at rest and in transit, so you can be sure that your data is secure.
- **Access Control**: FaunaDB provides a variety of access control features, including role-based access control and fine-grained access control.
- **Auditing**: FaunaDB provides auditing features, so you can track who is accessing your data and what they are doing.

### 3.5 Scalability

FaunaDB is designed to be highly scalable, so it can handle the growing needs of your application. FaunaDB's scalability is based on a set of core concepts:

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Horizontal scaling is a technique for increasing the capacity of a system by adding more nodes. FaunaDB uses horizontal scaling to increase its capacity.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Vertical scaling is a technique for increasing the capacity of a system by adding more resources to a single node. FaunaDB supports vertical scaling, so you can increase the capacity of a single node if needed.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Auto-scaling is a technique for automatically increasing or decreasing the capacity of a system based on demand. FaunaDB supports auto-scaling, so you can be sure that your application will always have enough capacity.

## 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

### 4.1 Installing FaunaDB Python SDK

To get started with FaunaDB in your Python projects, you'll need to install the FaunaDB Python SDK. You can do this using pip:
