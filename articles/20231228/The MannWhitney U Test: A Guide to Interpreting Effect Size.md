The Mann-Whitney U test, also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, is a non-parametric statistical method used to compare two independent samples. It is particularly useful when the data is not normally distributed or when the variances of the two samples are unequal. The test is based on the ranking of the combined data from both samples and is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups.

In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and interpreting the effect size of the Mann-Whitney U test. We will cover the core concepts, algorithm principles, and specific steps and mathematical models. We will also provide code examples and detailed explanations, as well as discuss future trends and challenges in this field.

## 2.核心概念与联系

### 2.1 Non-parametric statistics

Non-parametric statistics, also known as distribution-free statistics, are statistical methods that do not rely on assumptions about the distribution of the data. These methods are particularly useful when the data is not normally distributed or when the sample size is small. The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test that compares two independent samples without assuming any specific distribution.

### 2.2 Independent samples

Independent samples are two or more groups of data that are collected from different sources or under different conditions. The Mann-Whitney U test is used to compare two independent samples to determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups.

### 2.3 Rank-sum test

The rank-sum test is a non-parametric statistical method that compares two independent samples based on the ranking of the combined data. In the Mann-Whitney U test, the combined data from both samples are ranked, and the ranks are used to calculate the test statistic U. The rank-sum test is a powerful tool for comparing two independent samples when the data is not normally distributed or when the variances of the two samples are unequal.

### 2.4 Effect size

Effect size is a measure of the magnitude of the difference between two groups. In the context of the Mann-Whitney U test, the effect size is used to quantify the strength of the relationship between the two independent variables. The effect size is an important consideration when interpreting the results of the Mann-Whitney U test, as it provides a more complete picture of the relationship between the two groups.

## 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

### 3.1 Algorithm principle

The Mann-Whitney U test is based on the ranking of the combined data from both samples. The algorithm principle involves the following steps:

1. Combine the two samples and rank the data from smallest to largest.
2. Assign the rank to each observation in the combined data.
3. Calculate the test statistic U for each group.
4. Determine the critical value or p-value to assess the significance of the difference between the two groups.

### 3.2 Mathematical model

The Mann-Whitney U test is based on the following mathematical model:

$$
U = \frac{n_1 n_2}{2} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n_1} \left(R_i - \frac{n_1 (n_1 + 1)}{2}\right) + \sum_{j=1}^{n_2} \left(\frac{n_1 (n_1 + 1)}{2} - R_j\right)\right]
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes of the two groups, and $R_i$ and $R_j$ are the ranks of the observations in the first and second groups, respectively.

### 3.3 Specific steps

The specific steps to perform the Mann-Whitney U test are as follows:

1. Combine the two samples and rank the data from smallest to largest.
2. Assign the rank to each observation in the combined data.
3. Calculate the test statistic U for each group using the formula above.
4. Determine the critical value or p-value to assess the significance of the difference between the two groups.

### 3.4 Effect size calculation

The effect size for the Mann-Whitney U test can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
r = \frac{U - 0.5}{\sqrt{N(N + 1)/6}}
$$

where $r$ is the effect size, $U$ is the test statistic, and $N$ is the total number of observations in both groups.

## 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

### 4.1 Python implementation

Here is a Python implementation of the Mann-Whitney U test using the `scipy.stats` library:

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

# Sample data
data1 = np.random.uniform(0, 10, 10)
data2 = np.random.uniform(5, 20, 10)

# Mann-Whitney U test
u_statistic, p_value = stats.mannwhitneyu(data1, data2, alternative='two-sided')

print("U statistic:", u_statistic)
print("P-value:", p_value)

# Effect size calculation
r = (u_statistic - 0.5) / np.sqrt(len(data1) * (len(data1) + 1) / 6)

print("Effect size:", r)
```

### 4.2 R implementation

Here is an R implementation of the Mann-Whitney U test using the `wilcox.test` function:

```R
# Sample data
data1 <- runif(10, 0, 10)
data2 <- runif(10, 5, 20)

# Mann-Whitney U test
u_statistic <- wilcox.test(data1, data2)$statistic
p_value <- wilcox.test(data1, data2)$p.value

print(paste("U statistic:", u_statistic))
print(paste("P-value:", p_value))

# Effect size calculation
r <- (u_statistic - 0.5) / sqrt(length(data1) * (length(data1) + 1) / 6)

print(paste("Effect size:", r))
```

### 4.3 Interpretation

In both Python and R implementations, the U statistic and p-value are calculated, as well as the effect size. The p-value is used to assess the significance of the difference between the two groups. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), the difference is considered statistically significant. The effect size provides a measure of the magnitude of the difference between the two groups.
