Hi there! As the CTO at my company, I am thrilled to share with you about some important aspects of keeping an eye on your puppies and providing suitable care and love for them.

11 months ago, we had our first puppy Paco, and it was amazingly cute. The owner had taken good care of him during his time in the shelter, but it didn't stop there. Over the years, he has learned so much about animals, especially working with different breeds and developing social skills such as leash-trapping and agility training. At this point, we have realized that it's essential to take measures to ensure that all your pets are properly cared for both physically and mentally. 

In the past few years, many pet owners have come forward with suggestions like adopting more veterinary assistants or enrolling in specialty dog trainings to improve their physical condition. However, these ideas might not always be practical or affordable for everyone, which is why it's crucial to consider personalized approaches to individualizing care plans based on each puppy’s needs and preferences.

So what does one need to consider when it comes to keeping an eye on and caring for a newborn puppy? Here are some key points to keep in mind:

1. **Attention:** Puppies require constant attention throughout their lives – whether they're being groomed by vet clinic staff, playing with human companions, or exploring the world outside. Make sure to reward your pups for taking care of themselves well, and encourage them to exercise regularly and explore outside. 

2. **Feeding:** Before most people think of feeding a puppy, they usually focus only on its diet and nutrition, without considering the other critical aspect of their health - the ability to recover from illness quickly and effectively. When it comes to puppies, having a high quality, varied diet is essential. Choose nutritious foods rich in iron and fiber, vitamins, and minerals, while avoiding fatty starchy foods that may cause gas and gastrointestinal issues later down the line. Use worm-free diets wherever possible. Keep up with the diet through routine visits with the vet or with families.

3. **Grooming:** Your puppy will spend most of its life in the crate, inside their warm, soft bed. To make their stay comfortable and enjoyable, grooming is an integral part of their daily activities. Grooming should include cleaning, brushing, tanning, shaving, combing, and trimming, all of which help prevent skin diseases and enhance overall appearance. Regular grooming sessions with the vet can also help maintain healthy hair growth and body texture. Additionally, if your puppy requires special grooming treatments (e.g., tailoring), it's important to choose options with a low cost per treatment, and offer the necessary instructions beforehand.

4. **Toys:** While puppies are young and immature creatures, they have developed ingenuity, patience, and resilience, making them ideal companions for children or adults who want to challenge them. So it's important to ensure that your puppy receives plenty of toys and playmates, including happy-hour games, furry friends, treats, and snacks. Remember, too many toys can actually contribute to stress, anxiety, depression, and various other medical conditions. It's essential to choose appropriate toys based on age, activity level, and family history.

5. **Diaper Change:** Although puppies typically use diapers within their day, it's still important to change their diapers at least once every year or two to promote proper hygiene. This includes wiping clean, thoroughly rinsing, and drying the pad. By following simple steps, diaper changes can minimize skin discharge, reduce flea numbers, and help your puppy recover faster after infections and birth injuries. If needed, visit the vet or post office for assistance in changing diapers.

6. **Medical Care:** In addition to the basic care outlined above, it's crucial to ensure that your puppy receives appropriate medical attention for any underlying disease or infection. Most pets receive primary care care from a veterinarian or pet healthcare provider, who helps monitor their overall health and takes prescribed medications when necessary. Check with the vet periodically for any potential concerns or symptoms related to your puppy, and schedule follow-up appointments as soon as possible. Additionally, make sure your puppy stays active and enthusiastic throughout their entire lifecycle, ensuring that it keeps receiving the right amount of exercise and rest. Finally, remember to remind your puppy of their own needs and responsibilities, such as taking care of infant home care responsibilities, watching out for the safety of other pets, and getting help with household chores.

7. **Housekeeping:** Finally, it's essential to provide your puppy with enough space and quietness, and enable them to go to sleep easily and without distraction. That means keeping the room tidy, removing clutter, vacuuming, and dusting the furniture regularly. They should also learn to sit and stand independently without interference from others. Overall, make sure your puppy has everything they need to feel safe, healthy, and loved by caring for them safely and comfortably.
