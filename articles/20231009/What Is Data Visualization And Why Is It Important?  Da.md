# 1.背景介绍


Data visualization is a powerful tool used by businesses and scientists to understand data more quickly and accurately. Visualizing large amounts of complex data can provide insights that are otherwise hidden or difficult to find. The goal of data visualization is to create meaningful representations of the data in order to enable decision-making processes that involve human intelligence. 

In recent years, data visualization has become an essential component for business decision making, scientific research, healthcare analysis, and many other applications across different industries. As such, it plays an increasingly important role in improving organizational effectiveness, customer satisfaction, and productivity. However, despite its importance, few organizations have been able to effectively use data visualization effectively due to several reasons: 

1. Lack of proper training and education: Data visualization requires proficiency in statistics, mathematics, computer science, and design skills to create visually appealing visualizations that highlight patterns and trends from raw data. Without these skills, businesses often rely on inferential statistical methods instead, which may not always produce accurate results or reliable interpretations.

2. Lack of standardization and consistency: Different stakeholders within an organization may require different types of visualizations with varying levels of complexity and accuracy. This creates challenges when trying to communicate complex information across teams and departments without having clear guidelines or expectations.

3. Complexity and variability in data: While there is no single definition of data visualization, it refers to any technique used to represent and analyze large datasets through various forms of graphical representation and interactive interfaces. In practice, data visualization tools vary widely in terms of their usability, functionality, scalability, and interactivity. This makes it challenging to build consistent, reusable components that work well across multiple contexts.

Overall, effective data visualization involves coordination between various disciplines, technical expertise, communication strategies, and subject matter experts to ensure efficient use of available resources while maintaining user satisfaction and producing high-quality deliverables. With this article, I will explain what data visualization is, why it's so important, how it works, and some best practices and pitfalls to consider before implementing your own data visualization projects.

## 2.1 Definition & History 
Data visualization is defined as the process of transforming and organizing large sets of data into graphics that convey specific insights about the underlying structure and behavior of the data. Data visualization was first developed during the 1900s by economist John Gruber who applied principles of color theory to describe quantitative relationships among variables. Over time, numerous techniques were developed to visualize data such as histograms, scatter plots, line charts, bar graphs, heat maps, and pie charts.  

The term "visualization" itself dates back to Greek origins where it originally meant something similar to "to look at." Modern usage of the word typically focuses on creating images or illustrations rather than just displaying data, but the meaning has continued to evolve over time. In 2017, McKinsey & Company released a study titled "The Evolution of Visualization Literacy," highlighting the rise of new technologies like big data analytics and cloud computing, alongside the increased demand for data analysts with advanced skills in data visualization. 


## 2.2 Types Of Data Visualization 
1. Scatter Plots : A scatter plot shows the relationship between two numerical variables by connecting points with lines or markers indicating individual values. These plots are commonly used to show the distribution of a variable relative to another. 

2. Line Charts : A line chart shows changes in a continuous variable over time by connecting data points with straight lines. These charts are popular for monitoring time-based trends, analyzing stock prices, and tracking sensor readings over time.

3. Bar Graphs : A bar graph displays categorical data using rectangular bars whose height indicates the magnitude of each category. Each bar can be colored differently to reflect its value compared to other categories. Examples include population pyramids and vertical bar charts. 

4. Histograms : A histogram shows the frequency distribution of a numeric variable by dividing its range into bins and counting the number of observations that fall into each bin. An example is shown below:

   

5. Heat Maps : A heat map uses colors to display the correlation between two or three variables. Rather than showing a single color for each cell, heat maps show a gradation of shades depending on the strength of the correlation. 

6. Pie Charts : A pie chart represents the proportion of each category in a dataset by drawing slices of a circle representing each item. Each slice is filled with a unique color based on the corresponding category. 

7. Radar Charts : A radar chart is similar to a polar chart except that it emphasizes all four quadrants of the chart instead of just one. This provides more detail than a simple bar chart since it shows both positive and negative correlations.  

   
8. Candlestick Charts : A candlestick chart is used to display trading activity over a period of time. It consists of thin wicks and thick bars that indicate opening and closing prices as well as the direction of the trade. Oscillating candlesticks usually indicate a change in price direction.

9. Maps : A geographic map displays spatial data by projecting real world locations onto paper, typically using symbols such as dots, lines, or polygons. Common examples of geographic maps include choropleth maps, heat maps, and symbol maps.
