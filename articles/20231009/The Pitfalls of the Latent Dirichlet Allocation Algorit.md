# 1.背景介绍


Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular statistical technique for topic modeling in natural language processing (NLP). It was introduced by Blei et al.(2003), which models each document as a mixture of topics and assigns each word to one or more topics. LDA has become an important tool for analyzing large corpora of textual data that are difficult to manually analyze. However, it still has some drawbacks when applied to complex tasks such as dealing with short texts or multiple documents related to different subjects. In this article, we will discuss some of the pitfalls of using LDA in NLP applications, as well as propose several solutions to mitigate these issues.
In particular, our goal is to develop a systematic understanding of how LDA works under the hood, identify its weaknesses and potential improvements, and suggest practical methods for dealing with them. We assume readers have some knowledge of machine learning concepts and techniques, including neural networks, matrix factorization, and optimization algorithms.

# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
Before delving into the specific details of the algorithm itself, let's go over some key terms and concepts used in LDA. These concepts may seem basic but they can be essential for understanding the algorithm better. 

## Documents and Words
The starting point of topic modeling is the collection of documents, where each document contains multiple words or phrases. Each document is represented as a vector of word frequencies. For example, consider the following sentence from Wikipedia: "I am happy because I got a new car." This sentence could be represented as follows:
$$ \begin{bmatrix}
    & i & a & m & h & a & p & p & y & c \\
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}$$
Here, each row represents a single word in the vocabulary. The number of columns corresponds to the total number of unique words in all documents, while the numbers in each cell indicate the frequency of occurrence of that word in that particular document. Note that there are many ways to represent documents and their contents as vectors. One possible way is to count the occurrences of each word type within a window of surrounding words (such as a sentence or paragraph). Other representations include n-grams, skip-grams, or character-level representations. Whatever representation is chosen, the process of turning raw text into counts should follow standard NLP preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.

Once we have processed the documents and converted them into bag-of-words format, we can start analyzing the relationships between the words in each document.

## Topics and Topics Clusters
Topics are abstract ideas or categories that coalesce together to form a concept. They emerge based on patterns found in the word usage across a corpus of documents. To extract the topics, we need to define a set of common themes or semantic features that appear frequently in the corpus. After identifying these topics, we group similar ones together into clusters. A cluster typically refers to a set of closely related topics, although there are exceptions to this rule depending on the context. For instance, a news website might categorize its topics around major political events like "elections", "coronavirus" and so on, even though those topics may overlap slightly. By clustering topics together, we can reduce the complexity of the model and focus on capturing the overall structure of the corpus rather than individual examples.

Each document can be assigned to multiple topics. Therefore, each document belongs to one or more clusters, and each cluster can contain multiple topics. The strength of a relationship between two documents depends on both their similarity and their connection to shared clusters. At the same time, documents within the same cluster tend to have similar contents regardless of the exact topics they belong to. As a result, grouping similar documents together helps to improve the accuracy of the resulting topic model.

## Probabilistic Model and Prior Knowledge
To capture these relationships between the documents and topics, we need to introduce some additional concepts. Firstly, instead of directly representing documents as vectors of word frequencies, we need to assign a probability distribution to each document and each word. This allows us to take into account the uncertainty inherent in the observations and inferences made by human annotators. Secondly, we need to incorporate prior knowledge about what topics exist in the corpus. For example, we might know that certain types of words occur commonly enough to serve as good proxies for defining topics. 

One approach to capture these probabilities is to use Bayesian inference. Given a set of observed variables (documents, words, and topic assignments), we can estimate their conditional probabilities given a set of unobserved variables (the parameters of the model). Specifically, we compute the joint likelihood function $P(D,W,\theta|\beta)$, where $D$ denotes the collection of documents, $W$ denotes the collection of words, $\theta$ denotes the collection of topic assignments, and $\beta$ denotes the hyperparameters of the model (which include priors for topic distributions, word distributions, and other factors). The parameters of the model are estimated using numerical optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent or variational inference. 

By combining probabilistic and latent variable models, we can create a generative model for the data. The idea is to assume that each document is generated by a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of word types. In addition to describing the observed data, this model also captures the hidden structure of the data and allows us to generate new samples from the underlying generative process. The key insight behind LDA is that it infers the true values of the unknown variables (in this case, the topic assignments and word types) using the available data and known relationships between them.

# 3.Algorithm Details and Operations
Now that we understand the core concepts and connections of LDA, let's dive deeper into the technical details of the algorithm. Before going into detail, let me clarify some terminology. In order to avoid confusion, here's how I'll refer to various entities throughout this section:

1. Document: A piece of text written by someone or something. There can be multiple documents per subject. For example, a news article, research paper, or tweet. 

2. Vocabulary: The set of unique words present in the entire corpus, compiled from the tokens extracted from the documents. 

3. Corpus: The set of all documents that constitute the dataset.

4. Token: A sequence of characters that represents a meaningful unit of work within a document, such as a word, phrase, or punctuation mark. Common approaches for extracting tokens involve splitting the documents into sentences, paragraphs, or chunks of fixed size. 

5. Word: A sequence of consecutive letters (not necessarily alphabetic) that appears in the vocabulary. Often times, it's considered a colloquial term that roughly translates to "token".

6. Term Frequency (TF): The number of times a word occurs in a document, divided by the total number of words in the document. Can be weighted according to the length of the document or the positions of the word within the document. TF = #times_word_occurs / #total_words.

7. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): The logarithmically scaled measure of the importance of a word in the corpus, computed as the inverse of the proportion of documents in the corpus that contain the word. IDF = log(#docs / #docs_with_word). Lower values correspond to rarer words, higher values to more frequent words. 

8. Bag of Words: A sparse representation of a document where each entry represents the frequency of occurrence of a word in the document. The rows correspond to the words in the vocabulary and the entries to the corresponding TF values.

9. Hidden Variables: Some aspects of the problem that are not explicitly visible in the input data. For example, the actual topics and distributions of word types. 

10. Hyperparameters: Parameters of the model that are not learned from the data but are defined beforehand and control the behavior of the algorithm. Examples of hyperparameters include the number of topics, smoothing parameter alpha, and priors for the topic distributions. 

With these definitions out of the way, we can now talk about the main operations of the LDA algorithm.

## E step: Estimate the word distribution for each topic
The first step of the algorithm involves estimating the word distribution for each topic. Mathematically, we can write this expression as:
\begin{equation}
    \phi_{dwk} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}(z_{ik}=j)\cdot\mathbb{I}(w_{i}=k)}{\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}(z_{ik}=j)}
\end{equation}
where $w_{i}$ is the $i$-th word in the document, $z_{ik}$ is the topic assignment for the $i$-th word ($k$-th topic), and $\mathbb{I}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function that takes value 1 when the condition inside the parentheses is true and 0 otherwise. This equation computes the fraction of times a word $w_k$ occurs in a document assigned to a topic $j$.

We initialize $\phi_{dwk}$ to 0 for every word $w_k$ and every topic $j$, and update its value after computing the sum over all the documents in the corpus. The denominator sums up the probabilities of all the documents being assigned to each topic, so it gives us the normalization constant for each word and topic combination. Since the numerator only depends on whether a word is associated with a topic and whether the current document is actually assigned to that topic, we can optimize computation by skipping the inner sum if the latter condition is false.

This equation calculates the probability of observing a word $w_k$ in a document assigned to a topic $j$, given the current state of the model. When we run the E-step on a mini-batch of training data, we accumulate these values for all pairs of words and topics.

## M step: Update the topic distribution for each document
After calculating the probabilities of each word occurring in each topic for each document, we move onto updating the topic distribution for each document. Mathematically, we can express this equation as:
\begin{equation}
    \theta_d = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\alpha_kz_{dk}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\alpha_k+\sum_{i=1}^Nw_{di}},
\end{equation}
where $\theta_d$ is the topic distribution for document $d$, $z_{dk}$ is the topic assignment for the $d$-th document ($k$-th topic), $w_{di}$ is the $i$-th word in the document, and $\alpha_k$ is the smoothing parameter for the $k$-th topic. The outer sum normalizes the weights by the total weight of all topics combined with the sum of all document lengths (measured in number of words). The inner sum calculates the expected contribution of each topic to the final topic distribution, taking into account the smoothing parameter $\alpha_k$ and the word distribution for the document.

Again, we initialize $\theta_d$ to 0 for every document $d$, calculate its value after computing the sum over all topics $k$, and then normalize it by dividing by the sum of all nonzero elements. Once again, we perform optimization by skipping computations if necessary.

## Running the Algorithm
At this point, we have implemented the E-step and M-step equations for computing the word distribution for each topic and the topic distribution for each document. Now, we just need to put everything together into a general framework and loop until convergence.
