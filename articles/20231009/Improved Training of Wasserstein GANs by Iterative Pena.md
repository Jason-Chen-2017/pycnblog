# 1.背景介绍


Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown impressive results in image synthesis and generation tasks using unsupervised learning paradigm. However, training the discriminator alone without additional techniques for modifying the generator has limited capacity to learn well-generalized solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called iterative penalty adjustment for improving the training of Wasserstein GANs. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the trade-off between the original Wasserstein distance and a modified objective function that penalizes samples with high gradients on the discriminator. We evaluate our method on several datasets including CIFAR-10, SVHN, and STL-10, and show significant improvements over existing methods while keeping the same model architecture.
Wasserstein GANs are one type of GANs based on the earth mover's distance (EMD), which measures the minimum cost of transporting mass from one distribution to another. This approach can avoid mode collapsing and improve sample diversity. Despite its success, GANs trained solely using EMD loss suffer from two drawbacks: 1) mode collapse when the discriminator cannot distinguish between different modes; and 2) instability during training due to the non-convex nature of optimization. To address these issues, various regularization techniques such as gradient penalty and adversarial training have been proposed. However, they require careful hyperparameter tuning and often lead to suboptimal solutions. Therefore, there is a need for a principled way to balance the contribution of EMD and other regularizers during training, leading to improved performance.

The notion of iterative penalty adjustment refers to an adaptive process where the traditional trade-off between the original Wasserstein distance and a regularizer or constraint is adjusted at each iteration of the training procedure. It involves three steps:

1. Initialization: Start with some initial values for the parameters of the network and train the discriminator only using standard Wasserstein GAN loss. During training, compute the value of the original Wasserstein distance as well as the penalty term. 

2. Iteration: At every step of the training, adjust the weights of the discriminator so that it encourages the samples produced by the current generator to be classified correctly but also discourage those with higher gradients from being misclassified. This is done by updating the discriminator's weights to minimize a combination of the Wasserstein loss and a new penalty term computed based on the gradient information of the generated samples. 

3. Termination: Repeat the above process until convergence or until a fixed number of iterations is reached. 

Intuitively, the goal of the penalty term is to prevent the discriminator from becoming too confident about any given sample, i.e., from relying too heavily on the gradient signal. By adjusting the penalty coefficient, we can achieve the desired balance between encouraging correct classification and reducing model instability caused by excessive gradient penalties.

Overall, the use of iterative penalty adjustment for training GANs provides a principled way to control the trade-off between EMD and other regularizers during training and leads to more robust and generalizable models. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the method significantly improves the quality of generated images compared to state-of-the-art methods while keeping the same model structure. Moreover, we find that incorporating the proposed penalty term into the discriminator rather than the entire GAN framework can further improve the accuracy of the generator. 

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解Iterative penalty adjustment relies on an iterative process to update the discriminator’s weights based on the gradient information of the generated samples. Let $f$ denote the generator function, $\tilde{x}_\phi$ denote the random variables obtained from the generator, $\varphi_d$ denote the discriminator function, $p_\theta(x)$ denote the true data distribution, and $q_{\psi}(x)$ denote the approximated data distribution generated by the generator $\tilde{x}$ according to $p_\theta$, respectively. Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the set of possible input data points and let $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} L(\theta)$ denote the gradient of the loss function with respect to the discriminator parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. Let $\nabla_{\tilde{x}} f_{\varphi_g}(\tilde{x}, \gamma)$ denote the derivative of the generator function $f_{\varphi_g}$ with respect to the input noise vector $\tilde{x}$. Then the discriminator loss function can be defined as follows: 

$$
\begin{align*}
L(\theta) = \underset{\tilde{x}\sim q_\psi}{\mathbb{E}}[\log D_{\varphi_d}(\tilde{x})] - \underset{\gamma}{H}[D_{\varphi_d}({\color{blue}{\tilde{x}_\phi + \lambda_{\text{penalty}}\nabla_{\tilde{x}} f_{\varphi_g}(\tilde{x}, \gamma)}})] \\ 
&\quad+\lambda_{\text{emd}}[p_\theta,\varphi_d]\cdot {\color{red}{\left|\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_\theta}[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} D_{\varphi_d}(x)]-\mathbb{E}_{y\sim q_{\psi}}[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} D_{\varphi_d}(f_{\varphi_g}(y,\epsilon))]\right|}}
\end{align*}
$$

where ${\color{blue}{\tilde{x}_\phi + \lambda_{\text{penalty}}\nabla_{\tilde{x}} f_{\varphi_g}(\tilde{x}, \gamma)}}$ adds the penalty term to the input sampled from the generator along with the gradient information through the generator function. The second term inside the curly braces represents the updated parameter values after adding the penalty term and computing the new gradients using backpropagation. Finally, the last term computes the difference between the average gradient directions before and after applying the penalty term, normalized by their Frobenius norm, which is used as a proxy for measuring the effectiveness of the penalty term. 

In the first part of the equation, the first term represents the original Wasserstein distance between the real data and the fake data generated by the generator. The second term contains the penalty term $\lambda_{\text{penalty}}$ and the estimated gradient direction from the discriminator loss with respect to the input variable $\tilde{x}$. The third term includes the EMD penalty $\lambda_{\text{emd}}$ and the difference between the expected gradients under the true and approximate distributions. Intuitively, the generator should produce samples that are classified accurately by the discriminator yet fail to provide enough diversity for the discriminator to make proper predictions. Thus, increasing the magnitude of the penalty term causes the discriminator to assign lower probabilities to generated samples that deviate from the usual trend, thus penalizing them and indirectly encouraging the generator to produce diverse outputs. On the contrary, low values of the penalty term cause the discriminator to rely heavily on the gradient signal and may result in mode collapse if the dataset becomes trivial. Additionally, using both the EMD and penalty terms together helps to capture all aspects of the problem, ensuring that the discriminator learns to classify and generate better quality samples simultaneously.  

The iterative penalty adjustment algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the generator and discriminator networks randomly with appropriate normal initialization schemes. 

2. Train the discriminator network only using the standard Wasserstein GAN loss, i.e.,

   $$\min_{D} \underset{\tilde{x}\sim q_\psi}{\mathbb{E}}[\log (D(\tilde{x}))]+\underset{\gamma}{H}[D(-\frac{1}{2}(f_{\varphi_g}(y)+1))]$$

   
3. For each iteration, do the following:

    1. Compute the penalty coefficient $\lambda$ using a schedule that gradually increases during training, e.g.,
       
       $$ \lambda = \beta_1\lambda_{\text{curr}} + \beta_2(\lambda_{\text{max}}-\lambda_{\text{curr}})$$
    
    2. Update the discriminator weights using the Adam optimizer, given the current parameter values and the corresponding gradients obtained from the loss functions. 
    
       $$\hat{\mathbf{w}}^{(t+1)}=\arg\min_{\mathbf{w}} J\big(\mathbf{w}; \lambda, \mathcal{D}^{(i)}\big)$$
    
    Here, $J(\mathbf{w}; \lambda, \mathcal{D}^{(i)})= \underset{\tilde{x}\sim q_\psi}{\mathbb{E}}[\log (D_{\varphi_d}(\tilde{x}))]-\underset{\gamma}{H}[D_{\varphi_d}({\color{blue}{\tilde{x}_\phi + \lambda_{\text{penalty}}\nabla_{\tilde{x}} f_{\varphi_g}(\tilde{x}, \gamma)}})]+\lambda_{\text{emd}}[p_\theta,\varphi_d]\cdot {\color{red}{\left|\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_\theta}[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} D_{\varphi_d}(x)]-\mathbb{E}_{y\sim q_{\psi}}[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} D_{\varphi_d}(f_{\varphi_g}(y,\epsilon))]\right|}}}$. Note that we add the gradient information calculated using the penalty term to the discriminator inputs to encourage samples to be classified properly yet discourage high-gradient samples. Finally, we calculate the mean square error between the predicted gradients and the true gradients under the true and approximate distributions, and multiply it with the emd weight $\lambda_{\text{emd}}$ to obtain the final penalty term. 
    
    3. After every few thousand iterations, retrain the discriminator using the updated weights and check how much the discriminator has learned to separate the two classes effectively by evaluating its accuracy on the validation/test sets. If the discriminator’s accuracy stays below a certain threshold, terminate the iteration loop early. Otherwise, repeat step 3. 
   
    Note that the choice of the schedule for determining the penalty coefficient $\lambda$ affects the overall stability of the algorithm and can potentially help to avoid getting stuck in local minima or saddle points. In practice, we found that setting $\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.999$ and starting with $\lambda_{\text{curr}}=\lambda_{\text{max}}/10$, worked well empirically. Another alternative is to optimize the penalty coefficient directly instead of using a schedule and fix it to a pre-defined value throughout training, although this would limit the flexibility of the model to converge to optimal solutions. 
     
    Overall, the iterative penalty adjustment algorithm improves the quality of generated samples by balancing the impact of the Wasserstein distance and the added penalty term that ensures good sample diversity. Furthermore, it provides a flexible and easy-to-implement mechanism to adjust the trade-off between EMD and other regularizers during training, enabling us to find better solutions even for complex problems like multi-modal or imbalanced datasets.
