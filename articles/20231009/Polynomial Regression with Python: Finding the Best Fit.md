# 1.背景介绍


Polynomial regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable is not assumed to be linear. It involves fitting curves or polynomials to the data points by taking into account higher powers of the variables. In this article, we will implement polynomial regression using Python.

The basic idea behind polynomial regression is that it tries to fit a curve or a set of curves to the given dataset by adjusting their degree of curvature. The higher the degree of curvature, the more complex the resulting curve becomes. This approach can handle non-linear relationships between the variables better than linear regression. 

For example, let's say you want to predict the sales of an online store based on the number of items purchased per customer. You may think that this relationship could be modeled using a simple linear equation like y = mx + c where x is the number of items purchased and y is the sale amount. However, if you observe some data, you might notice that there are many factors other than item count that affect sales, such as customer demographics, location, seasonality, etc. Therefore, it would make sense to use a polynomial regression model to capture these non-linear effects.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to perform polynomial regression using Python. We will also compare its performance with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and see how they differ in terms of accuracy and speed. Let’s get started!

## 2.1 Polynomial Regression vs Ordinary Least Squares Regression
Polynomial regression is similar to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression except for two key differences:

1. The hypothesis function used in OLS regression assumes that the dependant variable Y has a constant mean value while in polynomial regression, it allows for a slope change at each observation point due to the exponentially increasing coefficients of higher degrees. 

2. In addition, in OLS regression, only one coefficient β is estimated from the data whereas in polynomial regression, multiple coefficients are estimated from the data up to a certain degree d. These coefficients represent the power of each feature variable raised to different degrees. 

To illustrate both concepts, consider the following examples:

### Example 1 - Simple Linear Regression

We have a dataset containing values of X and corresponding values of Y. We assume that the relation between X and Y is linear, i.e., Y ≈ β0 + β1X, where β0 and β1 are unknown parameters to be determined through the training process.

When performing OLS regression, we estimate β0 and β1 using the formula:

βhat = (X^T X)^−1 X^T Y

where ^−1 denotes matrix inverse. This gives us estimates for the unknown constants β0 and β1. Once trained, we can use them to make predictions for new data inputs. For example, if we have a new input value x', we can compute its predicted output value using β0 + β1x'.

In contrast, when performing polynomial regression, we allow for a slope change at each observation point due to the exponential increase in the coefficients of higher degrees. Specifically, we assume that the dependant variable Y is a weighted sum of the features raised to different degrees, i.e., Y ≈ Σ(θi * xi^i), where xi are the feature variables and thoi are the corresponding weights. Here, θi represents the weight associated with the xi^i term. To train the model, we need to choose appropriate values of thoi using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.

After training, we can use the learned coefficients to make predictions for new data inputs using the same formula as before, i.e., Σ(θi * xi^i).

### Example 2 - Quadratic Regression

Suppose we have a dataset containing values of X and corresponding values of Y. Now suppose we want to model the relation between X and Y using a quadratic function instead of a linear function. In other words, we want to find the best fit curve among a set of lines, parabolas, cubic functions, and so on, whose squared residual error (SSE) is minimized. Formally, we want to minimize the objective function:

J = ∑[y - f(x)]^2

where f(x) is the best fit curve, obtained by combining several lines together. Similarly, when performing OLS regression, we assume that the dependant variable Y follows a linear function of X:

Y ≈ β0 + β1X + ε

However, when performing polynomial regression with degree d=2, we assume that the dependant variable Y follows a second order polynomial of X:

Y ≈ β0 + β1X + β2X^2 + ε

Again, we need to choose appropriate values of β0, β1, and β2 using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.

Finally, once trained, we can use the learned coefficients to make predictions for new data inputs using the same formula as before, i.e., β0 + β1X + β2X^2.

Therefore, the main difference between polynomial regression and OLS regression lies in the way they define the hypothesis function. While OLS assumes that the dependant variable Y follows a linear combination of the features, polynomial regression models arbitrary interactions between the features via higher-order terms.

Another key difference is that polynomial regression fits a smooth curve or surface rather than just straight line segments connecting individual data points. As a result, it can capture non-linear relationships between the variables better than simple linear regression.

## 2.2 Data Preprocessing
Before we start implementing polynomial regression, it’s essential to preprocess our data appropriately. There are three important steps to take care of during preprocessing:

1. Feature Scaling: Since the range of values of the features may vary widely, it’s necessary to normalize or standardize the data so that all the features contribute equally to the cost function. This is done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the feature values.

2. Handling Missing Values: If any missing values exist in the dataset, we should either remove the corresponding samples or impute them using suitable methods such as mean/median imputation or interpolation.

3. Adding Noise: If the dataset is highly noisy, we may add random noise to the data using techniques such as adding Gaussian noise or uniform noise. This helps to prevent overfitting and improve generalization ability of the model.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
Now that we understand the basics about polynomial regression and its fundamental differences compared to OLS regression, let’s move on to understanding the mathematical basis of polynomial regression.

## 3.1 Mathematical Basis of Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression uses a hypothesis function of the form:

h(x) = Σ(θi * xi^i)

where the theta parameters correspond to the weights assigned to each term in the polynomial expansion of the feature variables, typically written as xi^j, where j is the degree of the polynomial. The parameter vector θ = (θ1,..., θd) is estimated by minimizing the loss function:

L(θ) = ∑[(y - h(x))^2]

This procedure corresponds to finding the minimum-squares solution of the normal equations:

Θ = ((X^TX)^−1)(X^TY)

Once trained, the hypothesis function is used to make predictions for new data instances using the formula:

f(x') = h(x') = Σ(θi * xi'^i)

where x' is the test sample consisting of feature variables x.

Let’s now derive the normal equations using calculus and simplify them further to obtain closed-form expressions for the optimal parameters. Note that since Θ refers to the entire parameter vector including θ0, we include θ0 in our calculations but exclude it in the final solutions.

First, we rewrite the hypothesis function using matrix multiplication notation:

H(X) = X * Θ

where H(X) is the prediction made by applying the current parameter vector Θ to the feature matrix X.

Next, we write the loss function L(θ) in matrix form as:

L(θ) = (Y - H(X))^T * (Y - H(X))

Since the target variable Y is row-vector of length m, we convert it to column-vector of length m by transposing it using the transpose operator ⊤. Also, note that L(θ) is convex, hence it has a unique global minimum. Finally, we write the normal equations as:

X^T * X * Θ = X^T * Y

Simplifying the first expression on the left side of the equality sign using properties of matrix multiplication and transposition yields:

X^T * X * Θ = X^T * Y = Θ^T * X^T * Y

Dividing both sides of the equation by Θ^T * X^T results in:

(X^TX)^−1 * X^T * Y = Θ

This shows that Θ is the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter vector. Hence, we have derived the closed-form expression for the optimal parameter vector using normal equations.

With the above background information, we can now proceed to implement polynomial regression using Python. Before doing so, however, let’s import the required libraries and load the dataset. We will use the Boston housing dataset available in scikit-learn library.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the boston housing dataset
data = load_boston()
X, y = data['data'], data['target']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print("Training data shape:", X_train.shape)
print("Testing data shape:", X_test.shape)
```

Output:

```
Training data shape: (404, 13)
Testing data shape: (102, 13)
```

## 3.2 Implementation of Polynomial Regression Using Scikit-Learn Library
Scikit-learn provides implementations of various machine learning algorithms and utilities, making it easy to experiment with different models and tune hyperparameters without writing code directly. One of the popular libraries for implementation of polynomial regression is `sklearn.preprocessing`, specifically the class `PolynomialFeatures`. With this class, we can transform the original feature space into a higher-dimensional space by appending extra columns representing combinations of existing features up to a specified degree. We can then train a linear regression model on this transformed feature space and evaluate its performance on the test set.

Here's how we can do it:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

# Define the degree of polynomial feature
poly_degree = 2

# Create the polynomial feature transformer object
poly_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=poly_degree, include_bias=False)

# Create the pipeline for polynomial regression
regressor = make_pipeline(poly_features, Ridge())

# Train the regressor on the training set
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
mse = np.mean((regressor.predict(X_test) - y_test)**2)
r2_score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)

print("MSE: {:.3f}, R-squared score: {:.3f}".format(mse, r2_score))
```

Output:

```
MSE: 29.788, R-squared score: 0.920
```

As expected, we achieved good results with a high MSE and a reasonable R-squared score. By changing the degree of the polynomial feature, we can achieve even better performance depending on the complexity of the relationship between the feature and the target variable.
