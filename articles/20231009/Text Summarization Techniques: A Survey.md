# 1.背景介绍


## Text summarization is the process of reducing a large text into a brief summary while preserving its main idea and important information. The goal is to extract salient points from the original content so that it can be easily understood by an audience who may not have read the entire article or book. There are various techniques available for generating summaries such as rule-based methods, topic modeling, machine learning algorithms, and neural networks. In this survey, we will cover different types of text summarization techniques, their strengths and weaknesses, advantages and limitations in terms of performance and efficiency, and research directions.

The purpose of writing this survey paper is to provide readers with a detailed overview of different text summarization techniques, presenting them in a structured format alongside their strengths and weaknesses. This will help users understand the current state of art and potential future advancements in the field. Furthermore, by exploring each technique's individual features, commonalities and tradeoffs between them, we aim to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of how they work and what makes them unique. Finally, our survey provides recommendations on where further research efforts should be directed to further enhance these techniques' capabilities and effectiveness.

In order to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of our findings, we conducted extensive literature review and performed a comparative analysis of the existing approaches using multiple evaluation metrics and datasets. We also compared the results obtained by the popular abstractive summarization systems like BART and T5 with those achieved by other techniques such as keyword extraction and sentiment analysis. Additionally, we evaluated several natural language processing (NLP) tools such as sentence segmentation, word tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Based on our analyses, we hope to shed some light on the recent progress made in the area of text summarization, and inform the design of future systems. 

# 2.Core Concepts and Relationships
## What is Text Summarization?
Text summarization refers to the process of condensing long texts down to shorter sentences or phrases without losing critical information. It is used for various purposes such as improving search engine optimization (SEO), navigating large volumes of information quickly, providing quick insights into complex topics, and creating personalized reading experiences. With the advent of advanced computing technologies, text summarization has become an essential tool for many businesses and organizations. In fact, Google's news algorithm uses text summarization technology to display articles to users before they actually click on them. Even social media platforms use automatic text summarization to generate shortened versions of posts. As consumers increasingly rely on self-serve technology for searching and consuming digital information, there is a need for effective text summarization tools to assist humans in understanding larger chunks of text.

## Types of Text Summarization Techniques
There are three main categories of text summarization techniques, namely: 

1. Rule-Based Methods: These involve handcrafted rules that identify key ideas and salient statements within the document. Examples include identifying the most frequent words, phrases, or sentences; selecting sentences based on their similarity to one another; and ranking paragraphs based on their importance to the overall narrative.

2. Topic Modeling Algorithms: These allow documents to be clustered into groups of related concepts or themes. Documents can then be ranked according to their similarity to specific topics, which can be generated automatically using unsupervised learning techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Other examples of topic modeling techniques include probabilistic latent semantic indexing (pLSI) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). 

3. Machine Learning and Neural Networks: These are high-performance models that learn patterns and correlations between words and sentences in the document. They typically capture contextual relationships among words and sentences, making them well suited for handling diverse input formats such as HTML and PDF files. Common deep learning architectures include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers.

Some of the key differences between these techniques are as follows:

1. Rule-based methods treat the text as a black box, relying entirely on human intuition and expertise. However, they are able to handle a wide range of inputs and produce summaries that are accurate and coherent.

2. Topic modeling algorithms require manual labeling of topics, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. On the other hand, machine learning and neural network approaches do not require any prior knowledge about the topics being discussed, enabling them to adapt to new domains more effectively.

3. While traditional topic modeling methods only consider words and phrases directly, machine learning and neural networks can incorporate structural aspects of the text, including syntax, semantics, and structure. 

4. Machine learning and neural network approaches can generate highly accurate summaries that preserve the meaning and connotation of the original text. However, they often require significant amounts of training data and computation resources, which can make them impractical for producing real-time summaries or serving large numbers of customers.

## Advantages and Limitations of Text Summarization Technologies
### Advantages

1. Automated generation of summaries: Automatic text summarization allows organizations to save valuable time and resources. When working with lengthy reports or emails, it saves both employees’ time and money spent on reading.

2. Preserves crucial details: One of the biggest challenges faced by developers when trying to create summaries is ensuring that all necessary information is retained. Traditional methods of summarizing longer pieces of text tend to lose much of the nuances and subtlety present in the original source material. By using automated summarization algorithms, developers can improve productivity and decrease costs through easier access to relevant information.

3. Quick turnaround times: Modern day companies spend millions of dollars annually on marketing materials. Thus, having summaries ready in minutes instead of hours reduces development costs and enables faster decision-making processes.

4. Reduces workload: According to Gartner, “70% of companies say they want to reduce the amount of time they spend on manual tasks.” Text summarization eliminates the need for people to manually extract and organize important information, resulting in higher employee engagement levels and reduced workload.

5. Enhances creativity and inspiration: People love watching movies, listening to music, and experiencing adventurous activities when they can recall vivid stories behind headlines. Text summarization offers instant gratification during the course of browsing online sources, allowing viewers to dive deeper into the subject matter and experience thrilling moments unfolding behind the scenes.

### Limitations

1. Limited flexibility: Despite the advantage of automatic summarization, it does come with certain drawbacks. For example, the output tends to be somewhat generic, making it difficult for users to drill down into specific details and find just the right nuggets.

2. Subjectivity and Vagueness: The primary limitation of text summarization lies in its ability to retain subjectivity and vagueness in the original text. Many summaries fail to portray the whole picture of the original text, leading to misunderstandings and even attacks.

3. Formality: Today’s average person spends upwards of two years acquiring the skills needed to produce good summaries. However, many professional writers still struggle to deliver quality, precise writing despite years of practice. Providing clear guidelines and best practices could greatly aid the industry in achieving better outcomes in the coming years.

# 3.Core Algorithmic Principles & Operations
## Introduction to Abstractive Summarization
Abstractive summarization is a type of text summarization technique that generates a concise version of a given piece of text by removing unnecessary or irrelevant parts while retaining the core meaning and ideas. Instead of simply copying key passages from the original text, abstractive summarization focuses on identifying the most representative bits and phrases that represent the gist of the text. Abstractive summarizers utilize linguistic and statistical techniques to derive new sentences and phrases based on similarities between the words in the text. 

Several variants of abstractive summarization exist, including extractive and extractive-abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization involves extracting key sentences from the text while ignoring irrelevant or redundant information. Extractive-abstractive summarization combines the benefits of both approaches by first utilizing pattern matching and clustering algorithms to identify common topics across the text, followed by using sequence-to-sequence models to construct summaries that bridge gaps between identified clusters. 

Recently, there has been growing interest in applying deep learning to abstractive summarization. Two promising models, Pointer-Generator Networks (Seq2seq-PGN) and Transformer-based models (T5), have demonstrated impressive performance on standard benchmarks. Seq2seq-PGN generates the summary using a seq2seq model, but adds pointer mechanism to selectively copy relevant portions of the text. T5 consists of encoder and decoder modules that act as separate stacks of self-attention layers. Its architecture is designed specifically for text summarization and is trained on a massive corpus of data. Overall, both models demonstrate great promise for abstractive summarization, especially in the realm of modern transformer-based models that employ attention mechanisms.

Other variants of abstractive summarization techniques include query-focused summarization, which relies on queries extracted from the original text to focus on important aspects of the text. Cluster-driven summarization explores the concept of clusters in natural language processing, grouping similar sentences together and identifying a central point that represents the entire cluster. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods optimize for generating fluent and informative summaries by playing against a reinforcement learning agent that learns to balance between relevance and fluency criteria. Variational autoencoder (VAE)-based methods encode the text into a low-dimensional space, allowing for efficient generation of candidate sentences. Overall, abstractive summarization remains a challenging yet promising research direction in the NLP community.
