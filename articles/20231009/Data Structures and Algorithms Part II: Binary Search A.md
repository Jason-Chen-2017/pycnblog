## Overview of Binary Search Algorithm

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list or array with O(log n) time complexity. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. At each step, it compares the middle element of the remaining interval to the target value, deciding whether to eliminate one of the halves based on the comparison result. The binary search algorithm can be implemented recursively or iteratively using loops or recursion. 

The basic idea behind the binary search algorithm is that we divide the search space into two parts at each iteration. If the desired element is found in the first part, then we discard the second part; if not, we repeat the process with the relevant portion of the search space until either the desired element is found or the search space has been reduced to zero elements.

In this article, we will focus on understanding how binary search works, analyzing its efficiency, and applying it to real-world problems such as searching for a given number in a sorted array. We will also discuss some other applications of binary search, including finding duplicates and solving equations involving variables. Finally, we will talk about some common pitfalls and limitations of the binary search algorithm, as well as techniques for optimizing its performance. 

## Problem Definition

Given a sorted array `arr[]` and a key value `x`, you need to write code to find the index position where the key value `x` occurs in the array. If the key value does not exist in the array, return -1. Please note that the input array may contain duplicate values and should work efficiently even when there are many duplicates. Therefore, our solution should have logarithmic time complexity.

For example:

```python
Input: arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40], x = 10
Output: 3

Input: arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40], x = 7
Output: -1
```

## Approach

We can use binary search to solve this problem. In general, the approach involves comparing the midpoint of the subarray with the key value `x`. Here's how it works:

1. Start with a high and low pointer initialized to the beginning and end of the array respectively.
2. While the pointers haven't crossed over yet (i.e., while low <= high), do the following:
    * Calculate the middle index of the current subarray (`mid = floor((low + high)/2)`).
    * Compare the value at `arr[mid]` with the key value `x`:
        * If they are equal, return the index `mid`. 
        * If `arr[mid] < x`, move the left pointer `low = mid + 1` to exclude the right half of the array.
        * Otherwise, move the right pointer `high = mid - 1` to exclude the left half of the array. 
3. If the loop ends without finding the key value, return `-1`.

Here's the Python implementation of this approach:<|im_sep|>|>im_sep<|im_sep|>

# Iterative Solution

def binarySearchIterative(arr, x):

    # initialize the low and high pointers
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    # iterate until the pointers cross over
    while low <= high:
        
        # calculate the middle index
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # compare the value at the middle index with the key value
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        
        # if the value at the middle index is less than the key value,
        # move the left pointer to the right side of the middle index
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
            
        # otherwise, move the right pointer to the left side of the middle index
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    # if the loop ends without finding the key value, return -1
    return -1

# Testing the function
print(binarySearchIterative([2, 3, 4, 10, 40], 10))   # Output: 3
print(binarySearchIterative([2, 3, 4, 10, 40], 7))    # Output: -1<|im_sep|>|>im_sep|>
