# 1.背景介绍



Streamlit is a popular library used for building interactive web applications in Python. It offers powerful features such as data visualization and machine learning model training without writing any HTML or JavaScript code. In this article, we will learn how to create an interactive widget using the streamlit library in Python. 

We assume that you have basic knowledge of Python programming language and some experience in creating websites and web applications using HTML and CSS. If you are new to these topics, please refer to other resources available online before continuing with our tutorial.

This article assumes that the reader has at least a good understanding of the following concepts:

1. Basic scripting and coding skills
2. Some familiarity with the concept of widgets and components in UI design and development
3. Familiarity with key terms like API, HTTP requests, JSON, Markdown, GitHub, Heroku, and Docker

Let’s get started!

# 2.Core Concepts and Contact

Before diving into specific technical details, let us first understand what exactly do we mean by “interactive”? Is it just the ability to manipulate input values on the screen itself or can it also involve functionality related to changing content dynamically based on user interactions?

Among various use cases where one might want to make their software application interactive, here are three main categories: 

1. Data Visualization - The primary purpose of data visualization is to present information visually in order to extract insights from it. It allows users to compare, analyze, and discover patterns within large amounts of data. 
2. Machine Learning Model Training - This category involves creating models that can predict outcomes based on input data. By doing so, it enables users to automate common tasks and reduce manual effort involved in repetitive work.
3. Automated Bots/Scripts - This category encompasses automated scripts that perform various actions based on certain conditions. They help improve efficiency, increase productivity, and save time spent on routine activities.

Now that we know what kind of interaction we are looking to build, let's dive deep into the core concepts behind the streamlit library.

The fundamental unit of a streamlit app is called a component. A component is essentially a self-contained piece of code that renders a particular element on the page, such as a chart or a text box. Components come in different types, ranging from simple buttons to complex charts and graphs. Each type of component provides its own set of properties and methods that allow developers to customize them according to their needs. For example, buttons accept labels, colors, and sizes as inputs, while line charts provide options for setting axis limits and markers.

Widgets are another important concept in streamlit apps. Widgets are simply UI elements that enable users to interact with the program. They consist of input fields (such as text boxes), checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, sliders, etc., depending on the desired behavior. When users modify the value of a widget, they trigger events that update the output of the corresponding component on the page. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider which component should be associated with each widget to ensure seamless integration between the two.

Together, components and widgets form the basis of streamlit apps, making it easy to create high-quality, customizable interfaces with ease. With proper planning and attention to detail, streamlit apps can achieve impressive feats of interactivity.

# 3. Core Algorithm and Operations

In this section, we will look closely at how the streamlit framework works under the hood. We will focus more specifically on the algorithmic side of things rather than discussing all the nitty gritty details. Let's begin.

## Web Server Architecture
When we run a streamlit script, the system creates a local web server that serves up the application. The web server listens for incoming HTTP requests coming from your browser and sends back responses containing the generated HTML and JavaScript code. Here's a simplified version of how it works:


As you can see above, there is a single process running on your computer hosting both the web server and your streamlit application. All requests made to the website are handled by this same process. As long as your streamlit script remains active, the web server will continue serving your app to your browser. However, if you shut down the script, the web server will stop serving the app until you restart it manually.

Each request comes in through an HTTP method, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, or TRACE. When the request arrives, the server parses the URL path to determine which component of the app to render. For instance, if the requested URL is `http://localhost:8501/my_component`, the server would load the `my_component` component. Based on the requested method, the server may send data to the client in the response body, headers, status codes, cookies, or WebSocket connections.

Once the server has determined which component to serve up, it searches for its definition inside the streamlit script file. If found, it executes the code inside the function decorated by `@st.cache`. This way, the execution result of the function is cached and reused whenever the same arguments occur again. This significantly improves performance since the execution of expensive operations is not repeated every time a user refreshes the page.

Finally, when the execution of the component function completes, the server serializes the return value using JSON and returns it to the client. The client then uses this data to update the state of the rendered component, either replacing existing content or updating only the necessary parts of it.

Overall, the web server architecture makes it possible to execute arbitrary Python code securely and efficiently, even on very resource-constrained systems. Since most modern browsers limit CPU usage, memory consumption, and network bandwidth, optimizing the rendering speed and reducing unnecessary computations is crucial for achieving optimal responsiveness across a range of devices. Moreover, thanks to the built-in caching mechanism, reusing results of computationally intensive functions becomes almost free.
