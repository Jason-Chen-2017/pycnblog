# 1.背景介绍


This article discusses the surprising fact that top deep learning competitions don't have to generate any significant profit for their sponsors or organizers. The author looks into several major deep learning competitions such as Kaggle, CIFAR-10 competition in Computer Vision (CV) and ImageNet challenge for image classification in CV, etc., from both a technical perspective and an economic point of view, to analyze why these competitions are succeeding despite the lack of any financial reward. Specifically, we will focus on analyzing the results obtained by teams who participated in the following competitions:

1. MNIST Digit Recognizer - Handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is a beginner-level competition and used to assess the ability of participants to build CNN models with high accuracy and learn various techniques like regularization, dropout, batch normalization, etc., while also exploring practical issues like overfitting and label noise. 

2. Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Large Digit Classification Challenge. SVHN is a large dataset containing more than 30 million labeled images of handwritten digits. It was proposed as part of the suite of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Database 19 and was held at ILSVRC 2011 in Lausanne, Switzerland. In this competition, teams had to design algorithms to automatically recognize digits drawn in real world images.  

3. Traffic Sign Recognition System (TSRS). TSRS was originally designed as a vision challenge at ICCV 2015. It featured signboards from different cities around the world which required them to classify signs accurately based on visual features extracted from the images provided. Teams were free to use whatever frameworks they wanted, including OpenCV and TensorFlow, but were required to implement a system capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset. 

In all three cases above, there were no specific rules regarding the payment of prizes, beyond offering cash prizes for winning teams. However, some online communities offer discounts or swag for winners, leading to significant profits for sponsors. As one data point, during the first half of 2021, Kaggle offered prizes of $500USD, $1,000USD, $2,000USD for each successful team, depending upon their performance in the corresponding competition. While many researchers believe that deep learning can enable accurate predictions, sustainable production, and personalized assistance, it has not been proven yet through competing successfully on challenging tasks. Nonetheless, there seems to be a general trend towards building better systems and playing more meaningful games, making it essential for companies today to invest time and resources in developing machine learning solutions. 

We propose that organizations should carefully consider how they allocate resources amongst multiple tasks and activities within an organization to ensure a balanced budget allocation, regardless of whether the end goal is generating profits or advancing the mission of the organization. Moreover, we need to make sure that sponsors are aware of the potential impacts of the success of deep learning competitions, so that they can tailor rewards to maximize the long-term benefit of their investment. Overall, it's critical for organizations to embrace AI technologies in ways that support its mission, without compromising core business operations.

## 2.1. Deep Learning Competition
A deep learning competition is typically designed to assess the skill level and problem-solving abilities of individuals, while providing structured challenges that require advanced machine learning skills and methods. Competitions help to evaluate candidates' practical proficiency in handling complex datasets, solving real-world problems, and demonstrating the knowledge necessary to work effectively in a fast-paced environment. There are two main types of deep learning competitions:

1. Competitive programming contests where students write programs against fixed test cases to solve programming questions related to computer science topics like algorithms, data structures, operating systems, databases, web development, etc. These contests usually involve scoring points, which are rewarded according to correctness of program output, execution time, memory usage, error messages, etc.

2. Machine learning competitions where trained models are tested on a well-defined task, often with publicly available evaluation criteria. Teams are ranked based on their performance and may receive prizes if they outperform other competitors or complete a final tournament stage.

## 2.2. Profitability of Deep Learning Competitions
Deep learning competitions generally provide financial benefits to the winners. Prizes are typically paid out in different forms depending on the size of the sponsorship and number of participants. Sponsors could choose between the following four options:

1. Pay per submission: In this option, the winner receives a monetary amount only after completing a certain number of submissions to the leaderboard. For example, the best model submitted to the MNIST Digit Recognizer competition earns a set price when it completes five successful submissions.

2. Pay per correct prediction: Similar to the previous option, the winner receives a monetary amount only once they achieve a predetermined level of accuracy on the test set. For instance, during the SVHN Large Digit Classification Challenge, the team receiving highest accuracy gets rewarded.

3. Pay per sample evaluated: Alternatively, the winner receives a monetary amount after evaluating a certain number of samples or datapoints in the training set. This option could be beneficial for tasks where small errors lead to significant decreases in accuracy, such as natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis or text categorization.

4. Fixed reward pool: Some competitions allow sponsors to set up a fixed reward pool and assign portions of it to particular categories or groups of winners based on their performance in the competition. For example, Google Research’s AlphaStar family of machine learning bots won millions of dollars in a recent competition called DeepMind Dota 2.

While traditional job offers also pay a salary after performing a certain number of tasks, deep learning competitions do not require strict rules on the payment of prizes. Furthermore, some online communities offer promotions and swags for winners that can lead to significant profits. Lastly, some organizers even include special benefits or discounts for those who qualify certain criteria like working with a partner company or being a member of a particular team.
