## 2.1 Trust and Intelligence
Trust is a fundamental concept that refers to the ability of an agent (e.g., a person or organization) to recognize other agents’ behavior or actions without questioning their motives or intentions. It enables individuals and organizations to establish reciprocal trust and understand each other’s point of view. The objective of building trust is not only for personal gain but also to build long-term relationships within an ecosystem.
Intelligence is defined as the capability of making sophisticated decisions based on evidence and reasoning abilities such as problem solving, logical reasoning, and statistical analysis. In recent years, artificial intelligence has become increasingly important in various fields such as finance, healthcare, security, transportation, and others. However, many people do not fully understand its capabilities and limitations due to the complexity and versatility of its algorithms.
To bridge the gap between these two concepts, we can define trustworthiness as follows: "trustworthiness is the degree of belief by one entity in another entity's judgment." Thus, it involves both knowledge and attitude towards an AI system.
Now let us move on to explain what exactly does 'believes' mean when talking about trust. When two entities communicate with each other, they may feel uncertain whether they are really communicating with each other. This uncertainty might be because of several reasons, including misunderstanding, confusion, ambiguity, mistrust, bias, and unintended negative effects on the relationship. In this case, there could be multiple ways to resolve the issue, including agreeing to compromise on some points, using different terminologies, accepting responsibility for disagreements, and so forth. But ultimately, even if no mutually beneficial exchange occurs, at least the entities would still want to build stronger bonds through trust. So, how can an AI system create trust? Well, here are some steps involved:

1. Communication: A reliable communication channel must exist between the parties in order to establish trust. This means that all relevant information should be exchanged in a timely manner and thoroughly discussed before any action is taken. For example, messages should include clear instructions, details, and examples, which will help ensure that the recipient understands the message. 

2. Clarity: Clear communication ensures that all participants have the same understanding of the situation and what each party wants from the other side. This allows them to come up with solutions together while avoiding conflicts and distractions. For instance, if one participant thinks something is wrong, they can ask questions to clarify what led to it. If someone doubts the credibility of an AI model, they can get clarification on why they believe that it was used.

3. Relevance: Information presented should be relevant to the conversation. People who work closely with the AI system should always stay updated with new developments, techniques, and technologies related to AI. They need to know where the AI system fits into the overall landscape of technology trends and opportunities. By doing so, they can make better business decisions regarding investment in the field.

4. Authenticity: Participants should believe that the other side is genuine and truthful. Any claim made should be supported by solid evidence and factual data. This helps prevent false impressions and reduce the risk of manipulation.

5. Empathy: Participants should care deeply about each other's needs and concerns. As partners, we should listen to our partner's voice rather than trying to control them. We should treat everyone equally regardless of their background, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, etc. Empathy is essential to building trust because it provides a way for two parties to empathize with each other's emotional states, challenges, and frustrations.

6. Compassion: Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness. Even if someone feels powerless over another person's actions, they should try to express their feelings in a positive way. Using humor and creativity can also promote trust. With more compassion, people tend to persevere and eventually achieve greater levels of trust.

7. Integrity: To maintain a level of trust, participants must demonstrate integrity throughout every interaction. While participating in conversations and interactions, participants must remain responsible and ethical, upholding principles of honesty, non-discrimination, and fairness. This demonstrates that they are being fair to themselves and taking full responsibility for their actions.

8. Respect: Although individualism and selfishness can sometimes lead to conflict, respec is crucial to maintaining trust. At times, the AI system may take advantage of human rights laws or policies to protect human lives and property. In such cases, the AI product should be transparent about such issues and clearly show users what rights it owns and considers important. Finally, it is worth noting that creating trust requires patience and understanding. No matter how much effort is put into building trust, things can go wrong in real life and people often need to step down or withdraw from engagement altogether.
