# 1.背景介绍


Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique where multiple models are trained and their outputs are combined to improve predictions accuracy. In this article, I will explain some commonly used methods for handling label noise in ensemble learning. 

Label noise refers to data points with incorrect or incomplete labels, which occurs when there exists errors in data collection, human error, or other unforseen circumstances. Label noise has several types:

1. Missing Labels (ML): A point without any assigned class label, indicating that it should not be included in training. This type of noise usually happens because one or more classes were excluded during preprocessing or feature extraction, but should have been included at runtime. 

2. Anomaly Values (AV): Points with unexpected values that differ significantly from the rest of the distribution, making them hard to classify accurately. Common examples include outliers or deviations above or below certain thresholds. AV often arises due to sensor failures, hardware malfunctions, or natural variation in data generation process.

3. Mislabeled Examples (ME): Data points with different true labels than those originally provided by the dataset owner. Examples could come from adversarial attacks or model errors causing misclassification.

To handle label noise, two main approaches exist:

1. Training-based Approach: The idea behind this approach is to train individual models on clean labeled data without noise, then integrate them into an ensemble using various combination techniques like majority vote or bagging. During testing time, noisy labels are replaced by the predicted probabilities obtained from each member of the ensemble.

2. Ensemble-based Approach: Another method involves treating label noise as additional instances within the original dataset itself. For example, if we observe an AV in our test set and want to replace it with a new instance with known label, we can add it to the training set alongside its correct counterpart(s). However, this approach requires careful design to ensure that added instances do not increase overfitting or bias the final performance of the ensemble.

In summary, both these approaches help us handle label noise while ensuring high performance and generalization capabilities of the resulting ensemble. However, training based approach takes much longer compared to ensemble-based approach since it involves retraining multiple models on clean data repeatedly. We also need to take care while choosing appropriate combination techniques depending upon nature of the problem and available resources. Finally, evaluating the quality of the ensemble's results depends upon metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and so on. Therefore, selecting suitable evaluation metrics becomes critical before deploying the ensemble system in real-world scenarios.

In conclusion, handling label noise effectively in ensemble learning helps reduce the impact of noise and improves overall performance. There exist many techniques that can be used to handle label noise depending upon the nature of the problem and available resources. It is essential to select appropriate methods and evaluate the performance of the ensemble after deployment to make sure it performs well under different conditions.

## 2.1 What Is Ensemble Learning? 
Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple models to improve predictive performance. The goal is to create a meta-model that combines the decisions of several sub-models to achieve better accuracy. Ensemble learning has three main components:

1. Models: These are the individual algorithms or models that we combine to form an ensemble. They must be accurate enough to give reasonable estimates of the target variable.

2. Combination Techniques: These are mathematical operations performed on the output vectors of all the base learners to obtain a single result vector. Three common combination techniques are:

   - Voting (majority voting): Each prediction is casted as positive if it receives a majority number of votes among the members of the ensemble.
   
   - Bagging (bootstrap aggregation): Randomly sampling datasets with replacement from the original dataset creates multiple bootstrap samples. Then, each member learns on each bootstrapped sample separately and the final decision is made based on the aggregated outcomes.
   
   - Boosting (sequential learning): In boosting, each member learns on the previous ones' mistakes and tries to minimize the total error rate. The algorithm focuses on reducing the weight of wrongly classified instances instead of simply ignoring them.
   
3. Meta Model: The meta-learner is the model that integrates the decisions of the base learners to produce the final result. The most popular meta-learners are random forests and gradient boosting machines.

In summary, ensemble learning is a powerful technique that combines the decisions of multiple models to achieve higher accuracy. It uses various combination techniques like bagging, boosting, and voting to construct an accurate and robust predictor. 

## 2.2 Types Of Label Noise And How To Handle Them?
There are three types of label noise: 

1. Missing Labels: These are instances without any assigned class label, indicating that they should not be included in training. The solution to handle missing labels is simple. We can either exclude these instances from training or assign them a special label like “noisy” during inference time. 

2. Anomaly Values: These are instances with unexpected values that differ significantly from the rest of the distribution, making them hard to classify accurately. Common examples include outliers or deviations above or below certain thresholds. AV often arises due to sensor failures, hardware malfunctions, or natural variation in data generation process. One way to handle anomaly values is to use isolation forest, a nonparametric anomaly detection method.

3. Mislabeled Examples: These are data points with different true labels than those originally provided by the dataset owner. Examples could come from adversarial attacks or model errors causing misclassification. One way to handle mislabeled examples is to modify the loss function used during training phase to penalize misclassifications heavily. We can even augment the training set by adding similar but slightly perturbed versions of the same input/label pairs.

In summary, identifying the type of label noise present in the data can greatly affect the performance of ensemble models. Handling missing labels ensures that the classifier doesn't get biased towards the minority class, while anomaly values require specialized solutions to identify and remove outliers from the dataset. Finally, modifying the loss function to penalize misclassifications would potentially cause the model to ignore helpful features that distinguish between correctly and incorrectly classified examples.
