# 1.背景介绍


Mangrove swarms are the dominant species in freshwater wetlands worldwide, providing habitats for a wide range of marine organisms including fish and plankton. However, mangrove growth is characterized by complex life cycle processes that can lead to environmental damage and abiotic stressors, such as ocean acidification and temperature extremes. To understand these mechanisms, we need to identify how different factors affect mangrove development and interact with each other, and their role in mediating the effects of warming or changing water conditions on mangrove populations. This will provide valuable information for conservation planning, restoration efforts and future management strategies for deepwater mangroves. 

In this paper, we will explore the various mechanisms involved in causing damage to mangroves due to abiotic stresses, which include biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors can cause damage through anthropogenic disturbance, while abiotic factors include changes in light levels, wind patterns and temperatures that result in increased water salinity and turbidity that can trigger pore-wetting conditions leading to erosion, altering nutrient cycling and dislodging mangrove tissue. The interplay between these factors has been shown to impact ecosystem functioning and productivity across a diversity of taxa, from benthic consumers like plankton to terrestrial pests and pathogens. Therefore, understanding the interactions between these abiotic factors and biology at the local, regional and global scales is crucial to developing effective responses. 

Our objective is to review key research findings related to biotic and abiotic factors that influence mangrove development and ecological functioning, and synthesize them into an integrated framework for better predicting outcomes under different conditions and managing risk in mangrove systems. Specifically, we aim to: 

1) Identify the importance of physical and chemical factors in influencing mangrove development, particularly at sub-tidal scales, using a combination of field observations, experimental studies, model simulations, and theoretical analysis;

2) Quantitatively assess the magnitude and direction of potential impacts caused by increasing salinity and turbidity on mangrove communities globally;

3) Develop improved methods to manage mangrove forests that are sensitive to warming and changing climates, specifically targeting areas where mangrove population structure and functioning needs to be restored;

4) Develop robust predictions tools that leverage ecological data to inform decision making and resource allocation for mitigating abiotic stressors and enhance community resilience. 

Overall, our goal is to contribute new insights to knowledge about mechanisms of organismic damage and abiotic stresses induced by deepwater mangrove swarms, thereby enabling more effective management options for mangrove ecosystems around the globe.

## 2.1 概念
### Mangrove (Hibiscus spp.)
Mangroves are small (~5cm diameter), burrowing plant plants in the forested eastern hemisphere of the Earth's surface that cover approximately half of all the land covered by mangrove forests (as of 2019). There are two main types of mangrove forests: scarps (also known as dune-formations) and bands (also known as shellfish grasslands). Scarp-formations have many narrow channels in which mosses grow, whereas band-formations tend to produce larger, open grasslands that allow deposition of fine sediments and organic matter. Both mangrove trees and shrubs can host fungi and other animals, while algae and bacteria are also common reservoirs of nutrients and protective microbes. Some mangrove forests contain hillsides, which offer opportunities for rare bird species and nesting sites for migratory birds.

### Depression
A depression is a thin layer of rock or soil raised above a landscape surface, commonly used to help control flow of water, ice, or other fluids. When a depression forms in response to changes in elevation or moisture, it can severely impair the natural functions of nearby vegetation and human health. Desertification, glacier retreat, and climate change have driven the rapid expansion of coastal depressions, creating regions known as "glacier margins". Despite their importance, however, little is known about the physiographic controls on mangrove formation and damage, particularly in the face of extreme sea-level rise, high-water marks, and elevated temperatures experienced during the summer months.
