# 1.背景介绍


As for choosing a machine learning method or algorithm to solve a particular problem, there are many options available. There are several machine learning algorithms that can be used, such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, k-means clustering, and so on. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages compared to others. To choose one from these options is not an easy task because each algorithm may suit different scenarios better than others. Therefore, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm before making a final choice.
Two popular machine learning methods in supervised learning are classification and regression. Let’s take a closer look at these two categories:

1. Classification: This involves predicting the class label of a given input data point based on labeled training examples. It attempts to learn a mapping function between inputs and outputs by using various algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, and Naive Bayes. The main goal of this method is to classify new instances into predefined classes based on prior knowledge or past data. Here are some key points about classification:

    - Supervised Learning: A classification algorithm needs labeled training data to learn how to map input features to output labels.
    - Probability Distribution: When we use a probability distribution over multiple classes for classification, we can compute the likelihood of observing the observed data under the assumption that each class is generated by a distinct underlying probability distribution.
    - Overfitting Problem: If our model becomes too complex with respect to the amount of training data, then it will start to memorize the training set instead of generalizing well to unseen data. This leads to poor performance on test data and reduced accuracy. We need to address this issue through regularization techniques like cross-validation, early stopping, or dropout regularization.
    - Non-linear Decision Boundaries: For non-linear datasets, linear classifiers like logistic regression cannot produce good results. However, nonlinear classifiers like support vector machines (SVM) can learn complex non-linear decision boundaries that are highly flexible and resistant to overfitting.
    
2. Regression: Regression analysis aims to find relationships between independent variables (predictors) and dependent variables (outcomes). The goal is to identify patterns that exist within the dataset and to create a mathematical equation that best explains the relationship between the variables. Some common regression models include linear regression, polynomial regression, and time series analysis. Linear regression assumes that the outcome variable depends linearly on the predictor variables. Polynomial regression adds higher powers of predictor variables to capture non-linear relationships. Time series analysis models help us analyze changes over time. Here are some key points about regression:
    
    - Unsupervised Learning: Regression problems don’t require any labeled data to train their models since they aim to find relationships between variables without any pre-defined outcomes.
    - Simple Assumptions: Regression models assume that the relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable follows a simple linear pattern. However, this does not always hold true due to the presence of noise and other factors.
    - Correlation Between Variables: We should check if there exists correlation between the predictor variables to avoid multi-colinearity which would cause instability in the solution. Also, we can use feature selection techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression to select only relevant features.
    - Error Metrics: We can measure the error between predicted values and actual values using commonly used metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or root mean square error (RMSE). RMSE is often more interpretable than MSE as it gives us an idea of how far off our predictions were on average.
    
Based on the above definitions, we have a clear understanding of both classification and regression algorithms and their differences. Now let's talk about when to use each algorithm.

# 2.核心概念与联系
Let's now dive deeper into the core concepts behind supervised and unsupervised learning. These concepts provide a solid foundation for understanding both types of algorithms. 

1. Data: Data refers to a collection of information obtained from sensors, logs, images, videos, etc., and represents the independent variables (features) that influence the outcome variable (label).

2. Training Dataset: The training dataset contains all the input-output pairs used during the training phase of a model. It consists of the observations where the correct answer is known. The objective of the training process is to learn a function that maps input features to output labels. During the training process, the model makes a series of iterations updating itself until convergence or until certain conditions are met.

3. Testing Dataset: Once the model has been trained successfully, it needs to be tested on a separate testing dataset to evaluate its performance. This helps us determine whether the model has learned correctly and is able to make accurate predictions on previously unseen data.

4. Model Parameters: The parameters of a model refer to the numerical values associated with each input feature that affect the output prediction. These parameters change as the model learns to adapt to the specific data being processed.

5. Hyperparameters: Hyperparameters are additional parameters that are tuned during the training process. They control the behavior of the optimization algorithm used during the training process. Examples of hyperparameters for a classification model might include the number of hidden layers in a neural network, the learning rate for gradient descent optimization, and the value of the regularization parameter used in penalized logistic regression.

6. Loss Function: The loss function measures the difference between the predicted and actual values of the output label. Different loss functions are used depending on the type of problem being solved (classification vs. regression).

7. Optimization Algorithm: An optimization algorithm determines the procedure used to update the model parameters towards minimizing the loss function. Popular optimization algorithms include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), mini-batch gradient descent, and Adam optimizer.

8. Regularization Techniques: Regularization techniques add constraints to the loss function to prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model. Common regularization techniques include L1/L2 penalty, dropout regularization, and early stopping.
