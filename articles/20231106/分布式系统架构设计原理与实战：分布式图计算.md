# 1.背景介绍


Graph computing is a significant paradigm shift in the way we approach processing and analyzing complex networks of data. While graph theory was originally used for solving mathematical problems, it has since evolved into an essential tool for dealing with real-world applications such as social media analysis or routing algorithms in computer networks. Graph computing offers numerous advantages over traditional relational database management systems, including ease of scaling to large graphs, scalability across multiple nodes, ability to handle highly interconnected data sets, and support for dynamic queries. However, there are also some challenges when applying graph computations in distributed environments. In this article, we will discuss these challenges and provide solutions to them using techniques such as parallelism, fault tolerance, and load balancing. We will focus on how to apply graph computation models on massive datasets that span multiple compute nodes and how to design efficient architectures for high availability and scalability. We will explore practical examples from industry and research settings along with case studies that illustrate the utility of graph computing technology. 

In summary, we will introduce the fundamental concepts behind graph computing, explain its key benefits and challenges, identify best practices for deploying graph computations on distributed platforms, and demonstrate how graph computations can be applied in various scenarios ranging from industrial engineering to scientific modeling. The reader should gain a deeper understanding of the unique challenges faced by developers working in the field of graph computing and how to overcome them through careful planning and implementation. Additionally, he/she will have hands-on experience implementing advanced algorithms like PageRank, Label Propagation, Diffusion Centrality, and community detection, which are critical components of many popular graph analytics tools.

## 2.1 网络模型
Graph theory provides a powerful framework for representing and manipulating complex networks of entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). These network structures can represent any type of relationship between objects, including people, organizations, and even physical objects like machines and vehicles. There are several different types of networks, each with its own characteristics:

 - **Undirected graph**: An undirected graph represents all possible connections between nodes regardless of directionality. This means that if node A is connected to node B, then node B can be considered connected to node A as well. This makes it easy to analyze the overall connectivity of the network and allows for easier visualization of the interactions between nodes. Examples include social networks, road maps, web pages, transportation networks, and biological pathways.

 - **Directed graph**: A directed graph only represents one direction of the connection between nodes. For example, in a telephone network, one phone number may lead directly to another without going back to the originating phone number. Directed graphs are commonly used to model communication channels where information moves in one direction, such as email messages, instant messaging, or news articles.

 - **Weighted graph**: A weighted graph assigns weights or costs to the edges connecting nodes. This allows us to describe the importance, distance, or duration of the links between nodes. It's important to note that edge weights do not need to be numerical values; they can also represent qualitative attributes such as sentiment scores or keywords. Weights play a crucial role in determining which paths are most likely to result in the fastest or shortest routes in a network.

 - **Multi-graph**: A multi-graph allows for multiple simultaneous edges between two nodes. This can occur when there are multiple paths available to reach a particular destination. Common examples include air traffic control systems and navigation software. Multi-graphs can also capture bidirectional relationships among nodes, which can make certain tasks more challenging.

## 2.2 模型演进
### 2.2.1 Hyperlink graph
The earliest known form of a network was a hyperlink map, which represented the interconnection of HTML documents on the World Wide Web. Each document contained references to other documents that were linked together. Graphs based on hyperlinks offered a natural way to model relationships between websites, but they suffered from severe limitations due to the sheer size and complexity of the Internet.

### 2.2.2 Social Network Analysis (SNA)
In 1977, Barabasi and Albertson published a paper called "Emergence of scaling in random networks". They proposed a theoretical model for growing scale-free networks and showed that such networks often exhibit properties such as clustering coefficient and degree distribution similar to those found in real-world social networks. Based on this observation, SNA became a prominent area of research in social sciences until the early 2000s. Today, it is still widely used to study large-scale social networks.

### 2.2.3 Theoretical foundation for network science
Network science offers a rich source of both empirical insights and theorems about network structure, dynamics, and functions. Understanding the principles underlying network growth, topology, and function can help us build better predictors, preventative measures, and recommendations for managing complex networks. Especially interesting are theories of random graph generation, which offer a basic benchmark against which to measure other network models and understand their tradeoffs.
