# 1.背景介绍

  
Agricultural automation technologies are one of the most significant innovations that have been brought about by digital transformation over the past few years. They offer several benefits to both agricultural industry as well as society at large. However, it is also essential to note that they are still in their infancy stage, with many challenges yet to be overcome before they can be widely adopted across different sectors of the economy. 

In this article, we will explore how technology-enabled manufacturing processes such as precision agriculture and smart farming have transformed the way industries work today. We will discuss various applications of these technologies in terms of improving productivity, reducing costs, addressing environmental concerns and increasing profitability for farmers. Specifically, we will focus on how Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming have impacted farms throughout the world and what steps need to be taken towards their implementation globally.  

To provide better insights into the complexities involved in implementing these technologies, we will highlight certain key features that make them more effective than traditional methods. For instance, compared to manual fertilizer application, Precision Agriculture offers higher yield per hectare and reduces labor cost significantly while ensuring consistent quality levels. Similarly, Smart Farming provides adaptive management of resources, which not only saves time but also improves crop yields and enables crops to adapt to changing weather conditions and soil conditions.

Lastly, although these technologies have been gaining traction within the agricultural sector, there remains a lack of widespread adoption among governments, banks, insurance companies and other stakeholders alike. This article aims to provide an overview of these technologies and present them in a pragmatic and accessible manner, so that they can be easily understood and implemented by a wide range of people around the world. 

2.核心概念与联系
Precision Agriculture (PA): PA refers to the use of advanced sensors, algorithms and machine learning techniques to improve yield, reduce costs and enhance productivity through precise fertilizing and irrigation control in agricultural fields. The goal of PA is to achieve greater yields without compromising quality, thus promoting organic farming practices that produce healthier products and lower prices for consumers.

Smart Farming: SMART stands for Sustainable Management, Adaptive Resourcing, Technology and Agronomic Techniques. It refers to using new technologies to optimize efficiency and increase production, ensure sustainability, manage water and nutrients effectively and efficiently, address climate change and enable adaptation to changing landscapes and environments. By applying SMART principles, farmers can save money, improve productivity and enhance profitability.

The two technologies mentioned above complement each other to provide a holistic approach towards achieving improved outcomes in agriculture. PA employs advanced sensors and algorithms that analyze the field conditions and predict optimal fertilization regimes based on patterns of rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, etc., while SMART uses IoT devices like drones or hybrid vertical farms to monitor the actual performance of growing operations and adjust the plant layout accordingly. These tools are designed to minimize wastage, maximize output and promote consistency in harvests, leading to increased profits and reduced labour costs.

3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

Precision Agriculture involves three main components - image processing, signal processing and pattern recognition. Image Processing involves analyzing images captured from remote sensing platforms and mapping the characteristics of the vegetation to identify areas where crops need improvement. Signal Processing involves detecting abnormal signals, including variations in temperature, humidity, and soil properties, indicating potential issues with the crop growth cycle. Pattern Recognition involves identifying patterns in historical data that indicate trends and determine appropriate actions for future crop varieties.

To implement Precision Agriculture successfully, farmers must collect reliable, accurate and detailed data related to vegetation structure, distribution, crop requirements, and soil characteristics. Data collection should occur throughout the growing season, with careful monitoring and calibration to avoid bias and misinterpretation of information. During the dry season, analysts may choose to deploy automated sprinklers to apply fertilizers automatically according to preset rules. In wetter seasons, the analysts might use remote sensing imaging techniques to capture high-resolution images of the field and extract relevant parameters such as NDVI and LAI for the purposes of planning irrigation schemes.

Once the necessary data has been collected, patterns can be identified through statistical analysis and mathematical models. These models map out relationships between input variables such as temperature and precipitation, soil moisture and relative veg cover, and determine fertilizer recommendations based on predicted results. Models also consider factors such as current rates of nitrogen fixation and phosphorus uptake to account for varying crop requirements. To ensure that the recommendations are practical and feasible given the available resources, analysts typically estimate the costs associated with the fertilizer and plan for revenue generation opportunities.

For example, suppose that the recommended fertilizer level for a particular variety of crop requires a total of 75% N and 25% P, assuming ideal fertility values. Assume that the expected rate of nitrogen fixation is 0.45 kg/ha-yr, and that the expected rate of phosphorous uptake is 0.02 Mg/kg-N-day. Using these assumptions, the model would recommend an initial rate of 95 kg N ha-1 yr-1, adjusted downwards if additional inputs were required due to limited resources. The final rate could then vary depending on other factors such as available soil water capacity, availability of potassium and magnesium sources, and climate conditions.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, Smart Farming entails employing new technologies to optimize the resource allocation process within individual plants. The core idea behind Smart Farming is to leverage novel technologies such as artificial intelligence, computer vision and drone swarms to automate decision-making processes and optimize resource usage. In contrast to manually executing tasks, AI-powered systems require less effort and do not depend on trained personnel. Within each individual plant, the system continuously analyzes its surroundings and identifies best-fit resources for each task.

The technology stack used in Smart Farming includes software infrastructure, cloud computing services, mobile communication networks, sensor nodes, actuators, gateways and edge servers. Each component works together to optimize the overall resource utilization and ensure sustainable agricultural practices. As such, Smart Farming is particularly suitable for small-scale farms where conventional solutions may not be efficient enough.

To implement Smart Farming successfully, businesses must invest in developing software infrastructure, installing sensor nodes and establishing communication links. Additionally, organizations must create strategies to integrate the technology into existing workflows and business processes. Beyond simple automation, Smart Farming encompasses a number of other innovative approaches, such as collecting and storing real-time data for longitudinal analysis and optimizing supply chain efficiency.

Overall, Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming represent significant technological advances that transform the way agricultural practices are performed and contribute greatly to the development of healthy and affordable food for all. Despite the steep learning curve involved in implementing these technologies, they promise to deliver significant benefits to farmers across the globe.
