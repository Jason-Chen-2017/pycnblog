# 1.背景介绍



Today's world is undergoing a digital transformation with the advent of various technologies such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops and cloud computing. One of the popular tools used for data extraction from documents in this age of information overload is PDF. But extracting data from a large number of PDF files manually can be time-consuming and tedious. Therefore, it becomes essential to automate the process of data extraction from PDF files using programming languages like Python. 

In this article we will explore the use of Python library called “Textract” which provides an easy way to extract text and metadata from PDF documents without manual intervention. We will see how to install and use this library on our local machine or on any virtual environment (e.g., Anaconda). 

We will also learn about different functions provided by this library that help us to extract data from the PDF document including getting text content only, tables, images, and structured data. Finally, we will create some sample code snippets and explain each function in detail along with its working principle.

By the end of this article you will be able to implement automated data extraction from PDF files using Python and Textract library.


# 2.Core Concepts and Connection
The core concepts involved in this project are:

1. **PDF:** A portable document format (PDF) is a file format developed by Adobe Systems for managing and displaying electronic documents. It is based on a subset of PostScript language and provides more advanced features than most other document formats.

2. **Python Programming Language**: Python is a high-level interpreted programming language which was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989. It is widely used for developing web applications, scientific computations, artificial intelligence, etc.

3. **Textract Library:** The Textract library is one of the popular libraries available for python developers to extract text and data from pdf documents. This library uses the poppler open source library internally for converting PDF into image and text data and then processes them to get desired output. In order to use this library successfully, make sure to have poppler installed on your system before installing the Textract library. Poppler is a free software that enables rendering of Portable Document Format (PDF) documents. 

4. **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Command line interface refers to the set of commands or instructions given to the computer through keyboard input. CLI allows users to interact with the operating system directly and perform various tasks related to their operations.

5. **Virtual Environment:** Virtual environments provide isolated spaces for Python projects where they can safely store packages and dependencies required for running specific programs without causing conflicts with existing ones. They isolate the development environment and ensure that all the dependencies needed by the program are present and configured correctly. 

Now let’s go over each concept in detail:

1. **PDF** : PDF stands for Portable Document Format. It is a type of document file that consists of text and graphics in a compressed format. These files usually contain color photographs, scanned drawings, or diagrams. PDF files can also include audio clips, videos, and even music notation. When printed out, these files retain their formatting and appearance.

2. **Python Programming Language:** Python is a high level, general purpose, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language. Developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989, Python has become very popular among developers due to its simplicity, elegance and ease of learning. Many modern frameworks and libraries written in Python take advantage of its features like dynamic typing, flexible indentation, and built-in modules like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. There are many resources online to help beginners get started with Python, including books, tutorials, documentation, and community forums.

3. **Textract Library:** Textract is a python library that allows developers to easily extract data from PDF files. Its key features include:

   - Easy installation: Developers do not need to download external libraries separately for this purpose. Instead, they can simply run pip command to install Textract from PyPI repository.
   
   - Supports multiple engines: Textract supports multiple optical character recognition (OCR) engines, which identify and read text embedded within images and pages of PDF files. Currently, it supports the Abbyy OCR API, Google Vision API, Tesseract OCR engine, and Microsoft Computer Vision API. 
   
   - Integration with AWS: Developers can connect Textract library to Amazon Web Services (AWS) for further processing of extracted data, such as sentiment analysis, translation, and natural language understanding.

4. **Command Line Interface (CLI)** : CLI, short for "command line interface," refers to the user interface that presents a command prompt to the user, waits for the user to enter commands, and displays results after executing the commands. CLI simplifies the task of interacting with the operating system since users do not have to switch between different windows or tabs while performing repetitive tasks. Commonly used CLIs include PowerShell on Windows and Terminal on Mac and Linux systems.

5. **Virtual Environment:** Virtual environments allow developers to work on Python projects independently from their global Python installation. They isolate the development environment and prevent package conflicts across multiple projects. With virtual environments, developers can create separate environments for each project, making it easier to manage dependencies and versions.
