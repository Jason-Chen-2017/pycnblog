# 1.背景介绍



Hospital readmission is a serious problem in public healthcare settings. The predicted propensity of an individual to re-enter the hospital after discharge can have significant impact on the patient’s quality of life and financial outcomes. Researchers use predictive analytics tools to identify at risk patients who are likely to return to the hospital and address these issues. However, these systems must be approved by the government as it involves financial transactions that could potentially harm patient safety and security. In recent years, there has been growing interest in commercializing predictive analytics tools to enhance care quality and improve patient outcomes. 

Predictive analytics is widely used in various industries such as banking, insurance, manufacturing, and healthcare industry to optimize processes and decision making. Traditionally, predictive analytics models were built using statistical methods, which included linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines (SVM). These models were trained on historical data to make predictions about future outcomes based on inputs such as demographics, medical history, medications prescribed, procedures performed, lab results, etc. For example, with this information, predictive analytics models could determine the likelihood of a patient returning to the hospital within one year or five years based on their characteristics such as age, gender, race, income level, medical conditions, smoking status, education level, occupation, etc. This approach helped improve resource allocation and ensure timely admission to the hospital.

However, despite the potential benefits of using predictive analytics tools for hospital readmissions, several challenges still need to be addressed before they can be marketed commercially:

1. Approval process: It requires regulatory approval from the relevant government authorities like HIPAA, FDA, NIH, etc., before being able to implement the tool in a clinical setting. Even though some organizations offer consultancy services to help with this process, there are limited resources available globally.

2. Scalability: As the number of patients increases, the model needs to be updated periodically to stay ahead of any new trends. Maintaining high accuracy and consistency is key to ensuring that the tool remains effective. To meet scalability requirements, cloud computing platforms can be leveraged to automate the training and updating process, allowing more people to access the latest insights.

3. Security concerns: Many companies today are concerned about the potential security risks associated with using predictive analytics tools. Patient data collected through the tool should be protected against unauthorized access, misuse, and modification. Additionally, sensitive data such as personal identifiers should be encrypted during transmission and stored securely.

4. Ethics considerations: Because predictive analytics tools involve automated decisions and may lead to severe consequences if not properly evaluated, ethical principles need to be followed. Companies must respect privacy laws, provide transparency into how the tool works, and offer clear guidelines on interpreting its output. Finally, researchers must demonstrate why the tool is accurate and reliable so stakeholders can trust them. 

5. User experience: As predictive analytics tools become increasingly complex, user interfaces need to be designed thoughtfully to allow non-technical users to interact effectively with the system. Interpreting machine learning algorithms can be challenging, but professional software engineers can create intuitive visualizations and dashboards to simplify analysis.

The article will discuss the different approaches taken by businesses and institutions around predictive analytics and explore how they can leverage cloud computing platforms, big data technologies, and machine learning techniques to build commercialized solutions for hospital readmissions.

## Predictive analytics
Predictive analytics refers to the application of mathematical and statistical modeling techniques to analyze and forecast future outcomes based on current events or input variables. In general, predictive analytics tools use historical data to train a model that can accurately predict future outcomes given certain inputs. Common examples include linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM), among others.

There are three main components involved in building predictive analytics tools: data collection, algorithm development, and deployment/integration. Data collection involves gathering data points related to the prediction target, such as customer behavior patterns, sales records, employee performance ratings, and product usage statistics. Algorithm development takes this dataset and builds a mathematical model that captures patterns and relationships between factors. Once the model is developed, it is then deployed into a production environment where it can be utilized to make predictions. Integration involves integrating the predictive analytics tool with other applications to streamline operations and increase efficiency. For instance, predictive analytics tools can be integrated with scheduling systems to recommend optimal staffing levels to maximize profitability.

To achieve successful marketing campaigns for predictive analytics tools, businesses often follow an approach known as “build – get – buy”. This means starting out with basic functionality, testing it with real customers, then scaling up the solution for mass scale distribution. There are several channels that companies can take advantage of to acquire customers: direct sales, partner programs, webinars, partnerships with other firms, and affiliate marketing.

## Cloud computing platform
Cloud computing is defined as a type of computing where servers are hosted on the internet rather than locally. Using a cloud computing platform allows developers to rent virtual machines instead of owning physical hardware. This makes it easier to deploy applications quickly and cost-effectively, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Popular cloud platforms include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.

One popular service provided by cloud computing platforms is Big Data Infrastructure as a Service (BDIaaS) called Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). This technology provides efficient storage and processing capabilities for large datasets. Businesses can leverage HDFS to store large amounts of data and perform advanced analytics on top of it. For example, businesses can use HDFS to store structured and unstructured data including images, videos, audio files, logs, sensor data, and social media feeds. They can also apply advanced analytics frameworks like Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to run distributed jobs across multiple nodes to extract valuable insights from the data.

Another important aspect of cloud computing platforms is security. Malicious hackers exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses in cloud infrastructure to steal data, damage systems, and cause economic losses. Therefore, security measures are critical for many businesses working with sensitive data. Some common practices include encryption, firewalls, authentication protocols, and logging mechanisms.

Finally, cloud computing platforms are constantly evolving, and businesses need to keep pace with the latest developments to remain competitive. By understanding the fundamentals of predictive analytics and cloud computing, businesses can begin developing robust, affordable solutions to address the unique problems faced by hospitals worldwide.
