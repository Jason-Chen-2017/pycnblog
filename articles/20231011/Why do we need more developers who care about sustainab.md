# 1.背景介绍


The problem of climate change is becoming increasingly serious as the world's temperature increases due to anthropogenic activities such as industrialization and fossil fuel consumption. To limit these effects, governments have made a number of efforts including regulations on emissions, green buildings, recycling, land use policies, etc., but they cannot solve all problems and there still remains uncertainty regarding how long it will take for ecosystems to recover from the damage caused by human activity. Despite the urgency of this issue, many people still view it as unsolvable. 

To address this crisis, researchers have proposed several strategies that can help develop green software systems with increased efficiency and productivity while reducing carbon footprint. One key idea is to design and implement sustainable software practices, which entails using energy-efficient algorithms and optimizing resource usage. However, few professionals are currently willing or able to adopt these practices because it requires significant technical expertise and knowledge across various fields like computer science, engineering, economics, physics, chemistry, and psychology. This situation calls for new talented individuals to join the ranks of developers, who should be willing to invest time and effort into solving complex environmental issues and contribute towards building a more sustainable software industry.

In this article, I will explore why more developers would benefit from joining forces to tackle this important challenge. Let us begin our exploration with some background information:


## Sustainability In General


Sustainability refers to the ability of an ecosystem to persist over time under natural conditions without suffering any adverse impacts from external factors beyond its control. The goal of sustainability is to minimize negative consequences caused by resource scarcity, pollution, and climate change. There are several main components of sustainability such as biocapacity, physical stability, economic viability, social wellbeing, and overall community cohesion. Each component has unique challenges and opportunities for developing green software systems, especially when combined together. Here are some key points to keep in mind: 


### Biocapacity 


Biocapacity refers to the ability of organisms to grow and reproduce in an area without competing with other species. More specifically, it means that an ecosystem can support a diverse range of biological diversity, including plants, animals, microbes, and so on. It helps maintain ecosystems' resiliency against climatic stresses and the potential for disasters such as droughts, floods, wildfires, and epidemics. In terms of green software systems, this component includes making sure that development processes involve careful selection of resources such as renewable energy sources and data centers located in locations with low greenhouse gas emissions.


### Physical Stability 


Physical stability refers to the resistance of an ecosystem to deformation, erosion, and other forms of disturbance. This property is critical to ensure that plants and animals can thrive under harsh environments such as high temperatures, rainfall, wind, and snow. Similarly, cloud computing platforms must also possess stable underlying hardware architecture that can withstand sudden surges of traffic, server crashes, and power outages. In terms of green software systems, this component involves ensuring that code and infrastructure is designed in a way that allows it to scale easily and efficiently under different operating conditions.


### Economic Viability 


Economic viability refers to the degree to which an ecosystem maintains a viable financial base and produces necessary products and services within a given market context. Green software systems offer a variety of benefits to businesses and consumers, such as reduced maintenance costs, lower operational costs, improved safety, faster delivery times, and better customer experience. In terms of green software systems, this component involves improving product quality, reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste, and achieving economies of scale through automation.


### Social Wellbeing 


Social wellbeing refers to the level of satisfaction achieved by humans associated with living in an ecosystem. As one ecosystem becomes more degraded, another may emerge to replace it as a result of human interactions. For instance, if one habitat becomes contaminated, healthy habitats elsewhere could form instead. Likewise, communities that connect locally around shared interests could leverage each other's skills to mitigate climate change and enhance local economic viability. In terms of green software systems, this component involves building relationships between stakeholders involved in the creation and distribution of green software products and services, educating developers on the importance of sustainability and incorporating best practices into development processes.


Overall, sustainability encompasses a wide range of concepts and principles that play a crucial role in protecting ecosystems and promoting their persistence. By advancing technology and applying green thinking, we can create a more sustainable future for humanity. However, at the same time, we need to focus on developing strong foundations for sustainability within our organizations and institutions, and bringing together a team of experienced technologists, policy makers, and engineers to make a meaningful contribution to this field.
