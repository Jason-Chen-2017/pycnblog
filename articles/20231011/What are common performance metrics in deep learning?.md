# 1.背景介绍


Deep Learning (DL) has become a hot topic these days, with many applications ranging from self-driving cars to facial recognition systems. However, DL is not an exact science yet and there are still many open questions on how well it can perform given different types of tasks and datasets. To get started, we need to understand the key metrics used for evaluating DL models' performance. In this article, I will explain what commonly used evaluation metrics are in DL and their significance when choosing one metric over another.

In general, DL performance evaluations rely heavily on metrics that measure the degree of error or dissimilarity between predicted outputs versus actual labels. There are several popular evaluation metrics used in DL, including accuracy, precision/recall, F1 score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), etc. Each metric has its own strengths and weaknesses, which determine whether it's suitable for certain types of problems. Let's first go through each type of evaluation metric in detail:

1. Accuracy (Acc): This is simply the percentage of correctly classified samples out of all predictions made by the model. It works best if there are no class imbalance issues within the dataset. The accuracy alone may be misleading because it doesn't take into account other important factors such as true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), recall, precision, etc., and thus cannot directly indicate how well the model performs under various conditions. 

2. Precision/Recall (Prec/Rec): These two measures provide information about the ability of the model to identify relevant instances from the dataset while minimizing the number of incorrect ones. They balance each other out so that high precision leads to lower recall, and vice versa. A high recall means good sensitivity to the target variable, but low precision indicates that some instances are being missed. On the contrary, a high precision could result in high TPR but low FPR. When designing a DL system, it's often helpful to consider both precision and recall together to avoid biased outcomes due to one measurement strategy only.

3. F1 Score: This combines precision and recall into a single measure using harmonic mean. It takes into account both true positives and false positives, but ignores false negatives. An F1 score closer to 1 indicates better performance than average, and a score closer to zero indicates worse performance.

4. Area Under Curve (AUC)-ROC curve: ROC curves are created by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at different classification thresholds. The area under the curve (AUC) provides an overall indication of the model's performance across all classification thresholds. An AUC close to 1 indicates excellent performance, whereas values closer to 0.5 indicate that the model is performing equally well regardless of the threshold.

5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE calculates the difference between the predicted value and the actual value for each sample, then takes the absolute value and returns the average over all samples. It gives a rough idea of the average magnitude of errors the model makes.

6. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Similarly, MSE squares the differences between the predicted and actual values for each sample, sums them up, and divides by the total number of samples. It penalizes large errors more severely than MAE.

7. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE takes the square root of MSE to give an interpretable standard deviation unit instead of squared units.

8. Cross Entropy Loss Function: CE loss function is frequently used as the cost function during training a DL model. It is defined as -sum(y_i*log(p_i)) where y_i is the ground truth label and p_i is the predicted probability assigned by the model to the i-th class. The goal is to minimize this loss function to achieve better performance. By default, cross entropy loss tends to produce better results compared to other metrics.

The choice of evaluation metric depends on several factors such as the nature of the problem, available data, and intended use case. Some promising alternatives include accuracy, precision/recall, AUC-ROC curve, F1 score, and cross entropy loss function depending on the specific application and desired tradeoffs.

Let's look at some examples of real world scenarios and choose appropriate metrics accordingly:

Example 1: Binary Classification Problem
A bank is trying to predict if a customer would default on a loan or not based on historical transaction patterns. Since they have limited resources and want to make sure the model does not just memorize the data without exploring potential patterns, they decide to focus on identifying customers who are likely to default, since losing money is bad for business. Therefore, they choose to optimize for precision rather than accuracy to limit false alarms caused by missing out on potentially valuable transactions.

Solution: Precision/Recall Metric
To evaluate the model's performance, they can calculate precision and recall separately for each class (defaulted vs non-defaulted) and take the weighted average based on the proportion of each class in the test set. Alternatively, they can combine the two scores into a single F1 score using the following formula:

F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) 

This formula balances precision and recall effectively and should work well for binary classification problems like this one. If the dataset contains multiple classes, they can also compute separate metrics for each class individually and compare their performance using AUC-ROC curve or PR-curve. For example, the precision for the "non-defaulted" class can be calculated independently, yielding higher precision values for those observations that were truly non-defaulted (true positives) but incorrectly identified as defaulted (false positives). However, having separate precision values per class can allow us to analyze individual performance characteristics more closely.

Example 2: Multi-Class Classification Problem
An ecommerce platform wants to classify images of products into different categories. Based on user feedback, they believe that the highest priority should be maintaining user satisfaction and reducing churn rates. Therefore, they opt for optimizing for recall, even though precision might suffer due to the large class imbalance issue.

Solution: Recall Metric
For multi-class classification problems like this one, they can calculate recall separately for each class (e.g. shirt, dress, sneakers) and take the weighted average based on the proportion of each class in the test set. Alternatively, they can compute the macro-average recall which treats all classes equally regardless of their size in the test set, resulting in a single scalar value representing the overall performance. This approach assumes equal importance to all classes, which may not always hold true.
