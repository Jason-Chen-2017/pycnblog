# 1.背景介绍


​Machine learning (ML) has become a popular topic in recent years because of its wide application range and high accuracy rate. It is widely used in various fields such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing, image recognition, finance analysis, healthcare, and so on. However, it also brings some challenges to data scientists, including the requirement for technical skills and mathematical proficiency, the difficulty in setting up efficient environments, and the need for careful validation process. In this article, we will introduce several interesting games that can be implemented using machine learning techniques. These games include Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Flappy Bird, and Snake Game with AI Agent. We will discuss how these games are developed and evaluated based on machine learning algorithms and their performance evaluation metrics. Additionally, we will present some related concepts and terms involved in game development and reinforcement learning which are crucial for our understanding of ML approaches.

We will briefly explain what constitutes as an AI agent, the two main types of AI models: supervised learning and unsupervised learning, and finally, reinforcement learning.

## What is An AI Agent? 
An AI agent refers to any software system that interacts with an environment through inputs and produces outputs by learning from past experience and taking actions based on its decision-making policy. 

The term "agent" comes from the idea of autonomous agents or human-like computer programs that act in real-world scenarios rather than being programmed explicitly.

### Types of AI Models

1. Supervised Learning Model: This model learns from labeled examples, i.e., training sets where each input-output pair is annotated with correct answers. The algorithm maps input features to output labels based on the known relationship between them. One example of this type of model is linear regression that predicts the sales of a company given its advertising budget, popularity, and other variables. 

2. Unsupervised Learning Model: This model is trained on unlabelled data without any prescribed labels. The algorithm tries to identify patterns in the dataset and discover underlying structure. One example of this type of model is clustering that groups similar objects together based on their attributes.

3. Reinforcement Learning Model: This model enables an agent to learn from interactions with the environment. It explores the state space by choosing an action at each time step, receiving feedback about the outcome of the action, and adjusting its behavior accordingly. The goal is to maximize long-term reward by making optimal decisions in pursuit of the highest expected value. For example, an agent may play video games by observing the screen and selecting actions to move around the map while receiving rewards for winning or losing the game. 

## How does Machine Learning approach Solve Problems? 

There are three steps involved in solving problems using machine learning:

1. Data Collection: Collecting large amounts of data that contains information about the problem. For instance, if you want to build a spam filter, collect emails containing spam messages and non-spam messages. If you want to classify images, collect a dataset of different objects and their respective images.

2. Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the collected data into meaningful features that help the machine learning algorithm to understand the pattern in the data.

3. Training/Testing Phase: Splitting the dataset into training set and testing set. The training phase involves fitting the model on the training set and validating it on the testing set. The purpose of splitting the dataset is to ensure that the model doesn't overfit on the training data and performs well on the new, unseen data. Once the model is validated, the last step is to use it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

After building the model, there are multiple evaluation metrics available to measure the performance of the model. Common metrics used in machine learning include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean squared error. Other metrics like ROC curve, AUC-ROC, confusion matrix, etc. can provide additional insights about the model's performance.
