# 1.背景介绍


Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Descent (NGD) is a popular optimization algorithm for deep learning models that use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as their training algorithm. It improves SGD by introducing an acceleration technique that enables it to converge faster than standard SGD. The main idea behind NGD is to modify the gradients computed during each iteration of SGD so that they point towards the direction that minimizes future error rather than simply following the current estimated direction of the steepest descent. This modification results in improved convergence rates and allows SGD to take smaller steps with high probability, reducing the chances of getting stuck in local minima or saddle points.
In this article, we will discuss several important aspects related to NGD, including its core concepts, mathematical model and practical implementation details. We will also briefly touch upon some of the other common optimization algorithms such as Adagrad, Adadelta and Adam, which have been used together with NGD for better performance in certain applications. Finally, we will give specific examples from various areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning and recommender systems to illustrate how NGD can be applied to improve the performance of deep neural networks.
# 2. Core Concepts and Relationship
Before moving forward, let us first understand what are the key concepts associated with NGD and how they interact with each other. 

## 2.1 Acceleration Technique
The concept of "acceleration" refers to changing the search direction of the optimizer based on past information about the function being optimized. The Nesterov method uses an "acceleration term" that adjusts the step size based on the momentum term calculated at the previous time step. Intuitively, if we move along the negative gradient direction, we can estimate the maximum value we can reach in that direction without actually making any moves yet. If our prediction was too far off, we would try a larger step size to correct our mistakes and get closer to the true minimum. Conversely, if our prediction was close enough, we could decrease the step size to save computational resources and avoid unnecessary iterations. By combining this approach with traditional momentum updates, Nesterov's method is able to achieve significantly faster convergence rates compared to conventional SGD.

## 2.2 Gradients
The second critical component of NGD is understanding the definition of "gradient". In general, the gradient of a scalar-valued function $f(\mathbf{x})$ evaluated at a point $\mathbf{x}$ represents the slope of the function at that point and indicates the direction in which the function increases most quickly. Mathematically, the gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} f(\mathbf{x})$ of $f(\mathbf{x})$ at a point $\mathbf{x}$, denoted as:
$$\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} f(\mathbf{x})=\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}\right]^{T}$$
where $\{\mathbf{x}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ is a set of n variables. For example, the gradient of the loss function commonly used in machine learning problems such as logistic regression, i.e., cross entropy loss, is given by the expression:
$$\nabla_{\theta} L(\theta)=\left[\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta_{j}}\right]_{j=1}^{m}$$
where $\theta=(\theta_1,\cdots,\theta_m)$ and $L$ is the loss function that depends on $\theta$. In addition, note that not all functions defined over vectors have gradients; some may only have partial derivatives with respect to some subset of their inputs. Therefore, it is important to keep track of whether your objective function has a gradient and under which conditions it does and doesn't exist.

## 2.3 Momentum Term
The third essential concept in NGD is the "momentum term", which helps to smooth out oscillations caused by small changes in the gradient. Intuitively, momentum terms represent the "memory" of the last few updates made to the parameters, allowing the algorithm to continue traversing down the hill while gradually moving away from regions with high curvature. The update rule for the velocity vector is given by:
$$\begin{aligned} v_{t+1} &= \mu_{t} * v_{t} + g_{t}, \\ \theta_{t+1} &= \theta_{t}-\alpha*v_{t+1}.\end{aligned}$$
where $\theta$ is the parameter vector, $g_t$ is the gradient vector at time t, $v_t$ is the velocity vector at time t, $\mu_t$ is the momentum coefficient, and $\alpha$ is the step size. Note that $\mu_t$ should be chosen carefully to balance exploration and exploitation during the course of the optimization process. Typical values of $\mu$ range between 0.5 and 0.9 depending on the problem domain and amount of prior knowledge available.

## 2.4 Adaptive Learning Rate
Another crucial aspect of NGD is the adaptive learning rate scheme. Standard SGD methods typically rely on a fixed step size $\alpha$, but NGD maintains a variable step size that adapts automatically to the magnitude of the gradient. Specifically, at each step, the algorithm computes the dot product between the current gradient and the historical average gradient:
$$r_t = \frac{\|\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} J(\mathbf{x}_t)\|^2}{1-\beta^{t}}$$
where $J(\mathbf{x}_t)$ is the objective function, $\beta$ is a hyperparameter that controls the exponential decay rate of the historical average, and $t$ is the number of iterations elapsed since the start of the training process. Based on this ratio, the algorithm determines the appropriate step size $\alpha$:
$$\alpha = \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{r_t+\epsilon}}$$
where $\eta$ is the initial step size and $\epsilon$ prevents division by zero when $r_t$ approaches zero. Common choices for $\beta$ include 0.9, 0.99, or 0.999, depending on the desired level of smoothing and noise tolerance.

Overall, the combination of these four components makes up the basic operation of NGD, which effectively combines a powerful derivative estimation technique with momentum-based acceleration to produce highly accurate estimates of the optimal solution in convex settings. However, there are many variants of NGD, both theoretically and empirically discussed, that further enhance its properties and effectiveness in different contexts.
