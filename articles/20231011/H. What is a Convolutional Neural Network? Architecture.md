# 1.背景介绍


Deep Learning (DL) has been revolutionizing various applications such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, etc., due to its ability to extract high-level features from complex data without the need for hand-engineered feature engineering techniques. However, DL models have some unique challenges in handling raw images or audio signals that are commonly used in computer vision and speech processing tasks. In this article, we will explore how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) work by going through their architecture, components, and practical application scenarios.

A CNN is composed of multiple layers, including input layer, hidden layers, output layer, and pooling layers. Each layer performs different operations on the input data depending on the purpose of the network. The main components of a CNN include filters, weights, activation functions, and max-pooling layers. A filter is a small matrix that scans over the input data and applies an elementwise operation to each region it covers. Weights are learned parameters applied during training that adjust the response of the filter to different patterns found in the input data. Activation functions transform the filtered results into outputs by applying non-linearity, which helps learn more complex relationships between the inputs and outputs. Max-pooling reduces the spatial dimensions of the output by downsampling the most important features within each pooling window. 

To put these concepts together, we can think of a CNN as follows:

1. Input layer: This accepts the original input data, usually an image or a sequence of numbers.

2. Hidden layers: These process the input data using filters and weight matrices. There may be several hidden layers with increasing complexity and depth. 

3. Output layer: This produces the final prediction based on the processed input data. It typically consists of fully connected nodes that produce a single value per class label.

4. Pooling layers: These reduce the spatial dimensionality of the output of the previous layer by downsampling the maximum values within each defined window. Commonly used pool sizes range from 2x2 to 3x3 pixels.


The key idea behind CNNs is that they apply filters to local regions of the input data to learn higher-level features that help generalize better to new data samples. The filters act like simple feature detectors that capture specific visual patterns or sound events. By chaining multiple filters across multiple layers, CNNs can automatically identify complex dependencies among the input features and extract relevant representations for classification or regression tasks. Additionally, CNNs can also be trained end-to-end directly on raw data without any pre-processing or manual feature engineering steps, making them easier to train and deploy compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.

In this section, we will go through details about the math behind convolutional neural networks, as well as explain how they operate step-by-step in terms of forward propagation, backward propagation, and optimization. 

### Mathematics Behind Convolutional Layers
Let's assume that our input data X is a two-dimensional image with dimensions M x N, where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns. Suppose further that we design a convolutional layer consisting of K filters of size FxF with S strides, i.e., there are K sets of weights W[k], bias b[k] and output z[k] for each k = 1,..., K. Denote the first position in the output volume Z corresponding to the top left corner of the input volume X as (i, j), then the formula for calculating the activation at position (p, q) in the output volume Z is given by:

Z(p, q) = ∑_{k=1}^K \sum_{u=0}^{F-1} \sum_{v=0}^{F-1} X(S*(p-1)+u, S*(q-1)+v) * W[k](u, v) + b[k]

Here, S denotes the stride length and *(p-1) and *(q-1) represent shifting the positions according to the stride length. Note that the multiplication sign * represents element-wise product and summation is performed over all the u and v indices for a particular set of weights W[k]. 

Next, let's consider the effect of padding in a convolutional layer. Padding refers to adding zeros around the border of the input volume before performing the convolution, so that the output volume has the same size as the padded input volume. With zero padding, the expression for computing the activation at position (p, q) becomes:

Z(p, q) = ∑_{k=1}^K \sum_{u=0}^{F+S-2} \sum_{v=0}^{F+S-2} X((p-1)*S+u-P, (q-1)*S+v-Q) * W[k](u, v) + b[k]

where P and Q are the amounts of padding along the row and column directions, respectively. If we do not add any padding, the formula remains unchanged.

### Forward Propagation
Now let us move on to the implementation stage of the convolutional neural network. We start with initializing the input volume X, followed by defining the hyperparameters such as filter size, stride length, and amount of padding. Next, we compute the output volume Y of the convolutional layer by iterating over all possible locations p and q in the output volume Z and computing the activations at those locations using the above formulas. Finally, we apply non-linearities such as ReLU, softmax, sigmoid, tanh, or linear activation function to obtain the predicted output values y.

### Backward Propagation
Once we have computed the loss function L w.r.t. the predicted output y, we use backpropagation algorithm to update the model parameters such as weights and biases using gradient descent. Let's define the derivative of the cost function C w.r.t. the output of neuron k in the kth hidden layer as dC/dz[k]:

dC/dz[k] = δ[k] * (a[k])',   if relu activation function is used
        = (δ[k] * a[k]' - Σ_j[l] (w'[kl] * δ[l])) / (1-a[k]^2), otherwise

where δ[k] is the error signal for the kth unit and a[k] is the activation of the kth unit before passing it through the non-linearity. Here,'denotes transpose operation and Σ indicates the sum over all l units in the next layer connecting to the kth unit.

The errors induced by each neuron can be propagated backwards throughout the entire network to calculate the gradients of the cost function with respect to the model parameters. Specifically, we update the parameter vector theta by taking a stochastic gradient descent step towards negative direction of the gradient as follows:

theta = theta - alpha * grad,  where grad is the average of accumulated gradients over mini-batch samples.
