# 1.背景介绍


Marine ecosystems are critical for local communities and indigenous cultures' sustained existence in remote areas where access to electricity is limited or non-existent. However, the energy availability of these marine environments is often limited due to adverse weather conditions and sea level rise. There has been increasing interest recently in using alternative energy sources such as renewable energy sources (RES), which provide cheaper energy than traditional fossil fuel based power generation systems. In addition, this approach can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve aquatic habitats through enhanced nutrient cycling by bacteria. Yet there is still significant work to be done before RES can fully replace conventional energy production and commercial renewables have yet to achieve widespread use. The breathable energy concept is proposed as a new avenue to address these challenges and promote community development and sustainability within the context of global climate change. 

The goal of the Breathable Energy and Marine Bioreactor (BEMB) project is to develop a cost-effective, scalable system that utilizes microalgae as an organic carbon source for BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles). Using marine biogas obtained from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), this system will convert and store microalgae carbon dioxide into high-boiling hydrogen (H2) suitable for domestic and commercial use. By incorporating passive solar heating technology, the bioreactor can produce H2 with minimal need for external heat. This technology is particularly attractive because it does not require any preheating or boiling of water used to generate hydrogen, making it economical and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the bioreactor can continuously regenerate its H2 feedstock without requiring refilling or replenishing storage tanks, making it scalable for long-term operations. Overall, this technology enables small scale homeowners, businesses, and institutions to tap into large amounts of renewable energy in their local area while also promoting local community development and sustainability. 

The key features of the BEMB project include:

1. Microalgae as a potential source of high-value carbon for BEV applications

2. Use of AUVs to obtain marine biogas, allowing for efficient conversion of CO2 into H2 

3. Solar heating for H2 production without the need for external heat sources 

4. Continuous H2 generation with no requirement for refill or replacement of storage tanks 

5. Ability to recycle hydrogen for other uses, including medical and scientific purposes

Microalgae is a versatile source of organic carbon that naturally occurs in seawater around the world. They are found throughout the ocean, ranging from epipelagic zones to deeper estuaries and subtropical regions. Microalgae play important roles in supporting a wide range of marine ecosystems, including freshwater fisheries, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and plankton ecology. To convert organic matter produced by microorganisms into usable energy, we must first separate out the carbohydrates and then break down the resulting oil into useful compounds like methane and ethane.

Hydrogen, on the other hand, is one of the most abundant chemical elements in the universe. It forms readily in solution and remains liquid until converted into electricity via combustion or conduction. One form of hydrogen that is particularly suited for BEV applications is ammonium hydrogen sulfate (NH4OH). This type of hydrogen is produced by ammonia during combustion and can be extracted from algae after cooking. When combined with an organic carbon source, NH4OH becomes a powerful vehicle for converting organic matter into highly efficient high-energy chemicals.

By combining microalgae and NH4OH together, we can create a process known as bioreaction. During this process, the algal cells of microalgae release NH4OH, which reacts with excess CO2 produced by the microbes. The reaction results in a stable ammonium oxide precursor that is gradually consumed by the microbe and formed into NH4SO4. These products are quickly absorbed back into the cell's cytoplasm, becoming available for further consumption. This process continues uninterrupted for days or weeks depending on the size and composition of the microalgae. As a result, the microalgae acts as a source of both organic carbon and hydrogen, giving us the opportunity to explore novel ways to utilize them for BEV applications. 

Microalgae are also prime targets for the production of hydrogen, providing opportunities to increase efficiency and lower costs compared to traditional fossil fuel-based energy technologies. Not only can microalgae act as a source of organic matter, but they also contain valuable flora and fauna components that contribute to the overall health of their surrounding ecosystem. For instance, mangrove swamps provide beneficial bacterial decomposers that remove harmful pigments and toxins. Additionally, methanogenesis plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity and functionality of marine ecosystems, contributing to their stability and resilience. Furthermore, the recovery of endogenous metabolic wastes generated by animals can help to alleviate air pollution caused by anthropogenic activities, thus promoting more greenhouse gas reductions over time.

Solar heating refers to the use of sunlight to warm up or cool down a surface. While traditional electrical heating systems rely on direct contact between electrical appliances and the heat source, SOLAR HEATING relies on natural radiation, provided by the Sun. Some benefits of solar heating include reduced operating costs, increased thermal insulation, and better control over temperature levels. Within the BEMB project, we plan to use solar heating to generate H2 from the combination of NH4OH and microalgae. By distributing H2 across multiple microscopes, our solar power plants can efficiently distribute and circulate it throughout the local area.

Finally, since we anticipate scaling the operation of our solar power plants and generating hydrogen for a variety of uses, we must ensure that our H2 production processes are robust and reliable enough to handle unexpected events and maintain the quality and safety standards required by the regulatory bodies involved. This includes regular testing, maintenance, and monitoring to ensure that our hydroponics systems remain functioning properly and deliver safe and healthy H2 to our customers. Overall, the BEMB project aims to leverage advantages of microalgae and solar heating to enhance the economics and viability of locally grown energy resources while ensuring human wellbeing, social inclusion, and the health of marine ecosystems.
