# 1.背景介绍


Text classification is a task of categorizing text into predefined categories based on the information present in it. In this article, we will compare and contrast two popular deep learning models – Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), commonly used to solve such tasks. 

In recent years, RNNs have become very effective in solving sequential data problems like language modeling, speech recognition or sentiment analysis. They are designed to recognize patterns and dependencies among sequences of input data. CNNs were initially developed for image processing but later found their way into natural language processing domains where they perform well on various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic detection etc. Therefore, both types of networks can be applied to text classification problem with different approaches and trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency and scalability. We will also discuss how these network architectures differ from each other in terms of design principles, strengths, weaknesses, applicability and limitations.

Let’s now understand why RNNs and CNNs are widely used for text classification:

1. Efficiency - Both RNNs and CNNs use a feedforward neural network architecture that makes them highly efficient compared to traditional machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines. This is because RNNs process sequence data by passing through time steps sequentially, while CNNs work with local features by convolving filters over the input data. 

2. Long term dependency - Sequential data often exhibit long term dependencies which require specialized memory mechanisms to capture the contextual relationships across multiple time steps. The relevance of past events impact the current event more than current events impact future events, making RNNs especially useful in capturing this kind of temporal pattern. 

3. Input representation - RNNs operate on a sequence of vectors representing the words in a sentence, which captures the semantic meaning of the sentence. On the other hand, CNNs are designed for processing images, which has higher dimensionality and spatial nature. However, they learn abstract representations of visual concepts using convolutional filters instead of raw pixel values. 

4. Parallelism - Both RNNs and CNNs can exploit parallel computing capabilities of modern computers to train models faster. RNNs can distribute the computation along time steps, whereas CNNs parallelize across feature maps. 

5. Scalability - While both RNNs and CNNs can handle large datasets with millions of examples, they may not be ideal for small to medium sized datasets. This is mainly due to the fact that training an RNN requires a significant amount of memory, which grows quadratically with the size of the dataset. To address this issue, researchers have started exploring techniques like batch normalization and gradient accumulation, which reduce the memory footprint of training but sacrifice some performance. 

Now let’s move towards detailed comparison and contrast of RNNs and CNNs for text classification:

## Comparing CNNs and RNNs in text classification
Both RNNs and CNNs follow similar architectural principles. Both use a feedforward neural network with hidden layers to extract high level features from the input data. But there are key differences between them:

1. Architecture: RNNs have an LSTM or GRU unit at each time step, which captures the long range dependencies across multiple time steps. On the other hand, CNNs employ convolutional filters to extract local features from the input data.

2. Output layer structure: RNNs typically have one output layer per class label, which produces a probability distribution over all possible classes. On the other hand, CNNs produce a single fixed length vector per example, which represents the entire sequence of word embeddings after pooling and dropout operations.

3. Regularization techniques: Both RNNs and CNNs incorporate regularization techniques like L2/L1 regularization, dropout and early stopping, to prevent overfitting and improve generalization ability.

4. Gradient flow: Both RNNs and CNNs are trained using backpropagation through time algorithm, where errors are propagated backwards through the time steps during training.

5. Embedding layer: In addition to the embedding layer, both RNNs and CNNs contain a second dense layer immediately before the output layer to project the learned features into a lower dimensional space.

Here is a summary table comparing the strengths and weaknesses of RNNs and CNNs for text classification:
