## Customer Loyalty Program (CLP)
A customer loyalty program rewards customers who frequently purchase certain products or services based on their previous behavior. These programs usually encourage repeat purchases and retain existing customers while attracting new ones. By making it clear what constitutes loyal behavior from both sides - customer and seller, CLPs help establish trust and credibility among consumers. 

For example, Amazon offers a free monthly membership called Prime membership that allows users to save money, access additional products, and get discounts. Similarly, Target offers a Rewards Program which gives users points for every dollar spent online and redeems those points for prizes such as cash back on future purchases. Both these programs promote loyalty and encourages repeated shopping behaviors.

## Product Promotions
Product promotions refer to different types of marketing efforts that target specific segments of consumers, such as targeted advertisements on social media platforms or billboards within shops. Different promotional methods include direct mail, email blasts, phone calls, text messages, coupons/discount cards, and online advertisement campaigns.

Some popular examples of successful product promotions include Walmart’s Fall Sale, Apple’s Macbook Pro discount, and the Nike Mercurial Monthly Sale. These promotions used highly effective marketing tactics such as personalized messaging, engaging headlines, multichannel communication, and clear pricing to entice consumers towards making purchases.

## Consumer Education
One way to build brand equity is to educate consumers about your brand’s value propositions and benefits. This includes providing information on why people should buy from you, using authentic testimonials, and highlighting key features of your product. Educating consumers helps create a sense of familiarity and confidence amongst them, further building their loyalty. For instance, Tesla has recently launched its Model S, a premium electric car made specifically for the masses. However, many people don't know much about Tesla other than it's a high-tech car company. Therefore, having clear consumer education materials and FAQs would allow potential customers to understand more about your brand before making a purchase.

Another benefit of consumer education is that it creates awareness and drives demand for your products. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram often use advertisements to reach new customers, so providing informative content can increase your visibility and capture potential customers' attention. With increased traffic and engagement, your brand could potentially become one of the most popular choices among consumers.

## Sales Campaigns
Sales campaigns involve using promotional materials to influence sales and generate interest in your brand. These can range from simple flyers, posters, signs, and videos to full-fledged direct mailing campaigns. Often times, sales campaigns focus on creating awareness, generating leads, and converting visitors into customers. 

Common sales campaigns include TV ads, radio ads, billboard ads, website promotions, and email newsletters. Examples of successful sales campaigns include Nike’s annual Menswear Sale and Coca-Cola’s Annual Advertising Awards. By leveraging traditional marketing tactics, such as PR, advertising, and sales, you can improve your chances of gaining brand equity over time. 

## Paid Search Advertising 
Paid search advertising involves finding plausible keywords related to your brand and showing your ads in Google searches. This technique relies on keyword research and optimization to deliver valuable results. Advertisers pay a commission fee each time someone clicks on an ad, ensuring that your ads do not appear too sparse or obtrusive. Paid search advertising is particularly effective when used in combination with product promotions, giving your brand greater authority and impact. 

Examples of successful paid search ads include Costco’s “Buy Our Products” ad on Yahoo Shopping, Macy’s Discounted Prices ads on eBay, and Best Buy’s coupon system on Etsy. Overall, by taking advantage of all available marketing channels, you can significantly increase your brand equity without compromising your business model. 

## Media Buy-in
Media buy-in refers to connecting with major media outlets such as television stations, newspapers, magazines, and broadcasters. Connecting with these organizations can provide valuable insights and perspectives on customer preferences, needs, and behaviors. Building rapport with the press can help you gain an understanding of consumers' expectations and desires, enabling you to market appropriately. Successful media relationships also require consistent participation from both sides, ensuring that your message remains fresh and accurate. 

Popular media outlets that have been a great fit for sellers of digital products include Apple News+, CNN Digital, ESPN Radio, Bloomberg Television, Fox News, and Reuters NewsWire. By working closely with these organizations, you can ensure that your message reaches the right audience and improves brand equity. 

## Trade Shows
Trade shows are events where industry leaders gather to share ideas, experiences, and best practices. Participation in these events can enable you to network with fellow professionals and establish yourself as an expert in your field. Attracting industry experts can help you identify market trends and develop competitive advantages. 

Successful trade show sponsorships typically involve organizing meetings, hosting presentations, and exhibiting your brand’s products. For instance, Nike invited former GM President <NAME> to give a speech at the Grammy Awards last year. Other successful sponsorship partnerships include H&M’s i-Message launch, Toshiba’s Dignitas event, and McDonald’s Launchpad announcement. Working with trade shows enables you to stay up-to-date on current market trends and connect with established thought-leaders. 

## Partnerships with Influential Organizations
Partnerships with influential organizations such as music labels, universities, and retail chains can help expand your brand reach and influence decision-making. Establishing collaborations with these organizations can help you gain valuable insight into consumers' hopes and fears, and shape your strategy accordingly.

Examples of successful partnerships include the Jay-Z and Travis Scott collaboration at Rihanna’s Late Night Music Festival; The University of California Colleges & Schools and Georgia Tech to offer scholarships to students interested in studying abroad; and Starbucks and Little People’s coffee shop to give free coffees to eligible employees. 

By bringing together various sources of funding, capital, and knowledge, you can optimize your brand equity and draw on diverse perspectives to gain significant market share. Ultimately, there is no single formula to follow, but implementing best practices and integrating multiple marketing channels can lead to increased brand equity over time.
