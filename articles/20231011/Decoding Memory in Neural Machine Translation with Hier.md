# 1.背景介绍


Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved tremendous progress recently and is currently the most popular model for language translation due to its effectiveness, efficiency, and low computational cost. However, NMT systems still struggle when it comes to decoding long sequences or handling sentences that require complex translations. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical latent variable approach called HL-NMT for efficient and accurate decoding of long sequences while ensuring fluency and coherence during sentence generation. The proposed system consists of three key components: an encoder-decoder architecture based on deep learning techniques, memory access mechanisms, and attention mechanisms. This article will explain each component in detail and demonstrate how they interact with one another to produce accurate and fluent translations.

The primary goal of this research work is to develop a new methodology for neural machine translation (NMT) which can efficiently handle long input sequences by incorporating memory into the decoding process. One way to do this is by using a hierarchical latent variable (HLV) approach where the decoder generates words one at a time but also maintains a record of previously generated words in memory. The use of HLV enables us to capture the contextual relationships between different parts of a sentence and generate accurate and fluid translations without compromising the overall quality of the output sequence. We show that our HL-NMT approach produces high-quality translations that are both faster than conventional non-memory-based NMT models and more fluent than those relying solely on statistical postprocessing methods. In addition, we have performed ablation experiments to validate the efficacy of individual components within the system and evaluate their impact on performance. Our results suggest that incorporating HLV allows for significant improvements over non-memory-based approaches in terms of speed and accuracy.

## 2.1 What is Neural Machine Translation?
Neural machine translation (NMT), also known as natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text translation and speech recognition, refers to a type of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that uses AI algorithms to automatically translate human language into computer languages. It involves training machines to understand and translate language through the usage of large amounts of data collected from parallel texts. The system uses neural networks trained on large corpora of parallel text to learn the patterns and meaning of source and target languages simultaneously. The goal of any NMT system is to enable users to communicate with other people, machines, and applications across various languages.

## 2.2 Why is Memory Important in Neural Machine Translation? 
In today's increasingly digitalized world, humans often rely heavily on technologies like mobile phones, social media platforms, chat bots, etc., where messages can be exchanged in real-time. These message channels present several advantages, including ease of communication, low latency, and dynamic content. Despite these benefits, the importance of effective and efficient memory in NMT remains elusive because current decoding strategies employ relatively simple models that ignore sequential dependencies among source and target tokens. As a result, NMT systems typically fail to generate fluent and correct translations under certain circumstances, such as when generating responses to questions asked by customers or analyzing financial reports. Therefore, there is a need to come up with improved decoding strategies that leverage memory and preserve the rich contextual relationships between different parts of a sentence.

## 2.3 Hierarchical Latent Variable Model for Neural Machine Translation
We propose a novel concept of Hierarchical Latent Variable (HLV) for addressing the issue of efficient and accurate decoding of long sequences while preserving fluency and coherence during sentence generation. HLV utilizes two levels of representations to encode and decode language, namely a lower level sequence representation (i.e., word embeddings) and a higher level structure representation (i.e., syntax trees). The former captures the semantic meanings of individual words while the latter reflects the syntactic structures underlying the sentence structure. By integrating these two levels of representations together, HLV provides a powerful framework for capturing both local and global information inherent in natural language. Specifically, we design two types of memory cells within the decoding process: history memory cell and priority memory cell.

History Memory Cell: A history memory cell records previously generated words so that the decoder can refer back to them later on if necessary. It works by keeping track of all previous words alongside with their corresponding scores, representing their likelihood of being chosen again in subsequent iterations. During decoding, we selectively retrieve the top K words that appear frequently enough to serve as candidates for recalling from the history memory cell.

Priority Memory Cell: A priority memory cell stores key-value pairs of specific words and phrases that occur frequently throughout the training corpus and can provide additional cues to guide the decoding process. These pairs may include proper nouns, common idioms, familiar expressions, and multi-word expressions (MWEs). When encountering such phrases, the priority memory cell retrieves their associated values and assigns them a higher score than regular candidate words, promoting their relevance in the final output. 

Attention Mechanism: An attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on particular parts of the input sequence while generating output symbols. It calculates a weight vector for every position in the sequence, which represents the degree of focus on that part. Based on this weight vector, the decoder selectsively focuses on important positions to generate relevant output symbols. At each step, the decoder uses both the encoding vectors and the hidden state of the previous time step to compute the next set of probabilities, making use of the HLV mechanism.

Overall, the HL-NMT framework achieves excellent decoding performance and fidelity by exploiting the strengths of neural networks and advanced decoding strategies. We believe that the proposed framework could significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance of NMT systems for handling long sequences and complex sentences, leading to better customer engagements and enhanced user experience.
