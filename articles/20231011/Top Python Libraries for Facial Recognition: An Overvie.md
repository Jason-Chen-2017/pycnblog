# 1.背景介绍


Facial recognition technology is rapidly expanding in recent years and it has been applied to a wide range of applications such as security, surveillance, human-computer interaction (HCI), healthcare, etc. One of the most popular techniques used for facial recognition is called face verification or similarity matching, which involves comparing two faces using various image processing techniques. 

However, there are several challenges associated with this technique. Some of them include low accuracy, slow response time, and scalability issues that make it difficult to apply it in real-time scenarios like video streams and social media feeds. Therefore, new approaches have emerged recently to overcome these challenges. In this article, we will introduce some of the top Python libraries available for facial recognition tasks.

The first section of our article will provide an overview of what facial recognition is, its benefits, and how it can be used effectively. The second part of the article will cover key terms and concepts involved in facial recognition systems, including feature extraction, data representation, classifier training, and performance evaluation. We will then move on to discuss the core algorithms behind different facial recognition libraries, their specific implementation details, and analysis of the mathematical models behind each algorithm. Finally, we will explain the working principles of state-of-the-art deep learning based facial recognition frameworks and drawbacks of existing solutions. Our articles are intended to help readers understand facial recognition technologies better by providing insights into their design choices and practical application in the modern world. 

# 2. Core Concepts and Key Terms 
Before going further, let’s quickly review the main concepts and key terms related to facial recognition systems. 

## Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is the process of extracting important features from images such as eyes, nose, mouth, and ears that represent the unique characteristics of the subject in an image. This information is extracted so that similar images can be grouped together under one class. There are several ways to perform feature extraction, such as Haar Cascades, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH). 

In general, feature extraction methods typically involve the following steps:

1. Image pre-processing
2. Image resizing
3. Grayscaling or color space conversion
4. Detection of relevant features such as eyes, noses, lips, and eyebrows
5. Feature normalization and scaling
6. Descriptor calculation


## Data Representation
Data representation refers to the way in which raw data is transformed into a suitable format that can be understood by the machine learning algorithm. It includes techniques such as normalization, encoding, and discretization. For example, when performing classification problems, categorical variables should be converted into numerical values before feeding them to the model. Similarly, continuous variables can be scaled or normalized to reduce the effect of outliers.  


## Classifier Training
Classifier training involves building a statistical model that maps input data to output labels. It consists of three stages:

1. Train-Test Splitting - Dividing the dataset into a train set and test set
2. Model Selection - Choosing the best model architecture for the given problem statement 
3. Hyperparameter Tuning - Fine tuning the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve its performance

Once the model is trained, it is evaluated against the testing set to measure its performance. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, confusion matrix, and other measures can be calculated to evaluate the quality of the model.

## Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation metrics play an essential role in evaluating the performance of the facial recognition system. There are several commonly used metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, confusion matrix, etc., depending on the nature of the task at hand. These metrics allow us to analyze the degree to which the model correctly identifies individuals from known samples versus unknown ones, while also accounting for false positives and negatives. 

Therefore, choosing appropriate evaluation metrics plays a crucial role in assessing the performance of the facial recognition system. Moreover, optimizing the performance of the facial recognition system requires careful consideration of all aspects such as the choice of model, evaluation metric, data preprocessing techniques, regularization, etc. Thus, keeping up with latest research trends is essential for ensuring the success of facial recognition systems.

# 3. Algorithms Used in Facial Recognition Libraries
Here, we will discuss briefly about the core algorithms used in common Python facial recognition libraries, namely OpenCV, Dlib, and FaceNet. Additionally, we will explore the pros and cons of each algorithm and suggest potential improvements. 

### Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) Library
Open CV library provides support for object detection and tracking, image manipulation, machine learning, computer vision, and augmented reality. The library includes implementations of numerous image and signal processing techniques such as filters, transformers, segmentation, stitching, motion analysis, object recognition, and pattern recognition. Its features include video capture, camera calibration, image filtering, noise reduction, background subtraction, contour finding, corner detection, and many others.

#### Algorithm 1: Eigenface Recognizer
Eigenface recognizer is a simple approach to recognizing faces. It uses eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of faces as features and trains a linear SVM classifier on these eigenfaces. The benefit of using PCA for feature extraction comes from the fact that eigenvectors of the covariance matrix correspond to dominant directions in the original feature space and hence reveal the structure of the data. Eigenfaces may not work well if the orientation of the subjects is different.

Pros: Simple, Easy To Implement, Efficient and Accurate, Good For Large Scale Applications, Can Handle Different Orientations Of Subjects

Cons: May Not Work Well If Noisy Images Are Available, Doesn't Capture Distortion Intensity Changes

#### Algorithm 2: Fisherface Recognizer
Fisherface recognizer improves upon the traditional Eigenface recognizer by incorporating a weighting scheme that encourages the reconstruction error to be minimized. It calculates a weighted mean of the eigenvectors instead of just the mean. Instead of relying only on the highest variance eigenvectors, Fisherface combines multiple eigenvectors within a small radius around each reference point, leading to a more robust representation of the underlying face shape.

Pros: Better At Handling Rotated Faces, Can Detect Partial Faces, Compared to Eigenfaces, Less Prone To Overfitting And Underfitting

Cons: Requires Additional Computational Resources To Calculate Weighted Mean, Slower Than Other Methods

#### Algorithm 3: LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) Algorithm
This algorithm extracts local binary patterns (LBP) histograms as features from images. LBP is a texture descriptor method that represents textures as compact bit strings. The histogram of these bit strings captures spatial variations and encodes lighting variations. The resulting histograms constitute the features for training a binary SVM classifier.

Pros: Computationally Efficient, Robust To Corrupt Inputs, Works Well With Low Resolution Images, Flexible Configuration Options

Cons: Only Recognizes Faces, Doesn't Learn Texture Information, May Not Be Best Choice For Higher Accuracy Tasks

### Dlib Library
Dlib is a powerful open source C++ library that provides advanced front end algorithms for high level computer vision tasks such as face recognition, object detection, clustering, indexing, recognition, and machine learning. It supports both dense and sparse representations, large scale image collections, and high-performance hardware acceleration. Dlib contains a number of algorithms for object recognition, face recognition, pose estimation, landmark detection, and image alignment among others.

#### Algorithm 1: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) Based Facial Detector
HOG is a feature descriptor used for object detection and description. The algorithm works by dividing an image into small cells, computing gradient vectors inside those cells, normalizing them, and aggregating them across cell positions to produce a final histogram of gradients representing the appearance of the object in question. The idea is to learn a mapping between the image and its surrounding context to detect objects and track them throughout subsequent frames.

Pros: Simple, Fast, Highly Scalable, Perfect for Real-Time Applications, Captures Complex Appearance Features

Cons: Cannot Identify Partially Visible Faces, Prone to False Negatives, Sometimes Misses Small Objects

#### Algorithm 2: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Based Facial Detector
The convolutional neural network (CNN) based detector is another powerful tool for facial recognition. It builds upon the concept of deep learning and learns to classify different parts of the face by training a series of layers on labeled examples. The extracted features are fed through a multi-layer perceptron layer and passed through softmax activation function to obtain predictions.

Pros: Capable Of Learning Interpretable Features, Supports Partial Faces, Very High Accuracy, Supports Highly Variable Pose Face Landmarks

Cons: Heavy Compute Requirements, Difficult To Train, Takes Time To Train, May Not Be Best Choice For Embedded Systems

#### Algorithm 3: KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) Based Facial Comparator
The KNN based facial comparator compares faces by identifying the k nearest neighbors in a database and assigning the label of the majority neighbor as the predicted label of the query face. Since it is a lazy learning algorithm, it does not require any training stage. However, it has limited capability to handle pose variations and partial faces due to its simplistic distance measurement.

Pros: Simple, Easy To Use, Supports Partial Faces, High Accuracy

Cons: Limited Ability To Handle Pose Variations, High Memory Consumption, Poor Speed On Large Scale Databases
