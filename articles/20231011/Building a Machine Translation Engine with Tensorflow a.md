# 1.背景介绍


This article will guide you through the process of building a machine translation engine using TensorFlow and Dialogflow CX (Cloud-based Conversational AI platform). We will use pre-built models for English to Spanish translation and modify them according to our requirements. The end product will be able to translate text in real-time or offline mode depending on user input. 

Machine translation is an important technology that helps people around the world communicate easily by translating one language into another. However, it has been found out that many users still struggle with finding accurate translations despite having access to advanced translation tools. Therefore, we need to develop automated systems capable of providing high-quality translations without human intervention. To achieve this, we can leverage cloud technologies such as Dialogflow CX to build our translator.

Dialogflow CX is a conversational AI platform that allows developers to quickly build powerful natural language understanding (NLU) bots without writing code. It provides built-in integration with common NLP libraries like Google Cloud Natural Language API and Amazon Comprehend which makes it easy to integrate these capabilities into your chatbot. Additionally, it includes support for integrating multiple languages, enabling multi-language conversation flows within your bot. Finally, it offers a range of features including customizable training data, test results analysis, and analytics tools making it easier for businesses to monitor their performance and improve their products over time.

In this tutorial, we will create a simple translator based on Dialogflow CX's off-the-shelf machine learning models for English to Spanish translation. We will then explore how to customize the model architecture to suit our specific needs and evaluate its accuracy on various datasets. Finally, we'll explain how to deploy the trained model as a chatbot that can handle real-time conversations in any supported language pair. 

By the end of this tutorial, we hope to have developed a working prototype of a machine translation engine using Dialogflow CX that is suitable for real-time deployment.

# 2. Core Concepts & Architecture
## Introduction
### What is Neural Machine Translation? 
Neural machine translation refers to the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in order to perform machine translation between two different languages. DNNs are specialized artificial neural network architectures that consist of multiple layers of nodes connected with each other. These networks learn complex patterns from large amounts of training data, resulting in improved translation accuracies compared to traditional statistical machine translation techniques.

One way to approach this problem is to utilize encoder-decoder frameworks, where an encoder converts source sentences into fixed-length vector representations while a decoder generates target sentence words conditioned on the encoder output vectors. In this framework, the encoder consists of an LSTM layer that processes the source sentence word by word while the decoder also contains an LSTM layer.


The key idea behind these type of models is that they exploit linguistic structure of sentences by processing individual words rather than entire phrases at once. This allows the model to consider not only syntax but also meaning when generating target words. An attention mechanism controls the flow of information across the encoder and decoder hidden states to ensure that the generated target sentence retains necessary contextual information from both sides.

### Why Use Neural Machine Translation?
Neural machine translation has several advantages over conventional approaches:

1. Better Accuracy - Neural machine translation systems use highly sophisticated deep neural networks that capture linguistic structures and correlations across the vocabulary. They provide higher accuracy levels compared to standard statistical methods.
2. Scalability - Neural machine translation models can be trained on larger corpora to obtain better accuracy faster than previous statistical approaches. Moreover, these models can handle more languages with ease since they don't rely solely on dictionary lookups and n-grams. 
3. Non-deterministic Behaviour - Neural machine translation models involve non-deterministic behaviour due to random sampling during inference. Since there is no greedy decoding step involved in traditional statistical MT, errors may occur even if the system produces correct translations. However, with neural models, errors become less frequent as the softmax probabilities converge towards a single decision. 
4. Incremental Learning - Traditional MT systems require retraining whenever new data becomes available, whereas neural models update continuously based on incoming data. Thus, updates to the models are quick and can result in significant improvements in overall accuracy.

Overall, neural machine translation presents a promising alternative to traditional statistical machine translation systems and is rapidly gaining popularity in industry. With the right combination of data quality, algorithms, and hardware resources, neural machines translation could become a competitive solution to current MT tools.
