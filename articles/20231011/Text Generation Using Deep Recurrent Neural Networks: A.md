Deep learning models have made significant advances in the field of natural language processing (NLP) recently. The use of deep neural networks has led to improved performance in various NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and named entity recognition. Despite these advancements, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed for achieving efficient generation of new text content at scale. In this article, we will survey several approaches and techniques for generating new text using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These approaches include classical statistical methods such as n-gram and Markov chain based approaches, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) models with attention mechanisms. We will also discuss applications of each approach on a variety of NLP tasks like automatic text summarization, question answering, and dialogue systems. Finally, we will analyze the current limitations of RNN-based approaches and suggest future research directions. 

In summary, this article aims to provide an up-to-date overview of recent developments in RNN-based approaches for generating new text content at scale. It provides an in-depth understanding of different models used for text generation, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, along with specific implementation details. Additionally, it discusses how these models can be applied to real-world problems by considering the context in which they should be deployed. Overall, the purpose of this review is to inform the reader about the latest developments in NLP through systematic comparison of existing models and to facilitate further research in this area.

Text generation refers to the process of producing sequences or paragraphs of natural language text automatically from scratch, without any human intervention or assistance. This task is especially challenging because of two main factors: (i) length variability and complexity inherent in generated text; and (ii) high degree of creativity required to produce coherent and fluent sentences. RNN-based approaches have emerged as one of the most promising strategies for solving this problem. An RNN model consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, where each node takes input from its previous layer's output(s) and produces some output signal. The sequential nature of inputs makes it suitable for modeling temporal dependencies in data. 

The basic idea behind RNN-based approaches is to train them on large amounts of preprocessed text data consisting of long sequences of words. During training, the model learns the patterns and relationships between individual words, which allows it to generate novel sentences or complete documents without explicitly providing the desired sentence structure or syntax. There are three key components involved in building an RNN-based model for text generation: 

1. Input encoding: This involves converting raw text into a format that can be fed into the model as input. The simplest way to do this is to represent each word in the vocabulary as a fixed-size vector using either word embeddings or character-level representations. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, while character-level representations capture syntactic relationships. 

2. Sequence generation module: This is responsible for producing the actual sequences of output tokens during inference. Typically, this module uses a combination of repeated matrix multiplication operations and activation functions called gates to compute the probability distribution over all possible next words in the sequence. 

3. Output decoding: This stage converts the predicted probabilities into meaningful sequences of words or characters. One common technique is to apply beam search algorithm, which explores multiple paths in the probability space to find the best candidate solution at each step. Another technique is to use a simple greedy decoding strategy, which selects the highest probable token at each time step until the end-of-sentence marker is reached. 

Overall, modern RNN-based approaches offer significant benefits over traditional statistical techniques such as n-grams and Markov chains, including scalability to larger datasets, better interpretability of the learned features, ability to handle complex input sequences, and more accurate predictions. However, due to their high computational cost, it may not always be feasible to train these models on large corpora containing millions of examples. As a result, other techniques like GANs and Seq2seq models have become popular alternatives, but their theoretical underpinnings remain unclear. 


# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
This section describes the general architecture and operation of typical RNN-based models for text generation. Specifically, we focus on four representative types of models - language models, conditional language models, sequence-to-sequence models, and transformer models - and briefly summarize their respective properties and drawbacks.

## Language Models
Language models aim to predict the probability distribution of the upcoming word given the sequence of previously seen words. They are often trained on large datasets of texts that cover a wide range of topics, allowing them to learn the likelihood of different words appearing together. 

### Unigram Model
The first type of language model is the unigram model, which assumes that the probability of a word depends only on the presence of that word in the corpus. That is, if a particular word appears k times in the corpus, then its probability is simply proportional to k. Mathematically, the unigram model can be written as follows: 

P(w|W_t) = P(w) 

where W_t denotes the sequence of previously seen words and w is the current word being considered. The probability of w can be computed as the total number of occurrences of w divided by the total number of words in the corpus. 

Although the unigram model performs well in practice, it does not take into account the order of the words in the sequence, so it cannot accurately capture the dependency between adjacent words. 

### Bigram Model
To address the shortcomings of the unigram model, bigram models introduce the concept of n-gram. Essentially, instead of looking at single words independently, bigrams combine the occurrence of two consecutive words to estimate the probability of the third word. For example, if the phrase "the quick brown fox jumps" appears frequently in a corpus, then the probability of the word "jumped" would depend on both the presence of "quick brown" and "fox". To build a bigram model, we assume that the probability of a word depends both on the presence of the previous n-1 words and the nth word in the corpus. Mathematically, the bigram model can be written as follows:

P(w|W_{t-n+1},...,W_t)=\frac{c(W_{t-n+1},...,W_tn,w)}{c(W_{t-n+1},...,W_t)}

where c() represents the count of the corresponding n-gram frequency in the corpus. 

The bigram model addresses the issue of word order, but it still suffers from sparsity problem. If we encounter a phrase that never occurred before, then the bigram model will assign zero probability to it. To mitigate this problem, trigrams and higher order n-grams were developed. Trigrams consider triples of words while higher orders consider longer sequences of words. All of these n-gram models suffer from the curse of dimensionality, meaning that they require much higher computation resources than simpler models. Therefore, state-of-the-art models rely heavily on tricks such as back-off and interpolation to improve their accuracy while keeping the model size manageable. 

However, even though language models perform well in practice, they lack flexibility to capture polysemy and ambiguity. Some words can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which they occur, making it difficult to determine the correct interpretation of ambiguous sentences. 

## Conditional Language Models
Conditional language models extend the standard language model to incorporate additional information about the surrounding text, known as context. This enables them to make better decisions when generating new text, leading to more fluent and coherent results. Three variants of conditional language models exist - dirichlet, latent variable, and hierarchical. 

### Dirichlet Language Model
Dirichlet language models are very similar to unigram and bigram models, but now the probability of a word depends not just on its frequency in the corpus, but also on the probability assigned to each distinct preceding sequence of words. More specifically, let Θ denote a set of smoothing parameters, and let Z[i] be the set of all n-tuples of words ending with word i. Then, the probability of word j following word i conditioned on the context Z[j], assuming no unknown words, can be estimated as:

P(wj|Zi[j]) = \frac{\#(Wi[-k]+...+Wi[j])+\#\sum_{z∈Z}Wz}{\#\#(Wi[-k]+...+Wi[l])+Θ_i} + \frac{1-\#\#(Wi[-k]+...+Wi[j])}{\#\#\#(Wi[-k]+...+Wi[l])+KΘ_i} * prod_{z∈Z}(1-P(zj|Zi))^θ_iz

where Wi[i] denotes the i-th word in the tuple of words Zi, and Θ_i is the smoothing parameter associated with word i. By setting Θ=1 for every word i, we recover the original bigram model. 

The dirichlet language model captures correlations between subsequent words across contexts, which improves the quality of generated text compared to plain unigram/bigram models. However, computing the denominator requires iterating over all contexts, making it less efficient than the standard bigram/unigram models. Additionally, since the model relies on exact counts of n-grams in the corpus, it tends to overfit to small datasets. To combat these issues, hierarchical language models can be used. 

### Latent Variable Language Model
Latent variable language models combine ideas from Bayesian statistics and latent variables to create a powerful tool for capturing complex contextual dependencies among words. Intuitively, a language model encodes the overall probability distribution over possible sentences as a function of observed words, ignoring the underlying causal structure of the language itself. However, instead of trying to directly infer the joint probability of all possible words in the sequence, latent variable models factorize the joint probability into marginals representing independent latent variables, and then use these variables to estimate the likelihood of each observed word given the values of the latent variables. 

Specifically, suppose we have K latent variables {v1,..., vK} and wish to estimate the probability p(x|v1,..., vk) for a sentence x=(xi1,..., xik). Assuming that xi1,..., xik are drawn independently from their respective distributions, we can write:

p(x|v1,..., vk) = p(xi1|v1) *... * p(xik|vk)

We want to estimate the marginal distributions p(vi) and p(xj|vi) for each vi, xj pair, respectively. One approach is to use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which maximizes the log-likelihood of the observations given the model. Alternatively, we can use variational inference, which finds the closest approximation to the true posterior distribution while minimizing the divergence between the approximated and true posteriors. Both methods optimize a lower bound on the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which measures the difference between the true posterior and our approximation, as shown below:

ELBO = E_{q(v1,..., vk)}[\log p(x|v1,..., vk)] - KL(q(v1,..., vk)||p(v1) *... * p(vk))

Since the ELBO is usually non-convex, optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent typically struggle to converge. To address this issue, hybrid variational inference combines MLE and variational inference, leading to faster convergence rates and better solutions than standard variational inference. 

The latent variable language model offers great promise for improving the accuracy and robustness of text generation compared to conventional language models. However, it requires careful design of the approximate inference procedure and handling of missing data, making it more prone to errors and suboptimal solutions. Additionally, inference can be slow and resource-intensive, limiting its applicability to large-scale datasets.

## Sequence-to-Sequence Models
Sequence-to-sequence models are deep learning architectures that map an input sequence to an output sequence of target tokens. Each element of the input and output sequences is mapped to a vector representation, which is then passed through a series of hidden layers to produce a probability distribution over all possible outputs. They differ from standard encoder-decoder models in that they don't use separate input and output decoders. Instead, they employ shared weights across all layers and allow the decoder to attend to different parts of the input at each time step.

A simplified version of the sequence-to-sequence model looks like this:

Encoder: Inputs → Context Vector 
Decoder: Previous Outputs + Context Vector → Next Output

The encoder processes the input sequence and computes a fixed-size context vector that represents the entire input sequence. The decoder generates each output token sequentially, taking the previous output and the context vector as input. At each time step, the decoder applies a multi-layer perceptron to compute the probability distribution over all possible output tokens and attends to relevant parts of the input sequence. Once the final output token is produced, the whole sequence is returned as output.

There are several variations of the sequence-to-sequence model, ranging from vanilla RNNs to attention-based seq2seq models. The choice of hyperparameters such as the number of layers, size of hidden states, and dropout rate can greatly affect the performance of the model, requiring careful tuning. Common extensions include pointer networks and copy mechanism that enable copying words from the input sequence into the output sequence, effectively doubling the number of output vectors and extending the effective context window. 

Sequence-to-sequence models offer several advantages over plain RNN models for generating text. First, they operate on variable-length input sequences, making them more suited for modeling long texts such as news articles or conversations. Second, they encode the probability distribution over all possible output sequences rather than relying on hard alignment constraints, leading to more flexible and expressive models. Third, they can easily be adapted to different NLP tasks, reducing the need for specialized designs for each task separately. Fourth, they leverage advanced optimization algorithms such as Adam and Adagrad to avoid local minima, enabling easier training and greater stability.

Unfortunately, however, sequence-to-sequence models tend to exhibit slower inference times and memory usage than RNN models, particularly for longer sequences. Additionally, attention mechanisms can sometimes lead to vanishing gradients, causing the model to collapse early on. Lastly, since the model maps entire input sequences to a single fixed-sized output vector, it can be less helpful in addressing sophisticated concepts or domain-specific terminology that require fine-grained reasoning beyond the scope of the input sequence.
