# 1.背景介绍


Euclidean space embedding (ESE) is a powerful tool for data visualization and analysis in many scientific fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, engineering, finance, and economics. It allows researchers to visualize complex structures in low-dimensional spaces by transforming the original high-dimensional datasets into two or three-dimensional shapes that are more easily analyzed and interpreted. In recent years, various algorithms have been proposed for ESE, including t-SNE, UMAP, MDS, Isomap, and LLE. However, it remains an open problem to determine which algorithm is most suitable for specific applications or datasets. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive overview of ESE algorithms with mathematical models and step-by-step tutorials for using each one. Specifically, we will cover:

1. Introduction to Euclidean space embedding 
2. Common concepts and connections between different ESE algorithms 
3. Detailed explanations and illustrative examples of core algorithms (t-SNE, UMAP, MDS, Isomap, LLE), including equations, implementation details, usage scenarios, and evaluation metrics.
4. Practical implementations and code snippets for popular tools like Python libraries, R packages, MATLAB functions, etc., as well as their performance evaluation results.
5. Future trends and challenges for ESE development
6. References and Appendixes
This tutorial can serve both scientists and developers who want to learn about and use ESE methods effectively in their projects. The detailed introduction of core algorithms enables readers to understand the underlying principles and evaluate the suitability of each method in different settings and contexts. Moreover, practical implementation samples provide helpful references for developers interested in implementing ESE algorithms from scratch or using pre-existing libraries. This article also includes guidelines and tips for effective communication within the scientific community, enabling all participants to communicate clearly and effectively with others while benefitting from learning opportunities together. Finally, this article should be useful to anyone interested in visualizing and analyzing complex data sets in higher dimensions through ESE techniques.

The article is structured as follows: Section 2 presents an introductory chapter to Euclidean space embedding, discussing its history, theoretical foundations, and application areas. Section 3 reviews common concepts and connections among different ESE algorithms, including distances, similarities, optimization objectives, and initializations. Section 4 presents detailed explanations and illustrative examples of core algorithms, ranging from traditional dimensionality reduction methods to advanced non-linear manifold learning approaches. Each section contains clear math formulas, graphics, and sample codes for easy understanding and reproduction. Lastly, Section 5 evaluates the performance of these algorithms across several real world datasets, demonstrating how they perform under different circumstances and constraints. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with a summary, future directions, and references and appendices.

Overall, this article serves as a valuable reference resource for practitioners and students in science and technology fields alike. It provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of essential components of ESE algorithms, helping researchers and engineers choose the appropriate approach for their specific needs, as well as enable them to quickly apply new methods and integrate them into existing workflows. 

# 2.Introduction to Euclidean space embedding 
## History
Euclidean space embedding is a fundamental concept in mathematics, introduced by Leonhard Euler in 1735. At the time, he was working on projective geometry, and his discovery led him to consider the transformation of points in a plane onto a sphere or hypersphere. These transformations allowed him to analyze and represent objects in three-dimensional space without prior knowledge of the internal structure of those systems. Despite being very ingenious and important in geometric applications, Euclidean space embedding has not seen widespread attention until the mid-20th century when the field gained prominence due to breakthroughs in computer graphics, machine learning, and signal processing technologies.
 
In terms of numerical computation, Euclidean space embedding is based on linear algebra and matrix decomposition techniques, especially the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD decomposes any input dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ into three matrices: $U$, $\Sigma$, and $V^T$ such that $X = U\Sigma V^T$. The matrix $U$ contains the left singular vectors of $X$, i.e., eigenvectors of the Gramian matrix $XX^T$. The matrix $\Sigma$ contains the singular values of $X$, ordered in descending order of magnitude, where each value reflects the amount of variance explained by its corresponding vector in $U$. The matrix $V^T$ contains the right singular vectors of $X$, i.e., eigenvectors of the Hermitian conjugate of the Gramian matrix $XX^T$. By selecting the top k eigenpairs $(u_i,\sigma_i,v^*_i)$ from the SVD representation of $X$, we obtain a reduced set of coordinates for representing $X$ in a lower-dimensional space that preserves its most important features and maintains local similarity relationships.

While modern literature seeks to generalize and advance this theory, Euclidean space embedding has remained a central research topic throughout the past half century. Its popularity has increased significantly due to advances in machine learning, statistics, and computing power. Nonetheless, despite its historical importance, Euclidean space embedding still faces many practical issues today, particularly concerning scalability and efficiency of algorithms. Nevertheless, there is much promise ahead for developing novel algorithms to improve computational efficiency and speed up current methods.
