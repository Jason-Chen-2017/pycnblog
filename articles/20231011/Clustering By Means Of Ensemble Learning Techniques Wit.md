# 1.背景介绍


Ensemble learning techniques are a collection of algorithms that combines multiple machine learning models to improve the accuracy and reduce the errors in classification or regression tasks. In this article we will implement ensemble clustering methods using Python with iris dataset for illustration purposes.

In an Iris dataset, there are three species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica) and four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). We want to classify these flowers into their respective species based on their feature values. 

Ensemble learning is particularly useful when you have less amount of data because it combines several weak classifiers together to produce a more accurate result. Here we use Random Forest classifier as a weak learner which helps us to achieve good results even if we don't have much training data. Additionally, we can also try different combination of algorithms like bagging, boosting, stacking etc., to see whether any one of them performs better than others.

Overall, ensemble learning is known as a powerful technique that helps our models to generalize well to new unseen data samples and overcome the problem of overfitting. It's important to understand how ensemble works and its advantages before trying to apply it to real world problems.

We will start by importing necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
```
# 2.核心概念与联系
Ensemble learning is a type of meta-learning technique where several base learners or models combine to improve predictions. There are various types of ensemble learning approaches such as Bagging, Boosting, Stacking and Voting. Each of these approaches has some unique characteristics and benefits depending upon the nature of the task at hand.

### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):
Bagging is an ensemble learning method used for reducing variance of individual models and improving overall model performance. The idea behind bagging is to generate multiple subsets of training data from original dataset with replacement and then train a separate model on each subset. This process repeats several times and each model contributes to building an ensemble of highly accurate models without any correlation among them. Bagging generates low variance estimates and hence reduces overfitting. 

### Boosting:
Boosting is another popular ensemble learning algorithm that focuses on combining diverse models to create a stronger classifier. In contrast to bagging, boosting trains each model on the same input data but iteratively updates the weights assigned to the misclassified examples to make subsequent models focus more on difficult cases. Boosting provides higher bias estimates compared to bagging. However, since boosting involves sequential iterations, it takes longer time to converge to the best solution. 

### Stacking:
Stacking uses two level architecture where top layer consists of multiple classifiers like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests etc., while bottom layers consists of two or more outputs from previous level. The final prediction is calculated as the weighted sum of all outputs from both levels. Stacking generally produces better predictive accuracy compared to single level models. But, due to computationally expensive optimization procedures, it requires significant computational power and may take long time to optimize. 

### Voting:
The voting approach is similar to majority vote in regular elections where several candidates compete to decide the outcome. Similarly, the voters submit their opinions about the given item and the most voted option wins. Voting is a simple yet effective way to combine different models into a single output but lacks diversity of underlying models. Hence, it tends to underfit the data due to its simplistic nature.
