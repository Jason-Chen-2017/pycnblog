# 1.背景介绍


Optimal stopping is a classic problem in economics and management where an agent wants to choose between several possible actions with different costs, benefits, and risks to maximize his long-term utility or minimize losses. The optimal stopping problem has been studied in various fields such as finance, operations research, and game theory. 

In this article, we will focus on one specific type of optimal stopping problem called "stopping time". In this problem, an agent starts from a given initial condition and must decide when to stop an activity by making some investment or other action that involves a certain risk, depending on what outcome he expects. If the expected outcome happens sooner than anticipated, then the agent should stop early to avoid loss; if it takes longer, then the agent should wait for the expected outcome. This process can be repeated multiple times over the course of years or decades, leading to the development of strategies for optimally stopping activities based on expected outcomes.

The central challenge of optimal stopping problems is determining the best timing of stopping, i.e., when the agent should initiate the activity to maximize its potential benefit while minimizing the associated risks. Traditional methods used to solve these problems involve mathematical optimization techniques, but recent developments have led to the use of machine learning algorithms that learn to predict optimal decisions through decision trees. 

Decision trees are powerful nonparametric models that allow for the automated construction of classification rules by analyzing data features and their relationship with the target variable. Decision trees have become increasingly popular due to their ability to capture complex relationships between input variables and outputs without requiring explicit assumptions about the underlying distribution of inputs or outputs. In particular, decision trees can be applied to optimize stopping time problems because they provide a theoretical framework to understand how the agent's behavior depends on various factors and allows us to identify patterns and trends across datasets to make predictions and recommendations.


We will describe here the main principles behind decision trees for solving optimal stopping problems, explain the details of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm used to implement them, demonstrate the performance of MCTS on real world examples, and highlight future directions and challenges for further research. 


# 2. Core concepts and connections
## 2.1 Optimal Stopping Problems
Optimal stopping problems refer to the task of selecting the optimal time or action point at which to take some action, subject to constraints on risk and expected value. There are two types of optimal stopping problems commonly encountered in practice:

1. Stopping Time Problem: An agent starts at time $t_0$ and needs to determine the optimal time at which to stop an activity, taking into account both immediate utility gains and potential future loss in case the expected outcome does not materialize beforehand. 

2. Stopping Cost Problem: In this scenario, the goal is to minimize the total cost incurred during the lifetime of an agent by deciding when to make an investment, project, or other decision that leads to a specified change in state or parameter. Here, each potential action has a known cost and uncertainty, and the objective is to find the sequence of actions that minimizes the overall cost with respect to the uncertainties and tradeoffs among choices made along the way.

These problems can be formulated as decision-making problems under uncertainty, where the agent's beliefs and preferences are represented by random variables and uncertainty is modeled through probabilistic reasoning and inference processes. For instance, in the stopping time problem, the agent may face a choice among a range of possible times, each with a corresponding probability of occurrence, representing the level of certainty regarding the duration of the activity. Similarly, in the stopping cost problem, the agent faces a variety of possible investments with varying levels of success, risks, and opportunity costs, which affect the overall cost of pursuing any single path.

## 2.2 Decision Trees
A decision tree is a widely used class of statistical models for both classification and regression tasks. It is similar to a flowchart, consisting of nodes representing conditions on the predictor variables and branches connecting children nodes to the next node in the hierarchy until a terminal node is reached. Each branch corresponds to a possible outcome of the decision, while the leaf nodes represent the predicted values or classes assigned to new observations according to the conditions set at each node.

Decision trees were originally developed for computer science applications involving pattern recognition and prediction, but have also found applications in a wide range of domains including finance, marketing, operations research, bioinformatics, and physics. One common feature of decision trees is that they can handle qualitative and quantitative input variables and produce accurate results even in cases where the relationship between inputs and outputs is nonlinear. They can also accommodate missing data and handle both continuous and discrete data.

In optimal stopping problems, decision trees offer a powerful methodology for understanding the underlying structure of the decision-making process and automatically generating optimized stopping schedules. Specifically, decision trees can model the sequential nature of the agent's response to incoming information and generate optimal decisions that maximize long-term utility while minimizing risks. By recursively splitting the input space into regions based on the outcomes of previous actions, decision trees can approximate the optimal solution to the stopping problem by identifying areas where there is high probability of achieving maximum gain. By combining this approach with efficient pruning procedures, decision trees can efficiently handle large amounts of input data and construct highly effective classifiers for various decision-making scenarios.


## 2.3 Monte Carlo Tree Search
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), proposed by Wierstra et al.(1994), is a general purpose tree-search algorithm that uses a series of simulations to guide the exploration of decision trees and estimate the quality of the resulting solutions. The algorithm works by iteratively building a collection of candidate moves based on the current state of the tree, evaluating these candidates using simulated rollout policies, and selecting the move that appears most promising. As the simulation progresses, the algorithm maintains a tree of possible moves, whose depth and width grow exponentially with the number of iterations, and tracks the probabilities and outcomes of all completed simulations.

When applying MCTS to optimal stopping problems, the key idea is to first establish a rough approximation of the optimal decision rule by considering only a small subset of possible actions and discarding those unlikely to lead to significant improvements. To do this, the algorithm explores the decision space by repeatedly selecting actions randomly according to their prior probabilities, simulating their effects on the remaining state variables, and updating the probability distributions accordingly. Based on the accumulated evidence, the algorithm constructs a decision tree that captures the likely optimal paths and stops expanding nodes that appear to be redundant or irrelevant. Finally, the algorithm evaluates the quality of each subtree and chooses the best one to select as the final stopping schedule.
