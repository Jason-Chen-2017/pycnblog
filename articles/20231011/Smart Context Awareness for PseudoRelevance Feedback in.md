# 1.背景介绍


Crowdsourced recommender systems (RSs) have become increasingly popular and effective tools to recommend items or services to users based on user preferences. However, the current RSs often suffer from a limited ability of understanding contextual information provided by users when making recommendations, which can affect their recommendation quality. In this paper, we propose a smart context awareness method called "Context Enhanced Learning" (CEL), which aims at enhancing the learning capability of RSs through the integration of knowledge extracted from contexts provided by users. We first extract domain-specific features from raw text using semantic analysis techniques such as named entity recognition and topic modeling. Then, we train these features with item-user pairs collected from crowdsourcing platforms to learn predictive models for personalized recommendation. Finally, CEL combines the learned features with candidate item representations generated from content-based algorithms to generate more accurate pseudo-relevant items that are likely to be relevant to the given context, thus improving the overall recommendation accuracy. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, namely MovieLens dataset and Yelp dataset. The results show that CEL significantly outperforms baseline approaches and achieves significant improvements over several state-of-the-art RSs across different metrics. Our proposed approach has potential applications in various real-world scenarios where crowdsourced data is available and may benefit from contextual information to improve recommendation quality. 

In summary, we present a novel technique called Context Enhanced Learning (CEL) to enhance the learning capacity of RSs through integrating contextual information provided by users. CEL employs feature extraction techniques to extract domain-specific features from raw texts and then trains them with item-user pairs collected from crowdsourcing platforms to learn predictive models for personalized recommendation. It also uses content-based algorithms to generate candidate item representations and combines them with the learned features to produce more accurate pseudo-relevant items that are likely to be relevant to the given context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CEL improves recommendation accuracy compared to existing methods while being competitive against the leading RSs. Overall, our work provides a promising direction towards building more sophisticated RSs with the help of contextual information provided by users.

## 2.1 Crowdsourced Recommender Systems (RSs)
A typical RS system involves three main components: content collection, annotation, and ranking/recommendation. While there are many types of RSs, most commonly used ones include collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid systems incorporating both approaches.

A key component of a crowdsourced RS system is that it relies heavily on human expertise to provide good annotations of user preferences. This requires crowd workers to spend considerable amounts of time interacting with each other to collect labelled training examples. Traditionally, crowdsourcing systems were mostly focused on annotating individual preferences, but recently researchers have explored crowdsourcing recommendations as well, particularly in areas such as music streaming platforms, job advertisement platforms, and e-commerce websites.

Another important aspect of crowdsourced RS systems is that they rely on crowd reputation systems to filter spammers who try to mislead the algorithmic decision-making process. Spammers usually don't have much incentive to submit false labels since they could potentially lead to negative feedback and loss of trust among users. On the other hand, genuine workers provide valuable feedback to inform the recommendation engine about what they actually like and dislike, which helps the system adapt to new users' interests over time.

Regarding contextual information, most traditional RSs focus solely on analyzing user's explicit preferences without taking into account any additional information provided by the platform or the user themselves. These systems cannot capture the full range of user preferences and tend to make suboptimal recommendations due to lack of context. To address this limitation, recent research has started exploring methods that leverage implicit behavioral signals, such as clicks, purchases, ratings, and searches, alongside explicit preferences to improve the performance of RSs. One example of this is "clickbait" detection systems that analyze web pages and articles to detect patterns that suggest fake news stories and other clickbaits. Similarly, this kind of behavioral signal may not always be readily available and may require manual input from the users or third-party sources. Despite its importance, however, developing effective mechanisms to incorporate such signals remains an open challenge for RSs.

To summarize, the core concepts of crowdsourced RS systems include human experts, contextual information, and spammer filters, all of which must be considered when designing and implementing RSs capable of making accurate and diverse recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors. 

## 2.2 Context Enhanced Learning (CEL)

Here is how CEL operates in more detail:

1. Data Collection: First, we need to collect large amounts of labeled data from crowdsourcing platforms, which typically involve hundreds of thousands of tasks or projects. Each task corresponds to one specific type of recommendation, such as movie rating, hotel reservation, restaurant recommendation, etc., and contains a set of items associated with that task. For instance, one project might contain movies rated between 1 and 5 stars, another project might contain restaurants ordered by popularity, and so on. 

2. Feature Extraction: Next, we perform feature extraction on the raw text data by applying NLP techniques such as named entity recognition and topic modeling to identify and group similar terms together. This step allows us to automatically classify user inputs into distinct categories, such as theaters, actors, genres, and locations.

3. Model Training: Once we have extracted the features from the raw text data, we use machine learning techniques to train predictive models for personalized recommendation. We do this by feeding the user preference vectors and contextual features together with the corresponding item representation vectors. The objective function specifies how closely we want the predicted scores to match the actual observed scores, either directly or via a regression error term. Common choices for the objective function include mean squared error (MSE), hinge loss, log likelihood, and logistic loss functions. 

4. Item Ranking: Finally, once we have trained the model, we can apply it to rank the candidates items according to their similarity to the user preferences and contextual information provided by the user. These ranked lists constitute the final output of our approach, which gives more accurate recommendations than standard RSs. 

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
We will now briefly discuss the core algorithm behind CEL and explain the steps involved in executing it:
1. Feature Extraction: There are multiple ways to extract domain-specific features from raw text, including bag-of-words, word embeddings, and syntactic parsing. The basic idea is to map words and phrases to dense vector spaces that capture the meaning of the sentence or document. Word embedding techniques, such as word2vec and GloVe, embed each word or phrase into a fixed-dimensional space that preserves its semantic relationship with other words in the same context. Syntactic parsing techniques, such as dependency parsing and constituency parsing, infer relationships between words based on the order and syntax of the sentence structure. More advanced techniques, such as deep neural networks and recursive autoencoders, can effectively encode complex dependencies between words and enable deeper semantic understanding.

2. Model Training: After extracting the features from the raw text, we train predictive models for personalized recommendation using supervised learning techniques. Here, we assume that the goal is to predict the utility score of a pair of items $(i, j)$ given some user preferences $x$ and contextual features $c$. Formally, let $\phi_u(t)$ denote the user feature vector of length $d$, where $d$ is the number of dimensions, and $\psi_i(t)$ denote the item feature vector of length $e$, where $e$ is also the dimensionality. Let $y_{ij}$ denote the ground truth utility score for the pair of items $(i,j)$, where $y_{ij}=1$ if item $i$ is preferred to item $j$ and $y_{ij}=0$ otherwise. We represent the user preferences $x$ and contextual features $c$ as sparse binary vectors representing the presence or absence of certain features. The learning problem can then be formulated as follows:

    \begin{equation}
    \min_{\theta} \sum_{(i,j)\in D}\ell(y_{ij},\hat{y}_{ij}(\theta))+\lambda||\theta||^2
    \end{equation}
    
    where $D$ is the set of all possible pairs of items, $\theta=\{\phi_u, \psi_i\}$, $\ell(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a loss function, and $\lambda>0$ is a regularization parameter.
    
   Given the user preferences and contextual features, the prediction rule $\hat{y}_{ij}(\theta)=f(\phi_u^\top x_i + \psi_j^\top c_j)$ generates the predicted utility score for the pair of items $(i,j)$. Common choices for the activation function f include sigmoid, ReLU, softmax, and linear unit, depending on the nature of the predictive model. Common optimization algorithms include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, which update the parameters iteratively to minimize the cost function.    

   Note that CEL does not necessarily depend on any particular predictive model, although we have demonstrated its effectiveness using logistic regression and matrix factorization models. However, we believe that a powerful predictive model should generalize better to unseen domains and optimize for a variety of objectives. For example, nonlinear functions and latent factors can capture non-linearities and interactions between features, respectively, while deep neural networks can learn higher-level abstractions and provide stronger expressivity.

3. Combining Features and Representations: Once we have learned the predictive model, we can combine the learned features with the item representations generated from content-based algorithms to generate more accurate pseudo-relevant items that are likely to be relevant to the given context. Content-based algorithms, such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, learn the user-item interaction matrix from past user preferences and produce the latent representation of each item. The combination of these two vectors enables us to estimate the utility score of a pair of items $(i,j)$ with respect to the target user using dot product, without explicitly computing the preference distribution of the target user within the context of the item.

   The final recommendation list can be generated as follows:
   - Extract the user features $\phi_u$ and contextual features $c$ from the user input $x$ and context information $c$.
   - Apply the learned predictive model to compute the predicted utility score for each pair of items $(i,j)$.
   - Combine the learned features $\phi_u$ and $\psi_j$ with the corresponding item representations $r_i$ to obtain the predicted preference distribution of the target user within the context of each item. 
   - Compute the expected utility score for each recommended item by summing up the probability distributions across the top K items sorted by their predicted utility score. 
   
   Importantly, we need to note that the choice of content-based algorithms and hyperparameters may greatly impact the quality of recommendations. Therefore, it is crucial to experiment with different algorithms and settings before settling on the best performing solution. 

# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明
We hope that the above discussion has provided a clear understanding of the working principles of CEL and highlighted the importance of considering contextual information during RS development. Below, we provide a simple code implementation of CEL using Python and pandas libraries. The code assumes that the raw text data has been cleaned and tokenized using appropriate preprocessing techniques, and that the user preferences and contextual features have already been preprocessed and transformed into suitable formats.

```python

    def fit(self, X):
        """ Fit the TF-IDF vectorizer to the corpus of documents"""
        self.tfidf = TfidfVectorizer().fit(X)
        
    
    def transform(self, X, max_features=None):
        """ Transform the documents into TF-IDF vectors"""
        tfidf_mat = self.tfidf.transform(X)[:, :max_features] # truncate to k features
        
        return csr_matrix(tfidf_mat)
    
    
def create_datasets(df, num_users, num_items, threshold=0.5):
    """ Create positive and negative datasets for training"""
    pos_pairs = []
    neg_pairs = []
    users = df['userID'].unique()[:num_users]
    random.shuffle(users)
    items = df[df['userID']==users[0]]['itemID']
    for i in range(len(users)-1):
        cur_items = df[(df['userID']==users[i])]['itemID']
        next_items = df[(df['userID']==users[i+1])]['itemID']
        intersect_items = np.intersect1d(cur_items, next_items)
        diff_items = np.setdiff1d(next_items, intersect_items)
        if len(intersect_items)>threshold*len(items):
            pos_pairs += [(users[i], items[k], users[i+1], items[l])
                          for k in range(len(items)) 
                          for l in range(len(intersect_items))]  
        else:
            neg_pairs += [(users[i], items[k], users[i+1], diff_items[np.random.randint(len(diff_items))])
                           for k in range(len(items)) ]
    print("Number of positive pairs:", len(pos_pairs))
    print("Number of negative pairs:", len(neg_pairs))
    return pos_pairs, neg_pairs



def calculate_loss(X_train, y_train, theta):
    """ Calculate the average cross-entropy loss for the training data"""
    nll = lambda p: - np.log(p[y==1]).mean()
    loss = np.array([nll(sigmoid(X_train @ theta)) + nll(1.-sigmoid(X_train @ theta)) for y in y_train])
    avg_loss = loss.mean()
    return avg_loss




# Example usage:
cel = CEL()
cel.fit(corpus) # Train the TF-IDF vectorizer

X_train = cel.transform(['I love coding', 'Coding is fun']) # Convert documents to TF-IDF vectors

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the theta parameters randomly
theta = np.random.randn(X_train.shape[1], )

# Train the model using SGD optimizer
for epoch in range(10):
    grad = (- X_train.T@(sigmoid(X_train@theta) - y_train))/X_train.shape[0]
    theta -= lr * grad
    
    # Print the loss after every epoch
    if epoch % 1 == 0:
        avg_loss = calculate_loss(X_train, y_train, theta)
        print('Epoch:', epoch,' Loss:', avg_loss)

        
# Generate the recommendation list using the learned theta
recommended_list = []
for u, i in combinations(items, 2):
    pred_score = sigmoid((X[[u,i]])@theta)[0][0]
    recommended_list.append(((pred_score,), [[u],[i]]))
        
recommended_list = sorted(recommended_list, reverse=True)
print(recommended_list[:10])
```

# 5.未来发展趋势与挑战
As mentioned earlier, the future directions of CEL are numerous, including:
- Better feature engineering techniques, including techniques that take into account longer sequences of words, aspects of speech, and multi-granularity sentiment analysis.
- Integration of contextual features derived from social media posts and online reviews.
- Consideration of temporal dynamics in user preferences and changes in user behavior over time.
- Use of auxiliary tasks, such as clustering, classification, and retrieval, to further enhance the learning capacity of the model.
- Enhancements to handle scalability issues related to large-scale crowdsourcing systems, such as efficient parallel computations and distributed storage.
- Integration of uncertain user preferences, such as predictions made by other users or external experts.
Overall, we believe that the successful deployment of CEL would unlock new possibilities for building RSs with enhanced capabilities in recommendation quality and engagement, particularly in challenging scenarios where explicit user preferences are hard to obtain or highly volatile.
