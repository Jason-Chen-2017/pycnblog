# 1.背景介绍


In this article, we will build our own deep neural networks (DNNs) starting from scratch using only NumPy and pure Python code without relying on any external libraries or frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc., for educational purposes only. We will also explore the core concepts of DNNs to understand their working principles better. 

This project is suitable for developers who want to learn how DNNs work under the hood by implementing them from scratch with a high level understanding of mathematical concepts and coding skills. It can also be helpful if you are an AI researcher interested in building your own deep learning models that may not have been implemented before. 


Our goal here is not to create the most accurate or complex model but rather to get ourselves familiarized with the fundamental ideas behind DNNs, see how they work, and implement one simple version of it. The final result should give us insights into how to improve upon these basic models and apply them more effectively in practice. 

We will start by introducing some basics about DNNs: what are they? Why use them? How do they work internally? And why would someone ever need to make one themselves? After understanding the reasons behind their creation and internal structure, we will dive deeper into specific components of DNNs - hidden layers, activation functions, loss functions, optimization algorithms, and regularization techniques. 

Then, we will build each component of a vanilla DNN step-by-step using NumPy arrays alongside Python code. This process will help us understand how all these components interact together to produce output predictions based on input features. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our models through various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, confusion matrix, and other evaluation measures. 

By the end of this project, we hope to gain proficiency in implementing DNNs from scratch using NumPy arrays and pure Python code, which we can then use to build powerful machine learning models for real-world applications. 

Note: I am aware that there already exists many great resources online to learn about DNNs and how to build them. However, in my opinion, this project serves as a hands-on approach to getting our hands dirty while exploring the inner workings of DNNs and applying the theory learned to practical problems. Additionally, building from scratch does provide an opportunity to test out new ideas and approaches, something we often struggle when trying to implement complex systems. Ultimately, it's up to you whether you prefer a more theoretical or applied read!


# 2. Core Concepts and Relationships

Before diving into the details of implementing different parts of a vanilla DNN, let’s first understand some important terms and relationships used throughout the rest of the article. Here are some key concepts and definitions to keep in mind:

- Input layer: This represents the data fed into the network. In supervised learning tasks, the input includes both feature vectors and corresponding labels. For example, in image classification tasks, the input might include images of different objects and the corresponding labels could indicate the object type for each image. Similarly, in natural language processing tasks, the input might be sequences of words and the labels could represent the desired output for each sequence. The size of the input layer is determined by the number of features present in the dataset.

- Hidden layers: These are intermediate layers between the input and output layers. Each hidden layer receives inputs from the previous layer and outputs its results to the next layer. The purpose of having multiple layers is to enable the network to extract complex patterns from the input data and abstract higher-level features. The number of neurons in a hidden layer is usually chosen depending on the complexity of the problem at hand. A good rule of thumb is to start with relatively few neurons in the first hidden layer and gradually increase the size as you add additional layers until you reach the maximum capacity of the network (i.e., the upper limit where adding further layers won't significantly improve performance).

- Output layer: This represents the final layer of the network. It produces the final prediction for the given input data. Its size depends on the number of target classes in the task being solved. For example, in binary classification tasks, the output layer has two neurons representing the probability of the positive class and negative class respectively. In multiclass classification tasks, the output layer has multiple neurons, each representing the probability of each possible class label. During training, the network adjusts the weights of each connection in the network towards minimizing the error between predicted values and true values, known as the cost function. There are several loss functions available for this purpose, such as cross-entropy, mean squared error, and Huber loss, among others. Once trained, the network uses the learned weights to generate predictions for new input data.

- Activation Function: This is a non-linear transformation applied to the weighted sum of the inputs received by each neuron in a given layer. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, softmax, and so on. The choice of activation function affects the speed, stability, and range of values that can be produced by the network. Some activation functions perform well even when facing vanishing gradients, making them useful for deep neural networks with long chains of multiplications. Others like leaky ReLU address the "dying relu" problem during training, which occurs when neurons become inactive due to small gradient values.

- Loss Function: This is a measure of how closely the predicted output matches the actual output. During training, the network tries to minimize this loss function to update the weights in each connection to reduce the difference between predicted and actual values. Different types of loss functions correspond to different types of regression problems, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and SVM. Cross-entropy loss is commonly used for multi-class classification problems since it penalizes incorrect classifications with high confidence. Mean squared error and Huber loss are popular choices for continuous variable regression tasks.

- Optimization Algorithm: This is the algorithm used to optimize the parameters of the network during training. Popular options include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, and so on. SGD updates the weight of each connection using a fraction of the gradient computed for that connection, which helps prevent overshooting local minima. Other variants like momentum and Nesterov accelerated gradient descent (NAG) take into account the velocity of the gradient to accelerate convergence. Adam optimizer addresses the “problem of slow convergence” encountered in traditional SGD methods, by adapting the learning rate and adaptive moment estimation scheme to the distribution of the gradient.

- Regularization Technique: This is a technique used to avoid overfitting. It adds a penalty term to the cost function that discourages large weights, thus reducing the flexibility of the model to fit noise in the training data. L2 regularization is the most common form of regularization, which adds a quadratic penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. Dropout is another widely used regularization technique, which randomly drops out some neurons during training to force the network to learn more robust representations of the input data. By combining different regularization techniques, we can achieve a balance between fitting the training data well and generalizing well to unseen data.
