# 1.背景介绍


In this article we will discuss and implement two main types of reinforcement learning algorithms - Q-Learning and Policy Gradients using the OpenAI Gym library. This library provides us with a wide range of environments to experiment our algorithms on and thus makes it easier for us to test them before deployment.
Q-Learning is a model-free, off-policy algorithm that learns by updating its Q function based on the results of previous actions and observations. It can be used for both discrete action spaces or continuous action spaces depending on whether the environment has fixed or variable action values. In this tutorial, we will use the MountainCar-v0 environment which consists of a car on a one-dimensional track. The goal is to reach the flag on the rightmost point of the track by applying positive acceleration input (action=1) or braking input (action=-1). We will train an agent to learn to balance itself without crashing into any obstacles. 

Policy Gradient methods are another type of reinforcement learning method that works by estimating the policy directly from the data generated during training. These methods often work well when the action space is large and continuous. They can handle stochastic policies where each state might have different probabilities of taking different actions. We will use the CartPole-v1 environment which involves balancing a pole on a cart while preventing it from falling over by applying negative action inputs until the pole falls down. Our agent must learn to control the angle of the pole so that it stays within the designated region at all times.

Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves agents interacting with their environment through trial-and-error methods to maximize rewards. There are three main components involved in Reinforcement Learning: Environment, Agent, and Reward System.
The Environment defines the problem domain in which the agent interacts with. It contains the state variables, possible actions, and feedback reward signals. The agent's objective is to select actions to maximise cumulative reward received after each decision. Different problems can be defined as long as there is some form of interaction between the agent and its surroundings. For example, consider a game like Go where the agent controls a stone position on a board to capture surrounding stones. Another example would be a self-driving car system where the agent must choose appropriate speed, direction, and gearing settings to keep up with traffic flow and maintain safety.
An Agent is a software program or hardware device that performs actions in response to perceived states and generates actions. Agents take actions based on the current observation they receive from the environment. Two common classes of RL agents include Model-based (such as AlphaGo), Model-free (such as Q-Learning), and Actor-Critic (such as DDPG, A2C). However, these categories are not exclusive and other combinations may also exist. An Agent is trained to learn from experience in order to improve its behavior and performance. In particular, the agent explores its environment by trying out new actions and analyzing the outcomes to find optimal ones.
Finally, the Reward System is responsible for generating the feedback signal that indicates how good an agent's decisions were made. This could involve achieving specific goals, completing a task successfully, or receiving penalty points if certain behaviors are observed. For example, if an agent drives too quickly or makes mistakes, then it receives a small penalty. On the other hand, if an agent completes a complex task, then it gets rewarded with additional bonus points.
Overall, the combination of the above components enables agents to learn dynamic strategies for solving challenging tasks. In fact, the name "reinforcement" refers to the process of optimizing rewards and ensuring exploration of uncharted territory.

## Q-Learning
Q-Learning is a model-free, off-policy, temporal-difference RL algorithm. Its basic idea is to estimate the value of each state-action pair by taking into account the expected future reward derived from those pairs. Mathematically, given a transition probability distribution π(a'|s',r|s,a) and the reward r, the Q-value of state s, action a is updated as follows:

where γ is the discount factor, V(S') is the maximum Q-value among all possible successor states S'. Here, T(s,a,s',r) represents the tuple consisting of the next state s', action a', and immediate reward r obtained after executing action a in state s. The update rule assumes that the agent only explores, i.e., ε-greedy strategy is employed to explore uniformly random actions epsilon proportion of the time.

One advantage of Q-Learning over Monte Carlo Methods is that it takes into account all possible future rewards rather than focusing on the average reward. Additionally, it does not require access to the transition dynamics of the environment. Therefore, it can solve more difficult problems than traditional methods due to its ability to take uncertainty into account.

However, the Q-Value estimates tend to oscillate around the optimum values and suffer from variance issues. To address these issues, techniques like eligibility traces and double Q-Learning can be used to reduce the variance of the estimates. Double Q-Learning involves using two separate Q-functions to select actions, reducing the impact of overestimation errors caused by selecting actions that seem particularly beneficial initially but become less beneficial as further steps are taken. 


### Implementation in Python
Here is an implementation of Q-Learning in Python using the OpenAI Gym Library:

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

env = gym.make('MountainCar-v0') # create environment
num_actions = env.action_space.n # number of possible actions

def q_learning(alpha=0.5, gamma=0.9, epsilon=0.1):
    """
    alpha : learning rate [0,1]
    gamma : discount factor [0,1]
    epsilon : exploration rate [0,1]
    
    Returns the optimal policy and corresponding Q-table
    """

    # initialize Q table with zeros
    Q = np.zeros((env.observation_space.high[0]+1, num_actions))

    # iterate until convergence or episode limit reached
    num_episodes = 1000
    max_steps = 200
    for i in range(num_episodes):
        done = False
        step = 0
        obs = env.reset()
        
        # perform epsilon greedy exploration
        if np.random.uniform() < epsilon:
            action = np.random.choice(range(num_actions))
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[obs])
            
        # run episode
        while not done and step <= max_steps:
            # take action and get new state, reward, and terminal status
            new_obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
            
            # determine best action for new state according to Q table
            new_action = np.argmax(Q[new_obs])
            
            # update Q table using Bellman equation
            td_target = reward + gamma*Q[new_obs][new_action]
            td_delta = td_target - Q[obs][action]
            Q[obs][action] += alpha*td_delta
            
            # perform epsilon greedy exploration
            if np.random.uniform() < epsilon:
                action = np.random.choice(range(num_actions))
            else:
                action = np.argmax(Q[obs])
                
            # update variables for next iteration
            obs = new_obs
            step += 1
        
    return Q
    
optimal_Q = q_learning()
print("Optimal Policy:")
for x in np.linspace(-1.2, 0.5, num=20):
    print(np.argmax([optimal_Q[int(x*20)][i] for i in range(num_actions)]))
    
    
# plot results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(list(range(len(optimal_Q))), list(optimal_Q[:,0]), label="position")
plt.plot(list(range(len(optimal_Q))), list(optimal_Q[:,1]), label="velocity")
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("Episodes")
plt.ylabel("Value Function")
plt.show()
``` 

This code creates a mountain car environment using the OpenAI Gym library. The `q_learning()` function implements the Q-Learning algorithm. It initializes a Q-table with zero values and iteratively updates the Q-values according to the Bellman Equation. If the agent selects an action at random, it uses the maximum Q-value estimated for the current state as the next action. Otherwise, it explores randomly using an ε-greedy strategy. After running several episodes, the function returns the final Q-table containing the optimal policy. Finally, it plots the Q-function over episodes using Matplotlib.
