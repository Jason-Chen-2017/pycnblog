# 1.背景介绍


Without code, how can an organization build a powerful and reliable software system that meets the needs of its users? This article explores ways to achieve this by using other approaches such as design thinking, lego blocks, block-based programming languages, and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. We will analyze each approach based on its own strengths and weaknesses before presenting our recommendation for organizations who want to create high-quality enterprise software without relying on technical expertise.

To start with, let’s understand what software is in general terms. In simple words, it refers to any piece of computer programs or data used to provide support or perform tasks related to business operations. Enterprise software covers all types of software systems designed specifically for use within an organization, including customer relationship management (CRM), human resource management (HRM), accounting, payroll, inventory management, etc. The purpose of these systems is to simplify business processes and improve efficiency across the organization while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and maintaining trustworthiness. 

Now, why do we need to build enterprise software without coding skills? It turns out there are several benefits:

1. Increased productivity
Many industries require complex applications that involve numerous calculations and multiple levels of interconnectivity between different modules. Building enterprise software requires extensive knowledge about various technologies, processes, and methodologies. Without skilled developers, implementing such complex solutions would be a daunting task. With AI-powered tools and block-based programming languages like App Inventor, engineers can quickly develop prototypes and test them against user feedback. 

2. Improved customer experience
Customers expect fast and efficient service from their company. Despite the added complexity of managing complex systems, many companies still rely on paper-based manual workflows. Using technology to streamline these processes can help to reduce costs, improve speed, and enhance customer satisfaction.

3. Reduced risk
Software systems are prone to errors and vulnerabilities. Creating complex systems manually takes time, resources, and expertise. By automating parts of the process, organizations save valuable time and money. Additionally, integrating external services and APIs allows for seamless integration into existing ecosystems and reduces overhead.

4. Simplified maintenance and upgrades
The rise of mobile devices has made it easier for employees to access the same information stored in the cloud, enabling self-service capabilities. Systems built without code also offer improved maintainability due to centralized control over application configurations and settings. Changes can be rolled back in case of issues or updates can be easily distributed throughout the organization.

However, not everyone agrees that simply creating enterprise software without coding is always beneficial. Some organizations have concerns about security, privacy, performance, scalability, and reliability, which can become increasingly significant when dealing with sensitive or critical information. These considerations must be carefully considered depending on the specific requirements of your project. If you are considering building enterprise software without code, here are some tips to make sure you choose the right tool and approach for your project:

# 2.Core Concepts & Relationship
## Design Thinking
Design thinking is a human-centered approach to problem solving and innovation that encourages people to collaborate, empathize, and reflect on ideas in order to generate new ideas and products that solve real problems. By breaking down barriers to communication and collaboration, design thinking enables teams to come up with creative and innovative solutions to challenging problems. In enterprise software development, design thinking involves incorporating insights gained through interviews, surveys, focus groups, and ethnographic studies into the solution design process. Key steps include ideation, brainstorming, sketching, prototyping, testing, refining, and revising.

Benefits of design thinking:

1. Empathy - Design thinking fosters empathy towards customers, users, and stakeholders, allowing for better understanding of the end goal and target audience.
2. Communication - Design thinking facilitates effective communication between team members, providing a clear understanding of objectives and constraints.
3. Insight - Design thinking generates new ideas by exploring possible scenarios, influencing factors, and observing behaviors of others.

## Lego Blocks Programming Language 
Lego blocks is a visual programming language developed by <NAME> that uses pre-built LEGO bricks to program the behavior of robotic and physical objects. Its interface consists of a grid of colorful cubes called blocks that act as variables and operators for controlling robotics hardware. Users connect blocks together to construct more complicated functions that can be saved and reused later. Unlike traditional programming languages like Java or Python, Lego blocks lack explicit syntax and instead relies on defining logic by manipulating symbols on the screen. However, the ease of learning makes it popular among teachers and students.

Benefits of Lego blocks:

1. Flexibility - Lego blocks provides a flexible environment for experimentation and prototyping, making it ideal for developing applications rapidly.
2. Adaptiveness - Lego blocks allow for easy customization and modification, making it adaptable to different projects and contexts.
3. Instant results - Lego blocks enable quick iteration cycles during the early phases of development, resulting in faster delivery times and reduced error rates.

## Block-Based Programming Languages
Block-based programming languages are relatively new in the field but have seen a revival recently due to advances in machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. These languages represent a hybrid approach where individual pieces of code are combined to form more complex structures that abstract away underlying complexity. Popular examples include App Inventor, MIT App Inventor, Scratch, Snap!, and Blockly. Each language offers unique features such as drag-and-drop functionality, user-friendly UI, and cross-platform compatibility. Many enterprises already utilize these tools for building complex applications and digital experiences.

Benefits of block-based programming languages:

1. Enhanced code readability - Code written in block-based languages is organized, modular, and concise, making it easier for non-technical individuals to understand and modify.
2. Reusable components - Developers can reuse previously created components and customize them further for different projects.
3. Cross-platform compatibility - Different platforms can be targeted simultaneously with shared libraries and microservices architecture.

## Artificial Intelligence Techniques
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subset of computer science that focuses on developing machines that can learn and reason like humans. There are several AI techniques commonly used for building enterprise software, including natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and decision trees. These methods automatically extract meaningful information from unstructured text or image datasets, predict outcomes based on past trends, and automate decision-making processes. Examples of AI techniques being applied in enterprise software include chatbots and virtual assistants that respond to questions or provide recommendations, personalized content recommender systems that recommend relevant articles or videos, and stock trading bots that suggest buy/sell signals based on historical prices and market conditions.

Benefits of AI techniques:

1. Increased accuracy - AI models can accurately identify patterns and relationships in large datasets, leading to higher overall accuracy compared to hand-coded rules or procedures.
2. Automated decision-making - AI techniques can make decisions based on inputs and prior knowledge, reducing workload and improving employee engagement and retention.
3. Better decision-making processes - AI models can integrate into existing business processes and work flows, making it easier to automate routine processes and improve consistency and quality of service.
