Computer vision is a rapidly developing area that has seen an explosion in recent years with the advancement of deep neural networks and improved hardware. With advanced algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being able to extract significant features from images, computer vision applications have become increasingly important in our lives. In this article, we will explore one particular type of attention mechanism called visual attention, which provides contextual information about the objects present in an image while processing it by a CNN. 

Attention mechanisms play a crucial role in enabling modern state-of-the-art models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture meaningful representations from complex scenes. Traditionally, the feature maps produced by CNNs are flattened into a large vector representation of length `N`, where N stands for the number of filters used in the last layer of the network. However, in many cases, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or long sequences, using only the raw pixel values alone may not be sufficient for capturing complex relationships between different parts of the input image.

The power of visual attention lies in its ability to selectively attend to specific regions of the image at various stages of processing, based on their relevance to the task at hand. When designing architectures specifically for computer vision tasks, visual attention mechanisms can help to achieve better performance than other types of attention mechanisms due to their ability to focus on relevant details without overlooking irrelevant ones. This helps to enhance the overall accuracy of the model by improving the extraction of key features from the input image.

In this article, we will briefly explain the working principles of visual attention mechanisms and then dive deeper into some of the latest advances in applying these techniques to computer vision problems. We will also highlight some common pitfalls and challenges faced by practitioners who want to apply visual attention mechanisms in their work, before finally concluding with open questions and suggestions for future research directions.

# 2. Core Concepts and Interactions
## What is Visual Attention?
Visual attention refers to the process of selectingively focusing on certain regions of an image while processing it through a neural network architecture. It involves integrating spatial relationships among pixels, temporal dependencies within sequences, and the visual cortex’s ability to track salient objects and their movements across multiple frames of video. Visual attention mechanisms provide a way for the system to selectively focus on different aspects of the input image, making it more efficient and effective in extracting features that are informative and relevant to the problem under consideration. These mechanisms enable CNNs to learn abstract representations of the world that are useful for a wide range of computer vision tasks, including object detection, classification, segmentation, action recognition, and generative modeling.

There are several types of visual attention mechanisms, but two of the most commonly used are Global Attention and Local Attention. Both rely on calculating weighted sums of the input image based on individual pixels' importance scores calculated based on their proximity to each other. While global attention mechanisms consider the entire input image at once, local attention mechanisms perform computations on small regions of the input image separately and aggregate them together afterward. Different combinations of these approaches can lead to unique results, depending on the specific problem being addressed.



### Global Attention:
A typical example of a global attention mechanism is called Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, proposed by Hu et al.[1] SE blocks consist of three components: first, a pooling operation is performed on the input feature map to reduce its size and increase the receptive field of the next layer; second, a fully connected layer followed by activation functions performs adaptive weighting of the reduced feature map; and third, another fully connected layer with sigmoid activation function produces attention weights per channel. The final output of the SE block is obtained by multiplying the original feature map with the attention weights generated by the latter layers. By doing so, SE achieves “adaptive recalibration”[2] by reducing the impact of low-importance areas, thus ensuring high-level semantic understanding. Here is how the SE block works: 





Local Attention: Another approach is local attention mechanisms which use a sliding window approach to compute attention scores for every patch of the input image. The basic idea behind local attention mechanisms is similar to global attention mechanisms, except they operate on smaller patches of the image instead of the whole image. A set of such windows are created alongside the standard feedforward pathway, which processes the input image in parallel. Each window is processed independently and generates a query vector that is fed into a special attention module that computes soft alignment scores between the query vector and all image locations. The resulting score distribution is passed back to the corresponding window to produce refined outputs. Overall, local attention mechanisms have shown promising results compared to global attention mechanisms[3]. They offer higher computational efficiency because they avoid redundant calculations and hence decrease the computational burden on the GPU during training and testing phases. One disadvantage of local attention mechanisms is that they require specialized modules to handle variable input sizes. Nonetheless, it seems likely that local attention mechanisms will continue to gain traction in computer vision as they demonstrate promise towards solving a wide range of tasks related to natural language processing and machine translation. Here is how local attention mechanism works:



## How Does Visual Attention Work?
Now let us discuss in detail how does visual attention work internally and what factors affect its effectiveness?

### Data-Driven Approach:
When building a deep learning model for computer vision, visual attention mechanisms typically involve incorporating additional inputs derived from visual signals in addition to the raw image. Some popular examples include synthesizing depth maps, surface normal maps, saliency masks, and instance segmentation maps. For instance, in order to obtain accurate instance segmentations, pre-trained Mask R-CNN networks usually generate class-wise mask predictions from coarse spatial predictions made by a region proposal network. To exploit both the class labels and geometry information associated with instances, the authors propose generating instanced depth maps and instance normal maps simultaneously. Similarly, given the same class label, different shapes and sizes can lead to distinct appearance patterns and hence result in overlapping masks. Hence, it becomes essential to combine multiple modalities in visual attention mechanisms to ensure complete and robust instance segmentation. 

Another interesting aspect of data-driven methods is that they try to leverage the fact that human eyes are highly reactive to changes in scene content and structure. This makes it challenging to directly optimize the selection of visual features since humans cannot directly make sense of tens of thousands of features at once. Instead, systems need to devise heuristics or priors that capture visual concepts such as texture, color, and shape that are associated with visual concepts that people naturally associate with familiar objects or actions. Therefore, it is often advantageous to incorporate domain knowledge into visual attention mechanisms to guide the decision process rather than relying solely on visual features extracted from the input image itself.

### Learning-Based Approach:
One of the main reasons why visual attention mechanisms are so powerful is because they involve an interaction between the visual system and the underlying learned representations. As mentioned earlier, traditional CNNs tend to simply compress high-dimensional inputs into a fixed-size vector representation without considering any relationship between the elements in the space. However, with careful attention mechanisms, CNNs can effectively extract features that are informative and relevant to the task at hand. 

To understand how learning-based visual attention mechanisms work, let us consider a simplified version of a simple CNN architecture. Suppose we wish to classify animals based on their facial expressions. Given an RGB image of an animal, we would expect the CNN to automatically identify the expression in the face and subsequently use it to predict whether it belongs to the category of interest.

In this case, the visual system is responsible for detecting the faces in the image and identifying the landmarks that correspond to them. Once it identifies these landmarks, it passes those features to a separate branch of the CNN dedicated to predicting the expression categories. The output of this branch is combined with the already computed features from the initial layer of the CNN to form a joint representation of the full image. Finally, a classifier is trained to learn to recognize the correct category based on this joint representation.

This kind of interaction between the visual system and the underlying learned representations is central to the success of deep learning models in computer vision. Intuitively, it suggests that it should be possible to construct more expressive and flexible models that can extract more rich and diverse features from the input image while still relying on structured priors to direct the attention mechanism towards relevant regions.
