# 1.背景介绍


Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi are classic games that have been played for thousands of years. In recent decades, reinforcement learning has achieved some success in developing AI systems that can play these games well. However, developing an AI system from scratch requires a significant amount of human resources and expertise in both the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the game playing. Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective algorithms and models that can automate the planning process during the training phase, which allows AI agents to learn effectively on their own without any guidance or supervision. This article focuses on how we plan using deep reinforcement learning techniques in Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi games. We aim at building efficient computer programs that use this learned model to solve these games faster than humans. Specifically, we present our approach to optimize performance while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. 

In order to achieve this goal, we first introduce two new types of methods: forward search and backward planning. Forward search uses a set of policies generated by a neural network to explore different actions and outcomes throughout the game tree. Backward planning takes advantage of known moves, rules, and strategies used by players to make smart decisions about which action to take next based on the current state of the game. These insights provide us with valuable information that helps us improve our RL agent’s ability to master the games we play. Our proposed method, called AuroraNet+, combines the strengths of forward search and backward planning through a novel architecture inspired by biological neural networks. The key idea behind AuroraNet+ is to separate value estimation and policy inference into two independent tasks so that each task can be trained separately and combined later to obtain better results. 

Our proposed method successfully learns to play Atari games such as Pong, Breakout, and Space Invaders, improving over the state-of-the-art approaches significantly. We also show that AuroraNet+ can quickly adapt to new games even if they are very different from those previously seen, making it a powerful tool for domain transfer research. Additionally, we evaluate AuroraNet+ against several strong baselines in chess and shogi games, achieving higher wins and draws compared to the baseline approaches. Finally, we discuss potential limitations of our approach, including suboptimal exploration due to limited search depth and lack of generalization capability across different games, and propose directions for future research in this area. 

The main contributions of this work include: 

1. Proposing AuroraNet+, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates forward search and backward planning to optimize Atari gameplay.

2. Implementing AuroraNet+ in Python, PyTorch, and OpenAI Gym environments, enabling its application to real-world problems outside the classical domains.

3. Evaluating AuroraNet+ on multiple Atari games, showing that it outperforms other existing methods significantly.

4. Discussing the challenges of applying deep reinforcement learning to complex Atari games and proposing ways to address them in the future.

# 2.核心概念与联系
In this section, we will briefly introduce related concepts and terminologies used in this paper.
## Game Tree
A game tree is a tree structure representing all possible states of a given game, including positions, pieces, available moves, and rewards obtained at the end of each move. It is commonly represented graphically by nodes connected by edges where the edges represent legal moves between nodes. Each node represents a unique position within the game.

For example, let's consider a simple tic-tac-toe board like this one:

```
---------
| X | O |
---------
|   |   |
---------
|   |   |
---------
```

Each cell in this board corresponds to a node in the game tree, and there are eight possible winning combinations: `X` wins along rows/columns, `X` wins diagonally, `O` wins along rows/columns, and `O` wins diagonally. For simplicity, we assume that the game ends when either player gets three consecutive marks (`XXX`, `OOO`), which would correspond to a leaf node in the game tree.

## Policy Network
A policy network is a neural network function approximator that outputs a probability distribution over actions given an observation (state). This output is usually interpreted as the "policy" of the agent - what action(s) should be taken in response to the environment's state? When implementing the policy network in Atari games, we typically choose to use convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers to extract features from the input image and generate probabilities for various actions. To train the policy network, we need to define a loss function and update the weights accordingly. During inference, the network selects the most likely action according to the predicted probabilities.

## Value Network
A value network is another type of neural network function approximator that estimates the expected return of being in a particular state. Given a state, the value network generates a scalar value indicating the long-term reward expected from the current position. Traditionally, value functions are estimated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a heuristic search technique that explores the game tree recursively by selecting the most promising child nodes and simulating random rollouts until reaching a terminal state. Using MCTS is computationally expensive and may not scale to large games, so value networks have become increasingly popular in modern reinforcement learning.

To implement the value network in Atari games, we again use convolutional layers and fully connected layers to extract features from the input image and predict a scalar value for the expected return. Training the value network involves defining a loss function and updating the weights accordingly. While evaluating the policy network, we can add the predicted values of subsequent states to compute a discounted sum of rewards. Alternatively, we can directly estimate the return using a bootstrapping approximation that discounts the future returns based on the prediction error. Both of these methods require more computational resources than standard value updates but can potentially lead to more accurate predictions.

Overall, the policy and value networks together form the core components of our AuroraNet+ algorithm. By separating value estimation and policy inference, we can build an efficient program that makes use of prior knowledge and observations to efficiently navigate complex game spaces.

# 3.核心算法原理及具体操作步骤
## AuroraNet+ Overview
As mentioned earlier, AuroraNet+ consists of two components: a policy network and a value network. 

### Policy Network 
The policy network receives an observation (a frame of the game screen) as input and produces a probability distribution over actions as output. Specifically, the network inputs an RGB image of size $W \times H$ and passes it through four convolutional layers to produce feature maps of sizes $(\frac{W}{2}) \times (\frac{H}{2}), (\frac{W}{4}) \times (\frac{H}{4}), (\frac{W}{8}) \times (\frac{H}{8}),$ and $\frac{H}{16}$. These feature maps are then flattened and passed through four fully connected layers before generating a softmax distribution over five possible actions.  

We use cross entropy loss to train the policy network with the objective of maximizing the average surrogate log-likelihood ratio (ALR) over sampled trajectories starting from the initial position defined by the policy network. The ALR measures the improvement in the likelihood of following the optimal policy over randomly selected actions induced by the sampled trajectories. 

To speed up convergence, we initialize the parameters of the policy network with pre-trained ResNet-18 weights pretrained on ImageNet, reducing the number of iterations required for successful training. We further augment the dataset by flipping, rotating, zooming, and adding noise to the images, resulting in improved generalization capabilities. 

### Value Network
The value network receives an observation (a frame of the game screen) as input and produces a scalar value indicating the expected return of being in that state. The network inputs an RGB image of size $W \times H$, passes it through six convolutional layers to produce feature maps of sizes $(\frac{W}{2}) \times (\frac{H}{2}), (\frac{W}{4}) \times (\frac{H}{4}), (\frac{W}{8}) \times (\frac{H}{8}),(\frac{W}{16}) \times (\frac{H}{16}),$ and $\frac{H}{32}$, flattens the result, and passes it through three fully connected layers to produce a scalar output. The output layer activation function is linear since we want the value to remain non-negative. 

We use mean squared error (MSE) loss to train the value network with the objective of minimizing the mean square error between the predicted and actual returns computed using bootstrapped Q-learning. Bootstrapped Q-learning involves computing the target return as a weighted combination of the immediate rewards and discounted future returns based on the predicted values of subsequent states. Weights are updated using gradient descent with momentum to accelerate convergence and prevent oscillations. 

### AuroraNet+ Algorithm Summary

1. Initialize policy and value networks
2. Generate $k$ parallel episodes starting from different initial positions using the policy network 
3. Compute bootstrap targets for each trajectory by combining the immediate rewards and discounted future returns derived from the value network 
4. Update the value network using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent with momentum to minimize the mean square error between the predicted and actual bootstrap targets 
5. Train the policy network using the ALR loss function to maximize the overall improvement in the likelihood of following the optimal policy over randomly chosen actions produced by the sampled trajectories  
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for $t$ timesteps, where $t$ is determined by the length of each episode
7. Return the final policy network
