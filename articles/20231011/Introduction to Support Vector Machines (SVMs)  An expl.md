# 1.背景介绍

Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector classification, are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression analysis. They can be thought of as a "support" vector in the higher-dimensional space created by all the training data points, with the objective of finding the hyperplane that best separates them into different classes based on some predefined criteria such as maximizing the margin or minimizing the error rate between the two classes. The main idea behind SVM is to find the most optimal hyperplane that correctly classifies the data points without misclassifying any of them due to noise or outliers. 

Traditional machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and decision trees cannot handle non-linear relationships within the dataset, while neural networks can be computationally expensive for large datasets. However, SVMs offer an alternative approach by using kernel functions which enable us to use non-linear decision boundaries in the space defined by the input features instead of directly mapping them to the output labels. These kernels help model complex relationships in the data better than linear models. In this article we will explain the basic concepts of SVMs along with their mathematical formulations and implementation details. We will also demonstrate how SVMs can solve various problems including binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks. Finally, we will conclude with some future directions in the field of SVMs.

Let's start with understanding the background of SVMs. 

# 2. Core Concepts and Related Terms
Before delving deep into SVMs, let's understand some related terms.

1. Hyperplane: A straight line or curve in high dimensional space used to separate two or more classes of data points. 
2. Margin: The distance between the hyperplane and the closest data point(s). If it is small then SVM has a good separation performance otherwise it may not perform well.
3. Non-linearity: Ability of the problem to capture non-linear relationships within the data. Often represented by the use of non-linear transformations.
4. Kernel function: Mathematical function that transforms the original feature space into a new one where it becomes easier to apply traditional machine learning methods. It helps in creating non-linear decision boundaries in the transformed space. There are several popular kernel functions used in SVMs. 

Now that you have a basic understanding of these terms, let's move forward to understanding SVMs in detail. 

# 3. SVM Math Formulation 
In order to make predictions using SVM, we need to define the decision boundary that splits the dataset into two regions. This boundary is defined by the support vectors, i.e., the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane. One way to choose the best hyperplane is to maximize the margin around the support vectors. The margin is calculated as the minimum distance from either side of the hyperplane to the support vectors. The equation of the hyperplane depends on the value of w and b and the goal is to minimize the following cost function:

J = −w^Tw + C * sum[max(0, 1 – y_i * (wx_i +b))]

where J represents the cost function, w and b represent the weights and bias parameters respectively, y_i is the label of the i-th example, wx_i is the dot product of the weight vector w and the i-th example x_i, and C is a regularization parameter. When C is set to zero, the optimization problem reduces to finding the maximum margin hyperplane, but when C is positive, we get soft margin condition which allows the margins to be smaller in some cases at the expense of violating the hard margin constraint.

To optimize the above cost function, we need to compute its gradient and update the values of w and b iteratively until convergence. The iteration process repeats until there is no significant change in the cost function after each iteration. Once the hyperplane is learned, we can use it to classify new examples by computing their scores on the hyperplane and taking the sign of the score as the predicted class label. We can also measure the accuracy of the classifier by comparing it against the true labels of the test set. Here is the complete math formulation of SVM: 

# Given a labeled training dataset D={x_i,y_i} and a test set T={x_{test},y_{test}} :

## Set Parameters:

C : float, default=1
    Regularization parameter. The strength of the regularization is inversely proportional to C. Must be strictly positive. The penalty is a squared l2 penalty. 
    
kernel : string, default='rbf'
    Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm. It must be one of ‘linear’, ‘poly’, ‘rbf’, ‘sigmoid’, ‘precomputed’ or a callable. 
    If none is given, ‘rbf’ will be used. 
    
    
gamma : {'scale', 'auto'} or float, default='scale'
    Kernel coefficient for ‘rbf’, ‘poly’ and ‘sigmoid’.
    If gamma is'scale', then it uses 1 / (n_features * X.var()) as value of gamma,
    
    
    if gamma is 'auto', it uses 1 / n_features.

    

degree : int, default=3
    Degree of the polynomial kernel function ('poly'). Ignored by all other kernels.


coef0 : float, default=0.0
    Independent term in kernel function. It is only significant in 'poly' and'sigmoid'. 


shrinking : bool, default=True
    Whether to use the shrinking heuristic.

    Whenever alpha is updated during processing an instance, and eta is less than 1, 
    shirinking is performed in case the dual variable gets too small or negative.
    Otherwise, the solution keeps getting updated even though it is already converging.


tol : float, default=1e-3
    Tolerance for stopping criterion.


cache_size : float, default=200
    Specify the size of the kernel cache (in MB).
    
    
class_weight : {dict, 'balanced'}, default=None
    Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``. If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.
    The “balanced” mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``
