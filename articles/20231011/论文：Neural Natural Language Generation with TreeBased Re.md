# 1.背景介绍



Natural language generation (NLG) is an essential task in modern artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP), which aims to generate human-like text by using machines to model linguistic concepts and reasoning mechanisms. The key challenge of NLG is the syntactic structure that involves complex reasoning over multiple sentences or paragraphs, making it a challenging problem for both traditional statistical methods and neural networks. Despite these challenges, several recent advances have shown that tree-based models such as syntax-based models and compositional models can significantly improve the performance of NLG tasks. In this paper, we propose two new tree-based models named Neural PCFGs and Neural CP trees, which are inspired by probabilistic context free grammars and constrained phrase structures, respectively. We further develop novel algorithms for learning these models from unannotated data and evaluate their performance on diverse NLG benchmarks. 

The first part of our contribution focuses on introducing and discussing the core concept of these tree-based models, including probabilistic context-free grammars and constrained phrase structures. We also present detailed analysis about how each component contributes to the overall model's ability to generate fluent and coherent sentences. 

In the second part, we provide a detailed algorithm description of training and decoding NPCGs and CPTs and analyze its properties such as memory usage, convergence speed, and output quality. Moreover, we present a unified optimization framework for jointly optimizing NPCGs and CPTs simultaneously based on the ideas of structured prediction and latent variable inference. This approach allows us to achieve significant improvements compared to existing approaches on various benchmark datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models through experimentation on three popular NLP tasks: machine translation, summarization, and dialogue generation. Our results show that our proposed models can generate more fluent and accurate outputs than the state-of-the-art baseline models.

## Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (NPCGs)
Probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) represent a class of formalisms used in natural language processing where individual words are generated independently given some fixed set of rules, called productions. These productions are organized into a hierarchy, with higher-level productions generating substrings that are used by lower-level productions to form complete phrases or sentences. Each word in a sentence has a probability distribution specified by the probabilities assigned to all possible next words according to the current position in the derivation tree. 

Tree-structured PCFGs or neural PCFGs incorporate hierarchical representations of constituents in addition to linear sequence representations. They use a stack-like mechanism to keep track of partially formed derivations and encode them as binary trees. Hypotheses are represented as directed acyclic graphs and the likelihood of any hypothesis is computed using dynamic programming techniques. Unlike traditional context-free grammars, which only allow one non-terminal expansion per rule, neural PCFGs allow arbitrarily many expansions for each non-terminal during parsing.

## Constrained Phrase Structures (CPTs)
Constrained phrase structures (CPTs) are another type of context-free grammar representation used in natural language processing. CPTs define the structure of sentences by defining constraints between different parts of speech, typically corresponding to grammatical roles. For example, the NP head in a CPT might correspond to the subject of a sentence, while the VP head corresponds to the verb. By enforcing these constraints, CPTs ensure that generated phrases follow consistent grammatical patterns and semantics.

CPT parsers build parse trees by selecting non-terminal nodes that satisfy the conditions imposed by the constraints defined in the CPT. These constraints act like sieve filters, discarding inconsistent derivations early in the process. One advantage of CPTs over traditional CFGs is that they can capture richer semantic relationships among components within a sentence. However, due to their greater complexity and sensitivity to variations in input, CPT parsers may not be suitable for everyday applications.

Tree-structured CPTs or neural CPTs leverage similar principles as neural PCFGs to learn hierarchical representations of constituents. They also use a stack-like mechanism to keep track of partially formed parses and encode them as binary trees. Like neural PCFGs, CPT parsers use dynamic programming to compute the likelihood of any parse, but they do so iteratively rather than exhaustively search all possible derivations. This improves efficiency and prevents parser combinatorial explosion for long inputs.

## Learning Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (NPCGs)
We start with a corpus of parallel sentences consisting of source and target texts. We then randomly split the corpus into training and validation sets, and initialize parameters for our model such as the size of the vocabulary, the number of non-terminals, and the initial weights of the random variables associated with each production rule. 

To train our model, we perform the following steps for each sentence in the training set:

1. Parse the source sentence into a tree structure using a beam search algorithm.
2. Convert the parse tree into a sequence of terminal and non-terminal symbols that represent the sentence structure.
3. Compute the probability of each symbol and store them alongside the previous history of generated symbols. 
4. Use backpropagation to update the weight vectors associated with each production rule based on the accumulated loss gradients.

During decoding time, we generate a target sentence starting at a special end-of-sentence token and proceed by repeatedly expanding the most likely non-terminal node based on the highest probability predicted by our model. To avoid repeating previously generated symbols, we maintain a list of previously generated tokens and enforce recurrency constraints based on their positions in the derivation tree. If the list becomes too large, we prune out the oldest entries to prevent the decoder from getting stuck in local minima.  

Our model can handle high-level syntactic phenomena such as coordination, adverbial modifiers, and passives by allowing arbitrarily many expansions for each non-terminal during parsing. It also automatically discovers and uses biases in the dataset to bias towards common and informative productions, improving robustness against rare or irrelevant productions. Overall, our method provides efficient and effective ways to learn high-quality PCFGs from massive amounts of unannotated data. 

## Learning Constrained Phrase Structures (CPTs)
To learn constrained phrase structures, we begin with a small set of handcrafted templates that specify a subset of dependency paths that should exist between certain pairs of non-terminals. For example, we could specify that a particular noun phrase should always be preceded by an adjectival modifier that modifies the same noun. Similarly, we would specify that a subject in a sentence must immediately precede the predicate verb. 

Next, we collect a dataset of parallel sentences that consist of source and target texts annotated with the appropriate dependencies. We preprocess the data to extract relevant features such as path length and argument counts from the annotations, and normalize the numerical values to standardize the scale of our inputs. During training, we fit logistic regression models to predict the presence or absence of each constraint condition based on the feature vectors extracted from the sentences. Once we have trained our classifiers, we use them to filter candidate hypotheses during decoding. We select the top k candidates based on their likelihood score, where k represents the desired precision level. After decoding, we postprocess the resulting parse trees to remove spurious extractions caused by overlapping constraints and return the final result.  

Our method relies on logistic regression models to identify and rank potential constraints across the entire space of valid combinations of non-terminals, making it scalable to large corpora and handling complex interactions between constituents. The learned constraints are then used to guide the search process during decoding, providing powerful automatic disambiguation abilities that cannot be achieved solely through lexical and morphological resources alone. Additionally, our system supports incomplete annotation by treating missing elements as wildcards that match any value of the corresponding feature, enabling semi-supervised learning techniques to improve accuracy even when only partial data is available.

Overall, our work shows that neural tree-based models can effectively handle difficult syntactic phenomena, such as nested compound subjects and deep coordinate structures, and learn rich representations of constituents that make them well-suited for natural language understanding tasks.
