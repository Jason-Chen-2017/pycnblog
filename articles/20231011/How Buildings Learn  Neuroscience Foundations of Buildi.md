# 1.背景介绍


The human brain is the most complex organ in our body, it has about 100 billion nerve cells that interconnect with each other to form networks that allow us to process information quickly and intuitively. In the same way, buildings are constructed using a combination of materials, structural designs, thermal performance factors, lighting regimes and mechanical systems all working together to ensure their comfort and functionality. 

This article will provide an overview of how buildings learn and how we can leverage this learning for better outcomes. We will start by exploring some fundamental neuroscience concepts like the developmental sequence of the hippocampus, executive functions, memory formation and spatial navigation and how these principles have been used to improve building performance over time. We will then focus on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as deep reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms or genetic algorithms to optimize building performance over time. Finally, we will explore the potential future of building AI technology through its role in creating new business models and improving urban planning in the built environment.

Building AI technology requires large amounts of data collected from sensors around the building to train machine learning models. This requires careful engineering approaches to ensure privacy and security of sensitive data while minimizing noise and errors. The effectiveness of these technologies cannot be underestimated because they can help reduce energy consumption, increase productivity and enable more efficient use of natural resources.

In summary, this article provides an excellent opportunity for anyone interested in building science, computer science, neuroscience, software engineering, and economics to gain insights into how humans and buildings interact and learn at an unprecedented level. It also encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills across multiple disciplines to integrate ideas and knowledge and generate practical solutions to real-world problems. These achievements require a shared understanding and collaboration between various fields and expertise. Within the next decade, building AI technologies could revolutionize many aspects of our lives, including transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and education.

## Developmental Sequence of the Hippocampus:
The hippocampus, located in the midbrain, is responsible for long-term memory and visual perception. It works in conjunction with the cerebral cortex to support higher-level cognitive abilities like decision making and reasoning. Around the age of 7 months, hippocampal place cells appear and begin to grow in number. They help direct short-term memory storage and retrieval processes. Over the years, however, this region expands and contracts, resulting in changes in size and shape, allowing placenta to move up and down throughout the body.

Initially, hippocampal areas are arranged in layers known as functional sequences based on different stages of development. The oldest layer is called the dentate gyrus and consists mostly of cells associated with language functioning, speech production, reading, and problem solving. Next, there are progressively smaller regions within the hippocampus, ending with the pyramidal layer which contains motor control mechanisms. These layers become increasingly specialized towards specific tasks, providing enhanced processing capabilities for memories related to those tasks.






## Executive Functions:
Executive functions refer to mental abilities that operate beyond normal cognition. Some key executive functions include intuitive understanding, attention, working memory, social interaction, and self-control. These abilities are highly developed during childhood but tend to plateau at older ages. However, recent research shows that there are no clear boundaries between the executive and cognitive functions.

There are several studies demonstrating that executive functions are organized in separate parts of the brain. One area is the frontal lobe, where executive functions like memory and problem-solving take place. Another part is called the parietal lobe and focuses on cognitive functions like working memory and problem-solving. Other executive functions are found in the temporal lobe, relating to the conscious experience of time, emotional state, mood, and sleep quality. Additionally, there are parts of the occipital and orbitofrontal cortex involved in cultural sensitivity and affective processing. Overall, these diverse executive functions contribute to adaptability, flexibility, and creativity among individuals.
