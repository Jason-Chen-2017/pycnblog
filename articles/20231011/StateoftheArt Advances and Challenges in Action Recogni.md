# 1.背景介绍


Action recognition is one of the most important computer vision tasks that enables machines to understand the human actions being performed by humans or animals. This technology has been widely used in a wide range of applications such as robotics, gaming, surveillance systems, security monitoring, etc. In recent years, several deep learning based approaches have emerged for action recognition including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), which are highly efficient, accurate, and suitable for real-time processing. 

However, there are still many challenges ahead for achieving state-of-the-art performance on this challenging task due to various factors such as large scale data, limited computation resources, lack of annotated training datasets, dissimilarity among different action categories, variations in viewpoint, and diversity of human behaviors. These challenges require us to focus on exploring more advanced solutions and incorporating new techniques to address them. With these advancements, we may be able to overcome all current limitations and achieve higher accuracy levels. We need an interdisciplinary approach towards addressing these challenges so that our solution can benefit from the collective knowledge and skills of diverse experts across fields.

In this article, I will give a comprehensive overview of existing methods and their advantages and shortcomings for action recognition. Moreover, I will highlight future research directions and present some promising avenues for further progress in action recognition research using deep learning. Finally, I will conclude with open questions and future perspectives that need to be addressed to accelerate action recognition research development.

# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
## 2.1 Action Understanding
Action understanding refers to identifying what an actor is doing within a video sequence without explicitly defining the exact motion, pose, or object positions involved in the action. The goal of action understanding is to enable machines to capture, analyze, and interpret the activities of individuals or other objects. There are three key steps involved in action understanding:

1. Feature extraction: Extract relevant features from the input video sequences that can characterize the actors' behavior. For example, traditional computer vision algorithms like feature detection, tracking, and description can be applied to extract image features. However, this step requires manual labor and subjectivity. 

2. Action localization: Once the features are extracted, they need to be assigned to individual actions and segments within each video sequence. Traditional algorithms like HMMs, K-means clustering, or SVMs can be used to perform this task.

3. Action classification: Based on the localized features and their corresponding segmentations, the machine can classify each action into predefined classes. For instance, the activity of playing tennis could be classified under the category "sport". 

The main difference between action recognition and action understanding lies in its level of abstraction. While action recognition aims at recognizing specific instances of actions (such as jumping up and down), action understanding focuses on understanding what type of actions are occurring, rather than detecting specific instances. Despite this distinction, both problems are closely related. Action understanding builds upon the work of computer vision researchers who have focused on building visual representation models capable of capturing complex interactions between multiple moving objects and people [7]. By contrast, action recognition involves much deeper computational models and expertise in pattern recognition [2,3,5]. 

Furthermore, while the two problems can be thought of as separate but interconnected, it is worth noting that they can also be considered to be subproblems of a common problem, i.e., multi-modal action recognition. Multi-modal means that there can be multiple sources of information involved in determining how an actor performs an action. These include video, audio, social cues, sensors, eye-gaze, and speech [6] leading to increased complexity of the problem. 

## 2.2 Action Recognition Techniques
There are several types of deep learning architectures for action recognition, which include CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and Hybrids. Most modern approaches use either CNNs or RNNs in combination with additional techniques like attention mechanisms, self-supervised learning, and transfer learning. Here, let's discuss some popular methods and their strengths and weaknesses.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep neural network designed specifically for analyzing images and videos. It consists of layers of filters, which slide over the input image or video, computing weighted sums of pixel values within small regions. Each layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the activation map, effectively filtering out irrelevant information. The final output of the network is typically a probability distribution over predefined classes or actions.

Some of the benefits of CNNs for action recognition include:
* Compactness: Since CNNs only consider local dependencies, they are well-suited for handling high-dimensional inputs like videos. They have fewer parameters compared to other architectures like RNNs, making them faster and less computationally expensive.
* Translation equivariance: A major advantage of CNNs is their ability to recognize the same action regardless of where it occurs in the frame. This property makes them ideal for action recognition tasks involving movement in space or time.
* Flexibility: CNNs can be easily modified to handle new tasks or datasets by adding more layers or changing the architecture altogether. This allows researchers to adapt CNNs quickly to suit different requirements.

Some of the drawbacks of CNNs for action recognition include:
* Limited temporal resolution: Since CNNs process inputs sequentially, they cannot exploit spatio-temporal relationships between frames. To mitigate this limitation, RNNs and Transformers are often used in conjunction with CNNs to provide additional contextual information.
* Weakly invariant to viewpoints: In general, actions captured from different viewpoints lead to significant differences in appearance and motion. CNNs trained on monocular videos tend to perform poorly on stereoscopic videos, requiring specialized techniques to handle this aspect of variation. 

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that operates on sequential data, usually represented as series of vectors or arrays. They are particularly useful for natural language processing and speech recognition because they can take into account the order in which elements appear in the sequence. Similar to CNNs, RNNs consist of hidden states that carry information through time, allowing them to model long-term dependencies between events.

Some of the benefits of RNNs for action recognition include:
* Time dependency: RNNs can capture long-term dependencies between consecutive frames of a video sequence, enabling better predictions about what is happening in the next few seconds.
* Scalability: Because RNNs can deal with variable length inputs, they can be trained on smaller datasets or even single examples, making them practical for real-time inference.
* Non-sequential nature: As opposed to CNNs, which operate directly on spatial domains, RNNs do not rely on global patterns nor position coordinates to determine what constitutes an action. Instead, they leverage simple statistical dependencies across the entire sequence, which makes them effective for modeling complex behaviors.

Some of the drawbacks of RNNs for action recognition include:
* Longer training times: RNNs require longer periods of time to learn good representations of input sequences, especially if they are very deep. This can make them impractical for real-time deployment on embedded devices.
* Computational overhead: RNNs involve exponentially increasing number of multiplications and additions during forward propagation, resulting in slower computations compared to simpler feedforward networks.

### Transformers
Transformers were introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 [4], and offer a novel way of solving NLP problems by leveraging self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence. Unlike regular RNNs, transformers do not rely on hidden states to keep track of information, but rather employ an attention mechanism that assigns weights to every element in the input sequence. Transformers have shown great success in natural language processing tasks like text classification, machine translation, and question answering, as well as reinforcement learning tasks like imitation learning and game play.

### Hybrid Models
Sometimes, combining the strengths of multiple models is necessary to improve overall performance. One possible hybrid approach involves applying pre-trained CNNs to early stages of the pipeline followed by fine-tuning RNNs or Transformers for action recognition. Pre-training CNNs helps obtain robust and transferable features that can then be transferred to RNNs or Transformers for improved accuracy.

Another possible hybrid approach is to combine RNNs and Transformers by creating a unified framework that captures both temporal and semantic relationships across different modalities simultaneously. This leads to stronger multi-modal reasoning capabilities than purely relying on RNNs alone.

Overall, there is no clear winner when it comes to choosing between CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, or hybrids for action recognition. Different architectures require varying degrees of expertise, patience, and trial-and-error to find the best configuration. Nevertheless, it is crucial to adopt strategies such as transfer learning, domain adaptation, and ensemble learning to build end-to-end solutions that perform well on unseen data and accommodate diverse scenarios.

# 3.Algorithmic Principles and Details
Now that we have discussed the core concepts and connections of action recognition, let's dive deeper into the details of the underlying algorithmic principles behind the state-of-the-art approaches. Before proceeding further, I should note that action recognition is an ongoing area of research, with constant updates and improvements. New papers arrive almost weekly and tend to introduce new ideas, tools, and benchmarks. Therefore, the following section does not claim to be complete nor definitive. It serves mainly as a starting point for anyone interested in deep learning-based action recognition.

## 3.1 Single-Stage vs Two-Stage Approaches
Single-stage and two-stage approaches differ in their design strategy. Single-stage approaches apply a fixed set of learned features directly on the raw input video or sensor signals. On the contrary, two-stage approaches first extract representative features from the input signal, and then use another deep neural network to generate candidate actions. The latter part of the system is known as a proposal generator, responsible for generating a list of potential actions given the input features. Then, the proposal generator uses additional supervision signals, such as ground truth annotations or object detectors, to refine the generated proposals and select the ones that correspond to actual actions.

The following table summarizes the main characteristics of single-stage versus two-stage action recognition approaches:

| Characteristics | Single-stage Approach                      | Two-stage Approach                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Training Data   | High-quality labeled datasets             | Low-quality unlabeled datasets                |
| Architecture     | Fixed-feature extractor + classifier       | Feature extractor + proposal generator + predictor    |
| Model Size      | Small                                      | Large                                         |
| Inference Speed | Fast                                       | Slow                                          |
| Lack of Ground Truth | Difficult                                 | Easy                                           |

Two-stage approaches have several advantages over single-stage approaches:

First, they allow the system to concentrate on learning meaningful representations of the input signal, without having to manually engineer complicated hand-crafted features. Second, the second stage of the system is trained to produce action candidates that are likely to happen given the available features. Third, the use of external signals provides additional supervision to refine the generated proposals and reduce the risk of selecting false positives. Fourth, the proposal generator can use a variety of cues from multiple sources of information, improving the quality of the predictions. Lastly, by introducing extra modules, the two-stage approach can capture higher-level features that might be relevant for action recognition.

On the other hand, the main challenge of two-stage approaches is that they may miss out on salient features due to the low-quality input data. Additionally, the addition of extra components increases the complexity of the system, making it harder to tune and debug. Hence, there is a tradeoff between simplicity and efficiency depending on the application scenario and amount of labeled data available.

## 3.2 Trajectory Estimation and Pose Tracking
Trajectory estimation refers to predicting the path that an actor takes during an action. This involves estimating the positions and orientations of the actors' body parts throughout the scene. Pose tracking refers to associating detected body parts with their respective bodies. Both of these tasks are essential components in action recognition pipelines, since they enable the identification of relevant actions and help ensure that the inferred trajectories are consistent with those observed in the original video clip. Common trajectory estimation approaches include fully convolutional networks (FCNs) or siamese networks that compare pairs of consecutive frames to estimate the displacement vector between them.

Pose tracking approaches can be classified into two categories: Dense Pose Estimation (DPE) and Part-Based Methods (PBM). DPE methods attempt to reconstruct a dense skeleton representation for each person in the scene by fitting a 3D model to joint locations and orientations obtained from a multi-view RGB-D camera setup. PBM methods, on the other hand, represent a person as a collection of body parts, and match these parts against templates to identify the identity of the actor. Examples of PBM methods include OpenPose and Stacked Hourglass Networks.

Recently, transformer-based pose tracking methods have become popular due to their scalability and effectiveness in handling variable lengths sequences of poses. The basic idea behind these methods is to encode the pose sequence as a sequence of tokens, and train a transformer model to generate the output. The key idea is to assign importance scores to different parts of the pose, giving priority to important parts of the skeleton that affect the likelihood of an action occurrence. This method has shown exceptional results in various action recognition tasks, such as Human3.6M, NTU RGB+D, and Kinetics. Other methods that have taken advantage of transformer-based pose tracking include TANet, CMT, and AMASS.

## 3.3 Video Representation and Aggregation
One of the central challenges in action recognition is the variability of viewpoints, illumination conditions, scales, and background clutter in the environment. This affects the feasibility of training a single deep learning model on full-length videos. The root cause of this issue is that the shape, size, and content of objects and subjects in a video vary significantly, leading to a non-uniform representation of the scenes and actions within them. Furthermore, the intrinsic ambiguity and complexity of actions make it difficult to align different views of the same person, object, or event across multiple video clips.

To address these issues, several recent works propose to represent videos as collections of compressed frames, referred to as clips. The objective of representing videos as clips is to compress the spatial and temporal continuity of actions in the video and simplify the subsequent analysis. Several methods have developed for compressing videos into clips, including ByteNet and X3D. These methods aim to preserve the motion dynamics and saliency of the video while reducing the dimensionality of the intermediate representations. Additionally, they have demonstrated significant improvements in action recognition performance when compared to standard CNNs and RNNs on benchmark datasets. 

Once the videos have been compressed into clips, it is crucial to aggregate the representations of the actions across different clips. The simplest aggregation technique is to simply concatenate the representations of all the clips. Another approach is to pool the representations of all the clips, similar to pooling the representations of neighboring pixels in a convolutional layer. Pooling operations can result in loss of information, however, and can sometimes lead to degraded performance due to the reduction in spatial precision.

Finally, there are several promising avenues for further progress in action recognition research using deep learning. Some of them include:

1. Integrating geometric knowledge into the representation learning process: Actions and objects in a scene can have complex geometries and structures that impact the decision of whether to execute an action. To handle such cases, geometric priors can be integrated into the feature extraction module or utilized in the generation of candidates. Such priors can come from mesh or point cloud representations, or estimated from depth maps or optical flow. 

2. Combining multimodal information: Many aspects of human activities can be observed through multiple modalities, such as joint angle measurements from joint-position sensors or facial landmarks drawn on an image. To integrate multimodal information into action recognition models, we need to develop multimodal deep neural networks that can jointly process different modalities and enhance the representation power of the input signal.

3. Fusing multiple cameras and sensors: Even though stereo matching has proven to be an effective method for 3D reconstruction, the requirement of multiple overlapping cameras raises concerns regarding privacy and safety. To overcome this obstacle, we need to explore alternative ways of integrating multiple cameras and sensors together, such as cross-camera fusion or virtual reality headsets.

4. Attention-driven approches: As mentioned earlier, transformers have shown great promise in capturing both temporal and semantic relationships across different modalities. However, existing transformer-based pose tracking methods suffer from slow inference speed, which limits their practical usage on embedded platforms. To address this issue, we need to devise attention-driven methods that can dynamically allocate more computational resources to informative parts of the sequence.
