# 1.背景介绍


Machine translation (MT) is a crucial component of modern natural language processing systems. One way to improve the accuracy and efficiency of MT systems is to use advanced deep learning techniques such as transformers. However, transformer-based MT systems still face many challenges including computational complexity and memory consumption, making them difficult to deploy in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an automatic pipeline optimization framework for transformer-based machine translation that can significantly reduce computational cost without significant performance degradation. Our approach first extracts effective features from source sentences using pre-trained embedding models and applies parallel encoding and decoding modules to map the input sequence into an output representation space, thereby enabling efficient computation on limited hardware resources. Then, we design an attention-based multi-head self-attention network architecture which reduces the overall computational load compared to previous methods while maintaining high precision. We evaluate our method through experiments on five Chinese-English translation datasets and show that it outperforms standard transformer architectures under various metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate how our framework can be integrated into a unified end-to-end training system with other components, leading to significant improvements in both speed and quality. Finally, we discuss limitations of our approach and potential future research directions. 

In summary, we present an automatic pipeline optimization framework for transformer-based machine translation that achieves significant reductions in computational cost while retaining high precision. The proposed framework uses pre-trained embeddings and a lightweight yet effective self-attention mechanism to achieve fast and scalable inference. We further integrate the optimized pipeline into a unified end-to-end training system with other components, improving the overall performance of the system. With careful parameter tuning and architecture design choices, our framework can significantly enhance the performance of MT systems while reducing their computational requirements.

Firstly, let us go over some concepts related to machine translation:
 - Text corpus: A collection of text data that contains natural language sentences or documents. It could either be raw texts or preprocessed tokens.
 - Vocabulary size: The number of unique words in the corpus plus the special symbols used by the model (e.g., <pad> token).
 - Corpus size: Total number of words/tokens in the corpus.
 - Tokenization: The process of breaking down text into smaller units called "tokens" based on specific rules like whitespace characters and punctuation marks. These tokens are then fed into the model to generate translations.
 - Preprocessing steps: Various preprocessing steps involved before feeding the tokenized text into the model include normalization, stemming, stopword removal, etc. 
 - Embedding layer: An input transformation technique that maps each word in the vocabulary to a dense vector representation. Word vectors capture semantic meaning and enable modeling of relationships between different words. There are several types of embedding layers like word embeddings, character embeddings, position embeddings, etc. Each type of embedding has its own advantages and disadvantages.

 Next, let's talk about transformers:
  - Transformers: A type of neural network architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 that offers state-of-the-art results in NLP tasks. They use a novel mechanism called attention to perform highly parallelizable operations across sequences. 
  - Encoder: Encodes the input sentence by applying multiple layers of self-attention blocks followed by feedforward networks. This produces a fixed length contextual representation of the sentence that captures important information.
  - Decoder: Decodes the encoded sentence into target language by applying multiple layers of self-attention blocks followed by feedforward networks. It uses encoder outputs at each time step to construct a more comprehensive understanding of the input sequence.
  - Attention Mechanism: Allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence at each time step during decoding. It consists of two parts: Key-Value matrix multiplication and Softmax function. 
      
Now, let's summarize key aspects of our proposed framework:
 - Feature Extraction Layer: Extracts relevant features from source sentences using pre-trained embedding models. These features will be used by the next module, Parallel Encoding Module. The pre-trained embedding models help in capturing semantic meaning and relationships between different words. Currently, GPT-2 and BERT have shown impressive results on various NLP tasks.  
 - Parallel Encoding Module: Maps the input sequence into an output representation space efficiently using parallel computing. Uses attention mechanisms to compute contextual representations of each word in the input sequence. Takes advantage of multicore processors and reduced memory usage to make predictions faster.    
 - Self-Attention Network Architecture: Reduces the overall computational load compared to previous approaches while maintaining high precision. Consists of multiple heads of attention, where each head focuses on different aspects of the input sequence.     
 - End-to-End Training System Integration: Integrates the optimized pipeline into a unified end-to-end training system with other components to obtain better performance. Specifically, integrates feature extraction and compression modules alongside other components like the encoder and decoder in order to train a powerful translator model.
