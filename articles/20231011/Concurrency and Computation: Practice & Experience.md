# 1.背景介绍


Concurrency is a fundamental property of computer systems that enables multiple threads to execute in parallel or concurrently on the same processor core without interfering with each other’s execution. In this article, we will discuss concurrency as it relates to computation. It involves techniques such as synchronization primitives, message passing, task scheduling, thread management, and memory management, among others. We will also examine some related concepts such as parallelism, distributed computing, fault-tolerance, and performance optimization. Finally, we will look at several practical applications of concurrency in real world scenarios like web servers, database queries, messaging systems, and data processing pipelines.
In short, computational problems can be broken down into smaller tasks which can then be executed concurrently using various concurrency mechanisms such as multithreading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming models. The key to achieving high throughput for large scale computing is efficient use of these mechanisms combined with effective algorithms and data structures. To make sense of how different aspects of concurrency work together, we need to understand their interactions and relationships. This requires an understanding of basic principles, protocols, and algorithms used by different concurrency mechanisms and tools. By examining these principles, we can design better software architectures, optimize system resources, identify bottlenecks, and mitigate failures. These insights are applicable across diverse application domains such as mobile devices, cloud computing, big data analytics, and scientific simulations.

This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how concurrency affects computation and how its implementation influences modern software development practices. We begin by defining what constitutes computation and its role in today's digital world. Then, we explore four important areas of concurrency - synchronization primitives, message passing, task scheduling, and thread management. Next, we present advanced topics including parallelism, distributed computing, fault-tolerance, and performance optimization. Our detailed discussion of each area provides actionable guidance for building scalable, reliable, and performant systems. Finally, we highlight some popular real-world applications of concurrency and demonstrate their efficacy in addressing critical challenges such as scalability, latency, availability, and security.

## 2.1Computation
Computing refers to the process of performing calculations. Machines are designed to carry out computations efficiently and accurately. In order to achieve this goal, computers utilize processors, memory, input/output (I/O) units, and communication interfaces. A program running on one machine may interact with programs running on another machine via network connections over the internet. Computational problems include mathematical functions, logical operations, statistical analysis, and pattern recognition. Each problem must be decomposed into manageable subproblems, and solutions found independently for each subproblem should be combined to solve the overall problem. There exist many approaches to solving computational problems, ranging from classical algorithms such as brute force search, divide-and-conquer, greedy heuristics, and dynamic programming, to more recent machine learning methods such as neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. Despite their varying levels of complexity, all computational problems share certain characteristics, including input size, output size, time complexity, and space complexity. Solving a particular problem typically involves multiple iterations, where intermediate results are stored in memory until the final solution is obtained.


## 2.2Concurrency
Concurrency is a fundamental concept in computing that refers to the ability of multiple processes, threads, or tasks to execute simultaneously. However, unlike parallelism, which involves multiple independent processors working concurrently, concurrency involves the simultaneous activation of multiple threads within the context of a single process. In essence, concurrency allows us to leverage multi-core processors and exploit multiple CPU cores simultaneously, providing faster and more responsive processing capabilities.

Concurrent execution of multiple tasks benefits greatly from improved resource utilization. For instance, if a system has two threads that spend most of their time waiting for I/O requests to complete, then adding a third thread would allow both threads to continue executing while the I/O operation is being performed in the background. Another example could involve two threads accessing shared data concurrently, allowing them to coordinate their actions effectively without resorting to locking mechanisms such as mutexes. As mentioned earlier, concurrency simplifies development and maintenance of complex software systems by enabling developers to easily create new features and enhancements, leading to lower costs and increased productivity. On the other hand, poorly designed concurrency mechanisms can lead to race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks, negatively impacting system stability and efficiency. 

Asynchronous programming models are commonly used to implement concurrency in modern software systems. They enable applications to handle events asynchronously, i.e., without blocking the main event loop. In such models, tasks are dispatched to worker threads, whose job it is to perform the actual work requested by the task scheduler. Event notification is handled by callbacks, which are triggered when the corresponding task completes its execution. Modern operating systems and runtime environments such as Node.js,.NET, and Java provide built-in support for asynchronous programming, making it relatively straightforward to write concurrent code.

Together, concurrency and asynchronous programming have led to significant improvements in software engineering and development workflows. With increasing popularity of cloud computing, mobile devices, and big data technologies, there is a growing demand for highly scalable, robust, and reliable systems that can handle millions of users simultaneously. The introduction of concurrency and asynchronous programming models has revolutionized software architecture and development practices by enabling engineers to build complex systems quickly and with minimal risk of errors. 


## 2.3Synchronization Primitives
A synchronization primitive is a mechanism used to regulate access to shared resources between multiple threads or processes. Common examples of synchronization primitives include semaphores, locks, monitors, barriers, and condition variables. Semaphores serve as signaling devices between threads or processes indicating whether a shared resource is available or not. When a semaphore is initially created, it is set to a specific value, representing the maximum number of permits available. Each thread or process that wishes to acquire the semaphore needs to wait until the semaphore becomes non-zero before proceeding. If a thread or process attempts to release a lock that it does not hold, it will block until the lock is released. Locks serve as exclusive access control mechanisms preventing multiple threads or processes from accessing the same shared resource concurrently. Unlike semaphores, locks do not require any initial configuration and can be acquired immediately after creation. Monitors function similarly to locks but are specifically designed for use in multithreaded programming environments. Condition variables are often paired with monitors and are used to signal threads or processes waiting for a specific state change to occur on a shared variable. Synchronization primitives form the basis of most concurrent algorithms and data structures.



## 2.4Message Passing
Message passing is a communication technique that allows threads or processes to communicate with each other indirectly through message queues. Messages consist of data payloads along with metadata that describes the sender and receiver. Message queues act as buffers holding messages destined for different recipients. Processes or threads communicate with each other through send and receive operations that manipulate the queue contents. Many modern programming languages and frameworks support message passing mechanisms such as RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, Kafka, and Google Cloud PubSub. Message passing has been widely adopted due to its simplicity, flexibility, and low overhead compared to traditional RPC-based remote procedure calls (RPC). One major advantage of message passing is its ease of use, requiring no prior knowledge about the structure of the recipient program or service. However, it relies on external services to reliably deliver messages and therefore may be less suitable for tightly coupled, real-time applications. In summary, message passing is a lightweight, flexible, and easy-to-use communication mechanism that emphasizes loose coupling and transparency.


## 2.5Task Scheduling
Task scheduling refers to the assignment of hardware resources (such as CPUs, memory, disks) to runnable tasks in a system. Task scheduling policies determine how tasks are prioritized and assigned to runners based on their relative importance, constraints, and available resources. Examples of common task scheduling policies include priority-based scheduling, round-robin scheduling, first-come, first-served (FCFS), shortest job first (SJF), least laxity first (LLF), and shortest remaining time next (SRTN). Modern operating systems and runtime environments provide APIs and libraries for implementing custom task schedulers, allowing developers to fine-tune their system behavior to match specific requirements. While FCFS policy is simple and fast, it can cause starvation for heavily loaded systems, resulting in slowdowns or even crashes. Therefore, careful selection of task scheduling policies is essential for achieving optimal system performance under different workloads and load patterns.




## 2.6Thread Management
Thread management refers to the coordination of activities involving multiple threads or processes in a system. Thread management includes creating, managing, and synchronizing threads, allocating resources to threads, handling thread failures, and debugging issues arising from multi-threaded software systems. Modern operating systems offer several abstractions that simplify the management of threads, including threads, processes, and virtual machines. Using higher-level abstractions such as coroutines and fibers further reduces the overhead involved in managing threads. Furthermore, modern compilers and runtime environments automatically parallelize loops and regions of interest within threaded programs, reducing the need for explicit task scheduling. Overall, thread management enhances the efficiency and responsiveness of software systems by optimizing hardware usage and minimizing context switches.
