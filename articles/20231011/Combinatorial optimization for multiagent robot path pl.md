# 1.背景介绍


Path planning is an essential task in multi-robot systems that can effectively fulfill a variety of applications such as communication, surveillance, and exploration. However, when the system encounters uncertainties like dynamic obstacles or uncertain environmental factors, it becomes more challenging to plan the paths in real-time without compromising safety or mission objectives. The goal of this article is to propose a novel approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) to address these challenges by incorporating robustness analysis and probabilistic reasoning into the process. We start with explaining the fundamental ideas behind COs and their connection to robust MDPs. Then we move on to introducing several probabilistic concepts and methods used in cop solvers. Finally, we discuss some existing cop solvers and use cases where they are applied successfully. This will help us understand how probabilistic thinking coupled with combinatorial optimization can benefit various applications in multi-robot path planning.

A COP problem consists of defining a set of decision variables (e.g., paths, trajectories), objective functions, constraints, and uncertainties. Decision variables include all possible combinations of actions selected by each agent during execution. Objectives specify how well the final solution should satisfy certain goals, while constraints represent physical limitations or time budgets. Uncertainties typically come from two sources - sensor noise and dynamics uncertainty due to unknown forces and disturbances.

In contrast, a robust Markov decision process (MDP) considers only a finite number of states and transitions between them, assuming a perfect model of the underlying system's behavior. Robust MDPs have been shown to be effective in many practical applications because they enable the solver to make safe and optimal decisions even when there may exist adversarial agents attempting to deviate from the planned trajectory. Similarly, robust MDPs can also provide useful insights about the distribution of equilibrium solutions over all possible initial conditions and time horizons.

Combinatorial optimization techniques aim at finding the best solution among all possible outcomes given some decision variables and uncertainties. These methods involve computing a mathematical representation of the desired outcome based on probability distributions associated with uncertainties. They often employ a search algorithm that explores different possibilities until reaching a feasible or global optimum. Examples of common combinatorial optimization techniques include linear programming, integer programming, graph partitioning, and simulated annealing. Some state-of-the-art cop solvers leverage reinforcement learning algorithms, which can train agents to learn strategies by imitating expert policies or optimizing reward functions in an offline setting. Other approaches rely on heuristics or machine learning techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search or genetic algorithms.

The key idea behind our approach lies in using both classical combinatorial optimization techniques alongside with robust MDP models. To incorporate robust MDPs, we transform the COP into a robust MDP and then solve it using standard MDP solvers. Moreover, we integrate information from probabilistic knowledge bases and physics-based simulations to improve the accuracy and precision of the results. In summary, our proposed method addresses the challenge of robust and probabilistic path planning within the context of multi-robot systems by combining traditional optimization techniques with advanced machine learning tools such as deep neural networks.
# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
We begin by describing the basic idea behind multiobjective combinatorial optimization techniques called Pareto-optimal frontier computation. A typical COP problem involves multiple decision variables representing potential routes or trajectories for multiple agents. Each variable is assigned a fitness function that represents its quality relative to other candidate solutions. We want to find the joint Pareto-optimal solutions across all decision variables that maximize the sum of individual objectives. 

One popular algorithm for Pareto-optimal frontier computation is decomposition algorithm that recursively partitions the space of solutions based on conflict relationships and identifies the nondominated regions of the resulting subproblems. For example, suppose we are given three decision variables $X$, $Y$,$Z$. We consider two subproblems consisting of sets $\{x_i\}$, $\{y_j\}$,$\{z_{ij}\}$. Let $c_k(x)$ denote the cost of taking action $a_k$ in configuration $x$. The first subproblem consists of choosing one action $a_k$ for each agent to minimize the total cost $C(\{x_i(a_k)\}, \{y_j(a_k)\},\{z_{ij}(a_k)\}) = \sum_i \sum_j c_k(x_i) + \sum_j \sum_k c_l(y_j) + \sum_{ij} \sum_k c_{kl}(z_{ij})$ subject to $a_k\in X$, $a_k\notin Y$ and $a_k\notin Z$. The second subproblem has a similar structure but adds additional constraints to prevent collisions between trajectories of different agents. Given a collection of solutions $(X^\star,\{y_j^\star\},\{z_{ij}^\star\})$ generated by the decomposition algorithm, we compute the Pareto-optimal frontiers by identifying those configurations whose tradeoff between conflicting objectives is minimal. Intuitively, if one agent is farther away from another than expected by considering just the first objective, but is close enough to avoid collision risk, it makes sense to assign high preference to such configurations in terms of the remaining objectives.

Once we identify the dominant points of the Pareto-optimal frontier, we proceed to branch out and generate new decision variables that focus on specific areas around the tradeoffs. For instance, we might add a third decision variable that encodes the probabilities of agents colliding after executing each action in the current pareto-frontier subset. This allows us to explore tradeoffs beyond distance alone and exploit unexplored regions in the solution space. 

To build intuition, let’s take a closer look at the main steps involved in solving a COP problem using multiobjective algorithms.

1. Define decision variables and uncertainties
2. Generate a set of candidates by exploring different scenarios based on uncertainties
3. Evaluate the fitness of each candidate by calculating the value of each objective function
4. Identify the Pareto-optimal frontier by selecting only the configurations that satisfy a constraint function
5. Decompose the Pareto-optimal frontier to isolate nondominated regions and continue branching out
6. Select the next set of decision variables based on the tradeoff between objectives and apply branch-and-bound techniques to prune branches that violate constraints


# Proposed Methodology
Our proposed methodology includes four primary components: i) definition of relevant parameters; ii) probabilistic modeling of uncertainties through Bayesian inference; iii) generation of candidate solutions through sampling and optimization techniques; and iv) adaptation of probabilistic reasoning via uncertainty propagation to account for uncertainties in the subsequent decision making processes.

## Definition of Relevant Parameters
Firstly, we need to define the relevant parameters of the multi-agent system and map them onto the following categories: i) agent locations and motion models; ii) map information; iii) communication channels; and iv) scenario descriptions containing any type of uncertainty such as observation noise, dynamics noise, etc.

## Probabilistic Modeling of Uncertainties
To capture uncertainty in the multi-agent system, we need to model the beliefs and uncertainties in agent locations, map information, communication channel geometry, and scenario descriptions. We assume that the system dynamics are stochastic and governed by Gaussian random fields represented by the covariance matrices. Therefore, we formulate the multi-agent system as a Bayesian network where the nodes correspond to the random variables and the edges represent the conditional dependencies between variables. We estimate the posterior distributions over the variables using forward filtering and smoothing techniques.

## Generation of Candidate Solutions
Given the probabilistic prior estimates and agent behaviors, we can now generate candidate solutions for the multi-agent system by applying various search algorithms such as gradient descent, particle swarm optimization, tabu search, and genetic algorithms. During candidate generation, we optimize each agent’s movement pattern and select suitable communication patterns that lead to successful collaboration. By varying the interaction levels, resource sharing, and negotiation mechanisms, we can design complex scenarios and simulate various failures and attacks to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy.

## Adaptation of Probabilistic Reasoning via Uncertainty Propagation
After generating candidate solutions, we need to incorporate uncertainty propagation techniques to account for the impact of uncertainties in the subsequent decision making processes. One important component of uncertainty propagation is message passing, which enables the transfer of information from the experts to the novice in order to reduce their uncertainty and increase their ability to infer accurate beliefs. Another technique is online convex programming, which applies linearization to capture the effects of uncertainties on the decision makers’ objectives before updating their beliefs. 

Overall, our proposed methodology takes advantage of recent advances in machine learning, computational mathematics, and optimization algorithms to develop scalable, efficient, and reliable solutions for multi-agent path planning tasks under uncertainties.
