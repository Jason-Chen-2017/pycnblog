# 1.背景介绍


Data indexes are used to speed up data retrieval operations and improve database performance by reducing the amount of time required for searching or sorting large datasets. Without indexing, a search operation on a table with millions of records would take much longer than it would if an index were present. Data indexes store information about the location of specific rows within the tables, allowing quick access to the relevant data without having to scan the entire table every time.
In this article we will go through how databases use indexes to optimize query processing, reduce storage requirements, enhance database performance, and support concurrent queries. We will also cover various types of indexes including B-tree, hash, composite (multi-column), and other specialized indexes such as R-Tree, Inverted Index, Text Search, and Spatial indexes. Each type is discussed in detail along with its pros and cons, followed by a detailed explanation of their algorithmic approaches and implementation strategies. Finally, we will touch upon the tradeoffs involved in using different types of indexes for different scenarios and suggest practical guidelines for choosing the right ones based on factors like dataset size, data distribution, workload patterns, etc.
This article assumes readers have basic knowledge of database systems concepts, programming languages, and algorithms. It should be useful for anyone working with relational databases, database management software, web application development, and any other applications that require efficient querying of large datasets. The target audience includes developers who need to understand how indexes work internally and why they can make significant improvements to their database design and performance.
# 2.核心概念与联系
Before we dive into the details of each type of database index, let's first discuss some common concepts and terminology related to indexes:

1. Indexed Column: A column(or set of columns) from a table whose values are stored separately in a separate structure called an index. These columns are typically chosen to allow for fast searches and comparisons. For example, consider a "customer" table where there are multiple entries for each customer name. An appropriate indexed column could be one which groups customers by age or region, making it easy to retrieve all customers in a particular age range or in a given geographic area.

2. Covering Index: A special case of an index where the index covers the columns being searched or sorted. This means that the additional data needed to satisfy the search or sort request is already available in the index itself, so no additional disk reads are necessary.

3. Duplicate Key: Occurs when two or more rows have identical key values in the indexed column(s). A duplicate key can cause the database engine to misclassify certain queries, leading to incorrect results or slower response times. To avoid duplicates, ensure that each row has a unique value for the indexed column(s).

4. Clustered Index: A special type of B-tree index that stores the data in physical order. This makes it faster to locate adjacent rows during queries. However, updates to clustered indexes can be expensive because the entire index must be rebuilt after each update.

5. Non-clustered Index: A type of index that does not physically reorder the data. Instead, it contains pointers to the original rows, making it easier to locate them. Updates to non-clustered indexes do not affect the physical ordering of the data and can be performed very quickly.

6. Primary Key: A special column(usually containing a unique identifier) that acts as a unique identifier for each row in a table. It is commonly defined as part of a composite primary key, consisting of several columns combined together to serve as a single identity. Primary keys play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and uniqueness, but they may not always be the best choice for indexes due to their low selectivity and high overhead.

7. Secondary Index: One or more indexes created over columns that are not the primary key(s) of a table. They provide faster access to frequently accessed data while still maintaining good data quality and consistency. There are two main categories of secondary indexes - functional and inverted. Functional indexes map a single column to another column, while inverted indexes create a list of column values mapped to a corresponding set of rows. Both types offer better flexibility and scalability than traditional indexes.
