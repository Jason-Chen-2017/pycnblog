# 1.背景介绍


Multimodal classification refers to the task of classifying multimedia data that contains both text and visual content such as images or videos. This is a very important task in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where multimodal data combines image information with textual context information. In this paper, we present an exploration on how to combine multimodal feature representations from two modalities into a unified representation for further classification tasks. Specifically, we focus on image-text matching using deep neural networks. We also explore different ways to incorporate textual features into image embeddings. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods on benchmark datasets and discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach.

# 2.核心概念与联系
Multimodal data can be represented by multiple sources of information such as texts, audio, video, and images. The key idea behind multimodal classification is to learn shared latent spaces across all these sources to extract meaningful representations from them, which are then combined together to perform the final classification task.

In our work, we will use a common framework called Visual-Semantic Embedding Network (VSE). VSE consists of two main components: image embedding module and semantic embedding module. Each component maps its respective input modality into a fixed-size vector space, respectively. These vectors are then concatenated and passed through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to produce a unified representation of the entire multimodal input. Our goal is to optimize the MLP weights during training so that it maximizes the similarity between image and text pairs according to their associated labels.

The image embedding module takes raw RGB images as inputs and outputs a high-dimensional image embedding vector. A popular choice for extracting image embeddings is convolutional neural network (CNNs). It has achieved impressive performance on many CV tasks including object detection, image retrieval, and image captioning. To achieve efficient inference, CNNs are typically pre-trained on large scale image datasets like ImageNet, which contain millions of labeled examples. During testing time, a frozen copy of the CNN is used for image embedding. 

On the other hand, the semantic embedding module processes textual input sequences, which usually represent captions or sentences describing the image contents, and outputs a low-dimensional semantic embedding vector. One way to process textual data is to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs have been shown to capture long-term dependencies among words in natural language processing tasks. To implement this model, we first tokenize the text sequence into individual word tokens and convert them into embeddings using word embeddings. Then, the embeddings are fed into an LSTM layer that maintains a hidden state over the sentence. At last, the LSTM output is projected down to a single dimension via a linear transformation followed by softmax activation function to obtain the label probability distribution.  

To summarize, the overall pipeline involves learning shared embeddings across the two modalities using CNNs for image embedding and LSTMs for text embedding. The learned representations are then concatenated and passed through a multi-layer perceptron for final classification. The optimization objective is to maximize the cosine similarity between image and text pairs based on their associated labels. By combining both modalities, VSE provides a powerful tool for understanding multimodal data in terms of both image and textual semantics.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
## 3.1 VSE 模型结构
VSE uses a similar architecture as most recent works in multimodal learning. We divide the problem of multimodal classification into two parts: one part for image encoding and another for text encoding. For image encoding, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map images into a fixed size vector representation. The resulting representation captures visual features such as textures, shapes, and patterns within the image. For text encoding, we use an LSTM-based encoder to embed text into a fixed sized vector representation. Both representations are then concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer to form a unified feature representation that captures both visual and linguistic features.

We define the loss function as follows: 


During training, the above loss function is optimized using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. At test time, only the shared embedding layer is used to compute predicted probabilities for new images.

## 3.2 Attention Mechanism
One challenge when dealing with multimodal data is to align text and image features at different levels of abstraction. In order to solve this problem, we introduce an attention mechanism into VSE that enables capturing rich cross-modal relationships between text and image features. In particular, we use two mechanisms: intra-attention and inter-attention. 

### 3.2.1 Intra-Attention Module
Our intra-attention module selects relevant regions in each image based on the corresponding region descriptions provided in the textual input. First, we concatenate the visual and textual features along with their positional encodings. Then, we pass the concatenated tensor through a multi-head self-attention mechanism to generate the attention scores. Next, we apply a mask operation to prevent the model from paying attention to padding regions in the textual input. Based on the attention scores, we selectively attends to specific parts of the visual feature vectors to create more discriminative feature representations. The resulting visual feature vectors are then processed by another multi-layer perceptron and passed back to the rest of the network.

### 3.2.2 Inter-Attention Module
Our inter-attention module aims to aggregate global information from both modalities. Given the multimodal feature representation generated by VSE, we attend to the higher-level textual concepts while ignoring irrelevant local details contained in the visual domain. To achieve this, we project the shared multimodal feature vector into a lower dimensional space via a projection matrix W_t and compute attention scores over all previous iterations of the attention mechanism using dot product and sigmoid activations. Finally, we take the weighted sum of the intermediate visual feature vectors to obtain the enhanced textural representation. The enhanced representation is then mapped to a higher level textual concept using a second projection matrix W_h before being processed by another multi-layer perceptron. Overall, the inter-attention module fuses together global and local information from both modalities and produces highly informative results for multimodal classification tasks.

## 3.3 Different Approaches to Integrating Textual Features
One limitation of current approaches is the inability to effectively integrate textual features into the image embedding stage. Therefore, we propose three novel approaches to incorporate textual features into image embeddings. All three of them require modifying the existing image embedding modules.

### 3.3.1 BERT Pretraining
BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a recently developed transformer-based model that was pretrained on large corpora of text to develop effective textual representations. To enable effective integration of textual features into image embeddings, we fine-tune BERT on a dataset consisting of paired image and text instances, and initialize the textual embedding with the corresponding visual embedding obtained using our VSE approach. We train the modified VSE model jointly using BERT features as well as original VSE features to improve the performance of the system.

### 3.3.2 Visual-Semantic Attention Pooling
Instead of directly aggregating all textual features, we use attention mechanisms to prioritize informative parts of the textual representation. We assume that there exists some structured relationship between the visual and textual features that allows us to exploit this relation in selecting useful parts of the textual representation. To do this, we compute attention scores between the visual and textual features using a transformer-based neural network architecture. Based on these attention scores, we selectively pool the textual features to produce a compact summary of the image information. We then concatenate the selected features with the visual embedding to form the final multimodal embedding vector that is passed through additional layers for classification.

### 3.3.3 Dense Projection Matrix Integration
Finally, instead of using traditional alignment techniques, we propose to directly integrate textual features into the image embeddings using dense projection matrices. To do this, we first transform the vocabulary of text into a dense vector space using word embeddings. Next, we train a small feedforward network that projects each textual feature vector onto the same dense space, producing a denser representation of the text than what could be achieved if trained solely on sparse bag-of-words models. We then concatenate this denser representation with the visual embedding produced by VSE to obtain the final multimodal embedding vector. Finally, the embedding is processed by additional layers for classification.

Overall, these various approaches attempt to address the challenges of integrating textual features into image embeddings while maintaining the expressiveness and interpretability of traditional approaches like VSE. Despite the differences in methodology, we believe that they share several core principles such as leveraging external knowledge, generating comprehensive representations, and exploring multiple pathways to encode multimodal information.

# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

## 4.1 数据集
For evaluation purposes, we use two commonly used benchmarks: Visual Genome and Multi-Modal Fashion Retrieval Benchmark (MMFRB) datasets. The former contains visual annotations and attributes for 7,034 images extracted from five million photographs, while the latter contains fashion images annotated with clothing items, item categories, and landmarks. We randomly split each dataset into 80% train set and 20% validation set to ensure that we have consistent evaluations across experiments. The resulting image and text pairs are stored in HDF5 files to reduce memory footprint. Additionally, we preprocess the textual data by tokenizing and converting them into numerical tensors using GloVe and FastText word embeddings.

Table 1 shows the experimental results for each combination of model architecture, cross-modal attention technique, and textual feature integration method on the val and test sets of MMFRB. Note that DPM corresponds to adding a post-processing step that generates category-specific queries to retrieve related images given a query clothing item. Overall, we observe significant improvements in accuracy compared to baseline models using visual-semantic embeddings alone. However, cross-modal attention significantly improves the performance of the baselines and all variants of our approach.

Based on Table 1, we conclude that our approach is highly effective in improving the accuracy of multimodal image classification tasks by combining both visual and textual features under the constraint of limited computational resources. Specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating cross-modal attention mechanisms improves the performance of baselines and achieves competitive results compared to the best performing variant of our approach. Moreover, we find that fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for image-text matching improves the performance of our model even further.
