# 1.背景介绍


Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are recently gaining prominence in various applications such as node classification and link prediction. The performance of GNNs is often evaluated using a variety of metrics including accuracy, F1 score, mean square error (MSE), and so on. However, some datasets may be intrinsically hard to learn due to their complex topology structure or high noise levels which can hinder the learning process of GNNs. To address this issue, we propose a new regularization technique called topological regularization that encourages GNNs to preserve local structures while reducing the impact of noisy data points. 

To understand how topological regularization works, let's consider an example. Consider the following two graphs:

1. Graph A:

   |   |
   |---|---|
   |  A| B |
   |---|--A---|
   
2. Graph B:
   
   |   |
   |---|---|
   | C |D |E |
   |-C--|B-|-D-|
     
In both graphs, each vertex represents a person or entity and edges represent relationships between them. We observe that there is a shared edge (AB) but they have different connectivity patterns compared to other vertices. In graph A, AB connects nodes A and B with a high degree; whereas, in graph B, it connects only one end of a cycle shape pattern. Despite these differences, GNNs typically perform poorly when applied directly to these two graphs because they fail to capture local features in the underlying data distribution. To overcome this challenge, we propose topological regularization which penalizes models who violate certain properties of the topology by adding a loss term based on their distances from predefined topological constraints.

## Graph Neural Network(GNN)
Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a deep neural network architecture designed specifically for processing graph structured data. It learns representations of the entities and the connections between them within a graph context. GNN applies message passing through the nodes of the graph to update its hidden states. This is done by combining information about the neighboring nodes, referred to as messages, with the current state of the node being processed.

The key idea behind GNN is to model any arbitrary connection in the input graph as a function of the existing node features and the corresponding messages passed along the edges. Therefore, the model automatically accounts for all possible interactions and dependencies between the connected entities. These concepts help us develop intuition for understanding the working of GNNs better.

## Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting of machine learning algorithms. They add additional constraints to the training process to ensure that the learned parameters generalize well to unseen data samples. One type of regularization technique is early stopping, where we stop training the algorithm once the validation loss starts increasing, indicating that our model has started to overfit the training dataset. Another important class of regularization techniques include dropout, l2/l1 regularization, and weight decay, among others.

Topological regularization is a specific form of regularization method that was developed to address challenges associated with handling sparse and noisy labeled data. Instead of focusing solely on identifying accurate predictions, topological regularization adds a penalty term to discourage models from violating certain properties of the topology such as symmetry, cycles, and path lengths. By doing so, it aims to preserve local features in the underlying data distribution, leading to improved predictive performance.

3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
Topological regularization involves three main steps:

1. Identify the predefined topology constraint. For instance, we could specify that nodes should be symmetrically connected in order to encourage symmetrical representations across the graph.

2. Compute the distance matrix between every pair of nodes according to the specified topology constraint.

3. Add a regularization term proportional to the distance between the predicted labels and true labels multiplied by the distance matrix to the cost function used during training.

Here is the mathematical expression for the topological regularization term added to the standard cross entropy loss function:

$$L_{\tau}(y,\hat{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} L(\hat{y}_i, y_i) + \lambda\cdot R(\theta,X,e) $$

Where $N$ denotes the number of nodes, $\lambda$ denotes the hyperparameter controlling the strength of the regularization effect, $\theta$ denotes the weights of the model, $X$ denotes the set of inputs, $e$ denotes the set of errors computed during forward propagation, and $R(\theta,X,e)$ denotes the topological regularization function defined as follows:

$$R(\theta,X,e) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{T}|}\sum_{t\in \mathcal{T}}w_t[h_t(X)]^Te_t[\sigma(\mathbf{A})\circ f(h_t(X))],$$

where $\mathcal{T}$ denotes the set of allowed topologies, $w_t$ denotes the corresponding weight assigned to each topology $t$, $h_t(X)$ denotes the output of the model for input $X$ under the topology $t$, $\circ$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\sigma(\mathbf{A})$ denotes the sigmoid activation function.
