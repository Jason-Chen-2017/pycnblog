# 1.背景介绍


Exploratory data analysis or EDA is an essential skill for any data scientist to get a better understanding of the dataset and gain insights into its structure, distribution, correlation and outliers. In this article, we will go through all the steps involved in performing exploratory data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. We will also use some commonly used machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests etc., to compare their results with the results obtained from statistical methods applied on the same dataset.

In summary, this blog will help you understand:

1. The difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics
2. Different types of plots that can be used for analyzing continuous variables
3. How to perform univariate and bivariate analysis of continuous variables
4. How to detect and handle missing values
5. Decision tree algorithm and how it works
6. Random forest algorithm and how it works
To summarize, by the end of this article, you should have an understanding of various techniques available in exploring datasets, including visualizations, machine learning models, data cleaning techniques, handling missing values, and identifying patterns and trends hidden within them. By applying these techniques effectively, you can extract valuable insights and identify actionable business insights from your data. 

Before we begin our journey, let's first talk about what exactly does exploratory data analysis mean? Exploratory data analysis means going through the process of examining and understanding the data without relying too heavily on pre-conceived ideas or assumptions. It involves both qualitative and quantitative approaches to look at the raw data and try to find patterns and relationships that may not otherwise stand out. By doing so, data analysts are able to generate insights which could reveal underlying structures and patterns that would otherwise remain obscure. This approach helps businesses to make more informed decisions based on solid data rather than just relying on hunches and speculations made up of misleading assumptions.

# 2. Core Concepts And Connections
Data exploration refers to the act of gathering information from a large collection of data points and attempting to establish patterns, relationships, and correlations among those points. The main objective of data exploration is to analyze the data set and determine possible factors that influence a particular outcome variable. There are two basic approaches towards data exploration - Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics.

Descriptive statistics involve measures of central tendency, dispersion, shape, and other characteristics of the population or sample being studied. They provide basic facts and insights about the nature and distributions of the data. They describe general trends and patterns in the data but do not attempt to draw any conclusions beyond those already observed. Descriptive statistics include measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, skewness, kurtosis, and percentiles.

Inferential statistics involve making predictions or estimating the probability of occurrence of different outcomes given certain inputs. These estimates rely on statistical methods such as hypothesis testing and regression analysis. Inference is often used to assess the significance of differences between groups or individuals. Inferential statistics include measures such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient, t-test, ANOVA test, Chi-square test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Mann-Whitney U rank test.

The key concept behind EDA is to explore the data for insights while avoiding bias. While descriptive statistics provide broad views of the data, they may still lead to incorrect conclusions if there is any significant sampling error or measurement error. Thus, inferential statistics plays a crucial role in checking whether the data supports or refutes a hypothesis, whether it can be said to come from a normally distributed population or if it is reasonable assuming some model of dependence. 

Besides finding patterns and relationships among data, EDA can also highlight potential problems or errors in the dataset, such as duplicate records, outliers, incomplete data, irrelevant observations, and gaps or deviations from expected patterns. These issues must be addressed during data preprocessing to ensure accurate and reliable results from later stages of the analysis pipeline. Additionally, the choice of metrics and visualization tools used throughout the process is crucial because one technique may work well for one type of variable and poorly suited for another. Therefore, it is important to select appropriate techniques depending on the size and complexity of the data sets.

EDA requires an iterative approach where multiple visualization techniques, numerical summaries, and statistical tests are used together to reach meaningful insights from the data. Visualizing data allows us to quickly spot abnormalities, outliers, and interesting trends. Numerical summaries allow us to calculate relevant statistics and determine if there is evidence of normality or homoscedasticity. Statistical tests provide support for theories and hypotheses, allowing us to evaluate the importance of each predictor variable in predicting the response variable. Taking advantage of these various techniques enables us to formulate a complete picture of the data and uncover potentially useful information that has been missed beforehand.
