# 1.背景介绍


Logistic regression is a widely used statistical method for binary classification problems that involves modeling the probability of a given observation being labeled as one or another class. In this article, we will discuss implementing various gradient descent algorithms to learn parameters of logistic regression model using Python programming language.
# 2.Core Concepts and Connection
## 2.1 Linear Classification
Linear classification refers to predicting a categorical outcome based on a linear combination of features. It assumes that there exists some underlying linear relationship between input variables and output variable (in other words, it assumes a straight line can separate data points into different classes). The goal of linear classification is to find an optimal set of weights/coefficients (also called parameters) that minimizes the error rate when making predictions on new inputs. Mathematically speaking, the hypothesis function of linear classification can be represented by:

$$h_{\theta}(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\theta^Tx}}$$ 

where $\theta$ represents the vector of weights or coefficients, $x_i$ are the independent variables, and $y$ is the dependent variable. The sigmoid function ($\sigma(z)$) maps any real number to a value between zero and one. 

For example, consider a dataset with three input variables x1, x2, and x3 and a binary target variable y:

| Input Variables | X1 | X2 | X3 | Target Variable | Y |
|-----------------|----|----|---|---|---|
|                  |  1 |  2 |  3 |                 | 0 |
|                  | -1 |  4 | -3 |                 | 1 |
|                  |  2 | -2 |  1 |                 | 0 |

In order to use linear classification to classify the instances into two classes (classified as "0" or "1"), we need to choose which feature should be included in our decision boundary. One possible approach is to plot each pair of features against the target variable, and try to identify regions where the separating hyperplane is highly probable. However, this approach becomes increasingly difficult as more features are added. For instance, if we have four input variables instead of three, we would need to generate six combinations of plots, or visualize all possible subsets of four variables.

Instead of relying on visual inspection, we can use mathematical techniques to automatically select the most informative subset of features. This can be done through the use of feature selection methods such as Lasso regularization or Ridge regression. However, these approaches require that we specify a penalty term to minimize the effects of large coefficients on the prediction accuracy. We also need to carefully tune the values of the penalty parameter to avoid overfitting.

Another way to perform linear classification is to directly optimize the weights/coefficients without prior knowledge of the structure of the decision boundary. This can be achieved using optimization algorithms like gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. These algorithms start with random initial guesses for the weights, iteratively adjust them in order to reduce the error rate on the training set until convergence. In general, these algorithms work well for small datasets but may converge slower than specialized optimization algorithms designed specifically for high-dimensional sparse datasets. Moreover, they do not guarantee global optimum and require careful initialization of the weights. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the performance of the learned parameters on validation sets and fine-tune the algorithm hyperparameters as needed.

## 2.2 Gradient Descent Algorithm
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that repeatedly updates the parameters (weights/coefficients) of a model in order to minimize the cost function associated with the model's performance on the training set. The basic idea behind gradient descent is to calculate the gradient (derivative) of the cost function with respect to each weight, and move in the direction opposite to the gradient towards a local minimum of the cost function. Intuitively, we want to take steps that bring us closer to the point where the slope of the curve is the smallest (i.e., the lowest point on the curve), because this corresponds to the global minimum of the cost function. Gradient descent has many variations, but the standard version involves calculating the gradient at each step and updating the weights according to a learning rate, which controls how far we move along the gradient. The pseudocode of the standard gradient descent algorithm for linear regression is shown below:

1. Initialize the weights $\theta_0$,..., $\theta_{n}$ to arbitrary values.
2. Repeat until convergence {
   a. Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight $\theta_j$:
     $$\nabla_{\theta_j}J(\theta)=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta) $$
   b. Update each weight $\theta_j$ by subtracting a fraction of its corresponding gradient from itself:
    $$\theta_j = \theta_j - \alpha \nabla_{\theta_j}J(\theta)$$
   }
Here, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, which determines the size of the update step. The choice of the loss function depends on the nature of the problem we are trying to solve, such as squared error loss or cross-entropy loss. Additionally, gradient descent can be applied to non-linear models by applying the chain rule to compute gradients with respect to intermediate layers of the network.
