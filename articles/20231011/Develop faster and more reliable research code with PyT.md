# 1.背景介绍


PyTorch Lightning is an awesome Python package that makes it easy to train neural networks in PyTorch. It was developed by the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) team and is now widely used across the industry as well as open source communities alike. In this article, we will be discussing why one should use PyTorch Lightning instead of vanilla PyTorch while developing deep learning models for AI research and engineering applications. The benefits of using PyTorch Lightning include:

1. Simplified training loop API - PyTorch Lightning provides a simple and intuitive API for writing complex training loops. With just a few lines of code, you can define your model, optimizer, and data loaders, and start training!
2. Easy hyperparameter optimization - PyTorch Lightning also provides tools for automating hyperparameter tuning, which saves significant time compared to manual trial and error approach. This feature integrates seamlessly into your existing scripts, making it easy to switch between different optimization algorithms or even compare their performance during training.
3. Streamlined distributed training - Distributed computing has become increasingly popular over the last years, especially in the field of large-scale machine learning. PyTorch Lightning allows users to easily configure any number of nodes and GPUs for distributed training without hassle. No need to worry about communication protocols, synchronization primitives, or other details.
4. Flexibility and customization options - PyTorch Lightning offers many advanced features such as callbacks, logging, and automatic checkpointing, allowing users to build complex training workflows depending on their needs. Users can extend its functionality by implementing custom plugins or modules, further improving their productivity and flexibility.
In summary, PyTorch Lightning simplifies the process of building high-performance ML models while providing powerful features like hyperparameter optimization, distributed training, and extensibility. Moreover, thanks to its elegant design and modular architecture, PyTorch Lightning makes it easier for developers to write maintainable and reusable code. By utilizing these features and capabilities, PyTorch Lightning enables research teams to develop state-of-the-art AI systems quickly and efficiently. 

However, there are certain aspects of PyTorch Lightning that may not be immediately apparent at first glance, so let's discuss them in detail below. Firstly, let’s cover some important differences between vanilla PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning. We'll then look at some common practices and pitfalls associated with each framework before concluding our discussion.
# Differences Between Vanilla PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning
## 1. Model Definition
Vanilla PyTorch requires the user to manually specify the forward pass through the network by defining individual layers within the `forward()` method of the `nn.Module` class. A typical implementation would look something like this:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        
        self.fc = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.output(out)
        
        return out
```

This defines a simple MLP with three fully connected layers. However, note that we have no control over how the parameters of each layer are initialized or whether they get updated during training. Additionally, if we want to add regularization techniques or dropout layers, we would need to modify the `forward()` function accordingly, potentially duplicating a lot of boilerplate code. 

On the other hand, PyTorch Lightning encourages the user to focus on constructing the overall architecture of their model rather than getting bogged down in low-level implementation details. Instead, it automatically handles all of the necessary boilerplate code, including parameter initialization and optimization steps. 

For example, here is an equivalent definition using PyTorch Lightning:

```python
from pytorch_lightning import LightningModule

class LitMyModel(LightningModule):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, hidden_size=64):
        super().__init__()

        # Setting up layer dimensions and activations 
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.output_size = output_size
        
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size),
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layers(x)
    
    def configure_optimizers(self):
        optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
        return optimizer
    
model = LitMyModel(input_size=784, output_size=10)
```

Here, we've defined our model using a subclass of `LightningModule`, where we initialize the network architecture within `__init__`. We've specified the dimensionality of the input, hidden, and output layers, as well as the activation functions to apply after each linear layer. Note that we don't need to implement the `forward()` method explicitly since it gets inherited from `nn.Sequential()`. Finally, we've overridden the default optimizer configuration provided by PyTorch Lightning by specifying the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of $10^{-3}$. 

By following this pattern, PyTorch Lightning allows us to create flexible and scalable architectures that handle all of the underlying complexity automatically. The resulting codebase is much cleaner, less prone to errors, and easier to debug.

## 2. Data Handling
Another key difference between vanilla PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning lies in handling of data inputs. While PyTorch Lightning supports several types of datasets, dataloaders, and transforms already implemented, the best practice when working with image and text data still remains to roll your own preprocessing pipeline. Doing this often involves creating a custom dataset class that inherits from either `torchvision.datasets` or `torchtext.data`, and implementing methods such as `__getitem__()` and `__len__()`. These classes take care of loading raw data files and applying appropriate transformations such as random cropping, flipping, and normalization. 

While convenient, doing this can also introduce a level of complexity that can make your code harder to read and maintain. For instance, the fact that the `__getitem__()` method returns a tuple containing both images and labels means that separate preprocessing pipelines must be defined for each component of the returned tuple. Similar issues arise when dealing with variable length sequences or multiple modalities such as speech and vision.

Instead, PyTorch Lightning comes pre-packaged with data modules that provide a higher level interface for managing your data. They handle most of the complexity involved in processing and batching your data, including multi-process/thread data loading, on-the-fly augmentation, and support for splitting data into validation and testing sets. All you need to do is define the data directory, file formats, batch sizes, and any additional transform operations required. 

With PyTorch Lightning, you only need to call `trainer.fit(model)` to begin training, and everything else is handled under the hood. You can even specify GPU/TPU hardware resources for distributed training and enable automatic mixed precision training to further improve efficiency and speedup your experiments.
