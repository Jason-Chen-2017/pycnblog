# 1.背景介绍



Topological insulators are highly conductive materials that have a high degree of symmetry breaking and hardness to remove electrons from their magnetic domains. The confinement of an electron into the domain of a topological insulator results in low density of states (DOS), making it difficult to control electronic transport through the material. Despite these challenges, topological insulators are still recognized as important materials for many applications such as solar cells, lithium batteries, energy storage devices, and quantum computing hardware.

However, there is no clear understanding of how this conductivity is achieved and what makes them different than other materials with similar properties such as graphene or diamond. In this work, we use stochastic process techniques and first-principles calculations to investigate how each type of topological insulator can provide significant potential advantages over traditional materials. Our research highlights the importance of controlling the distribution of magnetization within the unit cell, which is fundamental to achieving the desired conductivity. We find that when using the Rashba model, i.e., including electron correlation effects due to orbital interactions, the most robust topological insulators such as Weyl semimetals show significant improvements compared to bulk systems. However, even these models fail to fully capture all relevant physics and lead to substantial discrepancies between experimental data and theoretical predictions. Finally, our study suggests that future avenues for investigation include developing new models and methods to more accurately predict the behavior of topological insulators under various conditions.

3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

In this section, we will explain the main ideas behind the stochastic methodology used in this research. To isolate the hidden conductivity in topological insulators, we must consider several factors such as the geometry of the system, spin interaction, electron correlation, external field, and defects. This is particularly challenging since topological insulators possess complex structure and require careful treatment to obtain accurate results. Here are some steps involved in our computational analysis: 

1. Calculating the thermodynamic and transport properties of the insulators using atomistic simulations: At high pressures, atoms interact strongly and form distinct clusters called bands. These bands define the phases of the insulators and give us information about the thermal properties of the system. It also allows us to see the distribution of intrinsic energy levels around the Fermi level. 

2. Identifying degenerate bands in the insulator: For stable phases like metallic topological insulators, multiple degenerate bands can coexist at any given point in space. Therefore, we need to identify the dominant bands and avoid introducing spurious correlations by freezing the non-dominant bands. One way to do this is to use the Rashba model, which includes both the electron and orbital interactions. We need to account for these effects during our simulations to ensure correct predictions of the critical temperature. 

3. Understanding the mechanism of confinement and freezing: Any electron near a topological insulator creates a barrier and blocks its escape until it leaves the magnetic domain. Thus, any attempt to increase the carrier densities would reduce the strength of the confinement barriers. We can analyze the effectiveness of the confined electrons by measuring the dimensionless enthalpy per particle and comparing with experimental observations. Moreover, we should freeze the carriers close to the surface of the insulators to achieve optimal condutivity. 

4. Studying the transferability of conductivity to different geometries: Topological insulators typically exhibit strong confinement barriers and therefore may not be suitable for large scale electrical applications. We need to characterize their transferability properties so they can be successfully used in practical applications. Some studies suggest that the Wigner distribution function provides a useful tool for quantifying the properties of the insulators as functions of distance from the surface. We can compare this with experimentally observed values of conductivity as a function of distance. 

5. Identifying non-magnetic sites and domains: Magnetic domains occupy a small region of space inside the insulator where carriers create local exchange coupling. Non-magnetic regions play an essential role in guiding the flow of charge through the system. In experiments, these regions are often identifiable by the appearance of gaps in the band structures. By analyzing the distribution of charge along these gaps, we can estimate the size and location of these domains. 

6. Simulating the motion of charged particles in the insulator: We can use molecular dynamics simulations to probe the temporal and spatial evolution of the magnetization of individual atoms and the electric field inside the lattice. We can observe the changes in the shape and positions of the domains and trace the paths of the charges through the system. This gives us insights into the collective behavior of the system and helps establish relationships between various physical phenomena. 

7. Integrating external fields and effects: Studies have shown that applying external fields to topological insulators can enhance their ability to transport charge. There are two mechanisms responsible for this: the Zeeman effect and the Hall effect. We can simulate these effects using simple perturbation techniques and measure the resulting changes in conductivity. 

8. Investigating the effect of orbital interactions: In general, the Rashba model assumes that the electrons do not experience significant orbital interactions beyond those caused by electron correlation. Nevertheless, we can gain additional insight into the physics of topological insulators by incorporating orbital effects into our simulations. Specifically, we can try to reconcile the predictions of the Rashba model with the predictions of the Heisenberg model and the Dyson equation based on the universal approximation theorem. 

9. Accounting for hidden stabilization mechanisms: Many topological insulators such as Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (YSK) insulators are resistant to sudden stimuli of external fields but instead develop slowly evolving signatures of confinement. We can probe the nature of these stabilization mechanisms using various techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). 

10. Developing new models and tools for improved prediction: As mentioned earlier, even though current models provide good approximations for the properties of topological insulators, they still leave much to be desired. Future research directions could involve improving existing models and building new ones specifically designed to better understand the complexity and emergence of topological insulators.
