# 1.背景介绍


## Problem Statement:Summarizing large volumes of documents is an essential task for organizing and understanding the content of those documents. It helps organizations gain a better understanding of what their information hold, making it easier for them to make informed decisions. However, manual summarization can be time-consuming and error-prone. To automate this process, we need machines that can read, understand, and summarize text efficiently and accurately. In this paper, we propose an approach using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automate document summarization tasks. We introduce a novel neural network architecture called Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN), which enables us to generate accurate and concise summaries from input texts with high accuracy. Our proposed system generates summary sentences based on the salience of important words within the original text while also taking into account relevant contextual information about the topic discussed in the document. The results show that our model produces higher quality summaries than state-of-the-art approaches and outperforms other machine learning models when evaluated on various evaluation metrics such as ROUGE score, BLEU score, and sentence coherence index.
## Proposed Solution:Our solution involves two main components - Text Preprocessing and Model Development.

Text preprocessing involves cleaning the raw text data by removing stopwords, punctuation marks, and numbers. This step is critical because it ensures that only significant information is retained during the training phase.

The next stage is to develop an LSTM-RNN model that takes the preprocessed text input and generates a set of summary sentences. 

We use a bag-of-words representation technique where each word in the input text is represented as a one-hot vector. These vectors are fed through an embedding layer that maps these dense representations to a lower dimension space where they become more meaningful. The embedded representations are then passed through several LSTM layers that capture long-term dependencies between adjacent words in the sequence. Finally, we feed the output of the last LSTM unit back into another fully connected layer that predicts the probability distribution over all possible summary sentences. During training, we optimize the weights of the entire model using stochastic gradient descent algorithm and calculate the loss function based on the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels. After some number of iterations, we select the best performing model according to a validation metric like ROUGE or BLEU scores and use it to generate summaries for new unseen documents.  

Overall, our proposed method reduces the manual effort involved in generating summary reports and significantly increases the efficiency in producing highly accurate summaries compared to traditional methods. By automating the generation of summaries, organizations can save valuable time and resources and focus on driving business objectives instead of spending hours analyzing complex documents manually. 
# 2.Core Concepts and Relationships
## Bag-of-Words Representation Technique
A bag-of-words representation consists of representing each word in the input text as a binary feature vector indicating its presence or absence in the given text. A commonly used implementation of this technique is to create a vocabulary consisting of unique words in the corpus and assign each word an integer id starting from zero. Then, each word occurrence in the text is converted to a sparse binary vector using the corresponding id as the index and a value of either 1 or 0 depending on whether the word occurs or not. For example, if "hello" occurs twice in the text but "world" occurs once, the binary representation would be [1 0 1 0 0], where the first element corresponds to "hello", the third element corresponds to "world".

## Word Embeddings
Word embeddings are vectors that represent words in a low-dimensional vector space where similar words have similar embeddings. One common way to train word embeddings is to use skip-gram or continuous bag of words (CBOW) algorithms that learn mappings between consecutive sequences of words in a text and the surrounding context. Once trained, these embeddings can be used to initialize the weights of deep neural networks for downstream natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation. There are many popular ways to obtain pre-trained word embeddings including GloVe, Fasttext, Word2Vec, and BERT.

## Long Short-Term Memory RNN
An LSTM-RNN is a type of recurrent neural network that captures long-term dependencies between adjacent words in the sequence. Each word in the sequence is processed independently at each timestep of the network, allowing the model to keep track of dependencies across multiple sentences in the input. An LSTM cell maintains a hidden state vector that captures the context of the previous inputs and can pass on relevant information to the current input. LSTM cells also include gates that control the flow of information between different parts of the cell's internal states. By passing the hidden state vector back to itself after every update, LSTM cells can propagate gradients throughout the entire sequence without vanishing or exploding gradients. 


## Coherence Measures
Coherence measures measure the degree of relatedness between a set of sentences. Two widely used coherence measures are length normalization (LNC) and semantic similarity (SS). LNC measures how closely related the sentences are in terms of word frequency, while SS measures their overall meaning similarity based on their underlying concepts. Both types of coherence measures play a crucial role in assessing the importance of individual sentences within a larger piece of text.

# 3.Core Algorithm and Operation Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
   * Cleaning text data
      - Remove punctuations, special characters, digits, and stop words
   * Tokenize the text and convert each token to lowercase
    
2. Convert text data into numerical format 
   * Use TF-IDF weighting scheme to compute a weight for each term in the document based on its frequency within the document and across all documents in the collection.
   
3. Train the Neural Network Architecture
   * Initialize the word embeddings matrix randomly or load pre-trained word embeddings
   * Create an instance of the LSTM-RNN class with specified hyperparameters
   * Pass the preprocessed text data through the embedding layer followed by the LSTM-RNN encoder and decoder
   * Compute the cross-entropy loss and apply SGD optimizer to minimize the loss function

4. Generate Summary Sentences
   * Take the input document as input and preprocess it as described above
   * Feed the preprocessed text data through the same embedding layer followed by the LSTM-RNN encoder to get the final hidden state vector
   * Apply beam search algorithm to identify the most likely sequence of summary sentences based on their likelihood and select a subset of top k sentences based on the summation of their log-likelihood values
   * Return selected sentences as the final summary
