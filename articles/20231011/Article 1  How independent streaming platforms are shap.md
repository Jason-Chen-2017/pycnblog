# 1.背景介绍


The advent of digital streaming services has changed the way we consume content and engage with fans on a global scale. Increasingly, these companies provide an alternative platform for users to view movies, shows, and other entertainment content, as well as allow them to purchase premium access to original content or new releases. This shift towards independence from traditional distribution models is now becoming more significant than ever before.

Streaming platforms such as Netflix, HBO Go, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, etc., have established themselves as pioneers in the entertainment industry by providing an immense amount of content available to consumers on demand, at their own convenience. These platforms are competing against rival providers like YouTube, which provides similar content but with a different branding and user experience approach. 

In recent years, streaming platforms have made huge strides in terms of monetization and customer acquisition, thanks mainly to the increasing success of subscription-based products and enriching offerings such as “Prime” programs that offer a wide range of benefits to subscribers beyond just a higher quality selection of content. Yet, with so many independent companies competing in this marketplace, it’s essential to understand how they can effectively shape the future of entertainment.

This article will focus on explaining how each company is enabling a fresh take on the entertainment industry and what role they play in shaping its evolution. We will also explore how they impact existing businesses and societies around the world and where they could be going next. Finally, we will discuss some lessons learned and identify potential risks involved with this massive change in entertainment industry. 

# 2.核心概念与联系
## 2.1 Streaming Platforms (SP)
Streaming platforms are online video portals owned and operated by various companies that enable individuals and organizations to stream high-quality videos directly to their devices via internet connections. SPs serve as a convenient way for anyone to watch high-quality video content without the need for downloading and buffering entire films or TV episodes locally onto their computers.

There are several types of streaming platforms including:

1. Third-party SPs: These companies operate outside the entertainment sector and provide services like music streaming, movie rental, and travel information.
2. Dedicated SPs: Companies like Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Prime Video provide exclusively streaming services for individual users who wish to enjoy content entirely off-line or offline for extended periods of time.
3. Content SPs: Companies like Netflix, Hulu, Binge TV, or Crave have specific categories of content they offer like Movies, TV Shows, Kids Content, and Anime. They generate revenue through advertising, subscriptions, and sponsorships.

### Types of content on streaming platforms
Content varies between platforms depending on the genre chosen and the type of media being streamed. Some popular content includes:

1. Movies & TV Shows: Users can find thousands of movies and TV shows to choose from, ranging from romantic comedies to action dramas, documentaries, and reality television series.
2. Anime: The Anime industry is growing rapidly, leading to a boom in streaming anime content. Most anime titles are available for free on streaming platforms, making it easier for fans to get into the fray.
3. Podcasts: Popular podcast hosts such as Pocket Casts or Overcast have been playing an increasingly important role in generating income for creators across the industry.
4. Music: Various artists and labels are offering their songs and albums for download or streaming on streaming platforms.
5. Gaming: There are over five billion console games available for PC, PlayStation, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Many gaming companies such as Microsoft Game Studios, Sony Computer Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and Ubisoft are providing their content for free on streaming platforms.

## 2.2 Independent SPs
Independent SPs are not controlled by any single entity, meaning they do not rely on a centralized payment system or use a common package of ads. Instead, they rely solely on subscription fees and membership discounts to acquire customers and increase profits. While some platforms like Spotify and Apple Music offer unlimited streaming forever, others like Netflix only offer pre-selected shows or movies on a limited time basis. Other examples include websites like Openload and Streamtape, both of which offer streaming directly to your device without any intermediary hosting service.

In addition to delivering content, independent SPs offer a variety of additional features such as personalized recommendations, smart playlists based on activity, ad-free playback options, and optional paid streaming services called VIP memberships. Moreover, they may also partner with major brands like Disney+ to release exclusive products related to the specific show or movie being watched.

### Roles of Independent SPs
Here's an overview of roles commonly associated with independent SPs:

1. Advertising Revenue: Independent SPs often earn a small percentage of the overall revenue generated by advertising. This helps to offset their costs while still providing valuable entertainment content to viewers.
2. User Retention: Since most independent SPs charge a minimal fee per month, they retain more users longer compared to platforms like Netflix or HBO Go. This enables them to make greater investments in developing their business model and reach new customers.
3. Brand Reputation: Independent SPs often have stronger credibility within the entertainment community because they do not depend on the broadcast television networks to gain traction. Additionally, they can build up their own audience base by hosting events, attending tradeshows, and promoting their content on social media platforms.
4. Corporate Responsibility: Independent SPs must consider the economics of maintaining a stable operation and raise capital through partnerships or equity investment, much like traditional broadcast TV stations. However, they cannot rely solely on these sources alone due to competition among companies.

## 2.3 Alternatives to independent SPs
However, there is no substitute for the massive profitability provided by these companies when combined with ad revenue. For instance, using advertising revenue to fund the creation of indie film trailers or apps could potentially lead to a surge in sales. Alternatively, bypassing subscription fees altogether could result in devaluation of popular entertainment content, leading to fewer viewers watching old classics. Therefore, it’s crucial for independent SPs to consider ways to leverage their strengths while mitigating their weaknesses to ensure a successful transition into the entertainment industry.
