# 1.背景介绍


Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), also known as ConvNet or CNNs, is one of the most popular deep learning models used for image and video recognition tasks. It works well on tasks such as object detection, image classification, and segmentation, where it takes advantage of spatial relationships between features in an input image. 

In this article, we will go through a basic understanding of convolutional neural networks using Python with TensorFlow library. We will be implementing various architectures, including LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, and MobileNet v2. Each architecture will be explained along with its working principle and benefits.

# 2. Core Concepts & Architecture

A convolutional neural network is made up of layers of neurons arranged in three dimensions: width, height, depth. The input layer receives the raw pixel values of the image, which then pass through several convolutional and pooling layers to extract relevant features from the images. These extracted features are fed into fully connected layers to produce the output prediction. 

There are different types of convolutional layers in a CNN: 

1. Convolutional Layers - This layer applies filters or kernels over the input data and produces feature maps. Filters slide across the input data, performing operations such as convolution, multiplication, and bias addition at each position.

2. Pooling Layer - After convolutional layers, pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps generated by the previous layers. They take advantage of the local receptive fields and maximize the signal to noise ratio within the kernel window. Some common pooling techniques include MaxPooling and AveragePooling.

3. Fully Connected Layers - These layers feed forward the final predictions obtained after passing through all the convolutional and pooling layers. They perform nonlinear transformations of the inputs to obtain more complex representations.


The overall structure of a CNN typically consists of alternating convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The number of filters in the first few layers determine the complexity of the model. As the size of the input decreases, the same amount of information is compressed but the level of detail increases. By stacking multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, deeper networks can learn higher-level features. The use of ReLU activation function and dropout regularization has been found to improve generalization performance. 


Here's how the major components of a typical CNN architecture look like:


AlexNet [3] is among the earliest successful CNNs due to its ability to automatically learn high-level features from small training datasets. VGG-16 [1], ResNet-50 [2], and Inception-v3 [4] are other famous CNNs that were inspired by AlexNet and applied similar principles to improve performance even further. 

In this section, let's explore some of the key concepts behind these models.

# 3. Model Details

## 3.1 LeNet-5

LeNet-5 [5] was introduced in 1998 by Yann LeCun et al., a researcher at the University of Toronto. It is a simple yet powerful model designed specifically for recognizing handwritten digits. Its architecture includes two convolutional layers followed by four fully connected layers. Here's how it looks like:


The first convolutional layer processes the input image using a filter of size 5x5, resulting in a set of feature maps. The second convolutional layer uses another filter of size 5x5, taking as input the outputs of the first convolutional layer and producing new sets of feature maps. The third and fourth fully connected layers are linear layers that apply non-linear transformation to the input vectors produced by the last two fully connected layers. 

To classify an input digit, LeNet-5 needs to first pre-process the image pixels by subtracting the mean value and normalizing the variance using standard deviation. Then, it feeds the preprocessed image into the first convolutional layer, resulting in sixteen feature maps with varying sizes. These feature maps are then passed through two pooling layers, reducing the size of the feature maps to a fixed size, namely, 2x2. Finally, the feature map is flattened and fed into four fully connected layers, producing ten class probabilities for each input digit. 

One drawback of LeNet-5 is that it requires careful parameter initialization and tuning because it relies heavily on the random initialization of weights and biases during the training process. Other downsides include slow computation speed and limited capacity for handling large-scale images. Overall, LeNet-5 is a good baseline model for handwritten digit recognition.

## 3.2 AlexNet

AlexNet [3] was introduced in 2012 by Krizhevsky et al. It is arguably the most influential CNN architecture ever developed. It incorporates several advanced ideas, including the use of overlapping pooling regions, a large batch normalization layer at the end of each convolutional layer, and an implementation of LRN layers instead of traditional pooling methods. Here's how it looks like:


It consists of eighteen convolutional layers followed by five fully connected layers. Each convolutional layer involves both convolution and nonlinearity, while the pooling layers simply compress the spatial dimensions of the input. The final fully connected layers have two hidden layers of size 4096 and finally emit the predicted class probability distribution.

Unlike LeNet-5, AlexNet does not require careful initialization and achieves excellent results on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images. One benefit of AlexNet is that it uses overlapping pooling regions to increase the receptive field without requiring excessively large strides. Another benefit is that it performs better than LeNet-5 when dealing with smaller objects in the image. Overall, AlexNet provides strong motivation to design deeper and wider networks based on earlier architectures like LeNet-5.

## 3.3 VGG-16

VGG-16 [1] was introduced in 2014 by Simonyan and Zisserman, who proposed a simple and effective method for training very deep neural networks. It consists of 16 convolutional layers, each followed by a max pooling operation. The first and third blocks consist of two convolutional layers each, while the second block consists of three convolutional layers each. The deepest block has only one convolutional layer, but increasing the number of filters throughout the network enables the model to learn more complex features. There are also three fully connected layers at the end.

Each convolutional layer consists of a series of filters applied consecutively over the input image, with a padding to maintain the spatial size of the input. The pooling layer reduces the spatial size of the feature maps by computing a maximum value within each region defined by a rectangular window.

After processing the input image, VGG-16 passes the feature maps through three fully connected layers, each containing 4096 neurons and ReLU activation function. The last fully connected layer emits the predicted class probability distribution.

Similar to AlexNet, VGG-16 outperformed previous state-of-the-art models on many computer vision tasks, such as ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and SVHN. One benefit of VGG-16 compared to AlexNet is that it has fewer parameters and can be trained on much larger datasets with ease. Additionally, it is easy to modify the architecture by adding or removing layers and adjusting hyperparameters. Overall, VGG-16 remains a strong contender for many applications in computer vision.

## 3.4 ResNet-50

ResNet-50 [2] is a significant breakthrough in the development of CNN architectures. It was proposed in 2015 by He et al. It leverages skip connections and residual units to address vanishing gradients problem. A residual unit is defined as a sequence of convolutional, BN, and activation layers that act as a shortcut connection from the input to the output. The identity shortcuts allow the gradient flowing directly from the output of one module to the corresponding input of the next module, thus improving the model accuracy.

The ResNet-50 architecture consists of seven stages, with each stage consisting of multiple residual units and a transition layer between adjacent stages. The first stage has 64 filters, while subsequent stages gradually decrease the number of filters until they reach the target depth of 512. All stages except the first one contain three residual units, while the first one contains one. Here's how it looks like:


ResNet-50 is significantly deeper than previous models such as VGG-16, leading to improved performance on many tasks such as ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and COCO. One benefit of ResNet-50 is that it allows for easier training and faster convergence than VGG-16. Another benefit is that it improves the accuracy of the model without significantly affecting the computational cost, making it an ideal choice for real-time applications. Overall, ResNet-50 offers great promise for addressing the challenge of building deep neural networks for visual recognition tasks.

## 3.5 Inception-v3

Inception-v3 [4] is a relatively recent architecture that combines elements of the ResNet-50 and GoogLeNet architectures. It uses parallel branches to capture multi-scale features, adds multiple fully connected layers at the beginning and end, and replaces max pooling layers with average pooling layers. Unlike AlexNet, which operated at a lower resolution, Inception-v3 starts with a coarse grid of feature maps at a low spatial dimension, allowing the model to adapt to different shapes of objects in the image. Here's how it looks like:


It consists of nine parallel branches, each of which processes the input image independently. The initial convolutional layer splits the input image into a collection of patches, and the remaining layers operate on each patch separately. Each branch comprises several modules, including a convolutional layer with pooling, a 1×1 convolutional layer, and a 3×3 convolutional layer. The concatenation of all the intermediate outputs from all the branches forms the complete representation of the image. The final fully connected layers form the classifier.

Like ResNet-50, Inception-v3 is highly parallelizable and can accommodate large-scale training efficiently. It also yields comparable results to ResNet-50, especially on ImageNet. Despite being slightly heavier than VGG-16 and AlexNet, Inception-v3 still maintains the strengths of both models. Overall, Inception-v3 demonstrates the potential for combining the best features from both worlds to create the most accurate deep learning models.

## 3.6 MobileNet v2

MobileNet v2 [6] is a lightweight CNN architecture that emerged in November 2018. It builds upon the intuition that mobile devices need fast and efficient models that can run on limited resources. Instead of using expensive matrix multiplications, it replaces the original fully connected layers with depthwise separable convolutions. Depthwise separable convolutions combine the advantages of depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions into a single layer. Here's how it looks like:


The mobilenet architecture breaks down into three main parts:

1. Depthwise Separable Convolution Layer - This layer applies a depthwise convolution along the channel dimension and a pointwise convolution along the spatial dimensions. The result is a compact representation of the input features, enabling the network to learn discriminative features for different spatial locations.
2. Linear Bottleneck Layer - This layer transforms the output of the previous layer into a narrower space, reducing the total number of parameters and computation required.
3. Classifier - This layer applies global pooling to aggregate the output of the entire network and produces the final predictions.

Compared to older versions of MobileNet, v2 introduces inverted bottlenecks, which enable flexible expansion of the model, as well as reduced computational overhead due to the reduction in the number of operations per layer. Overall, MobileNet v2 shows clear promise for accelerating the training of deep neural networks on resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile phones and embedded systems.

In summary, there are dozens of variations of CNN architectures with different properties and capabilities. To develop and evaluate these models effectively, it is essential to understand the core concepts and principles behind each architecture. With practice, you can easily construct and optimize novel architectures for specific problems, providing greater flexibility and efficiency in solving challenging problems related to natural language processing, speech recognition, and image classification.
