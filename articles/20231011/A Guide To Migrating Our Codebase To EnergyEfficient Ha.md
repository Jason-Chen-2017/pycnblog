# 1.背景介绍


Energy efficient computing refers to the use of resources (such as CPU and memory) that provide an optimal balance between performance and power consumption. The aim is to enable devices with low energy consumption and high performance in a cost-effective manner. In recent years, hardware companies have made significant investments in improving the efficiency of mobile processors and CPUs. However, many software applications still rely on older systems running at a slow pace. As a result, migrating our codebases to energy-efficient hardware has become essential for achieving competitive advantage over rivals such as Intel or ARM. 

This article will explore how we can migrate a codebase from a slow processor architecture to more powerful ones using modern programming techniques like multi-threading and SIMD instructions. We will also discuss various techniques to achieve better performance while reducing energy consumption and identify challenges faced during migration.

In summary, this article aims to help developers understand the importance of migrating their codebases to more energy-efficient hardware architectures. It will present the core concepts related to energy efficiency and describe the core algorithmic principles used by popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Finally, it will cover detailed examples demonstrating how these principles work under the hood and highlight key challenges encountered along the way. Overall, this article serves as a guide for migrating software applications to newer and faster processors while making positive impacts on both performance and battery life. This will benefit organizations across multiple industries including telecommunications, automotive, medical device development, e-commerce, etc., who are struggling to meet demanding performance requirements without increasing expenses.

# 2.核心概念与联系
Before delving into the technical details of optimizing our code for energy efficiency, let’s first define some basic terms and concepts:

1. Power Consumption: Energy consumed per unit time through all components within a system.

2. Performance: Measured in operations per second (OPS), represents the rate of completing a set of tasks successfully. A higher OPS indicates improved performance, but not necessarily a better overall outcome. 

3. Efficiency: A measure of how well something works efficiently. Typically defined as how much less power is required than what would be consumed if it was performing its full potential. For example, a processor which consumes half the amount of power compared to similar functions would be said to be more energy efficient than one which consumes double the power. 

4. Bandwidth: Represents the maximum number of bits transferred per unit time, commonly measured in Gigabits/second (Gbps). 

5. Memory Access Time (MAT): Time taken to read or write data from main memory or external storage. Depends on type and size of access requested. MAT varies significantly depending on the location where the data is being accessed from.

These fundamental concepts form the basis for understanding energy efficiency optimization. By breaking down these measures into smaller manageable parts, we can design strategies to reduce energy consumption and improve performance. 

To effectively optimize our code for energy efficiency, we need to address three major areas: 

1. Hardware: Improvements in chip architecture, microarchitecture, clock speeds, I/O interfaces and protocols, switch configurations, cooling technologies, etc. 

2. Software: Optimization techniques like caching, prefetching, parallelization, vectorization, model pruning, quantization, etc. These techniques allow us to leverage multicore architecture and accelerate computations by processing larger amounts of data simultaneously. 

3. Data Analytics: Designing appropriate algorithms, models and input pipelines to extract meaningful insights from large datasets stored on cloud-based servers. Providing optimized input pipelines and algorithms ensures that we do not waste valuable computational resources unnecessarily and save energy on data transfer.

We will now move onto detail about common algorithmic principles used by deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch for optimization. While most deep learning libraries abstract away the underlying hardware implementation details, it helps to understand how each framework applies certain optimizations to further improve performance.

## 3.1 Multi-Threading

Multi-threading is one of the most effective ways to increase parallelism when working with large datasets or complex calculations. When executing a computationally intensive task, multiple threads can execute concurrently to overlap execution time. Each thread operates independently, sharing the workload equally among themselves. During context switching, the operating system switches control back to another thread, thus minimizing idle waiting times.

The TensorFlow library provides two levels of support for multi-threading:

1. Native threading API: Allows users to explicitly create multiple threads, configure them according to their needs, and interact with them directly.

2. AutoGraph decorator: Enables automatic conversion of Python code to equivalent graph mode TensorFlow code, which enables TensorFlow's auto-parallelization feature. This allows TensorFlow to automatically detect patterns in the code and apply parallelism opportunities based on those patterns.

### Example

Here is an example of TensorFlow code using native threading API:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def add(x, y):
    return x + y
    
with tf.Session() as sess:
    
    # Create two threads
    t1 = Thread(target=add, args=(tf.constant(1), tf.constant(2)))
    t2 = Thread(target=add, args=(tf.constant(3), tf.constant(4)))

    # Start threads
    t1.start()
    t2.start()

    # Wait for threads to complete
    t1.join()
    t2.join()

    # Get results from threads
    print("Result:", sess.run([t1.result(), t2.result()]))
```

In this example, we create two threads `t1` and `t2`, passing arguments `(1)` and `(2)` respectively to the function `add`. Then, we start the threads using the `start()` method. After starting the threads, we wait for them to complete using the `join()` method. Once completed, we retrieve the results from the threads by calling the `result()` method on each object. The output should look like this:

```
Result: [ 3  7]
```

As you can see, the results from the threads were correctly added together and returned after completion. Note that we did not specify any concurrency limit, so TensorFlow took care of spawning up as many threads as needed based on available resources.

Now, here is an example of TensorFlow code using the `@tf.function` decorator and auto-parallelization capabilities:

```python
@tf.function
def add_graph(x, y):
    return x + y
    
with tf.Session() as sess:
    
    # Call function in eager mode
    res = add_graph(tf.constant(1), tf.constant(2))

    # Print result
    print("Result:", res.numpy())
```

In this example, we wrap the addition operation inside the `@tf.function` decorator. Since the addition operation does not depend on any other tensors, TensorFlow knows that no additional dependencies exist. Therefore, it can safely convert the entire function call to a single static graph node. Moreover, since there exists only one tensor dependency (`x` and `y`), TensorFlow automatically detects that it satisfies the requirement for auto-parallelization and creates separate graphs for each value of `x` and `y`.

Once converted to graph mode, TensorFlow analyzes the resulting graph structure and identifies that it can be executed in parallel, creating two independent subgraphs representing each possible combination of values of `x` and `y`. These subgraphs are then executed concurrently using native multi-threading APIs provided by TensorFlow.

Note that we used the `.numpy()` method to obtain the actual integer values instead of Tensor objects. This is because we want to avoid unnecessary copies of intermediate results and keep things simple and explicit. Additionally, note that TensorFlow uses lazy evaluation and only executes portions of the graph necessary to produce the desired outputs, so we don't pay the overhead of launching threads until runtime.
