# 1.背景介绍


Naïve Bayes (NB) is a popular algorithm used for classification tasks. In this article we will explore different types of NB and their differences. We will also explain how to use them in practice using Python programming language. 

Naïve Bayes works by making the assumption that all features are independent from each other given some class label. This means that if one feature has a strong relationship with another feature then it’s more likely that they would appear together when the same class label is presented as input. The basic idea behind the Naïve Bayes algorithm is very simple:

1. Calculate probabilities based on the probability distribution function (PDF). These PDF's can be calculated using various techniques like counting or continuous variables.

2. Use these probabilities to calculate the likelihood of an instance belonging to any particular class. 

3. Finally, we classify an instance into the most probable class. 

There are three main types of Naïve Bayes algorithms: Multinomial, Bernoulli and Gaussian. Each type is suitable for handling different types of data. For example, the Multinomial model is best suited for categorical data such as text classification while the Gaussian model is good at dealing with continuous-valued data such as numerical predictions.

Let us now move on to understand these three types of Naïve Bayes models in detail.<|im_sep|>
# 2.Core Concepts And Relationships
## 2.1 Probability Distributions
In statistics, a probability distribution is a mathematical function that provides us information about the frequency or relative occurrence of possible outcomes of an experiment or random variable. It helps us quantify our uncertainty in predicting future events or results. There are several types of probability distributions:

1. Discrete Distribution: A discrete distribution refers to values that fall within a finite set of integers or points. Examples include binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, etc.

2. Continuous Distribution: A continuous distribution represents a random variable whose outcome can take on arbitrarily exact values between two limits, usually denoted by lower limit $a$ and upper limit $b$. Examples include normal distribution, uniform distribution, etc.

Given a sample space $\Omega$, a probability distribution assigns probabilities to every element of the sample space. We can think of a probability mass function (PMF), which gives the probability that a certain event occurs exactly once, as a cumulative distribution function (CDF), which calculates the probability that a certain value is less than or equal to a certain point.

Probability theory is widely used in fields ranging from mathematics, physics, engineering, economics, finance and psychology. When we study data, we often encounter scenarios where probabilities need to be estimated or computed. Most of the time, we don't have access to a precise formula for the underlying probability distribution of the observed data but instead rely on statistical methods such as hypothesis testing and estimation to make inferences from the observed data.

In order to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution, we first need to know what kind of data it is describing. If the data is categorical, such as words or labels assigned to emails, then we can use a multinomial distribution. On the other hand, if the data is numerical, such as prices, heights, weights, or distances, then we can use a normal distribution or a lognormal distribution depending on whether there is skewness or kurtosis in the data. Both types of distributions share the property that they place most weight on the tails of the distribution. 

We assume that the probability density function of a continuous distribution depends only on its mean and variance. The likelihood function calculates the probability of observing a specific value of the random variable under the assumed probability distribution. For instance, if we observe a score of 80 on a test, assuming a normal distribution, we might say that the chance of obtaining a similar score is around 68%. Mathematically speaking, the likelihood function for a normal distribution is defined as follows:

$$P(X=x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

where $X$ is the random variable, $x$ is the observed value, $\mu$ is the expected value, and $\sigma^2$ is the standard deviation squared. By maximizing the likelihood function over all possible values of $x$, we obtain the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.

A bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution where the number of trials is always 1. Instead of randomly flipping coins, we flip a single coin and record either heads or tails. Thus, the probability of getting heads is p and the probability of getting tails is q = 1 - p. The PMF of a bernoulli distribution is defined as:

$$p(k;p)={\begin{cases} {p \choose k} & \quad if \quad k = 0,1 \\ 0 & \quad otherwise.\end{cases}}$$

The CDF of a bernoulli distribution is defined as:

$$F(k;p)=\sum_{i=0}^kp(i;\theta)$$

where $k$ is the number of successes.

For continuous random variables, we use Gaussians to approximate the PDF because they are easy to compute. However, Gaussians may not be appropriate for all types of data and so other probability distributions exist, such as gamma and exponential families, that provide flexible and powerful ways of modeling complex real-world phenomena.

Bernoulli distributions are particularly useful in binary classification problems where the target variable takes only two values, such as true/false, yes/no, spam/ham, etc. They allow us to represent binary observations with probabilities rather than just indicating presence or absence. We could use them to model things like whether someone is diabetic or not, whether an email is spam or not, or whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. Similarly, we can use multinomial distributions in multi-class classification settings where the target variable can take multiple classes.
