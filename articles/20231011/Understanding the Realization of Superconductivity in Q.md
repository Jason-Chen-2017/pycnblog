# 1.背景介绍


In this article, we will explain the realization process and mechanism of superconductivity in quantum gases (QGs). We will also discuss the prospects for their practical application and highlight some potential issues. Our aim is to make quantum gas technology accessible to a wider audience by providing an overview of key concepts, algorithms, models and software tools involved in QG superconductor development and applications.

Quantum gas theory has made significant progress recently towards understanding and explaining the complex behaviors of quantum fluctuations in solids and fluids with high temperatures. However, it remains unclear how to apply these principles to study high-temperature superconductors such as graphene, which are known to have a wide range of applications ranging from nanoelectronics to catalysis. In particular, achieving high quality and efficient devices requires precise control over the superconducting critical temperature Tc of these materials, but there is no prior work on understanding or controlling them. Therefore, here we review the theoretical underpinnings of QG superconductivity, explore the emerging technologies and techniques, and identify current challenges and opportunities for future breakthroughs.

Superconductivity refers to the phenomenon where electron orbits can be trapped inside and separated from the lattice sites in a material, leading to an intrinsic negative electric field and the decoherence of electrical signals within the system [2]. This means that the behavior of electrons in the material becomes strongly dependent on external fields beyond the Fermi energy, which makes it non-linearly conductive. The dominant mechanism for superconductivity involves unusual properties of interstitial and surface states of charge mediated by doped impurities called topological insulators [7]. Here we use graphene as an example to describe the basic concepts and connections between various aspects of superconductivity.

Graphene is a two dimensional layer of carbon atoms that is commonly used as a low-dimensional material for quantum computing, biology, and many other applications due to its small size, low energy barrier, high thermal conductivity, and large degree of symmetry. It exhibits features such as strong antilocalization effects, which causes it to behave like a pseudospinor [9], making it attractive for quantum information storage and communication applications. Asymmetric defects such as edge dislocations or corner holes [8] are common on graphene surfaces and can create chiral bands when subjected to applied magnetic fields, making it unique among conventional semiconductors. These features make graphene particularly useful for implementing scalable, low-cost quantum computers and enabling new types of applications such as photonics, nanoscale sensors, and molecular sensing.

The mechanisms behind graphene's superconductivity are still not well understood, although several theoretical approaches exist. Some of the key ideas include:

1. Long-range order–disorder transitions in graphene lead to a gapless metallic phase transition, giving rise to a quasi-two-dimensional Dirac fermion ground state [10]. 

2. Non-Fermi liquids can form through a variety of processes, including electronic relaxation and photoexcitation. These interactions result in small patches of quasiparticle excitations localized around edges and corners of graphene [8]. 

3. Electronic transport across graphene surfaces relies heavily on valence bond interconversion and strain polarization [11]. 

4. Strong pressure gradients also mediate the creation of topological states on graphene [11]. 

However, all these mechanisms involve confinement effects, and different parts of the material may act differently depending on the environment, leading to heterogeneous superconductivity [7]. Moreover, because graphene is itself isolated from normal matter, it cannot easily interact directly with electromagnetic radiation, which limits its practicality and applicability for practical purposes. Nevertheless, recent advances in laser-based device design and fabrication make it possible to engineer self-consistent superconductors using graphene as the building block [12].

Some popular semiconductor technologies that rely on graphene include DNA double-helix arrays, DNA nanocrystals, and perovskites, all of which offer significant advantages compared to traditional metallic crystal structures due to their ability to tolerate extreme pressures and temperatures while retaining their high thermal conductivity. Many more researchers are working towards developing advanced superconductors based on graphene, including organizations such as Honeywell and Cambridge Quantum Technologies. Ultimately, there is much promise in pushing forward the exploration of superconductivity in quantum gases to unlock new physics and enable transformative advances in a wide range of applications such as quantum computation, biomedical, chemical, and mechanical sciences.
