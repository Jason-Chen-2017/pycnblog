# 1.背景介绍


In recent years, self-driving cars have been gaining traction and becoming more affordable than ever before. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), currently there are over five million car accidents annually in the United States, which is estimated at around one every two seconds for a total of about $2 billion. To put this into perspective, if there were no self-driving cars available today, each person on average would be responsible for approximately half of all traffic crashes worldwide in the next decade. 

Although these statistics may seem alarming, it's important to understand that they are just some examples of how disruptive technology can be. By replacing human drivers with autonomous vehicles, we could reduce both road accidents and congestion by up to fifty percent. Furthermore, while manual driving remains a key component in many countries such as China, India, and Europe, most of the population still wants or needs access to new technologies that help them get around faster and safer.

However, should self-driving cars become a reality, will they eventually replace humans entirely, or will they play an integral role alongside drivers who work under certain conditions? And what challenges do we face as the industry continues to develop and improve our systems?

In this article, I'll explore these questions using data from the NHTSA to see if self-driving cars actually outperform humans in terms of road safety. We'll also discuss some of the common misconceptions and fallacies surrounding the topic of self-driving cars, including optimism and pessimism, and analyze current advances and future potential benefits and drawbacks. Finally, we'll address any remaining questions and concerns raised by readers and identify areas for further research.

# 2.Core Concepts & Connections
## What Is A Self-Driving Car? 
A self-driving car refers to a vehicle that is capable of navigating independently without the need for driver assistance. The software system running on top of the car controls its movement and takes care of tasks like breaking down complex intersections, avoiding obstacles and ensuring safe parking.

Self-driving cars use sensors and algorithms to perceive their environment and make decisions based on real-time feedback, similar to how humans operate their cars. When placed in front of any given environment, they start moving according to predefined routes and drive through unstructured environments effectively. For instance, Tesla’s Model S self-drives smoothly across city streets despite the presence of heavy traffic congestion.

Some notable companies that offer self-driving services include Google, Uber, Yahoo! JAPAN, Waymo, Amazon, NVIDIA, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Daimler AG, Volkswagen, and Mercedes-Benz. Although the majority of these companies are focusing on automobiles and transportation, others have made progress in other applications, such as healthcare and manufacturing.

The following video highlights some significant technological advancements in the last few years related to self-driving cars:

As you can see, the development of intelligent infrastructure, machine learning techniques, computer vision, robotics, and programming skills has enabled self-driving cars to perform a wide range of tasks. However, there are still significant limitations in terms of accuracy and performance due to the complexity of the tasks and environments they must navigate. Nevertheless, the long term goal is clear – self-driving cars will ultimately provide more convenience, safety, and mobility than even fully automated ones.

## Should Self-Driving Cars Replace Humans?
Ultimately, the answer depends on several factors, including demand, competition, economic feasibility, ethical considerations, and practicality. Despite rapid technological progress, the cost of implementing a fully functional self-driving car in a city remains high, making it difficult to justify their deployment in large numbers. Additionally, although self-driving cars promise substantial improvements over traditional vehicles, it's likely that some form of hybrid model will be required to achieve optimal levels of efficiency and safety.

According to the US Transportation Statistics bureau, roughly 40% of American adults choose to own a car rather than rent, accounting for nearly a third of all vehicles sold in the country. That said, self-driving cars may still prove useful in emergency situations where traditional vehicles fail, such as when pedestrians run away from an automated car or encounter an obstacle that cannot be avoided by the driver alone. Moreover, people may opt for a self-driving car only after evaluating its features and capabilities instead of solely relying on the price tag.

Overall, it's impossible to determine whether self-driving cars will eventually supplant humans in every scenario, but some common scenarios might include:

1. Improvements in safety, speed, and reliability
2. Reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality
3. Lower fuel consumption and lower costs of ownership
4. Improved employee productivity and retention rates
5. Increased job satisfaction and engagement
6. Ability to work remotely or virtually whenever and wherever desired

To assess the impact of self-driving cars on different industries, governments, and societal norms, we need to understand how they compare to existing models and evaluate their effectiveness on a wider scale. Additionally, we need to consider how these changes affect individuals' lives, businesses, organizations, and political institutions. If the benefits of self-driving cars outweigh the risks and problems associated with developing and maintaining them, then they could become a reality within a relatively short time frame.
