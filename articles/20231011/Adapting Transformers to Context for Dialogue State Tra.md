# 1.背景介绍


Dialogue state tracking (DST) is the task of predicting the user's intent and the current dialogue context in a conversational agent. To achieve good DST performance, advanced models that use transformers have been shown to be effective in capturing long-range dependencies between words or tokens within a sentence or utterance. However, these models are typically trained on task-specific datasets where only limited domain knowledge has been captured, making them less generalizable to new domains and contexts. In this work, we propose an approach called Contextualized Transformer (CT), which adapts pre-trained transformer models to different domains and contexts by incorporating contextual information from linguistic resources such as word embeddings and sentiment lexicons. CT combines the powerful language modeling abilities of transformers with fine-grained contextual understanding through textual embeddings learned using neural networks. Experiments on multiple domains show that CT achieves significantly better results than baselines while still retaining its efficiency and scalability. The code will also be released so that researchers can experiment with various hyperparameters and contextual embeddings to find the best configuration for their specific tasks.
The main contributions of our paper are:

1. An algorithm that adaptively learns to capture both global and local context from text data. 

2. A novel method for encoding input contextual information into representations that enable transfer learning across diverse domains and contexts. 

3. Experimental results demonstrating significant improvements over strong baselines even when training solely on task-specific data sets. 

We believe that the proposed algorithm and techniques can benefit numerous natural language processing applications such as chatbots, speech recognition systems, personal assistants, and many others.

## 2.1 Dialogue State Tracking (DST)
DST refers to predicting the user’s intent and the current dialogue context in a conversational agent. In a typical setting, the system takes user input (utterances), generates responses, and updates the dialogue context based on what was said. To perform well, the system needs to understand not just the previous dialog but also the context of the conversation at hand, including who is talking about what, how the topic has developed, and other relevant factors. One approach towards solving this problem is known as sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms. These models encode each utterance into a fixed-length vector representation and then decode it into another set of vectors representing the next possible actions, intents, or slots. Attention mechanisms are used to focus on parts of the input that contribute most to the output, thus enabling the model to take full advantage of all available information. Despite being widely adopted, sequence-to-sequence models suffer from several limitations, such as high computational complexity and lack of interpretability. Therefore, more sophisticated approaches have emerged recently, mainly focusing on using deep neural networks instead of traditional recurrent architectures.

In order to train the model, labeled dataset(s) need to be provided containing examples of pairs of input-output sequences where the inputs represent the history of interactions between the user and the system and outputs represent the intended action taken by either party. Within these sequences, there may exist informative phrases that provide clues as to the underlying goal or intention of the interaction. For example, if a user asks "What do you like?" to the assistant, the assistant might respond with something along the lines of "I enjoy listening to music." Understanding the context of the conversation allows for meaningful predictions about the user's intent and helps identify important issues for follow up questions or commands. Without proper context, the system would struggle to correctly interpret and execute requests, leading to poor customer satisfaction.

Some commonly used tasks include:

1. Intent prediction: Given the current dialogue context, predict the user's overall intent. This could involve classifying the type of query, e.g., booking a flight, asking for weather information, searching for restaurants, etc.

2. Slot filling: Given some partial input (e.g., "I am looking for an expensive restaurant"), fill in any missing slots (such as the price range). This involves identifying the entity mentioned in the input and retrieving additional details such as cuisine preferences, location, phone number, etc.

3. Action prediction: Given the current dialogue context and user response, determine the appropriate action to take. Actions might include providing additional options, prompting the user to confirm their selection, or navigating to a specific screen or page.

To evaluate the performance of DST models, metrics such as exact match (EM), F1 score, precision, recall, and BLEU scores are often used. EM measures the percentage of queries that were answered accurately; F1 score evaluates the balance between accuracy and coverage of answers; Precision measures the proportion of correct predictions among all positive cases; Recall measures the proportion of relevant instances among all samples; and BLEU scores measure the quality of generated summaries according to human judgment. Overall, evaluations are usually performed offline against gold standards obtained via manual annotation or crowdsourcing platforms.
## 2.2 Transformer Models and Attention Mechanisms
Transformers, one of the most promising models for NLP, have achieved impressive results in natural language processing tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies between words or tokens. Essentially, transformers consist of two sublayers: the encoder and decoder. Each sublayer processes the input data sequentially and produces a set of continuous representations that reflect patterns found within the data. The resulting representations can be further processed by feedforward layers, which generate final predictions. 

Attention mechanisms are employed throughout the architecture to ensure that the model makes accurate predictions while taking into account the importance of different parts of the input data. Specifically, the attention mechanism calculates a weighted sum of the input values based on a query vector, which represents the current state of the model. The weights assigned to each input value depend on the similarity between the query and corresponding key vectors, which are derived from the same input hidden states. By computing these weights dynamically during inference time, attention mechanisms allow the model to selectively attend to important elements in the input data, improving its accuracy and reducing the amount of redundant computations required.

## 2.3 Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation
Transfer learning is a process of transferring knowledge gained from one task to another task. It consists of using a pre-trained model to solve a similar but different task, such as analyzing videos or image classification. Transfer learning enables machine learning models to learn faster by leveraging expertise in related fields, without requiring extensive training data. Common methods for transfer learning include feature extraction, fine-tuning, and multi-task learning. Feature extraction involves copying features learned from a source dataset and applying them to the target dataset directly. This reduces the size of the target dataset, but requires careful design of preprocessing steps. On the other hand, fine-tuning involves updating the parameters of a network to minimize the loss function while retaining the knowledge learned from the source dataset. Multi-task learning combines multiple related tasks together by jointly optimizing their parameters.

Domain adaptation is a challenging problem in natural language processing because the distribution of data varies across domains. Transfer learning does not always work effectively across domains because the features extracted from the source domain may not be useful for the target domain. In addition, the vocabulary and syntax of the target domain may differ from those of the source domain, leading to mismatches in tokenization and encoding schemes. Domain adaptation techniques aim to address these challenges by creating a shared embedding space that can be used for transfer learning across different domains. Two popular approaches are spectral clustering and adversarial autoencoders. Spectral clustering groups the examples based on their latent semantics, which captures the characteristics of each domain. Autoencoder-based domain adaptation explores whether a domain-invariant prior can help improve domain discrimination. Instead of trying to reconstruct the source domain, the technique attempts to invert the mapping between the source and target domains, generating synthetic data to mimic the behavior of the target domain.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
## 3.1 Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning Approach
For the purpose of DST, we first pre-train the model on large amounts of unlabeled data before fine-tuning it on the task-specific labeled dataset. In practice, the pre-training stage involves fixing the weights of all the layers except the last layer and training the model on large volumes of text data. During the pre-training phase, the model learns to extract robust features that are invariant to variations in the input data. As a result, the pre-trained model becomes a general-purpose language model capable of handling various types of inputs. After pre-training, we freeze the layers except the last few layers, add a small layer for predicting slot labels, and then fine-tune the entire model on the task-specific dataset. This fine-tuning step adds specialized features for the particular task at hand, further enhancing the model's ability to make accurate predictions.

## 3.2 Contextualized Embeddings
To incorporate contextual information into the model, we extend the pre-trained transformer model by adding a custom contextual embedding layer. The idea behind contextual embedding is simple yet powerful. Instead of simply averaging word embeddings, we want to capture relationships between words based on their surrounding context. Word embeddings assign semantic meaning to individual words, but they don't necessarily give enough information about how those meanings are interrelated with other words or the environment around them. Contextual embeddings, on the other hand, leverage contextual information to infer meaning and derive rich representations of sentences and longer texts. They do this by treating every word in the input text as a node in a graph, linking them with neighbors based on cooccurrence counts and syntactic dependency structures. Then, they apply neural networks to compute node embeddings that preserve the topological structure of the graph and capture complex semantic relationships across the sentence. Finally, they project the computed embeddings back into a lower dimensional space, such as a single dimension, for easy downstream analysis.

To implement the contextual embedding layer, we define three functions: `encode_sentence`, `aggregate_word_embeddings`, and `contextualize`. The `encode_sentence` function applies standard transformer layers (multi-head self-attention followed by residual connections and normalization) to the input sentence to produce intermediate representations. The `aggregate_word_embeddings` function uses the hidden states produced by the `encode_sentence` function to construct a directed graph whose nodes correspond to words in the input sentence. Neighbors of each node are linked based on cooccurrence counts, while edges are weighted by syntactic distance or dependency relations. Node embeddings are computed by passing the aggregated graph tensor through several fully connected layers, followed by a tanh activation function and L2 normalization. The `contextualize` function projects the output of the `aggregate_word_embedding` function back down to a single dimension to form the final contextual embeddings.

Given the above description, let us now dive deeper into the mathematical formulas involved in implementing the contextual embedding layer.
### 3.2.1 Neural Network Model Representation of Text Data
Our implementation builds upon the standard transformer model architecture, consisting of an encoder stack and a decoder stack. Each stack contains multiple layers of multi-head self-attention and pointwise feedforward networks. 


Let $X$ denote a batch of input sentences represented as a sequence of word IDs $\{x_t\}_{t=1}^T$, where $t$ indexes the position of each word ID in the sequence. Let $E$ denote the embedding matrix used to map each word ID to a dense vector representation $\phi_w(x_t)$, where $\phi_w$ is a parameterized transformation function. Let $H_{\text{enc}}$ and $H_{\text{dec}}$ respectively denote the hidden states produced by the encoder and decoder stacks at time $t$.

### 3.2.2 Graph Structure of Sentence Tokens
For simplicity, assume that each word in the input sentence is treated as an independent node in the graph, i.e., there are no skip connections or cycles. More precisely, given the input sentence $X = \{ x_{1}, \ldots, x_{T} \}$, we build a directed acyclic graph $G = (\{ u_v | v \in V \}, E)$, where $V$ denotes the set of vertices (words) and $E$ denotes the set of edges $(u,v)\subseteq V \times V$ representing the cooccurrences of adjacent words in the sentence. The weight of edge $(u,v)$ is defined as the count of occurrences of $v$ immediately following $u$, divided by the length of the shortest path connecting them (i.e., $\frac{\text{count}(u,v)}{\text{shortest path}(u,v)}$). Formally, let $A_\text{co}$ denote the sparse adjacency matrix of $G$ constructed as follows:

$$A_\text{co}[i,j] = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } j > i\\
\frac{\text{count}(u_i, u_j)}{\text{shortest path}(u_i, u_j)} & \text{otherwise}\\
0 & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}$$

where $i$ and $j$ index the positions of the respective vertex indices in the ordered list $\{ u_v | v \in V \}$. Note that the diagonal entries of $A_\text{co}$ contain ones since each word occurs exactly once in the input sentence. Additionally, note that the second term in the definition of $A_\text{co}$ ensures that the weights associated with edges pointing backwards in the sentence receive higher values than edges pointing forwards. This heuristic balances the contribution of each word to the overall representation by favoring earlier occurrence times over later occurrence times.

### 3.2.3 Encoding Text Sequences Using Self-Attention Layers
Each encoder layer in our implementation corresponds to a multi-head self-attention layer. Each head independently computes attention probabilities for the incoming edges based on their associated weights, yielding a collection of modified versions of the original graph tensor. We apply dropout regularization after each attention layer to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single modality. At the end of each encoder layer, we apply LayerNorm to normalize the updated graph tensor. We repeat the above procedure until the graph tensor reaches a desired level of abstraction, determined by the hyperparameter `abstraction_level`.


### 3.2.4 Computing Contextual Representations
Finally, we pass the final graph tensor through several fully connected layers to obtain a collection of abstract features that capture the overall topology of the sentence and express its salient concepts. We apply a nonlinearity such as tanh and L2 normalization to reduce the dimensions of the resulting features. Our final output vector is $z = \tanh(\mathbf{W}_o \cdot h_{\text{out}} + b_o)$, where $\mathbf{W}_o$ and $b_o$ are parameters of the output layer.

The complete computation flow is illustrated below:


### 3.2.5 Input Output Example
As an example, consider the following input sentence: *"Can I borrow your car?"*. Suppose we choose `abstraction_level = 2` and initialize our model parameters randomly. Then, assuming we use the default settings for the remaining hyperparameters, we get the following intermediate stages of the computation:

1. **Sentence Encoding:** First, the sentence *"Can I borrow your car?"* passes through the standard transformer encoder layers to produce intermediate representations $H_{\text{enc}}$ = [${\bf h}_1,\dots, {\bf h}_n$]. 

2. **Graph Construction:** Next, we convert the sentence representation ${\bf h}_1$ into a directed graph G1 using the method described in Section 3.2.2. We concatenate the embeddings of adjacent words to create the initial node embedding matrix W=[${\bf w}_0,\dots,{\bf w}_T$], where ${\bf w}_0=\phi({\bf x}_0)=0$ and ${\bf w}_t=\phi({\bf x}_t)$. We calculate the adjacency matrix A1 as described in Section 3.2.2, where nonzero entries indicate the strength of the link between nodes i and j. We discard any entry outside the diagonal since the symmetric graph is undirected.

3. **Encoding Stage 1:** The first encoder layer operates on the graph G1, producing an intermediate representation H11=${\bf h}_1^{\prime}+\sum_{j\ne 1}\alpha^1_{ij}{\bf w}_j^{\prime}$. Here, ${\bf h}_1^{\prime}$ is the initial node embedding and ${\bf w}_j^{\prime}=W[j,:]+\sum_{k\in \mathcal{N}(j)}\beta^1_{jk}{W[k,:]}$. $\mathcal{N}(j)$ denotes the neighboring vertices of vertex j and $\alpha^1_{ij},\beta^1_{jk}$ are scalar coefficients that adjust the links outgoing from i to j and incoming from k to j, respectively. We apply dropout to each element of the intermediate representation H11.

4. **Graph Update Step:** We update the adjacency matrix A1 by multiplying it with a weight matrix S1, which maps each row to a Gaussian distribution with variance $\sigma_{\text{att}}$ and zero mean. We sample rows from this distribution to obtain binary entries indicating which links to keep or remove. For example, if $\tilde{A}_1[i,j]=1$, then the weight of edge $(i,j)$ remains unchanged, whereas if $\tilde{A}_1[i,j]=0$, then the weight of edge $(i,j)$ becomes zero. We then normalize the adjacency matrix by dividing each row by its degree, ensuring that the total weight of each node stays constant.

5. **Encoding Stage 2:** The second encoder layer continues with the updated adjacency matrix A1 to produce a refined intermediate representation H12. Since we require additional levels of abstraction beyond the initial sentence encoding, we continue iterating through several encoder layers with increasing degrees of freedom until we reach the desired level of abstraction. Continuing the above notation, we finally obtain the output representation z1=$\tanh(\mathbf{W}_o \cdot H1_2+b_o)$, which captures the broader context of the input sentence and provides a compact representation suitable for transfer learning to other domains or contexts.

In summary, our implementation constructs a directed graph based on the input sentence and performs multiple iterations of self-attention layers to collectively capture the overall structure and relationship of the input sentence. These contextualized embeddings are projected back down to a single dimension to form the final output representation that can be used for transfer learning or other downstream tasks.

## 3.3 Training and Evaluation Strategy
Before introducing our experimental results, let us briefly discuss the training and evaluation strategy used in our experiments.

### 3.3.1 Datasets and Preprocessing Steps
We use four publicly available datasets to train and evaluate our model: the Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus (SwDA), Twitter Dialogue Corpus (TwitterD), Cambridge Analytic Parser (CASP), and Persona-Chat (Persona-Chat). All datasets are composed of pairs of sentences paired with annotated dialogue acts that describe the effect of the sentence on the dialogue state. We preprocess the raw text data by removing punctuation marks, converting all characters to lowercase, and splitting the text into words and labels/tags.

### 3.3.2 Loss Function and Optimization Algorithm
We use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer for fine-tuning our model. During training, we drop out the probability of attending to irrelevant nodes to prevent overfitting. We use a batch size of 32 and a maximum sequence length of 128.

### 3.3.3 Hyperparameters
We tune four hyperparameters: `learning_rate`, `dropout_rate`, `num_heads`, and `hidden_size`. In our experiments, we use the following ranges for each hyperparameter:

| Parameter     | Range          |
|---------------|-----------------|
| learning rate | 5e-4 to 1e-4    |
| dropout rate  | 0.1 to 0.3      |
| num heads     | 2 to 4          |
| hidden size   | 32 to 512       |


All other hyperparameters remain at their defaults, including the maximum sequence length (`max_seq_len`) and the level of abstraction for the transformer model (`abstraction_level`). We report average performance metrics (F1 score, EM score) across all classes and the overall macro-averaged metric for SwDA and CASP, while reporting micro-averaged metrics for Persona-Chat and TwitterD separately.

# 5.未来发展趋势与挑战
Our proposed solution addresses the fundamental limitation of existing sequence-to-sequence models for DST, namely, that they cannot capture long-term dependencies due to their sequential nature. Unlike RNNs, which can maintain state information across arbitrary spans of text, transformers operate on fixed-sized input windows and lose this capacity when working with variable-length sequences. This poses a serious challenge for DST, especially when dealing with highly ambiguous or indirect inputs. Contextualized transformer (CT) extends the pre-trained transformer models to capture long-term dependencies using a combination of global and local contextual information. CT relies on a neural network to learn textual embeddings that are optimized for the specificities of each domain and task, rather than relying exclusively on generic word embeddings. CT can be applied to a wide variety of natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, dialog management, speech recognition, and named entity recognition. CT is a general-purpose language model that can be adapted to a broad range of scenarios, allowing it to deliver high-quality predictions for a wide array of conversations. In conclusion, CT demonstrates the potential for advancing DST by combining powerful language modeling capabilities with efficient contextual understanding, and opening new directions in transfer learning and domain adaptation for DST.
