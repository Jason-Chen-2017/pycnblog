# 1.背景介绍


传统的监督学习方法中，往往采用一个监督变量的标签信息作为训练目标，对模型进行训练，使得模型能够更好地拟合输入样本及其标签之间的关系。然而，在很多实际应用场景下，标签信息难以获取或缺乏足够质量。因此，如何利用无标签的数据进行监督学习，仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。Graph Autoencoder (GAE) 是一种无监督学习的有效方式，通过对图数据进行编码，可以有效地捕获局部的全局结构信息，从而为节点的标签分布学习提供指导。

## 定义
Label distribution learning (LDL), also known as graph embedding, is a natural language processing technique that learns the latent representation of nodes in a network based on their labeled neighborhoods [7]. In other words, LDL aims to find a low-dimensional vector representation for each node such that similar nodes have close vectors while dissimilar nodes are further apart. The core idea behind GAE and its variants is to learn the label distribution in a graph using neural networks. However, unlike traditional supervised machine learning algorithms where only one target variable is present, this problem involves two or more variables - labels and features. To address this issue, we use multiple encoder networks and separate decoders for each feature. Each decoder generates predictions for a particular feature from the learned latent representation. By combining these predictions, we can obtain the final prediction for the entire set of input data points. 

In summary, the goal of LDL is to learn an interpretable low-dimensional representation of graphs based on their node embeddings by capturing both local and global structure information associated with the node labels. We use neural networks to achieve this task by training multiple encoders to capture different aspects of the node label distributions separately. These encoders generate a common latent space which is then used by separate decoders to predict individual features of interest. Finally, we combine the predicted features to produce the overall predicted label for each node. This approach allows us to handle multiple variables without assuming any underlying relationships between them, making it suitable for applications involving heterogeneous data types.


## Related Work
Label propagation algorithm [1] has been widely used in many fields including social networks, text analysis, bioinformatics etc., to infer the missing labels through propagating the labels throughout the network. While effective, it relies heavily on handcrafted features or complex models, and hence cannot be directly applied to large-scale real world datasets. Other popular techniques include deep generative model such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) [3], Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [4], and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [5]. However, all of these methods require prior knowledge of hidden structures of the dataset. They cannot provide direct insights into the label distributions.

One key advantage of GAE is that it does not rely on any prior assumptions about the hidden structures. Instead, it uses simple feedforward neural networks to automatically extract relevant features from the input graph. It applies the same architecture across various tasks requiring node labeling, thereby enabling domain transfer among related domains. Moreover, GAE can effectively incorporate hierarchical information present in some real-world graphs, which may enhance the accuracy of label propagation. Nonetheless, GAE has several limitations compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches like VAE and RBM: limited expressiveness due to linearity of architectures; slow convergence speed due to stochastic optimization process; difficulty in handling noisy inputs due to sparse gradients. Hence, additional advances in efficient optimization techniques and regularization mechanisms are required to fully leverage the potential of GAE.

Finally, GAE has become increasingly popular recently due to its ability to deal with complex heterogeneous datasets efficiently. It has been used successfully in numerous applications, ranging from drug discovery to protein interaction prediction. Several works proposed extensions to GAE, such as conditional adjacency matrices and aggregators [6, 9]. These methods improve the quality of learned representations by exploiting additional information in the input graph. Despite significant improvements over the original GAE, new research directions are emerging, particularly focusing on scalability, robustness, and interpretability.
