# 1.背景介绍

Business Intelligence (BI) systems are widely used by organizations to transform raw data into valuable business insights. In recent years, the evolution of BI technology has been fast and significant, leading to the development of a new generation of enterprise-class BI software systems that offer unprecedented flexibility and scalability in terms of both scale and functionality. However, how these modern BI systems are designed is still an open question with limited understanding among developers and architects. 

In this paper, we present an architecture perspective on evolving business intelligence system architectures. We first provide a brief history of BI technologies from their roots in database management systems to more recent big data analytics platforms. Then, based on a number of key principles of the successful design process for various types of BI systems, we discuss different components and patterns involved in designing effective BI systems. Next, we highlight some important challenges such as complexity, interoperability, security, performance, etc., and propose solutions or strategies to overcome them. Finally, we also give several examples demonstrating our point using real world scenarios. This paper can serve as a guideline for developing better BI systems that can handle increasingly complex, large-scale, and heterogeneous datasets effectively while still maintaining high quality of service levels.

# 2.Core Concepts and Connections
## 2.1 Introduction 
The field of business intelligence refers to the application of statistical methods, computer science techniques, and information visualization to extract meaningful insight from organizational data. Within this context, there have been many technological advances over the past decade, including the rise of cloud computing, big data processing frameworks, and advanced machine learning algorithms. The explosion of data amounts has led to an increase in the size and complexity of business intelligence systems, which necessitates scalable, flexible, and efficient architectures. 

In order to address these issues, various enterprise-level BI systems have emerged, offering varying degrees of complexity and scalability. Some of the most popular systems include Tableau, QlikView, Microsoft Power BI, Oracle Data Quality, SAP BW/4HANA, and Google Analytics. Each one offers unique features and capabilities, making it difficult for users to make informed decisions about which system best fits their needs. Furthermore, because they are all different, it becomes difficult for developers to create robust and reliable applications that integrate seamlessly across multiple systems. 

To overcome these limitations, we need to develop highly integrated and flexible business intelligence systems capable of handling massive volumes of data efficiently and meeting the ever-increasing demand for BI services. One possible approach to solving this problem is through evolutionary design of business intelligence systems. 

Evolutionary design involves continuous improvement throughout the lifetime of the system, often focusing on areas such as usability, accessibility, reliability, maintainability, and performance optimization. By applying rigorous principles of software engineering, researchers have found that building sustainable and flexible business intelligence systems requires a multi-faceted approach. We need to ensure that the system remains adaptable and versatile enough to handle changing requirements and environments; incorporate diverse user groups and contexts to accommodate multilingual needs; improve overall system efficiency and productivity; and manage resources effectively to avoid bottlenecks and deliver value to stakeholders. 

This article will explore the concepts and principles behind evolutionary design approaches to creating effective business intelligence systems, illustrated with examples drawn from the literature and practical experiences. Specifically, we'll focus on four main principles of evolutionary design: 

1. Reusability 
2. Flexibility
3. Scalability
4. Adaptability

We'll then demonstrate how each principle contributes towards achieving the goals of building reusable, flexible, scalable, and adaptive business intelligence systems. Additionally, we'll look at the role of domain experts and technical proficiency in shaping the development process.


## 2.2 What Is Evolutionary Design?
Evolutionary design is a way of thinking about the design process that encourages incremental improvements over time rather than a single shot solution. It combines empirical research, creativity, and pragmatic approaches to identify and solve problems, often taking inspiration from nature's ability to evolve. A central tenet of evolutionary design is the idea that “better” designs arise through continually refining existing ones, not simply by trying out new ideas independently. 

There are three main stages of evolutionary design: 

1. Conception stage: where the initial concept is formed and tested within the context of the problem being addressed.

2. Experimentation phase: here, a team tests and evaluates different design options against realistic constraints and feedback. They aim to find the optimal combination of design factors that achieve desired outcomes while minimizing harmful side effects and negative consequences.

3. Deployment phase: once the best option(s) have been identified, the finalized solution may be deployed to users, customer support, or other interested parties. At this point, the design should be optimized for use over long periods of time without disrupting current operations or workflows.

It’s worth noting that evolutionary design is not a panacea and may require careful consideration of tradeoffs between specific objectives and constraints. Good practice can help teams navigate unexpected obstacles and challenge old assumptions while staying focused on generating new knowledge and insights.

## 2.3 Why Use Evolutionary Design for BI Systems?
### 2.3.1 Robustness and Flexibility
One common criticism of traditional IT infrastructure is its dependence on static design plans and rigid coding standards. Even small changes in hardware, operating system, or middleware can cause widespread disruption and slow down any deployment or upgrade effort. Similarly, a poorly planned, implemented, or documented BI system can lead to delays or failures that could potentially jeopardize critical business processes. To ensure resilience and ease of maintenance, businesses typically invest heavily in testing and monitoring procedures and regularly updating versions. 

However, these practices don't always translate directly to the design and implementation of BI systems. Traditional programming methodologies like waterfall, spiral, or V-model can become impractical when dealing with vast, dynamic, and noisy data streams. These systems must constantly adapt and learn new insights from incoming data, requiring a modular and flexible architecture that can quickly respond to changing business conditions. A good example of a flexible and adaptable system is the power of Hadoop, which allows analysts to analyze petabytes of data spread across thousands of nodes, dynamically adding or removing capacity as needed. 

By adopting an iterative, incremental approach, evolutionary design offers a powerful tool for addressing these issues. Developers can start with a basic prototype and gradually add features until they reach a state that meets the specific needs of the target audience. Testing, integration, and evaluation cycles can occur frequently during this process to identify and mitigate potential risks. Overall, this approach helps reduce risk, increase flexibility, and enhance overall system reliability.

### 2.3.2 Modularity and Scalability
Modularity is essential for enabling quick and easy modification of a BI system. Components that can be swapped or upgraded individually enable faster iterations and reduced downtime. Additionally, a well-designed architecture promotes scalability by allowing multiple instances of the same component to run concurrently on separate servers, further reducing the burden placed upon individual hardware. Thus, a strong modularity structure coupled with appropriate clustering techniques can significantly speed up the deployment and management of BI systems.

Adopting a microservices architecture style can further promote scalability by breaking down monolithic systems into smaller, independent modules that can easily be scaled horizontally across multiple servers. Examples of such systems include Apache Spark, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Kafka, and Elasticsearch. Each module can be responsible for a particular task, ensuring that errors do not propagate to other parts of the system. This approach simplifies maintenance and provides greater flexibility in managing the entire system.

### 2.3.3 Interoperability and Compositionality
Interoperability plays an essential role in successfully integrating BI systems. Different vendors or systems may use different formats or protocols, but interoperability ensures that data flows smoothly between them. For example, companies who want to leverage Amazon Web Services (AWS) data warehouse solutions can connect their AWS Redshift clusters to their IBM Cognos BI environment via JDBC connectors. Since AWS uses PostgreSQL, connecting the two can be done easily without the need for data transformations.

Another aspect of interoperability concerns compositionality. Assembling multiple subsystems together enables users to obtain more comprehensive views of their business data. Often, this means combining different sources of data – such as transactional databases, OLAP cubes, and semantic models – into a unified view. To accomplish this, tools such as Ralph Seven Eyes allow users to combine reports, dashboards, and metrics generated by different tools into a single interface.

### 2.3.4 Adaptability and Complexity Management
Systems built following traditional programming methodologies can become obsolete and difficult to modify over time due to the sheer quantity of code required to implement even simple features. While evolutionary design provides a useful framework for addressing these issues, it doesn't necessarily guarantee improved long-term results. Many organisations struggle to anticipate the full range of future requirements and expectations, leaving them vulnerable to compromised designs that fail to meet the changing needs of the business. Despite the importance of stability and scalability, it's crucial for organisations to balance the needs of short-term decision-making with the desire to remain competitive in the marketplace.

Evolutionary design can help organisations overcome these challenges by introducing gradual changes instead of sudden, drastic improvements. Development teams can continue to refine and improve existing solutions while identifying ways to tailor them to future requirements and constraints. Continuous improvement is essential for creating a resilient and adaptable system that can keep pace with the evolving business landscape.
