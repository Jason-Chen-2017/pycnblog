# 1.背景介绍


Linear regression is a supervised learning technique used to predict the dependent variable (Y) based on one or more independent variables (X). The algorithm works by finding the best line that fits the data points. 

In this article we will see how we can implement gradient descent in Python for linear regression using the scikit-learn library and understand its working principles along with implementing it from scratch. We will also compare both methods of computing the coefficients to check if they are giving the same result.

Let's start by installing the required libraries:
```python
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```
We will use NumPy library for numerical calculations and Pandas library for data manipulation. Scikit-learn provides us with an easy way to perform machine learning tasks such as linear regression and gradient descent. Matplotlib and Seaborn provide us with useful visualization tools to help us interpret our results better.

Before we begin let me explain what is gradient descent exactly. It is a popular optimization algorithm used to find the minimum value of a function or curve called cost function. It works by iteratively moving towards the direction of steepest decrease in order to minimize the cost function. Here is the general step-by-step process of gradient descent:

1. Start with some initial guess values of theta parameters
2. Compute the error between predicted output Y_hat and actual output Y
3. Calculate the slope of the error surface at each point using the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to theta 
4. Move downhill in the direction of the negative of the gradient (i.e., the opposite direction of the slope) to minimize the cost function. 
Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence to a local minimum.

It is important to note that gradient descent does not always give the global minimum but instead it converges to the local minimum which may be different depending on the starting point of the iteration. Therefore, it is necessary to initialize the parameters randomly several times before performing the final training. Finally, when comparing the two approaches, we should ensure that we have initialized the parameters randomly so that any differences could come solely due to randomness.  

Now let’s get started by importing the required libraries and generating some sample data for demonstration purposes:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

np.random.seed(42) # set seed for reproducibility

# generate dataset
X, y = datasets.make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=20, coef=True, random_state=42)

df = pd.DataFrame({'X': X.reshape(-1), 'y': y}) # create dataframe for plotting purpose

sns.lmplot('X', 'y', data=df, fit_reg=False); # plot scatterplot without regression line
plt.show()
```

The code above generates a simple dataset consisting of 100 samples with just one feature and adds some noise to the target variable. Then, it plots the generated data using seaborn library's lmplot function. 

Next, we need to split the data into training and testing sets:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

Finally, we can define our linear regression model and compute the coefficients using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class:

```python
# Define linear regression model
lr = LinearRegression()

# Train the model on the training set
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Intercept:", lr.intercept_)
print("Coefficients:", lr.coef_[0])
```

The intercept represents the bias term while the coefficient represents the weight assigned to the single input feature (in this case, only one column exists in the input matrix). Since we have a linear relationship, these numbers should be close to each other. However, there is no guarantee since random initialization plays a significant role in the convergence rate of gradient descent.
