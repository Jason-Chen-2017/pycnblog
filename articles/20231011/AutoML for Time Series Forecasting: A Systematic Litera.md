# 1.背景介绍


Time series forecasting is a challenging and important machine learning task. Traditional statistical models such as ARMA or ARIMA can handle limited historical data effectively but have several limitations including insufficient flexibility to capture the complex seasonal patterns in time series. Neural networks (NN) are also capable of modeling temporal dependencies, which makes them promising candidates for handling time-series data with nonlinearity. However, building high-quality NN models requires expertise in deep neural networks (DNNs), model selection techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and data preprocessing.

To simplify the process of building effective time series forecasting systems, there has been an increasing interest in automated machine learning (AutoML). Researchers have proposed various AutoML methods that can automatically search for suitable models, parameters, and configurations to improve performance on given datasets. One approach called Deep Learning based Model Ensembles (DLME) combines multiple DNN architectures trained on different subsets of input features or hyperparameters to generate predictions with better accuracy than individual models. Another approach called Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) combines both spatial and temporal information by using images, text, and other types of data sources together to generate accurate predictions.

In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art approaches to automate time series forecasting tasks. We first present a systematic literature review to identify the main research directions, problems, challenges, solutions, and open issues related to AutoML for time series forecasting. Then, we discuss the common principles, algorithms, and techniques used in these methods to address each problem. Finally, we provide guidance on how to integrate the above techniques into real-world applications and consider future research directions. 

# 2.Core Concepts and Related Terms
## Definition of Forecasting
Forecasting refers to estimating or predicting future values of a variable based on past observations. In general, the goal of forecasting is to enable decision making and achieve economic benefit. It involves analyzing trends, cycles, and volatility in data sets to make reasonable assumptions about what will happen next and anticipate potential outcomes. The output of a forecasting model is a prediction of one or more quantitative variables at specific times in the future. Forecasting models typically use a combination of statistics, mathematics, and computational techniques. Some examples include linear regression, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and hierarchical recurrent neural network (HRNN).

## Types of Time Series Data Sets
There are three major classes of time series data sets: univariate, multivariate, and mixed type. Univariate time series represent single variables such as sales, electricity consumption, temperature measurements, etc., while multivariate time series consist of multiple variables collected over time, e.g., stock prices, weather data, traffic counts. Mixed type time series are combinations of different data types, e.g., seismic activity data combined with climate change indicators.

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning Approaches for Forecasting
Supervised learning focuses on training a model by feeding it labeled data from known outcomes. The target value(s) are usually provided beforehand, either through experts’ judgement or via actual observations during the training phase. Examples include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks. Unsupervised learning relies only on the input data without any prior knowledge about the targets, and aims to discover insights and structure inherent in the data. This includes clustering analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and autoencoder networks.

## Challenges of Forecasting Time Series Data
The most common challenges associated with time series forecasting are the nonstationarity, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation of error terms. Nonstationarity occurs when the mean and variance of the time series changes over time, leading to fluctuations in its behavior. Heteroscedasticity describes the presence of different variances across the time period, making it difficult to model accurately. Autocorrelation refers to the correlation between adjacent residual errors, resulting in incorrect predictions due to redundancy in the data. To mitigate these challenges, the following strategies can be employed:

1. **Seasonality:** Seasonality arises because of the repetitive occurrence of certain events over a fixed interval, such as the weekly pattern in daily data. Identifying and correcting for seasonality is crucial for successful forecasting.
2. **Trend and Irregular Components:** Trend components explain variations in the mean level of the time series over time, while irregular components capture abnormal deviations from the assumed pattern. Different smoothing techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing, and Holt-Winters' method can be applied to remove the effects of noise and non-linearities in the data.
3. **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values may occur when sensors fail to record data points within a specified time window. These missing values can cause significant distortions in the data, so proper imputation techniques must be utilized to fill in the gaps.
4. **Ensemble Methods:** Multiple models can often outperform a single model if they share similar features or characteristics. Ensemble methods combine the outputs of multiple models to produce improved forecasts.
