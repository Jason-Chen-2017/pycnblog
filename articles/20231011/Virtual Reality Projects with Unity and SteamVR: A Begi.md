# 1.背景介绍


Virtual Reality (VR) technology has revolutionized the gaming industry in recent years, becoming one of the most exciting fields in computer science. It allows users to experience virtual reality worlds through their eyes or hands by moving a head-mounted display (HMD), which is designed specifically for VR applications such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or Google Cardboard. 

While Virtual Reality is still relatively new, it is rapidly expanding in popularity and adoption. Over the last few years, more and more companies are developing VR products and solutions that can be used by consumers around the world. In this article, we will explore how to build VR projects using Unity and SteamVR SDK, which provide an easy-to-use environment for creating VR games and experiences.

In addition to building traditional game engines like Unreal Engine or Godot, developers now have access to a wide range of free and paid software tools that make it easier than ever to create immersive VR content. This includes high-quality assets such as 3D models and textures, rendering engines like Unity's built-in pipeline or Unreal's PBR pipeline, audio tools like Pro Tools or Studio One, motion capture tools like Mobu, and so on. The combination of these tools makes it possible for developers to quickly prototype and release high-quality VR content without relying solely on experienced technical artists or engineers.

Finally, VR hardware platforms such as Oculus Rift S, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, and Microsoft HoloLens offer improved performance, comfort, and battery life compared to older PC gaming systems. With the right VR development toolkit, even novice programmers can start developing VR games and experiences that reach millions of players worldwide.

This guide aims to help you get started with building your own virtual reality project from scratch. We assume that you already know some basic programming concepts, including variables, functions, loops, conditionals, arrays, classes, and objects. If not, we recommend spending some time learning those basics before diving into the material covered here.

# 2. Core Concepts & Contact
Before we begin our journey into virtual reality development, it's important to understand some core concepts related to the SteamVR system. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

1. Head-Mounted Display (HMD): An HMD is a device that attaches directly to the user's eye level, providing them with virtual reality (VR) content. These displays often use advanced technologies like lens distortion correction and chromatic aberration compensation to achieve high visual accuracy and realistic image quality. Some popular HMD devices include Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Lenovo Explorer Xe, Samsung Gear VR, and Microsoft HoloLens.

2. SteamVR Software Development Kit (SDK): SteamVR provides developers with an easy-to-use API that enables them to integrate VR functionality into their existing applications. SteamVR also comes with several sample applications, plugins, and toolkits that simplify the process of creating VR projects. The SDK consists of several libraries and headers that allow developers to easily interact with various parts of the SteamVR runtime, such as tracking, input, overlays, audio, and other features.

3. SteamVR Applications: SteamVR offers several prebuilt applications, including dashboard, home, settings, store, and broadcast. Developers can download the SteamVR apps onto their Steam library and run them either on Windows, Linux, or Android devices. Each application presents different views within the SteamVR space, allowing users to navigate between games, settings, and social media.

4. SteamVR Hardware Platforms: SteamVR supports a variety of hardware platforms, including PC (Windows, Linux, macOS), consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S), mobile devices (iOS, Android), and VR devices (Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, etc.). Different VR devices work differently, requiring different setup procedures. However, once set up correctly, each platform offers similar VR capabilities, such as stereoscopic viewing, controller tracking, hand interaction, teleportation, and room scale VR environments.

Now let's dive deeper into how to build virtual reality projects using Unity and SteamVR SDK.
