# 1.背景介绍

 
计算机科学的发展历史从古至今已有两千多年之久，在此期间产生了很多优秀的科技成果，其中就包括著名的“算法”思想家Alan Kay、“数据结构”学者Lisp Curier、Unix操作系统设计者贝尔纳德·图灵、正则表达式的创始人<NAME>等人的著作。这些杰出的思想贡献都深深地影响着今天的计算机编程世界。可是，仅靠这些“理论基础”对计算机软件开发人员来说仍然很难应付实际需求。软件工程师除了学习各种编程语言、框架、模式和工具外，更重要的是要掌握能够解决现实世界问题的基本算法和数据结构。 


2.核心概念与联系 本书共分为四个部分，分别对应程序设计的基本过程、数据抽象、递归函数、及算法的分析与设计。这几章的内容构成了计算机科学的基础。第1章介绍计算机硬件、软件和程序的概念；第2章介绍了抽象数据的表示和操作方式；第3章介绍了如何将简单的计算重复多次，通过递归求解复杂问题；第4章介绍了如何采用分治策略，有效地解决复杂的问题。每个章节都提供了具体的示例，并给出其相关概念的定义。最后，还有一些附录，如“程序设计的指导方针”、“编程环境”、“语言实现”等，简要介绍了不同平台上的编程工具和环境配置。

最后，读者可以把自己对计算机科学的理解总结成一个小目标，比如：掌握计算机科学的基本方法论，能够编写高效、健壮且易维护的程序。而学习该书，就是去达到这个目标的途径。当然，除了学会用编程解决实际问题外，读者还应该具备一定的数学功底，熟悉抽象数据类型、递归函数、排序算法、搜索算法等概念。因此，阅读本书需要花费相当的时间，读者不妨参考下文中的“附录”部分，找寻一些相关的参考资料。

3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
算法是指用来解决特定类问题的指令序列。简单地说，算法就是一系列按顺序执行的一组规则。在计算机编程中，算法往往被用来解决某个问题，或者改进某些特定领域的现有软件。虽然算法既能提升编程能力也能降低开发时间，但它的重要性也不容忽视。

这里，我将重点介绍第1章、第2章和第4章的内容。由于篇幅原因，我只选择三个章节进行介绍，你可以点击链接查看完整的章节内容。

## CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Computation and Programming ##
Computer Science is the study of processes that interact with data and can be represented as programs, which in turn manipulate symbols and expressions representing those data. We use various programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, Lisp, and Fortran to develop computer software applications for a variety of purposes, from simple games to complex simulations. 

In this chapter we will learn about two important concepts in computing, **computational thinking** and **programming**. Computational Thinking involves an approach to problem solving wherein we break down a problem into smaller, solvable subproblems, and then use these subproblems to build up a solution. This process requires careful planning, logical reasoning, and creativity. On the other hand, programming involves the act of writing instructions that tell a computer what to do and how it should execute them. It involves a range of skills including algorithms, data structures, and procedural abstraction.

### 1.1 What Is A Program? ###
A program is a sequence of instructions given to a computer to solve a specific task or set of tasks. It may involve reading input data, processing it, performing calculations, storing results, and outputting reports or graphs. A well-written program must have clear specifications, error handling, documentation, and testing. 

Programs are stored on magnetic or optical disks or even CD-ROMs, just like any other type of digital information. When you run a program, your operating system loads the program's instructions into memory and begins executing them one instruction at a time. If there are no errors in the program, its execution ends with the program returning control to the user. If there are errors, the program detects them, handles them appropriately, and returns control to the user so they can correct the issue(s). 

For example, consider a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Here are some sample steps that the program might follow: 

1. Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle.
2. Read in the values entered by the user.
3. Multiply the length and width to get the area. 
4. Output the result to the screen.

This program follows the basic structure of most modern programming languages, using variables to hold input data, arithmetic operations to perform calculations, and functions to organize code and make it more modular. However, each language has its own syntax and semantics, making it difficult to write programs that work across multiple platforms or support different types of hardware.

### 1.2 Computational Thinking ### 
Computational Thinking is a methodical approach to problem-solving that involves breaking problems down into smaller, solvable parts called **abstractions**, and applying logic, creativity, and critical thought to identify patterns and relationships among the parts. Abstraction enables us to focus our attention on relevant details while ignoring irrelevant ones. We can also think of abstractions as tools that allow us to represent complex systems in simpler formulas and models. 

To illustrate computational thinking, let's take a look at the following examples: 

1. Identifying commonalities between two sentences, paragraphs, or documents.
2. Solving mathematical equations and integrating them into more complicated problems.
3. Classifying objects based on their attributes or behaviors.
4. Separating different species of animals based on their similarities and differences.

Each of these problems could be solved by identifying the underlying pattern or concept that underlies all the examples. Once we understand the underlying pattern, we can apply it to new situations that share the same characteristic or behavior. In general, computational thinking involves developing a deep understanding of the problem, breaking it down into small pieces, analyzing the pieces, and combining them to arrive at a complete and accurate answer.

### 1.3 Programming Paradigms ### 
Programming paradigms are ways of expressing computation, ranging from structured programming to functional programming to object-oriented programming. Structured programming is used when the algorithm is divided into separate sections or modules that communicate with each other via function calls and loops. Functional programming emphasizes the evaluation of expressions instead of statements, focusing on pure functions that produce a result without side effects. Object-oriented programming takes advantage of the features of object-oriented programming languages, such as classes and inheritance, to create reusable components that encapsulate data and functionality together.

While all three paradigms aim to provide developers with better organization, readability, maintainability, and flexibility, none of them is perfect and it’s often impossible to choose just one best fit for every situation. Some developers may prefer a mix of approaches depending on their personal style, experience level, and project needs.
