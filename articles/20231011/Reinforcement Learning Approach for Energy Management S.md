# 1.背景介绍


In the era of smart grid and IoT technology development, energy management systems (EMS) are becoming increasingly important to ensure efficient operation of electric power grids. As the primary challenges in operating an EMS are control optimization and power flow dynamics modeling, there has been a great research progress on developing reinforcement learning-based algorithms to address these problems. The main goal is to learn optimal decision making policies that can take into account various uncertainties and constraints in real time and optimize the system performance through improving the overall system cost while ensuring the long-term stability and reliability of the electrical grid. In this article, we will discuss the proposed solution using two commonly used RL algorithms namely Q-learning algorithm and actor-critic algorithm, along with their mathematical models and implementation details. We also briefly introduce the key features of RL algorithms as well as the benefits they offer.
In modern power grids, regulatory restrictions such as voltage drop limits, frequency restrictions, overload protection schemes and reactive power limits restrict the maximum output of power devices. To efficiently allocate the available resources among different loads, ancillary services like energy storage units must be considered during EMS design process. These energy storage units may include batteries, supercapacitors or other energy storage technologies. While optimizing the EMS controls, it becomes critical to consider the complementarity between different loads types and level shifting mechanisms to avoid undesired situations. Thus, robust and adaptive control strategies need to be designed to manage the dynamic interactions between loads, ancillary services, power converters, and energy storage units within the same power grid. This requires deep understanding of various physical aspects related to power distribution network topology, interconnection patterns, power conversion efficiency, load behavior, reserve requirements, service level objectives, device failures and anticipated thermal environmental changes. Therefore, it is essential to employ advanced techniques from control theory and optimization to develop more powerful and reliable EMS controllers. 

# 2.核心概念与联系RL(Reinforcement Learning) is a type of machine learning approach where agents learn to make decisions based on experience and feedback in order to maximize cumulative reward over time. It is known for its ability to handle complex environments by using multiple states and actions and quickly adapting to new information. However, RL involves complex mathematical formulas and algorithms and thus requires expertise in both theoretical and practical aspects. Here are some basic concepts that are involved in our work:

1. Environment: A world in which the agent learns to navigate. It consists of all possible states, actions, rewards, and any other relevant factors that influence the outcome of the episode. An example of an environment could be the power grid consisting of loads, ancillary services, power converters, and energy storage units located at different locations across the country. 

2. Agent: The entity responsible for selecting actions to achieve goals in the given environment. The agent interacts with the environment to select actions and receives feedback in return. There are three main types of agents in RL:
   - Value-Based Agents: These agents estimate the value function V(s), which represents the expected total future reward if the agent were to start in state s and took an action a. They use this function to determine the best next action to take based on the current state of the environment. For instance, Q-learning algorithm falls under this category. 
   - Policy-Based Agents: These agents directly learn the mapping between states and actions, without estimating the value function explicitly. Instead, they estimate the policy pi(a|s), which specifies the probability of taking an action a when starting in state s. They use this function to generate random actions during exploration, and exploit optimal actions otherwise. Examples of policy-based agents are Deep Neural Networks (DNN). 
   - Actor-Critic Agents: These agents combine ideas from value-based and policy-based methods. They simultaneously estimate the value function V(s), but also use it to improve the policy pi(a|s). Specifically, the critic component estimates the advantage A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s) for each state-action pair, which helps the actor update its policy. Examples of actor-critic agents include DDPG and PPO.

3. State: A particular condition or situation that describes the current context of the agent. The state space typically includes many variables that contribute towards determining the current observation and provide insights into the problem. Common examples of states could be the present bus voltages, demand profiles, temperature levels, wind speeds, etc., depending on the nature of the environment being modeled.

4. Action: An instruction or decision provided by the agent to the environment. Actions change the environment and affect how the agent should behave in the future. Common examples of actions could be the amount of power drawn from a generator or the direction of a motor.

5. Reward: An immediate feedback signal provided by the environment to the agent after an action is taken. The purpose of the reward function is to encourage the agent to learn the best way to act in response to the changing conditions in the environment. The reward function should always be specific to the problem being solved and should not rely solely on metrics such as absolute values or differences between states. It should capture the intended outcomes of the chosen actions and penalize deviations accordingly.

6. Trajectory/Episode: A sequence of observations generated by the agent's interaction with the environment. Each episode starts with an initial observation and ends with either a terminal state or a predetermined number of steps. In addition, every trajectory is assigned a final score representing the total reward obtained in the episode.

7. Bias/Variance Tradeoff: This refers to the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. During exploration, the agent explores unknown areas of the state space to find promising solutions. However, this can lead to suboptimal policies and high variance. On the other hand, during exploitation, the agent exploits knowledge gained from previous experiences to focus on areas where it is most likely to succeed. This tends to result in better generalization performance, but also higher bias.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解We propose two widely used RL algorithms for EMS control in the electric power grid, i.e., Q-learning algorithm and actor-critic algorithm. Both algorithms have similarities and differences, including their mathematical representations, structure, and implementation details. Let us now go through the detailed explanation of both algorithms.

1. Q-Learning Algorithm
Q-learning is a model-free, off-policy, tabular RL algorithm that uses linear approximation to approximate the Q function, which maps the tuple (state, action) to a scalar reward value. Q-learning works by updating the estimated Q-value for a given (state, action) pair based on the observed reward r and the updated Q-value for the subsequent state s'. The formula for updating Q is as follows:
where γ (gamma) is the discount factor, α (alpha) is the learning rate, and Q' denotes the newly learned Q-value for the next state. Q-learning provides only incremental updates and does not guarantee convergence. Hence, we may require several iterations of the algorithm until convergence. The pseudocode for Q-learning algorithm is as follows:<|im_sep|>
