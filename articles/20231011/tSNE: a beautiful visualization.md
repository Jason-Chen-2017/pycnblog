# 1.背景介绍




t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a machine learning algorithm developed by <NAME> and <NAME>, published in December of 2008. It is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data sets. In this article, we will go through the background, core concepts, technical details, implementation steps, mathematical model, code sample, future development challenges, and some common questions and their solutions. 

t-SNE was introduced to address two problems with popular techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS). Firstly, PCA assumes that the data follows a Gaussian distribution which may not be true when dealing with non-Gaussian distributed datasets like images or text data. Secondly, MDS does not preserve distances between points, making it difficult to identify relationships between different data points. t-SNE addresses these issues by first converting the original high-dimensional dataset into a low-dimensional space while attempting to preserve similarities between the input points. The new representation can then be plotted using standard techniques like scatter plots, histograms, etc. We hope that this article provides insights on how t-SNE works, its key features, and uses cases.

## Introduction



The goal of T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is to convert a set of observations from possibly nonlinear or multidimensional into a set of representations in a lower dimensional space, typically two or three dimensions, while preserving the relationships among the original observations. One way to think about this is to find a low-dimensional representation of each observation that "captures its topology" - that is, structures that are relatively frequent across all pairs of data points. This leads to a more intuitive and visually appealing representation of complex data than other dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis.

T-SNE has several advantages over existing methods, including speed, stability, and flexibility. Its main idea behind optimizing the similarity matrix is to use a probabilistic approach where each point pair is assigned a probability value based on whether they belong to the same cluster or not. By minimizing this Kullback-Leibler divergence between the conditional distributions and the joint distributions, the embedding is learned automatically. The final result is a well-separated and fairly compact representation of the input data that maintains its structure and appears faithful to the underlying manifold geometry. Additionally, the optimization method allows dynamic adjustments to the embedding parameters based on the progression of the cost function during training, making it useful for exploring parameter spaces and obtaining reasonable results at different scales. Despite its advantages, there are still many applications of traditional methods such as PCA or MDS that perform better than t-SNE in specific scenarios. Therefore, understanding and applying basic principles behind t-SNE is essential if you want to apply it successfully in your projects.

In this section, we introduce some important concepts related to T-SNE.

### Notation



We assume that the input data $X = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N$ consists of $N$ observations $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}$ each having an intrinsic dimensionality $D$. Each observation is a vector $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$. Let us also define the embedding variable $\mathbf{y}=\{\mathbf{y}_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and $\mathbf{y}_j \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ for any observation $j$, where $d$ is the desired output dimension. We denote the distance between $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{x}_j$ as $\|\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j\|$.




### Optimization Problem





Given a fixed perplexity level $\perp$, our objective is to minimize the following Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution $P_{ij}(\mathbf{y})$ and the conditional distribution $Q_j(\mathbf{y}|z_i)$, where $z_i$ represents the class assignment of the $i$-th data point:
$$
KL(P_{ij}(\mathbf{y})\Vert Q_j(\mathbf{y}|z_i))=-\sum_{k=1}^K P(Z_i=k)\log\left[\frac{Q(Y_i|Z_i=k)}{\prod_{l≠k}\sum_{m≠k}Q(Y_i|Z_i=l)}\right].
$$
Here, $Z_i$ is a binary random variable indicating the membership of $\mathbf{x}_i$ to one of $K$ clusters, and $Y_i$ refers to the corresponding location in the embedded space $\mathbf{y}$, i.e., $\mathbf{y}_i$. Note that the term inside the logarithmic brackets is a normalization constant that ensures that the probabilities sum up to one. Intuitively, we want to have distinct regions in the embedded space for each of the classes so that the points in the same class are close together while those in different classes are far apart. For instance, if we have two classes $(A,\,B)$ and there exist two examples $\{\mathbf{x}_1,\, \mathbf{x}_2\}$ that satisfy both conditions below, we want them to be very close together while the third example outside either class should be very far away from any of them:







  * $\forall j, z_j=1 \Rightarrow Y_j$ belongs to the $A$-class;
  * $\forall j, z_j=2 \Rightarrow Y_j$ belongs to the $B$-class;
  * All other values of $z_j$ imply no preference regarding the position of $\mathbf{x}_j$.











To achieve this, we optimize the following cost function:
$$
C_{\min} = \sum_{i=1}^N KL(P_{ij}(\mathbf{y})\Vert Q_j(\mathbf{y}|z_i)).
$$
We can derive the expression for the joint distribution $P_{ij}(\mathbf{y})$ and $Q_j(\mathbf{y}|z_i)$ using Bayes' rule. However, computing these expressions directly is computationally expensive due to the need to compute the inverse of the covariance matrices. Instead, we approximate the distributions by using student's t-distributions whose density is given by:
$$
P_{ij}(y)=\frac{(1+\|\mathbf{y}_i-\mathbf{y}_j\|^2/2\sigma_\varepsilon^2)^{-1}}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^D\sigma_\varepsilon^D}}\exp\left(-\frac{\|\mathbf{y}_i-\mathbf{y}_j\|^2}{2\sigma_\varepsilon^2}\right),
$$
where $\sigma_\varepsilon$ is a free parameter that controls the degree of sparsity in the embedded space. To obtain good results, we usually choose $\sigma_\varepsilon$ to be approximately equal to the average distance between the embedded points multiplied by a small number ($10^{-5}-10^{-3}$ depending on the size of the dataset). The conditional distribution $Q_j(\mathbf{y}|z_i)$ is computed as follows:
$$
Q_j(\mathbf{y}|z_i)=\frac{P_{ij}(\mathbf{y})}{{1+\sum_{l≠i}P_{il}(\mathbf{y})}^{1/(1+n)}},
$$
where $n$ is the total number of data points and $P_{il}(\mathbf{y})$ denotes the probability of assigning $\mathbf{x}_i$ to group $l$ according to the current estimate of the embedding $\mathbf{y}$. The subscript $l$ ranges from $1$ to $K$, but since we only consider binary partitions, $P_{il}=P_{li}$. Overall, t-SNE seeks to create an efficient alternative to conventional methods for visualizing large datasets consisting of thousands of variables or more.
