# 1.背景介绍


Microservices architecture has been gaining increasing popularity in recent years due to its many advantages compared with monolithic architectures such as scalability, flexibility, and agility. However, microservices still have their own challenges which make it an advanced topic in software development and management. Therefore, this article will first introduce the basics of microservices architecture, then discuss some key concepts and how they relate to each other, finally, it will focus on two core issues that cause friction when adopting microservices architecture: operational complexity and developer experience. We also provide a survey of popular programming languages for developing microservices applications and analyze why each one is a good choice. Finally, we will conclude by discussing the pros and cons of microservices architecture in relation to other design patterns and compare them with serverless computing approaches.
# 2.Core Concepts and Relationships Between Them
In order to understand microservices architecture better, we need to understand what components make up the system and how they interact with each other. Let's start by breaking down the term "microservice" into its constituent parts - service, application, and infrastructure. Here are their definitions:

1. Service: A small, self-contained unit that provides a specific functionality or feature. Services communicate with each other using well defined APIs (Application Programming Interface). Each service runs independently, but can be scaled horizontally across multiple machines if needed. 

2. Application: An instance of a group of services working together to accomplish a particular task or set of tasks. Applications are designed to work together as a single logical unit and can span multiple teams and organizations. For example, a banking application may consist of several individual services such as authentication, account management, and transaction processing.

3. Infrastructure: This refers to all the technologies, tools, and frameworks required to run and manage microservices applications. It includes platforms like containers, orchestration systems, and monitoring tools.

Together, these three components form the foundation of microservices architecture. To further illustrate the relationship between these components, let's take a real-world example of a microservices application called ABC Inc. ABC Inc consists of four different services that work together to handle customer orders, payments, inventory management, and accounting functions. 

The overall architecture of the system could look something like this:


Each box represents a service within the system. Services communicate with each other via API calls using standard protocols such as HTTP(S), WebSockets, AMQP, or Kafka. They also share data via databases, message queues, file storage, or cache layers. Services can be written in any programming language and use various database models and technologies, depending on the needs of the application.

# 3.Core Algorithmic Principles And Details Involved With Implementing Microservices Architectures
There are numerous principles involved in implementing microservices architectures, including loose coupling, automated deployment, and immutable infrastructure. Below are few examples:

1. Loose Coupling: Loosely coupled microservices allow developers to change and scale individual services without affecting others. This ensures that changes do not cascade and impact other parts of the system negatively.

2. Automated Deployment: Using automated deployment pipelines allows changes to be rolled out quickly and easily, reducing downtime and errors. Pipelines can include continuous integration, testing, and deployment processes.

3. Immutable Infrastructure: Using immutable infrastructure ensures that deployments cannot accidentally break existing environments. Instead, new versions of services must be deployed to newly created servers. This prevents the need for complex rollback procedures after unforeseen bugs arise.

# 4.Implementation Examples
Now let's go through some detailed implementation examples related to microservices architecture. These will help us gain more clarity about how to apply these principles in practice and increase our understanding of the concept.

## Example #1 - Building A Webshop Microservice Using Spring Boot
A common scenario where microservices come in handy is building large webshops with hundreds of products and thousands of customers. One possible approach is to split the functionalities among different microservices, making them easier to maintain and update. In this example, we'll build a simple shopping cart microservice using Spring Boot and MongoDB as the database layer. The following steps outline how to create and deploy this microservice:

1. Create a new Java project using your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).

2. Add the necessary dependencies to the pom.xml file:

   ```
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
       </dependency>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
       </dependency>
   
       <!-- Test Dependencies -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
           <scope>test</scope>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

3. Define the model classes used in the service. For this example, we'll define a Product class that stores information about a product sold online:

   ```java
   import lombok.*;
   
   @Data
   @AllArgsConstructor
   public class Product {
       private String id;
       private String name;
       private Double price;
   }
   ```

4. Implement the REST controller for handling requests from clients. Use the RestController annotation to indicate that this is a web endpoint:

   ```java
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
   
   @RestController
   public class ShoppingCartController {
     
       // TODO: implement GET request handler method
       
   }
   ```

5. Configure the MongoDatabase object so that it connects to the appropriate database instance. This should typically be done in a configuration class annotated with Configuration:

   ```java
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
   import org.springframework.data.mongodb.config.AbstractMongoClientConfiguration;
   import org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.config.EnableReactiveMongoRepositories;
   
    /**
     * Configures the Spring Data MongoDB repositories. Enables reactive driver usage.
     */
    @Configuration
    @EnableReactiveMongoRepositories("com.example.shoppingcart")
    public class MongoConfig extends AbstractMongoClientConfiguration {
    
        @Override
        protected String getDatabaseName() {
            return "shoppingcart";
        }
    
    }
   ```

6. Run the main method of the SpringBootApplication class to start the service. Ensure that you've started a MongoDB instance locally before starting the service.

   ```java
   import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
   import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
   
   @SpringBootApplication
   public class ShoppingCartServiceApplication {
   
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(ShoppingCartServiceApplication.class, args);
       }
   
   }
   ```

7. Deploy the resulting JAR file to a production environment (e.g., Tomcat server) using an automated deployment tool like Jenkins. Set up the necessary configuration files to connect to the correct MongoDB instance.

This basic example demonstrates how to build a simple microservice using Spring Boot, MongoDB, and best practices for building and deploying microservices. Additional features and capabilities can be added based on the requirements of the application being developed.
