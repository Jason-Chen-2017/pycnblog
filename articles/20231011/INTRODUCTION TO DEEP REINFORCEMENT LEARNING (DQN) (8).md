# 1.背景介绍

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex tasks in various fields such as robotics, autonomous driving, and games. DRL involves training an agent using reinforcement learning algorithm to learn optimal policies by interacting with the environment through actions. However, training an RL agent can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with high-dimensional continuous or discrete action spaces. Therefore, recent researchers have focused on reducing the complexity of these problems using techniques such as deep Q networks (DQNs), actor-critic methods, and proximal policy optimization (PPO). In this article, we will introduce DQN, one of the most popular deep RL algorithms used for continuous or discrete action spaces.
DQN is composed of two main components: the neural network representing the value function and the replay buffer. The value function takes in state and action pairs as input, and outputs a predicted future reward. During training, the replay buffer stores transitions from previous episodes that can help improve the performance of the agent over time. The basic idea behind DQN is to train the value function to predict expected returns based on observed states and actions taken during exploration. We then use the value function to choose the next best action to take at each step in the environment. This process is repeated until convergence or some maximum number of iterations is reached. 

In addition to its benefits, DQN is known to be effective in many real-world applications including atari games, board games, and card games. It has been shown to achieve superhuman performance in several challenging domains, such as pong, space invaders, and breakout. DQN also has great potential for industrial applications where it can solve problems requiring highly complex decision making under uncertain conditions. Despite its success, there are still challenges associated with its scalability and long term stability.

This article aims to provide an introduction to DQN with detailed explanations of core concepts and operations, mathematical formulas, code implementation, and unsolved issues. By reading this article you should gain a deeper understanding of how DQN works, what makes it unique compared to other approaches, and how it could be applied in your own projects.

2. CORE CONCEPTS AND RELATIONSHIP
Let's start our discussion by introducing the key concepts and relationships involved in DQN.

The Environment: The environment represents the world in which the agent interacts with. It contains all sorts of objects, entities, and obstacles. The agent learns about its surroundings through observations provided by the environment. There are different types of environments depending on the type of problem being solved, ranging from simple grid worlds to complex environments like Atari games.

Agent: An agent is any program that interacts with the environment to perform a specific task. Agents include software programs such as game playing bots, simulated vehicles, and self-driving cars. Each agent can consist of multiple parts, such as sensors, actuators, and memory units. For instance, a video game bot might have a camera sensor that captures images, a processor that executes AI logic, and a motion controller that controls the movement of the character. The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward obtained during interaction with the environment.

State: The state refers to the current contextual information available to the agent. This includes observations of the environment such as image frames, audio recordings, depth maps, etc., along with internal variables such as velocity, location, orientation, etc. States define the current situation of the agent and capture important features that may affect the agent's behavior. To be precise, states represent the current situation of the environment in terms of raw sensory inputs and internal parameters. They do not contain any knowledge or explicit instructions on how to behave.

Action: Actions refer to the set of possible decisions that an agent can make within an environment. These decisions can be discrete, such as choosing between left or right, or continuous, such as steering a vehicle or controlling a robotic arm. Different agents can have different sets of actions available to them due to their individual capabilities.

Reward: Rewards refer to the feedback given by the environment to the agent after taking an action. The rewards may come in different forms, such as negative or positive points, bonus prizes, penalties, or no reward at all. Rewards signal to the agent how well it is doing relative to its past actions and provide motivation to explore new behaviors.

Episode: A single run of the agent interacting with the environment starts with the agent resetting to its initial position and receiving initial observations. As the agent performs actions and receives feedback, it accumulates experiences in the form of state, action, reward tuples called experience replay buffers. When the agent completes a task or reaches a terminal state, it terminates the episode. Episodes repeat themselves over time as the agent learns to navigate the environment successfully.

Replay Buffer: Experience replay is a technique that allows an agent to learn from previously experienced situations rather than simply following a fixed sequence of actions. Instead of feeding the agent direct examples of state, action, reward sequences, they are fed batches of randomly sampled data from the replay buffer. This helps to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge, improving sample efficiency, and promoting exploration. Experiences can be stored in batches instead of individually, resulting in significant speedup in training.

Value Function Approximation: The value function approximator estimates the expected return, i.e., the discounted sum of future rewards, for a given state and action pair. It takes in a state s and action a, and outputs a scalar value V(s,a). DQN uses a deep neural network to approximate the value function. It consists of three fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions followed by output layer with linear activation function. Training this model requires backpropagation and gradient descent updates. Hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, gamma (discount factor), and epsilon (exploration parameter) need to be tuned to achieve good performance.

Policy Network: The policy network is responsible for selecting the action to take at each step based on the estimated values of the state and action pairs produced by the value network. Policy networks typically use softmax activation function to produce probabilities for each possible action, indicating the degree of preference for each action. We use greedy search to select the action with highest probability at each step if exploring is allowed. If exploitation is desired, we can follow the selected action deterministically without exploring further. However, since the policy network depends on the learned value function approximation, it can quickly become outdated and lead to suboptimal results. Therefore, we often update the policy network less frequently than the value function, which leads to more stable behavior. 

3. CORE ALGORITHM OPERATIONS AND FORMULAS
Now let's discuss the overall operation of DQN algorithm, starting from initialization till termination.

Initialization: Before running the training loop, we initialize the following components:

    * Initialize the environment
    * Create the value function approximator
    * Create the target value function approximator
    * Create the replay buffer
    * Create the policy network
    * Set hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, gamma, epsilon, and optimization algorithm
    
Training Loop: The training loop runs for a specified number of epochs or until the agent achieves a certain level of performance. At each epoch, we first execute n_steps of exploration before updating the value function approximator. Then, we collect transition samples from the environment using the current policy network. Once we have enough samples, we add them to the replay buffer and sample k random minibatches of transitions. Finally, we compute the loss function of the value function and update the weights using the optimizer. After every few epochs, we update the target value function approximator to match the latest version of the value function.

Exploration vs Exploitation: One major challenge faced by RL agents is the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. In the beginning, the agent needs to explore the environment to find better solutions, while in later stages, the agent must exploit its existing knowledge to reach the global optimum faster. DQN implements two mechanisms to balance these two aspects:

    * Epsilon Greedy Strategy: The epsilon parameter determines the fraction of times the agent is allowed to explore. On average, the agent selects a random action with probability epsilon, and otherwise follows the greedy policy with probability 1 - epsilon.
    
    * Target Network: Instead of updating the weights directly, we maintain another copy of the value function called the target network. We keep both networks updated periodically so that the target network remains a reliable guide towards the true value function even when the value function is changing rapidly.

Mathematical Formulation: Now let's get into the details of the mathematics behind DQN algorithm.

Firstly, let's consider a simplified case of tabular MDP. Let S denote the set of states, A denote the set of actions, T(s, a, s') denote the transition dynamics, R(s, a, s') denote the immediate rewards, γ denote the discount factor, π(a|s) denote the stochastic policy mapping from states to actions, and ε denote the exploration rate.

Then, we can derive the Bellman equation for Q(s, a):

Q(s, a) = R(s, a, s') + γE[Q(s', pi(s'))]

Where E[] denotes the expectation operator over future rewards. Based on this equation, we can estimate the value of each state-action pair using off-policy TD learning, which means we only gather samples from the actual environment while computing the targets.

To apply the value iteration method to estimate the optimal Q-function, we start from an arbitrary initial Q-value and iteratively update it according to the above Bellman equation. However, this approach becomes very slow and computationally expensive when the state space and/or action space are large.

To address these limitations, modern deep RL algorithms use a neural network as a function approximator. Specifically, they approximate the Q-function using a deep neural network, which computes the value function based on a combination of the current state and action. This reduces the dimensionality of the problem and makes it tractable to train.

Here's the architecture diagram of DQN algorithm:


In the architecture, we use a replay buffer to store transitions from previous episodes, a value function approximator to estimate the value of each state-action pair, and a policy network to generate actions based on the current state. The policy network produces actions using either a softmax function or a deterministic policy. The target network maintains a frozen copy of the value function, and is used to calculate the target Q-values for the policy gradient update. The advantage calculation calculates the difference between the current and next Q-values, which is used to train the value function.

Training Process: During training, we alternate between sampling experiences from the environment and optimizing the value function to minimize the error between the current and target Q-values. During the sampling phase, we select actions according to the current policy network, and append the resulting transition tuple (s, a, r, s’) to the replay buffer. During the optimization phase, we extract a mini-batch of randomly sampled transitions from the replay buffer, calculate the corresponding target Q-values, and optimize the value function using the policy gradient update rule.

Updates to Value Function and Target Network: We update the value function approximately using a variant of temporal difference learning called the double Q-learning. In traditional Q-learning, we update the action-value function using the mean squared error between the target Q-value and the estimated Q-value. However, this approach suffers from instability and bias since the same action may receive different advantages depending on the order in which it was selected. To avoid this, double Q-learning decouples the selection of actions from evaluation of those actions, allowing us to evaluate each action once using one value network and once using another. Specifically, we first use the online network to select the action to take (using ε-greedy exploration), and then use the target network to evaluate the Q-value of that action (without adding noise or exploration). Double Q-learning guarantees consistency and improves exploration.
