# 1.背景介绍


Probabilistic programming is a new paradigm that allows data analysts to describe statistical models using probabilistic statements and enable the use of inference algorithms for reasoning over those models. In this article, we will review various tools and libraries available for implementing probabilistic programs in Python and R languages. 

# 2.核心概念与联系
In order to understand what probabilistic programming is all about, let us first define some key concepts and their relationship with one another as shown below.


- **Probability distribution:** A probability distribution is a mathematical model describing the likelihood of an event occurring within certain intervals of time or space. Examples include normal distributions, binomial distributions, Poisson distributions, etc. Probability distributions are used to specify the uncertainty associated with random variables. They can be defined either deterministically (i.e., mathematically specified), or stochastically (i.e., based on observed data). The central idea behind probabilistic programming is that we should not only write down formulas for computing probabilities but also the underlying probability distributions themselves. This helps ensure that our computations are both correct and reliable.
- **Random variable:** A random variable represents a numerical outcome from an uncertain process. It takes real values in some range depending on its underlying probability distribution. Random variables may depend on other random variables or constants. For example, if we have two coin flips, each resulting in either heads or tails, then the total number of heads and the total number of tails would be dependent on these individual coin flip outcomes. Similarly, given a population of students, the chance of them being female depends on their race and gender identity.
- **Joint distribution:** The joint distribution of multiple random variables describes the complete set of possible combinations of their respective outcomes. It gives the likelihood of any particular combination of outcomes occurring together. Joint distributions are typically represented by tables or charts showing the marginal and conditional distributions of each individual random variable.
- **Inference algorithm:** An inference algorithm is a procedure for drawing conclusions from observed data under the assumption that it was generated according to a known probability distribution. There are several types of inference algorithms such as Bayesian networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, hidden Markov models, and variational inference. Inference algorithms work by updating the posterior probability distribution of the parameters using the prior distribution and observed data.

Here's an overview of how probabilistic programming works in Python and R:

1. Define the probability distribution(s) of the input random variables. These could be pre-defined (deterministic functions) or learned from data (stochastic models). 
2. Write down the mathematical formula(s) for calculating the probability of the output random variables (i.e., conditioned on the inputs). Note that the formula must involve the probability distribution(s) and the input random variables.
3. Use a suitable inference algorithm (such as MCMC or VI) to compute the value(s) of the output random variable(s) given the input values and/or the probability distribution(s). The result is a posterior probability distribution that incorporates the information contained in the observations.
4. Visualize the results using graphics and reports.

Let's take a look at each step in more detail:


1. Defining the probability distribution(s):

There are many ways to define probability distributions in Python and R. Here are some examples:

1. Deterministic functions: Mathematical formulae that represent specific probability distributions and allow you to calculate the probability of any given outcome. For instance, the Normal distribution has two parameters: mean and standard deviation. You can evaluate the probability density function (pdf) for different values of x to get the probability of observing x. Other common deterministic functions include Bernoulli distributions, categorical distributions, geometric distributions, etc.

2. Stochastic models: Models that learn the underlying probability distribution from observed data. Common approaches include maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), Bayesian inference, and neural networks. These techniques fit probability distributions to data by adjusting the parameters of the distribution until they best match the data seen so far. 

3. Importance sampling: Methods that approximate the true probability distribution by sampling from samples drawn from the target distribution, weighted by their relative probabilities. This approach is often useful when dealing with complex models that cannot be expressed exactly as a closed-form expression or when dealing with large datasets where exact calculations are impractical.

4. Other approaches: Variational inference, Gibbs sampling, particle filters, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and sequential Monte Carlo are also popular alternatives.

2. Writing the mathematical formula(s) for calculating the probability of the output random variables:

Once you've chosen the appropriate probability distribution for your input random variables, writing the formula for calculating the probability of the output random variable(s) is straightforward. Let's say you want to compute the probability of a student being admitted based on their grades in three classes, assuming that the probability of passing each class is normally distributed with a variance of 10. Assuming that the grades are independent (i.e., there are no correlations between the grades in the three classes), the formula would be:

p = p_c1 * N(grade_c1|mean_c1,variance_c1) * p_c2 * N(grade_c2|mean_c2,variance_c2) * p_c3 * N(grade_c3|mean_c3,variance_c3))

where p_ci is the probability of passing Class i, grade_ci is the grade obtained in Class i, mean_ci and variance_ci are the corresponding mean and variance of the Normal distribution respectively. Each term in the product corresponds to the probability of a single class pass, multiplied by the probability of obtaining the observed grade for that class using the Normal distribution. 

This formula involves the probability distribution(s) and the input random variables (the grades), which means that it fully specifies the joint distribution of the inputs and outputs. If we assume that there is noise added to the grades due to other factors (e.g., exam preparation, athletic skill), we might modify the above formula accordingly. To include this noise, we need to introduce additional random variables (e.g., the amount of noise added) and update the formula accordingly.
