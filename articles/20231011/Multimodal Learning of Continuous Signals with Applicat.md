# 1.背景介绍


In recent years, multimodal data has emerged as a promising approach for many applications such as speech recognition and gesture recognition. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for learning continuous signals from multimodal input streams by integrating information from multiple modalities. The proposed method consists of three main components: (i) Multi-view feature representation; (ii) Hierarchical temporal modeling; and (iii) Modality fusion layer. These components are designed to extract discriminative features from different views of the input, hierarchically model the sequence dependencies between them, and then fuse the learned representations into a common space for further classification or prediction tasks. We validate our proposed framework on two real-world datasets, namely BCI2aIV and UBFC-RMR, which represent biological signals captured using EEG and fNIRS sensors respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy while also achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency.
The aim of this work is to provide a detailed technical report covering all aspects related to the development and evaluation of the proposed framework for human activity recognition based on multimodal data. Additionally, we hope to inspire other researchers to consider integrating multimodal signal processing techniques to enhance their knowledge of the human body and improve healthcare systems.

2. Core Concepts and Connections 
To effectively analyze and classify continuous signals from multimodal sources, there are several core concepts that need to be explained and connected together. Below are brief descriptions and connections to support the rest of the article. 

1. Modalities and Views: Multimodal inputs typically contain data from multiple sources and these can have varying frequency, time domain characteristics, and even physical dimensions. To capture and process such signals efficiently, they must be first transformed into a format where relevant information can be extracted. This transformation requires representing the signals in a suitable way, known as a modality tensor. Each modality can be represented as a set of tensors, one per channel, that describe its spectral content over time and space. Similarly, multiview analysis involves transforming the same input data into multiple different forms so that complementary information can be combined and leveraged.

2. Temporal Modeling: Understanding the temporal relationships among the channels and sampling points of the input data is essential for extracting meaningful features. In the case of multimodal inputs, dynamic changes and correlations across different parts of the system cannot be ignored. Therefore, hierarchical models that leverage shared statistical properties of the data at different levels of hierarchy are required. In particular, kernel smoothing methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be employed to learn nonparametric representations of the data at both short and long time scales.

3. Fusion Layer: Once the features have been extracted from the different modalities and views, they need to be fused into a single representation before being classified or predicted. One popular technique for combining heterogeneous features is to use a weighted sum of their element-wise products followed by nonlinear transformations such as ReLU activation functions. Alternatively, soft attention mechanisms can be employed to selectively focus on specific regions of the feature maps during training and testing phases.
