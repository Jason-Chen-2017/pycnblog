# 1.背景介绍


Time series forecasting is a process of predicting future values based on historical data. It plays an essential role in many real-world applications such as finance, economics, and healthcare. In this article, we will focus on time series forecasting using statistical methods in Python with detailed explanation of the mathematical models used for making predictions. We also provide practical examples along with code implementation.<|im_sep|>
In simple terms, time series forecasting involves building a model that can make accurate predictions about future outcomes based on past observations or data points. There are several types of time series forecasting techniques available, including regression analysis, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, etc. Some common approaches include training/testing sets split, cross validation, backtesting, grid search hyperparameter optimization, seasonal adjustment, etc. This article focuses on ARIMA, one of the most commonly used algorithms for time series forecasting tasks. The other algorithms may be covered in separate articles later.
This article assumes the reader has basic knowledge of machine learning concepts such as regression, classification, clustering, and feature selection. Additionally, familiarity with various python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and tensorflow would help in understanding and implementing the presented techniques.<|im_sep|>
The goal of this article is to introduce readers to time series forecasting in Python by demonstrating its fundamental principles, algorithms, and usage scenarios. Moreover, it should inspire further exploration into more advanced topics related to time series modeling and prediction.

## Definition

A **time series** is a sequence of measurements taken at regular intervals over time. Each measurement is associated with a specific point in time called the **timestamp**. 

A time series typically contains multiple variables or dimensions, which have varying relationships between them over time. For example, stock prices can vary from day to day due to market fluctuations; sales numbers can increase and decrease periodically because of seasonality effects. Therefore, each variable within the time series is considered as having a different **level**, i.e., a certain value corresponding to each timestamp. These levels are usually measured numerically but can take categorical or ordinal values as well.

## Types of Time Series Forecasting Techniques

1. **Univariate Time Series:** This refers to cases where there is only one dependent variable in the time series. Examples include demand, temperature, fuel consumption, and income growth rates.

2. **Multivariate Time Series:** This refers to cases where there are two or more dependent variables in the time series. Examples include stock price and volume, gasoline prices and volumes, weather patterns and indicators, traffic flow and pollution levels.

3. **Heterogeneous Time Series:** This refers to cases where there are different data formats or units across multiple variables. Examples include energy consumption, air quality, and socioeconomic indicators. 

4. **Spatial Time Series:** This refers to cases where variations in the level of a particular variable occur over space or geographical regions. Examples include transportation flows, water levels, and oil spill locations. 

5. **Multi-horizon Time Series:** This refers to cases where there are multiple periods ahead of observation in order to capture complex temporal dependencies. Examples include sales forecasts, inventory management, and customer demand patterns.

6. **Mixed Time Series:** This refers to cases where there are both univariate and multivariate components present. Examples include electricity consumption and stock prices, mortgage rates and inflation rates. 


We can categorize time series forecasting techniques according to their input, output, and structure. Input could refer to the nature of the data being fed to the algorithm. Output could refer to the type of output expected, e.g., numerical values, binary labels, or class probabilities. Structure could refer to whether the model is stationary, semi-stationary, or non-stationary. Stationary models assume that the statistical properties of the process do not change over time, while non-stationary models allow for variation or trends in the data. Finally, some techniques incorporate prior information and external factors in addition to the time series itself, such as exogenous variables or holidays.


## Core Algorithm: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model
An ARIMA model is a statistical model that analyzes and forecasts a time series. It uses differencing transformations to make the time series stationary and then applies autoregression and moving averages to model the dependence of the time series on previous lagged observations. The key features of an ARIMA model are:

1. Autoregression (AR): This means that the current value depends linearly on the previous values of the same series. AR(p) indicates that the system moves backward p times to get the last p predicted values.

2. Moving Average (MA): MA component models the dependency between the error term and its lagged values. MA(q) indicates that the system moves forward q times to minimize the mean squared error.

3. Differencing Transformation: To make the time series stationary, differences between consecutive values are calculated and subtracted to eliminate any overall trend.


In summary, the steps involved in building an ARIMA model are as follows:

1. Visualize the data to check if it meets the assumptions of the model, namely randomness, constant variance, and absence of autocorrelation in the residuals.
2. Determine the order of the model parameters p, d, and q through trial and error.
3. Apply the model parameters to the data and calculate the residual errors.
4. Use statistical tests to check if the model provides satisfactory results. If not, iterate through step 2 until satisfied.
