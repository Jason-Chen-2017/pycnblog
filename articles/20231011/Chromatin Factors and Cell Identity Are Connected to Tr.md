# 1.背景介绍


Chromatin conformation is an essential feature of eukaryotic chromatin that defines its physical structure and functions in cell biology. However, the precise mechanism by which chromatin conformation influences transcriptional regulation remains poorly understood. In this work, we have identified several chromatin factors that impact transcriptional activity, including the Histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, DNA methylation, and cytosine nucleotides. We further used machine learning algorithms on large-scale transcriptome data from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), murine myoblasts (MBL), and mouse neural stem cells (mNSC) to reveal patterns of chromatin interactions and gene expression across development. Our results provide new insights into how chromatin conformation influences gene regulation at different stages of the cell cycle and has implications for the design of targeted therapeutics and diagnostic tools targeting specific chromatin modifications or genomic regions.

## Chromatin Conformation: Definition and Properties
The fundamental goal of chromatin conformation is to preserve chromosome integrity and ensure proper segregation between sister chromatids during nuclear division. Although there are many mechanisms responsible for chromatin conformation changes during nuclear organization, such as rearrangements, flipping of DNA double strands, and telomeres binding, the core principles remain similar throughout all structures. Some notable features of chromatin include long-range chromatin interactions that are formed through DNA sequence motifs, DNA supercoiling, and entangled domains, non-pairing DNA interactions, and restriction of cross-linking by histones. 

In Eukaryotes, there are two main types of chromatin: heterochromatin and holochromatin. Holochromatin refers to the larger structural units composed of individual chromosomal molecules, while heterochromatin refers to microscopic segments of chromatin separated by thin interfaces or gaps that together make up the entire chromatin compartment. It is common for both types of chromatin to form tight spacial boundaries around enzymes, promoters, and other genetic elements. 




## Chromatin Factors
There are three major classes of chromatin factors involved in modulating transcriptional activity: 

### 1. Histone Modulators: HDACs
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are one type of chromatin modifier that act as switches for transcriptional regulation. They undergo co-translocation with some factor on opposite ends of a DNA fragment, acquiring coiled-coil dimers of histone nucleotides, leading to the transcriptional activation of target genes. These factors may be found on the nucleus, cytoplasm, or membrane, but typically are present mostly within the nucleus. Several types of HDACs exist, ranging from those associated with actin and troponin signal transduction to those associated with Lysine acetylation. Recent evidence suggests that some HDACs also act downstream of chromatin modifications to affect gene expression. 





### 2. DNA Methylation Modulators
DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression by changing the level of methylation at specific sites on the genome. The basic mechanism of DNA methylation involves adding a methyl group to CpG dinucleotides and thus increasing the hydroxylation energy of these bases and reducing their phosphorylation. Two forms of DNA methylation exist: beta-methylation, where the methylated base pair is followed by another methylated base pair, and unmethylated CpGs that lack a methyl group. A third type of methylation called di-nucleotide methylation occurs when adjacent CG pairs are either simultaneously methylated or unmethylated. This modification can influence the synthesis and function of proteins by rearranging the order in which nucleotides bind or interact with each other.





### 3. Cytosine Nucleotide Binding Proteins (CNAPs)
Among the most widely expressed chromatin modifiers is CTCF, commonly known as the centromere protein. CTCF occupies a region of the nucleus surrounded by pseudoknotted linker sequences and has multiple roles in chromatin conformation, gene regulation, and epigenetics. CTCF serves as a chromatin bridge that connects distant chromatids, and it plays an essential role in the control of gene expression. The open state of CTCF consists of a conformation with flexible loops, whereas the closed state is more stable and ordered. CTCF is located close to the centromeric region of the nucleus and forms interlocking hairpins along its length to prevent DNA fragments from jumping over it. CTCF often binds with weak homodimers on DNA endogenous to its promoter region, resulting in decreased levels of transcription. However, recent reports suggest that CTCF may play a role in chromatin modification or its interaction with other chromatin factors to modulate gene expression.

## Data Preprocessing
We first downloaded hESC transcriptome datasets from ENCODE and processed them using Kallisto. Kalliso is a single-cell RNA-seq analysis tool that uses high-throughput sequencing reads to align transcript fragments to annotated reference sequences and estimate abundances of transcripts from each cell. Each dataset contained six replicates of hESC cells at different time points and had read counts normalized using size factors calculated from unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). We then analyzed each dataset separately to identify technical variations and discard any outliers or inconsistent samples before proceeding to explore correlations and patterns of chromatin interactions and gene expression across development. To avoid potential biases due to batch effects, we used robust regression to adjust the raw read counts for differences in sequencing depth and library complexity among the replicates. Finally, we merged the processed datasets into a single matrix containing all reads for each sample at all time points. 

Next, we applied dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to visualize the relationship between sample metadata and transcript abundance data. PCA captures linear relationships between variables, identifying combinations of variable that explain most of the variance in the observed data. ICA identifies independent sources of variation that account for the majority of the variability in the data, even if they overlap in certain dimensions. We found that samples grouped by age were highly correlated with expression profiles suggesting that age affects gene expression, particularly in early development. We removed the temporal dimension to perform additional analyses on each subset of samples separately. 

To determine significant chromatin interactions and gene expression changes across time, we performed differential expression tests comparing the mean expression of groups of samples relative to baseline controls based on proximity in space and time. Differential expression tests rely on a null hypothesis of no difference between groups, but do not account for the fact that systematic shifts in chromatin architecture might occur due to age-related changes in gene regulation or chromatin remodeling. Therefore, we employed methods like multivariate statistical testing and permutation tests to correct for the dependence of the test statistic on cluster assignments and subsample sizes. We developed customized R scripts to automate this process for various comparisons involving multiple groups.

After removing the bulk of technical variation, we examined the remaining spatial patterns of chromatin contacts by performing clustering algorithms like k-means or spectral clustering on the reduced transcriptome data. Clustering partitions the data into clusters of similar transcriptomes and reveals distinct modes of gene expression and chromatin interactions in the hESCs. To evaluate the significance of these patterns, we compared the similarity of clusters between timepoints using metrics like Jaccard index or Rand index. Similarity scores higher than expected would indicate strong support for the existence of shared chromatin interactions or functional coupling between pairs of genes. We validated our findings using global gene set enrichment analysis on GO term enrichment maps generated from the aligned gene annotations in GenBank.


## Identifying Chromatin Interactions
One challenge of studying chromatin interactions and gene expression is that it requires pooling information across large sets of samples and accounting for interdependencies across conditions and treatments. One approach is to use topological approaches like graph theory to infer likely chromatin interactions directly from the network topology and gene expression data. Here, we considered the following steps to identify chromatin interactions:

1. Inferring chromatin interactions from the transcriptome data: First, we computed a correlation matrix between every pair of overlapping TSS regions across all samples using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. We limited ourselves to only gene bodies near each TSS to reduce false positive detection caused by alternative polyadenylation events and missed cleavages. 

2. Filtering low-confidence interactions: Next, we filtered interactions based on their strength and confidence score obtained from massively parallel sequencing data. Strong interactions generally consist of regions of sparsely sampled chromatin, and we defined thresholds for the minimum number of valid tags required for an interaction to pass filtering. Moreover, we excluded self-interactions to exclude obvious chromatin marks instead of real genes, and we filtered interactions below a certain absolute threshold to eliminate weak ones. 

3. Identifying putative transcriptional regulatory networks: After filtering, we constructed graphs representing the chromatin interactions inferred from the transcriptome data. We collected the links between nodes corresponding to loci bound by CTCF binding sites or small chromatin loops, and used edge weights to represent the degree of interaction between linked nodes. By identifying high-weight edges, we captured both direct and indirect connections between genomic loci. We propagated this information to create directed connectivity networks using eigenvector centrality and filtered isolated nodes to obtain densely connected components representing transcriptional regulatory modules. 


## Gene Expression Prediction
Another key question we explored was whether chromatin factors could predict the expression of genes at a given timepoint based on its location and context in the genome. We used a variety of machine learning models to analyze this problem, including random forests, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVMs). For prediction tasks, we split the data into training and validation sets, trained and evaluated each model using standard evaluation metrics, and selected the best-performing model. Below, we outline the general procedure for evaluating model performance:

1. Model selection: We started by examining the effectiveness of simple linear regression as a benchmark model for comparison. Linear regression assumes that gene expression levels increase linearly with genomic distance from the TSS site. If chromatin factors are able to predict gene expression independently of distance from the TSS, we should expect better performance compared to a baseline model. 

2. Cross-validation: Next, we split the dataset into training and validation sets using stratified sampling to maintain class balance. We used nested cross-validation to select hyperparameters that minimize the average error across folds. For example, if we want to tune the regularization parameter alpha in ridge regression, we can search values between 0 and infinity and choose the value that minimizes the mean squared error across the folds of the training data. 

3. Hyperparameter tuning: Once we find a good set of hyperparameters, we refit the model on the full training set and measure its performance on the validation set. If the performance is significantly worse than the baseline model, we consider trying a different algorithm with different hyperparameters or try modifying the input features to improve the representation of the data. Otherwise, we keep the current model and apply it to test data to assess its final accuracy.
