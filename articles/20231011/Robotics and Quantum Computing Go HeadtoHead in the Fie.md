# 1.背景介绍


Robotics and Quantum computing have been on the rise since recent years. Both of these are advanced technologies that enable us to solve complex problems by manipulating information or data with machines. However, there is a significant gap between them in terms of technology advancement, tools available for development and field applications. This gap can lead to a disconnect between researchers and developers who are trying to develop and deploy advanced robotic systems. The goal of this article is to bring clarity into the field by analyzing how these two fields go head-to-head in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines”. One way to categorize different approaches in AI include rule-based reasoning, machine learning, deep neural networks, probabilistic inference, and symbolic computation. In this article, we will focus our attention on the field of robotics and quantum computing because both of them offer unique advantages over traditional methods such as brute force search.

Increasingly, organizations are seeking to use AI to automate critical tasks like manufacturing processes, self-driving cars, industrial production lines, and medicine. With such applications, it becomes essential to combine the power of both techniques to leverage their respective strengths. Despite this trend, there still exists a considerable gap between the technological capabilities of both areas. As more businesses and governments adopt AI solutions, it becomes crucial for them to work together to address these gaps and create new opportunities. 

The following sections will provide an overview of each area, its benefits, challenges, and future directions in detail. We hope that this article would shed light onto the roadmap ahead for researchers and engineers working in the field of AI and help establish a strong connection between these two disciplines.


# 2. Core Concepts and Connections
## Robotics
### What is Robotics?
Robotics refers to the study and design of mechanical and electrical devices that exhibit humanlike motion. These devices operate under specific sets of instructions called control laws, which allow them to perform a wide range of actions from simple manipulation to complex tasks like military tactics. Robotics was one of the early fields of AI that has inspired many breakthroughs, including computer vision, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and artificial limbs. It also plays a significant role in healthcare, security, and scientific research.

### Benefits of Robotics
1. High level of abstraction: Robots can be programmed using high-level programming languages like Python, C++, or Java, enabling users to quickly prototype and test different ideas without requiring expertise in electronics and mechanical engineering.

2. Reduced cost: Robotics technology offers reduced costs compared to conventional mechanisms because they can be built and deployed at lower cost than other forms of automation. For example, a home vacuum cleaner requires only $100 USD whereas building a similar system from scratch may require several thousand dollars. 

3. Better safety: Many medical procedures rely heavily on robotics, so improvements to safety can reduce the risk of accidents. By adding sensors and actuators to the robot, it can detect potential hazards and initiate safeguards if necessary. 

4. Complex tasks: Robotics enables professionals to tackle complex tasks like assembly line jobs, construction, and exploration. They can perform these tasks much faster and more accurately than humans.

5. Personal assistants: Many people nowadays rely on personal assistants like Siri or Alexa to complete daily tasks like playing music or answering questions. These services make it easier for individuals to interact with the modern world. 

### Challenges of Robotics
Despite its benefits, some issues remain unsolved. Some of the major challenges faced in robotics are:

1. Learning curve: Robotics involves solving challenging problems, which requires expertise in mechanics, electronics, and software development. Getting started can be daunting even for experienced engineers.

2. Safety: Robotics technology presents risks to public safety, environment, and health due to factors like physical injuries, poor battery management, and limited access to raw materials.

3. Expensive: While economic models have improved significantly in recent decades, creating low-cost, lightweight, and modular robots remains a challenge. There are currently few commercial options available that meet the same standards as regular consumer products.

4. Collaboration: Robotics technology relies on multiple systems interacting simultaneously, which makes collaboration difficult. Even when teams collaborate, errors and failures often result in product failure or loss of confidence.

### Future Directions for Robotics
As robotics continues to grow, several exciting research projects are emerging. Here are just a few:

1. Soft robotics: Developing soft robots that can manipulate objects or material without being directly connected to any external forces or motors. Such robots could benefit from increased dexterity, mobility, and flexibility compared to traditional rigid body structures.

2. Medical robotics: Developing a new generation of medically affordable robotic arms capable of surgery and guidance. Research in this field could pave the way towards greater accessibility in healthcare settings.

3. Augmented Reality: Providing interactive simulations that overlay virtual content on real-world environments. Applications in education, entertainment, and research industry could potentially transform the current way people learn and understand the world.

## Quantum Computing 
### What is Quantum Computing?
Quantum computing is a subset of theoretical computer science that uses quantum physics to simulate quantum behavior of classical bits and qubits. Quantum computers can process large amounts of data and run algorithms that were once thought impossible until recently.

### Benefits of Quantum Computing
Here are some of the key benefits of quantum computing:

1. Superior performance: Quantum computers promise to outperform conventional computers in certain tasks. For instance, quantum processors can achieve supercomputational speeds that exceed those of their digital counterparts.

2. Interact with real world: Unlike classic computers, quantum computers can interact directly with real world entities through quantum communication protocols. This opens up new possibilities for research and business in diverse fields like finance, energy, and nuclear power.

3. Real time processing: Since quantum computers use quantum effects instead of transistors and registers, they can process data in real time without waiting for clock cycles. Therefore, quantum computations can be used for real-time applications like stock market predictions, telecommunications, and medical diagnosis.

### Challenges of Quantum Computing
Unfortunately, while quantum computers offer impressive computational powers, developing practical quantum computers is still a long-term challenge. Aside from hardware and algorithmic complexity, one of the main challenges lies in ensuring that quantum properties are actually present in nature and not merely an illusion created by clever engineers. Another issue is scalability, where large numbers of qubits and circuits need to be processed within reasonable times. Overall, while quantum computing promises to revolutionize computer science, it will undoubtedly take years before actual deployment reaches widespread use.

### Future Directions for Quantum Computing
While various companies are investing in quantum computing research, a lot of progress has already been made. Here are just a few examples:

1. Quantum supremacy: A series of quantum algorithms have been developed that demonstrate impressive results against classical computers. Although the performance levels achieved so far are impressive, scalability and reliability are concerns that need to be addressed further.

2. Advancing quantum chemistry: Quantum computers can be used to enhance existing quantum chemical techniques by increasing computational efficiency and reducing errors. This could greatly accelerate discovery efforts in the field of drug delivery and toxicology.

3. Quantum Internet: Building quantum internet infrastructure will require addressing privacy concerns, network congestion, and distribution of data across multiple nodes. New protocols must be designed to optimize routing and delay, and fault tolerance measures should be put in place to ensure continuous availability of the service.
