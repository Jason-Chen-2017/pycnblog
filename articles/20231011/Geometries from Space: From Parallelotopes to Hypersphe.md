# 1.背景介绍


In this article we will explore the beautiful mathematical space called hyperbolic geometry, which lies at the intersection of algebra and geometrical concepts. We will start by exploring some basic terminology and then move on to the definition and properties of hyperbolic spaces, including parallelotope and dipyramid (or more general polyhedra). Then we will introduce the concept of duality between hyperbolic spaces and Euclidean spaces, before moving into a detailed discussion of important algorithms for computing with these structures in computer graphics applications such as ray tracing and polygon clipping. Finally, we will review how different models of conics intersect or are related to hyperbolic geometry, highlighting their unique features and implications for modeling and rendering physical phenomena.
Hyperbolic geometry is becoming increasingly popular both in theoretical studies and application areas such as computer graphics, virtual reality, augmented reality, medical imaging, signal processing, and astrophysics. In recent years it has emerged as an alternative paradigm for understanding and solving problems that typically involve complex shapes or symmetries, such as fractals, torus knots, and windings. It offers several advantages over traditional Cartesian or spherical coordinate systems, such as greater intuitive understanding of objects, simpler calculations, and ability to capture non-Euclidean deformations of manifolds. Therefore, its widespread use is likely to continue expanding in the near future.
The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of hyperbolic geometry, providing a strong foundation for students, researchers, engineers, and developers who want to learn more about its various applications and developments. Moreover, it should serve as a useful reference for those working in industry, teaching courses or labs in the field, or simply curious individuals who want to gain insights into the fascinating world of hyperbolic geometry. This article assumes a reasonable level of familiarity with basic mathematical concepts, such as vector calculus, linear algebra, and differential geometry.
To achieve our goals, we will follow the standard outline for writing technical papers. First, we will briefly describe the background and motivation for studying hyperbolic geometry. Next, we will define key terms and concepts, explain why they are important for hyperbolic geometry, and discuss their interplay and relationships with other parts of mathematics. We will then present the theory behind each part of hyperbolic geometry, explaining what makes them so special and interesting, and how they interact with classic ideas in differential geometry and topology. To illustrate the theory, we will showcase specific examples and visualizations. Finally, we will demonstrate how these concepts can be applied to real-world problems using numerical simulations and software tools, and highlight potential issues and challenges ahead. The hope is that this paper will inspire readers to delve deeper into the exciting and powerful world of hyperbolic geometry and stimulate further research efforts in this area.

# Section 2: Introduction and Review
## 2.1 Introduction

The term "hyperbolic" comes from Greek philosopher Heraclitus, meaning "half," referring to the fact that every object can be viewed as two separate halves. Mathematicians have long recognized that the Euclidean geometry cannot represent all possible shape forms, especially high-dimensional ones, while still satisfying certain fundamental properties like closure, convexity, and similarity. Hyperbolic geometry was introduced by Aristotle in his treatise on geometry three centuries ago, but only recently became widely popular due to its practical applications in physics, engineering, biology, and economics. One reason for this popularity is that it provides a natural way to model and analyze non-Euclidean manifolds, particularly those that arise naturally when considering continuous transformations like folds and wormholes. Another advantage is its elegant and simple visualization, making it ideal for educational purposes and demonstration purposes in art and science. Despite these benefits, however, there remains much confusion surrounding hyperbolic geometry, partially because many of its key ideas are not well-understood yet.

Hyperbolic geometry consists of two main branches: one based around planes and circles, known as planar hyperbolic geometry; another branch centered on ellipses and triangles, known as projective hyperbolic geometry. Planar hyperbolic geometry includes most familiar types of curves, such as lines, points, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolae, along with additional structure formulas that allow us to construct higher-order entities. Projective hyperbolic geometry includes polygons and polyhedrons built out of prisms, antiprisms, and dipyramids (also known as polygeneralizations of cones), among others, which play an essential role in computer graphics and virtual reality. Each type of entity can also be represented in terms of other entities, such as by extruding planes and pushing through ellipses, allowing us to form new structures by composing existing pieces. Unlike cartesian or spherical coordinates, hyperbolic coordinates require careful handling of singularities and poles, which make the computations challenging. However, once we understand these concepts and operations, it becomes clear that hyperbolic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying complex systems. 

Here we will explore some core definitions and properties of hyperbolic geometry, focusing specifically on the latter half of the spectrum - namely the relation between hyperbolic spaces and euclidean spaces, together with relevant applications and computational aspects. We will begin by reviewing some key terms and concepts, introducing important differences between hyperbolic and euclidean structures, and finally addressing the connection between hyperbolic geometry and conics.
