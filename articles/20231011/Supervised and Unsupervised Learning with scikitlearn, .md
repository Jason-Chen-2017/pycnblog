# 1.背景介绍



Supervised learning algorithms are used in various fields such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing to name a few. These models learn from labeled data where the input features along with their expected outputs are given. The supervised learning algorithm then uses this labeled dataset to make predictions on new unseen data. There are two types of supervised learning algorithms: classification and regression problems. In classification problems, we want to predict a discrete output value or class label based on some input features. In regression problems, we want to predict a continuous variable such as a number or price based on certain input features.

On the other hand, unsupervised learning is used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and visualization purposes. This type of learning does not involve any labeled training examples, but instead relies on finding patterns and relationships within the data. Examples include K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and DBSCAN clustering. We will be focusing on using scikit-learn library for implementing these algorithms in Python. 

In this article, we will first cover the basic concepts behind supervised and unsupervised learning before introducing different supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms available in scikit-learn. Next, we will go into detail about each algorithm's implementation using code examples. Finally, we will discuss future directions for further improvements. Let's get started!

# 2.Core Concepts & Relationships

## 2.1 Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model with labeled data, meaning that it can predict outcomes based on previously seen inputs. It consists of three main components:

1. Input Feature: The input feature represents the variables or attributes that influence the outcome.
2. Output Variable/Label: The output variable or label represents the intended prediction made by the trained model. 
3. Training Data Set: The training set is composed of both input features and corresponding labels. 

The goal of supervised learning is to train a model that can generalize well to unseen data so that it can produce accurate results when making predictions on new, unknown data points. Some popular supervised learning algorithms are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks etc. 



## 2.2 Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves training a model without any prior knowledge about the target values or classes. It consists of four main components:

1. Input Features: Unlike supervised learning, there are no predefined output variables or labels associated with the input features.
2. Clustering Algorithm: An algorithm that groups similar data points together into clusters according to the similarity between them.
3. Distance Measure: A distance measure that determines how close or far data points are related to each other.
4. Training Dataset: The training dataset contains only input features and needs to be clustered into separate clusters. 

Some popular unsupervised learning algorithms are K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).

So what's the difference? Both methods have common goals - to learn from existing data to improve decision-making capabilities. However, they differ in terms of the amount of information provided during training, assumptions, and evaluation criteria. Here's an overview:


1. **Number of samples:**
   
   * With supervised learning, we provide a labeled dataset consisting of both input features and their respective output variables. Therefore, the more training examples, the better our model becomes at generalizing to unseen data. 
   
   * On the contrary, unsupervised learning is typically applied on large datasets which may contain many irrelevant datapoints or outliers. Hence, it makes sense to use fewer training samples than those required for supervised learning. 

2. **Assumptions:**

   * Supervised learning assumes that there exists a relationship between the input features and output variables, i.e., we're trying to capture underlying patterns in the data. 
   
   * On the contrary, unsupervised learning has no preconceived ideas about the distribution of the input features; hence, it doesn't assume anything specific about the problem domain. 
   
3. **Evaluation Criteria:**

    * For supervised learning, we evaluate our model based on its performance on the test data set containing input features and output variables that were not seen during training.
    
    * While, for unsupervised learning, we cannot compare our model's performance directly against another model due to the absence of ground truth labels. Instead, we need to use metrics like silhouette score, calinski harabasz index or dunn index to assess the quality of the clustering result.
    
    
Overall, while supervised learning requires labeled data to train the model, unsupervised learning can handle large amounts of data with little or no supervision.
