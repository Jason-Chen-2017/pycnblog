# 1.背景介绍


Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which are used to encrypt communication between web browsers and servers, are widely used encryption protocols in today’s internet environment. However, it is not always straightforward for developers or system architects to understand the inner working of these algorithms. Therefore, this article will provide a quick understanding of how TLS and SSL encryption works at a high level and help developers better understand their use cases and security implications. In addition, we also explore various attack vectors that can be exploited using cryptography based encryption systems. 

This article does NOT cover all possible aspects related to TLS and SSL encryption such as authentication mechanisms, key exchange protocols, message integrity verification, etc., but instead focuses on providing an overview of major features of these protocols along with core concepts involved in establishing secure connections. The article also explains why certain encryption schemes have been chosen over others depending upon different application requirements. Finally, we look into recent developments in TLS and SSL protocols that aim to address some of the vulnerabilities associated with older protocols. Overall, this article aims to provide a clear understanding of the basics behind modern encryption protocols and highlight critical points that need to be considered while designing secure communications applications. This article should be useful for developers who want to get a comprehensive understanding of current and emerging encryption technologies.

# 2.Core Concepts and Relationships
## 2.1 Fundamentals of Cryptographic Encryption
Before delving into specific details about the encryption algorithms used in TLS and SSL protocols, let us first discuss fundamental principles of encryption and decryption processes in general.

1. Symmetric Key Encryption: The basic principle of symmetric key encryption is that two parties share one common secret key. Anyone having access to both keys can easily decrypt any encrypted data that has been encrypted using that same key. Here's how it works:

    - Parties agree on a shared secret key
    - Sender generates random plaintext data and encrypts it using the shared key
    - Receiver decrypts the ciphertext using the shared key and obtains original plaintext data
    
    Example: AES-CBC Cipher
    
    
    
2. Asymmetric Key Encryption: On the other hand, asymmetric key encryption involves two separate keys – public and private – which are mathematically linked. One key belongs to sender and the other key belongs to receiver. While sending messages, the sender uses the public key to encrypt the data before transmitting it to the receiver, and when receiving messages, the receiver decrypts them using its own private key. Public key encryption makes it impossible to reverse engineer the encrypted message without knowing the private key. The only way to read the encrypted message would be through the process described earlier using the corresponding private key.

    Examples: RSA, ECC
    
3. Hash Functions: These functions take input data and generate fixed-size output called hash values. They are typically used for verifying the authenticity and integrity of data by generating a unique digest value from the original data. For example, SHA-256 hashing algorithm is commonly used in TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3.

    Example: SHA-256 Hash Function
    
4. Message Authentication Code (MAC): A MAC function takes a piece of data, adds a secret key to it, and then hashes the result to produce a tag. During transmission, the sender includes the tag with the data so that the receiver can confirm if the message was received correctly. Similarly, during reception, the receiver checks if the decrypted text matches the expected hash value generated from the encrypted text and the sent tag.

    Example: HMAC Algorithm
    
Note: All cryptographic operations mentioned above rely on mathematical calculations and therefore they are highly sensitive to errors and side channel attacks. Hence, proper usage of cryptographic libraries and programming languages like OpenSSL provides security best practices.
