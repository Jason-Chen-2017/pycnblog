## Introduction
The World Bank estimates that by 2025, around half of the world's population will live in cities and the majority of these people depend on irrigation to their survival. The demand for clean water is expected to increase dramatically due to climate change as industrialisation leads to an increased use of fossil fuel energy sources such as coal, oil and gas.
Accordingly, accurate estimation of irrigation water usage across multiple fields has become crucial for managing resource allocation, monitoring environmental impacts and improving overall efficiency of water management systems. In this context, mobile app development could be used to create a solution which can effectively track water usage across large fields using only mobile phone camera images without any intervention or human supervision. This type of technology would also be beneficial for reducing costs associated with traditional technologies like surveys or field visits. However, achieving reliable accuracy requires careful design and implementation of algorithms that take into account various factors such as illumination variations between fields, image quality, object detection, background noise, target tracking, and so on. 

In this article, we propose a framework based on computer vision techniques for real-time tracking of irrigation water usage across multiple fields using mobile phone camera images. We start by reviewing relevant literature on computer vision and machine learning techniques for image processing and deep learning models for object detection, followed by an overview of our proposed approach. Finally, we present a detailed explanation of how our algorithm works, including its key components, operations and mathematical formulas, along with code examples in Python language and illustrations showing how it operates and improves over time.

## Object Detection
Object detection refers to the process of identifying and locating objects within an image or video frame. It involves detecting instances of different classes (such as vehicles, pedestrians, animals) and predicting their location and size within the image space. To perform this task, several approaches have been developed, ranging from classical methods such as color thresholding, edge detection, contour finding and shape recognition to more sophisticated deep learning networks that leverage convolutional neural networks (CNN).
One common challenge when performing object detection is handling occlusions, i.e., objects that are partially blocked by other objects in the scene. One approach commonly used to handle occlusion is non-maximum suppression (NMS), which removes duplicate detections generated by overlapping bounding boxes. Another technique called spatial transformers has been shown to improve performance even further by incorporating geometric transformations such as rotation, scaling and skewing to generate alternative anchor boxes centered at each pixel position.

We will use YOLOv3 object detector implemented using PyTorch library for this purpose. YOLO stands for You Only Look Once - a popular CNN architecture for object detection tasks. The v3 version adds several improvements compared to previous versions, including improved inference speed and higher mAP score (mean average precision) on COCO dataset.

## Image Processing Techniques
Image processing techniques play a central role in various applications involving image analysis. They involve manipulating digital images to extract useful information such as edges, contours, shapes, textures, etc. Some common techniques include contrast adjustment, sharpening, filtering, thresholding, morphological transformations, edge detection, segmentation, texture classification and feature matching.
Some important steps involved in image processing are image alignment, normalization, denoising, and compression. These techniques help remove unwanted noise and enhance the focus of an image. For object detection, additional preprocessing steps include resizing, padding, cropping, and grayscaling.

To preprocess the raw images, we resize them to smaller sizes suitable for training our object detection model. Then, we apply standard data augmentation techniques such as random rotation, scaling, shearing, and horizontal flip to generate new training samples. During testing phase, we keep the same image size but employ image padding if necessary to ensure that all objects in the test image can be detected.

Finally, we normalize the pixel values of the images to lie between 0 and 1 to avoid overflow during backpropagation. Moreover, we apply L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and reduce the number of free parameters in the network. Additionally, we may add dropout layers to randomly drop out some neurons during training to prevent overfitting. By using a pre-trained model such as VGGNet or ResNet, we can save both time and computational resources spent on training our own model.
