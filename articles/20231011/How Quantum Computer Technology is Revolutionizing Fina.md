# 1.背景介绍


The rapid advancement of quantum technology has unlocked the potential for a new age financial system based on quasi-classical physics, or “quantum finance”. As quantum computers continue to scale up their processing power and computational abilities, they have become an essential component in economic modeling, simulation, and optimization processes that are now possible with increasingly complex models and scenarios. The exponential growth in demand for data science tools and applications also calls for enhanced knowledge and expertise in this field. Herein we explore how quantum computer technologies can revolutionize the financial industry by enabling efficient and accurate market simulations that integrate human decision-making as well as mathematical computations. 

In our view, one crucial step towards realising quantum finance is recognising its fundamental role in creating a more comprehensive and robust financial ecosystem that combines market-driven strategies with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. By developing advanced algorithms and techniques, such as variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE), hybrid algorithms, and deep reinforcement learning, we aim to unlock the full potential of quantum computing and ultimately contribute towards improved investment decisions and market outcomes for both businesses and consumers alike. We hope that our exploratory analysis will provide valuable insights into the future of quantum finance and stimulate conversations between technologists, investors, and policymakers around the world.

## Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics is the study of particles and wavefunctions that exist in quantum theory. It describes the behavior of subatomic particles and waves of electricity through the principles of quantum superposition and interference. This allows scientists to model many physical systems in terms of quantum mechanical concepts. Quantum mechanics offers several advantages over classical mechanics:

1. Higher degree of freedom: Unlike traditional mechanics which works only with three degrees of freedom, quantum mechanics involves multiple degrees of freedom at each point in space. These degrees of freedom can be treated individually or combined together according to certain laws.
2. Non-linearity: In contrast to classical mechanics where objects oscillate in a straight line due to friction, quantum mechanics enables the creation of non-linear phenomena like dynamical chaos and nonlinear optics.
3. Precision: Quantum mechanics provides high levels of precision in calculating and analyzing equations involving large numbers of variables.
4. Uncertainty: Quantum mechanics provides an infinite range of possible states for a particle, making it capable of describing precisely any physical event without prior assumptions.

It is widely believed that quantum mechanics is responsible for much of the modern physics we observe today, including atoms, molecules, and light rays. However, quantum mechanics alone cannot explain all of the properties observed in nature. Other fields of mathematics, such as statistical mechanics and information theory, provide deeper explanations for these observations. 

## Quantum Computing
Quantum computing refers to the use of quantum mechanical effects to perform computation, leading to significant improvements in performance compared to classical computers. There are two types of quantum hardware architectures: superconducting circuits and fault-tolerant quantum devices. Superconducting circuits consist of isolated switches made from silicon and germanium material that create electromagnetic signals when operated under specific conditions. Fault-tolerant quantum devices, such as transmon qubits, rely on spontaneous emission of radio frequency radiation to function correctly. 

To understand what makes quantum computers different from classical computers, let's first consider the speed difference. A standard clock cycle time for a general-purpose processor, such as a laptop CPU, is typically measured in microseconds (ms). A quantum computer would theoretically operate at faster speeds than a classical computer but still limited by the limitations imposed by quantum mechanics, such as decoherence times. Therefore, current quantum computers can achieve very fast runtimes but may not always give results identical to those obtained using classical methods. For instance, if we run a quantum circuit designed to solve a particular problem on a given set of input values, there is no guarantee that the same output values will be produced every time the algorithm is executed, even if the inputs remain the same.

Another major advantage of quantum computers is their ability to manipulate entangled quantum states, which are commonly encountered in many applications, such as quantum chemistry, cryptography, and quantum simulation. Entanglement refers to the fact that two quantum bits behave as a single unit, i.e., if one bit is changed then the other bit changes too. Two classic bits have separate memory spaces, while two entangled bits share the same memory state. Entangling means that the entire quantum state becomes dependent on some aspect of the initial state, rather than being completely independent. This leads to significantly increased complexity in the implementation of quantum algorithms, requiring special techniques to manage entanglement across multiple components.
