# 1.背景介绍


Predictive analytics is one of the most popular areas in data science and machine learning. It involves building models that can accurately predict outcomes or make predictions based on existing patterns within data sets. In this article, we will build a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn library to understand how it works and what are its limitations. The aim of the article is not only to explain the working mechanism of Linear Regression but also to show you some useful tips for solving common problems like overfitting and underfitting. We will use an example dataset called “Salary vs Experience” which has two features: experience (years) and salary ($).


We assume that you have already installed Python and Scikit-learn libraries on your system. If not, please refer to these installation instructions before proceeding further. After installing them, let’s start by importing necessary modules and loading the sample data set into our program. 

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import linear_model

data = {'experience':[2,3,4,5,6],'salary':[75000,90000,110000,130000,150000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Data Set:")
print(df)

X = df['experience'].values.reshape(-1,1) # convert feature matrix
y = df['salary']                          # target variable vector
```
Here we have used Pandas DataFrame module to create a sample data set consisting of two columns - experience (in years) and salary ($), and then loaded them into X and y variables respectively. 

Let's now split the dataset into training and testing subsets so that we can test the accuracy of the model on unseen data later. 

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
In the above code, we have imported the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module, which allows us to split the given dataset into training and testing subsets. Here we have specified the size of the testing subset to be 20% of the total dataset (`test_size=0.2`) and assigned a random state value of 42 to ensure reproducibility across different runs. 

Now that we have prepared our data, we can move forward to creating our linear regression model.  

# 2. Core Concepts and Relationship
Linear Regression is one of the simplest type of supervised learning algorithms where the goal is to fit a line to a set of points. The task of Linear Regression is to find the best possible straight line through the given data points such that the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and actual values is minimized. 

The general form of Linear Regression equation is given below:

$$\hat{Y} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1}+... +\beta_{n}x_{n}$$

Where, 
* $\hat{Y}$ is the estimated/predicted output value or dependent variable.
* $x$ is the input variable or independent variable.
* $\beta_{0}, \beta_{1},..., \beta_{n}$ are the parameters of the model.
* There may be no intercept term if all variables are considered centered at zero; otherwise, there must be an intercept term present in the model.

When n equals one, Linear Regression becomes Simple Linear Regression where there is only one predictor variable x. When n exceeds one, it becomes Multiple Linear Regression where there are multiple predictor variables. 

For simplicity, we assume that n equals one in the rest of the article. 

# 3. Algorithmic Principles and Details
To derive the formula for estimating the coefficients $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{1}$, and $\beta_{2}$ for a simple linear regression problem, we need to minimize the error term between the predicted values ($\hat{Y}$) and the actual values ($y$) using a cost function. The commonly used cost functions for linear regression include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared Score. 

Mean Squared Error (MSE):
$$MSE=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y-\hat{y})^2$$

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
$$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y-\hat{y})^2}$$

R-squared score:
$$R^{2}=1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{\text {actual }}-\hat{y})^{2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{\text {actual }}-\bar{y})^{2}}$$

where, 
* $y$ is the actual response value or label.
* $\hat{y}$ is the predicted response value or label.
* $\bar{y}$ is the mean of observed responses.


One way to estimate the optimal values for $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{1}$, and $\beta_{2}$ is to perform Gradient Descent optimization algorithm. This algorithm repeatedly updates the values of $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{1}$, and $\beta_{2}$ iteratively until convergence criteria are met. The gradient descent optimization algorithm for linear regression consists of three main steps: 

1. Initialize the parameter estimates to small random values close to zero.
2. Calculate the gradients of the loss function wrt each parameter. 
3. Update the parameter values according to the negative of the gradient direction times a small step size. 

Once the optimization algorithm converges, we obtain the final estimates for the coefficient values. These estimates represent the best-fit line or hyperplane for the given data. Now, we can use these estimated coefficients to make predictions on new data points. 


As mentioned earlier, the advantages of linear regression include:

1. Easy to understand and interpret results.
2. Model assumptions are simple and easy to verify.
3. Can handle large datasets efficiently.
4. No assumptions about underlying distribution.

However, the disadvantages of linear regression include:

1. Predictions may be influenced by outliers or non-linear relationships.
2. Does not capture complex interactions between the variables.
3. Cannot automatically determine non-linear transformations required to improve performance.
4. Overfits to the training data if the number of features is too high relative to the amount of available data.
