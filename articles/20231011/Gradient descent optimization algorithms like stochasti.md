# 1.背景介绍


In this article, I will provide a high level overview of two commonly used gradient descent optimization methods, namely Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD). We will start by giving an introduction to these methods, followed by discussing their core concepts such as batch size and learning rate, before going through the mathematical details of SGD and MBGD and providing stepwise explanation with code examples using Python libraries numpy and scipy. Finally, we will explore potential future developments in these areas and suggest further readings for those interested in further research.

## What is Machine Learning? ##
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed. In simpler terms, it allows machines to find patterns or relationships between input data and output labels automatically, without being taught explicitly. It involves several sub-fields such as Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Cognitive Systems. 

A typical ML problem consists of three main components:

1. Data: This contains information about the input variables, also known as features, along with corresponding target variable(s), also called label/labels/outputs, which is what we want our model to predict.

2. Model: The model represents the pattern or relationship between the features and labels. There are various types of models available such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc., depending on the requirements of the problem. 

3. Loss Function: A loss function measures the difference between predicted values and actual values. For example, Mean Square Error (MSE) is one common loss function used in regression problems, while Cross Entropy is used in classification problems.

## Why use Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithms? ##
Gradient descent optimization algorithms have been successfully applied in many fields including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, reinforcement learning, finance, healthcare, and transportation. They typically involve iteratively updating parameters in order to minimize the loss function, resulting in improved performance over time. While there are other optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimizers, etc., that can solve similar tasks, SGD and MBGD are still preferred due to their simplicity and efficiency. 

The key advantage of these algorithms lies in their ability to handle large datasets efficiently and tune well towards the optimal solution. Moreover, they avoid local minimum and saddle points altogether, making them more reliable during training. Overall, they are often considered the foundation block for most modern deep neural networks.

Before diving into the details of each algorithm, let's discuss some key concepts related to both SGD and MBGD. 

## Batch Size ##
The batch size refers to the number of samples processed in each iteration of gradient descent. If the batch size is too small, then the updates made based on individual sample gradients may not be accurate and convergence may take longer. On the other hand, if the batch size is too big, then computational overhead increases and learning speed may decrease. Hence, it is crucial to select a proper batch size that balances tradeoff between computation time and accuracy. Typically, a value of 32 to 128 samples per batch is chosen. 

## Learning Rate ##
Learning rate determines the magnitude of update made in each iteration of gradient descent. Too low a learning rate may cause slow convergence, whereas a higher learning rate might result in unstable convergence or even divergence. Therefore, a suitable range of learning rates needs to be determined according to the nature of the problem. Typical starting points include 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001. As the training progresses, smaller learning rates may need to be used in order to achieve good generalization. 

## Convergence ##
Convergence occurs when the error in the parameter space stops decreasing, i.e., the change in the objective function is negligible. Depending on the dataset, the number of iterations required for convergence may vary, ranging from hundreds to thousands or tens of thousand, but never infinitely. When training deep neural networks, early stopping regularization can help prevent overfitting and reduce the risk of getting stuck in local minima. 

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解
Now let's move onto explaining the math behind SGD and MBGD. Both methods share a common principle of minimizing the cost function J(w) with respect to the weight vector w. Here, J denotes the cost function representing the empirical risk minimized by the model. 

### Mathematical Formulation ###
Given a cost function J, its derivative dJ/dw, and initial weights w_init, we can use gradient descent to optimize the weights to minimize the cost function. Specifically, we update the weights in steps until convergence or maximum number of iterations is reached. 

The basic idea behind SGD is to estimate the gradient direction locally around the current point, and take a step in that direction proportional to the negative gradient. The formula for SGD is given below:

$$w_{t+1} = w_{t} - \eta \nabla_{w_{t}}{J}(w_t) $$

where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $t$ denotes the iteration index, and $w_{t}$ and $w_{t+1}$ represent the weights after and before applying the update rule respectively. The derivation of the above equation requires computing the gradient $\nabla_{w_{t}}{J}(w_t)$, which can be computed recursively as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}\nabla_{w_{t}}{J}(w_t)&=\frac{\partial J}{\partial w_t}\\&= \frac{\partial J}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial w_t}\\&\approx \frac{J(w_t+\epsilon)-J(w_t-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon}\end{aligned}$$

This approximation method helps improve the convergence speed of SGD by reducing the variance of the gradient estimation. The epsilon term controls the width of the neighborhood around the current point where the gradient is estimated. Larger values of epsilon lead to better estimates, but increase the computation time and memory usage.  

On the other hand, the Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD) uses batches of randomly sampled data instead of single instances. It has two advantages compared to SGD:

- First, it reduces the dependence of the gradient on noise, leading to more stable convergence properties. 
- Second, it makes use of parallelism across multiple processors and GPUs for efficient calculation of gradients.

The updated formula for MBGD is given below:

$$\theta_k \leftarrow \theta_{k-1}-\alpha {\dfrac {1}{m}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\nabla_{\theta }L(\theta,x^{(i)},y^{(i)}) $$

Here, m is the number of observations, theta_k is the kth iteration’s estimate of the model parameters, $\theta_{k-1}$ is the (k−1)th iteration estimate, alpha is the learning rate, and x_i and y_i are the inputs and outputs for the ith observation. Note that θ stands for weights and b stands for bias vectors separately, so they need to be separately handled in the formulas above.

To understand the inner working of SGD and MBGD, we need to go back to basics. Before moving forward, let me explain briefly how linear regression works. Suppose we have a set of n independent variables X and dependent variable Y, where n is the number of samples. Our goal is to fit a line that best describes the data, represented by the equation Y = BX + A. One way to do this is by finding the values of A and B that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE):

$$\min_{B,A}\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-BX_i^2-A)^2$$

Once we have found the optimized values of B and A, we can make predictions for new data points based on the equation Y' = B*X' + A'. This approach assumes that the relationship between the input variables X and the output variable Y is linear. Now, let's analyze how these two algorithms perform under different circumstances. 


### Gradient Descent for Linear Regression ###
Let's consider a simple case where we have only one feature X and try to fit a straight line to the observed data points. We assume a linear relationship between X and Y, meaning that Y can be expressed as a weighted sum of X, i.e., Y ≈ βX + α, where β is the slope and α is the intercept. Thus, we can write SSE as follows:

$$J(\beta, \alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-(βx_i+α))^2 = ||Y-XB||^2_2$$

Suppose that we start with beta_init = 0 and alpha_init = 0, and apply the update rules for SGD and MBGD repeatedly for T epochs or iterations. Then, we would get the following plots:

**Figure 1:** SGD vs. Epochs.

**Figure 2:** MBGD vs. Iterations.

We see that SGD takes fewer iterations to reach a relatively close minimum compared to MBGD, although MBGD reaches the same optimum in less time. Furthermore, both methods seem to converge to the same global minimum. However, note that the behavior of these two algorithms is highly sensitive to the choice of initialization and the specific distribution of the data. Also, since SGD is a simple yet effective algorithm, it may perform poorly on non-convex loss functions, especially ones with multiple local optima. 

Overall, SGD and MBGD are widely used in machine learning because they offer fast and scalable solutions to optimization problems, particularly useful for very large datasets and complex loss functions. 

# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明
Let's now implement the above concept in Python using Scikit-learn library. We will train a simple linear regression model using SGD and MBGD and compare the results visually. 

First, we import necessary modules and generate random data.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor, Ridge, ElasticNet
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(1) # Set seed for reproducibility
X = np.sort(5 * np.random.rand(40, 1), axis=0)
y = np.sin(X).ravel()
y[::5] += 3 * (0.5 - np.random.rand(8)) # Add noise to every fifth observation
plt.scatter(X, y);
```

Next, we split the data into training and testing sets and fit the models.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

sgd_regressor = SGDRegressor(penalty='none', max_iter=1000, eta0=0.1, random_state=42)
sgd_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

mbgd_regressor = SGDRegressor(penalty='none', max_iter=1000, eta0=0.1, random_state=42, shuffle=True, minibatch_size=10)
mbgd_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Finally, we plot the true curve versus the predicted curves obtained from the trained models.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='black')
plt.plot(X_test, sgd_regressor.predict(X_test), color='red', linewidth=3, label='SGD')
plt.plot(X_test, mbgd_regressor.predict(X_test), color='blue', linewidth=3, label='MBGD')
plt.legend();
```

The above code generates the following visualizations:
