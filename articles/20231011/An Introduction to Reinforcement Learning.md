# 1.背景介绍


Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that allows an agent to learn from its interactions with the environment and improve itself over time. It involves training an agent to take actions in response to states within an environment based on reward or penalty signals. In this article we will introduce the basics of RL including why it’s useful, what are some key concepts related to RL, and how they relate to supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Additionally, we will provide an overview of three major algorithms for RL: policy gradient, value iteration, and Q-learning. Finally, we'll discuss several practical applications of reinforcement learning such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving.

## 2.1 Policy Gradient Methods
Policy Gradient methods are one type of reinforcement learning algorithm where the goal is to find a better policy than any human player can achieve through trial and error. The basic idea behind these methods is to train an agent by applying gradient descent updates to a parameterized policy function, which maps each state of the environment to an action probability distribution. 

The main idea of the policy gradient method is to maximize the expected return of the agent after taking an action given the current state of the world. This means that the agent should be able to control its behavior so that it explores different options while still achieving high rewards over time. To do this, the agent learns a set of weights or parameters that determine the action probabilities at each state. These weights are updated using gradients computed based on the difference between predicted and actual returns observed during training. Specifically, the loss function used to update the weights is typically a mean squared error between the predicted and true returns alongside the logarithm of the action probabilities. By performing gradient descent, the agent adjusts its weights towards minimizing the loss function.

In summary, policy gradient methods use a probabilistic approach to map each state to an action probability distribution and update the parameters of the policy function using gradient descent techniques to minimize a loss function based on predicted and actual returns. One advantage of using policy gradient methods is their ability to handle continuous action spaces more easily than other types of reinforcement learning methods. Another advantage is that they require less exploration compared to other methods like Monte Carlo tree search because the policy function directly represents the optimal strategy without the need for random sampling. However, since there is no guarantee that the learned policies will converge to the best solution, the convergence rate may vary depending on the specific problem being solved.

## 2.2 Value Iteration and Q-Learning
Value iteration is another type of reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to find the maximum expected return for an agent starting from any state. Similarly, Q-learning is a model free reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a neural network to approximate the action-value function instead of representing it explicitly. Unlike value iteration, Q-learning does not have to solve a maze-solving problem exhaustively but rather finds the shortest path to the goal.

Both value iteration and Q-learning differ in their formulation of the optimal policy. Value iteration computes the optimal state values recursively using Bellman's equation, whereas Q-learning estimates the action-values and then chooses the action that maximizes them. While both methods compute the same optimal policy, Q-learning tends to perform better empirically in practice due to its ability to deal with larger action spaces and non-deterministic environments. On the other hand, value iteration provides a simpler and faster way to solve small problems with simple dynamics. Overall, the choice of whether to use value iteration or Q-learning depends on the size and complexity of the problem being solved.

## 2.3 Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
Supervised learning involves labeled data that consists of input examples paired with desired outputs called labels. The task of the algorithm is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs based on this labeled data. Examples include classification tasks where the input examples represent images and the labels correspond to classifications such as "cat" or "dog". Other example applications include spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves only unlabeled data without corresponding output labels. The goal of the algorithm is to discover patterns and relationships in the data without any prior knowledge about the underlying structure or semantics. An example application of unsupervised learning is clustering where the goal is to group similar examples together into clusters without having any preconceived ideas about the number of clusters or the labelings themselves.
