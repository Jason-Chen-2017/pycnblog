## What is urban mobility?
Urban mobility refers to the movement of people and goods between different locations within a city or metropolitan region. The core idea behind urban mobility is that human beings can move easily from one location to another using public transportation, bicycle sharing systems, or walking paths. These mobilities have an impact on various socioeconomic aspects such as traffic congestion, air pollution, noise, and health effects due to vehicular emissions. Thus, it is essential for cities to consider urban mobility planning as part of their strategies to address these problems.

## Why do we need to model urban mobility?
Urban mobility planning involves several critical decision-making processes where decisions must take into account numerous factors including availability of infrastructure, costs associated with transportation modes, access to public transit services, pedestrian safety, etc. With accurate modeling of urban mobility patterns, cities can identify areas in which they may face bottlenecks and develop strategies to overcome them. Moreover, by studying and understanding urban mobility behavior, researchers can design new applications, products, and services that enhance user experience and improve various economic outcomes. Finally, models help governments make better policy decisions related to transportation infrastructure investment, funding, regulation, and management.

## How does urban mobility modeling work?
Urban mobility modelling typically includes four main steps: data collection, preprocessing, optimization problem formulation, and solution analysis. During the first step, relevant data are collected, preprocessed, and analyzed to extract key insights. Next, an optimization problem is formulated based on these insights to generate specific plans. A wide range of mathematical techniques, algorithms, and programming languages can be used to solve this optimization problem. Once the solution is obtained, various analyses can be performed to validate the quality of the plan and identify potential bottlenecks and conflicts.

In order to effectively model urban mobility behavior, there are several important concepts and principles that should be kept in mind. Firstly, stakeholders and end users must understand how urban mobility affects various socioeconomic aspects and contribute to developing realistic scenarios to capture these trends. Secondly, mobile phone data can provide valuable insights into pedestrian behavior and trip characteristics. Thirdly, stochastic approaches, simulation-based methods, and agent-based models can provide more reliable and predictable results compared to deterministic approaches. Fourthly, an iterative approach can be adopted to ensure that the modeled results remain accurate even after modifications and updates.

Overall, urban mobility modeling plays a crucial role in managing transportation infrastructure, improving mobility options, and enhancing economic performance. It requires advanced skills in data mining, optimization, and simulation, among others. Nevertheless, it is a complex topic that requires significant expertise and resources to achieve satisfactory results. In this article, I will discuss some fundamental concepts and principles underlying urban mobility modeling along with an application of stochastic programming techniques for realistic scenario generation and optimization of urban mobility patterns.

## Conceptual Overview
### Types of Mobility Behavior
The term'mobility' usually refers to two different things depending on the context. On one hand, it refers to the concept of physical activity involved in moving around, whereas on the other hand, it also incorporates social activities like shopping, dining out, hiking, watching movies, playing games, etc., and non-physical benefits like attending events, visiting relatives, or participating in community meetings. Therefore, it's important to distinguish between different types of mobility behaviors to properly analyze and model urban mobility patterns. We can classify urban mobility behavior into six categories:

1. Transit travel: Includes all forms of public transportation including bus, train, trolley, and ferry travel. This category includes both intra-city commuting and inter-city operations like railway and suburban rail system connections. 

2. Personal automobile travel: This includes driving alone, taking private cars, and parking lots/garages. Other forms of personal automobile travel include scooter-sharing platforms, mopeds, and electric car charging stations.  

3. Bicycle travel: This includes shared bicycles, single-ride trips, bike lanes, and cycle routes. Other forms of bicycling include pedal biking, skateboarding, and wheelchair-accessible bikes. 

4. Walking: This category comprises regular walking (e.g., daily life) and leisure walking (e.g., recreational pursuits). Non-motorized transportation options such as swimming pools or dog sledding are considered walks too.  

5. Commuter travel: This refers to tourists who use public transportation outside of peak hours to commute home. It can involve multiple modes of transportation such as carpooling, taxi stand pickup, and buses.  

6. Public transportation demand management: This involves allocating limited vehicle capacity for each route to reduce traffic congestion. Demand response programs and smart card technology can be leveraged to optimize ridership levels across multiple lines.  

### Cities as Dynamic Systems
Cities are dynamic systems whose components interact with each other and exhibit temporal and spatial dynamics that affect mobility behavior and outcomes. Transportation networks, land use patterns, population density, demographics, housing markets, business opportunities, and policies affect mobility behavior and mobility outcomes. All these variables interact with each other through transportation infrastructure, traffic flow, land use, and routing decision making mechanisms. Hence, it becomes very difficult to accurately model individual agents without considering the interactions and feedback loops that emerge between them. To model city-scale mobility behavior, we need to aggregate information from various sources and integrate them into a comprehensive picture to gain a global view of urban mobility behavior.

## Stochastic Programming Approach
Stochastic Programming (SP) is a powerful technique for solving large-scale optimization problems subject to uncertainty and imperfect information. SP enables us to build robust and optimal solutions while at the same time handling uncertainties and imprecision arising from incomplete information and misperceptions. The general framework of SP involves three basic components: decision variables, constraints, and objective function. Decision variables represent the unknown quantities that need to be optimized and constrained by the available information. Constraints describe the limitations and conditions placed upon the decision variables. Objective functions specify the goal that needs to be achieved by selecting values for the decision variables. Uncertainty and imprecision can be handled implicitly or explicitly via appropriate parameterizations or distributions. The output of the optimization process is a probability distribution over possible solutions that reflects our beliefs about the most likely outcome given the available information and assumptions made about randomness. By exploring different combinations of parameters, we can derive credible regions that can guide decision making and inform future decisions and actions. 

One common example of using SP for urban mobility modeling is the Ride-Sharing Problem, which aims to minimize the total travel cost for drivers during rideshares offered by public transportation companies. The optimization problem involves finding the best set of driver-vehicle assignments to minimize the total cost incurred by each driver while simultaneously satisfying certain demand constraints, e.g., minimizing idle times and meeting deadlines. However, the presence of externality can cause complications when optimizing ride-sharing systems since providers could potentially profit from their service by charging higher fares for shorter waiting times. Therefore, the ride-sharing problem is often framed as a mixed-integer nonlinear program with additional constraints regarding fairness and equity.

Another widely used approach for addressing the complexity and variability of mobility systems is Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), which uses simulations of interacting entities to simulate and predict mobility behavior. The ABM approach treats each entity (e.g., passenger, driver, or vehicle) as an autonomous agent and simulates its movements, interaction with other agents, and consumption of fuel and energy. By running simulations over a large number of iterations, we can collect empirical data on the observed behavior of the system and identify systematic patterns and inequities that might not be visible in traditional static models. Despite its versatility, ABM has been shown to be computationally intensive and less suitable for small-scale mobility modeling tasks. Nonetheless, ABM offers promising avenues for developing advanced tools for mobility analysis and prediction.
