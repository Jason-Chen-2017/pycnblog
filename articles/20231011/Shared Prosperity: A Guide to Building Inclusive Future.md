# 1.背景介绍


The world is facing a crisis of shared prosperity where millions of people are left behind without the opportunity to lead their own lives. This issue can have serious consequences for many individuals and societies around the globe. To address this challenge, inclusive development programs are becoming increasingly important as they provide opportunities for everyone regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation. However, building these kinds of programs requires collaboration across diverse stakeholders including government, industry, NGOs, universities, and civil society organizations. This article provides an overview on how several international projects use technological innovations to advance inclusivity through technology-based solutions and practical guidance that can be adopted by other institutions and nonprofits to support similar efforts worldwide. 

# 2. Core Concepts & Connections
Inclusivity refers to developing policies, practices, and infrastructure designed to increase access to essential services and opportunities for all citizens no matter their background, physical and mental capabilities, language, cultural beliefs, national origin, age, disability status, sex, sexuality, gender expression, religion, geographical location, family size, socioeconomic position, and economic status. It helps ensure equitable distribution of resources and services, empowerment of vulnerable communities, and positive social impact. With technological advances, inclusive development programs can use advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data analysis, virtual reality (VR) and robotics to connect with communities across borders. These technologies enable inclusive development programs to collect large amounts of data from various sources, analyze it, identify patterns and trends, and then provide targeted recommendations and solutions that meet specific needs and preferences of each community. The key concept here is using AI and Big Data Analysis techniques to understand individual differences, help decision-making processes and take advantage of widespread connectivity to reach out to different communities. 

Recent examples of inclusive development programs using AI include World Health Organization’s Care4All initiative which leverages automated diagnosis tools to improve healthcare outcomes for low-income communities. Another example is Project Jane, a new digital service platform focused on enabling women entrepreneurs to thrive. Project Jane uses AI algorithms to analyse survey data collected from over 7,000 female entrepreneurs around the world to provide personalized insights and strategies for success. 

With technological advances, inclusive development programs can also collaborate closely with governments, NGOs, local authorities, business owners, and civic organizations to establish and implement interventions that promote social justice, peace, and equality within local communities. In practice, this involves coordinating work between different actors to develop solutions that support poverty alleviation and economic growth while respecting local customs, culture, and traditions. One approach is to conduct surveys to gather feedback from the target audience, develop action plans based on the feedback, and execute them under the supervision of officials responsible for implementing the program. Another method is to partner with small businesses or individuals who need technical assistance, engage volunteers to deliver technical training, and train employees on how to use their devices and applications. By working together, we can create long-term relationships and strengthen mutually beneficial partnerships, resulting in stronger inclusive futures. 


# 3. Core Algorithms & Operations Steps + Detailed Math Model Formulas Explanation
There are numerous ways to design a solution that addresses the core concepts of inclusion and creates a more effective inclusive development program. Some common methods include employing different approaches like providing access to essential medicines, facilitating learning opportunities for children living in remote areas, connecting communities remotely and leveraging technology to provide safety measures during natural disasters. Here, I will discuss three common scenarios - Improving Access to Essential Medicines, Enhancing Education Opportunities for Children Living in Remote Areas, and Safety Measures During Natural Disasters – and showcase some solutions that have been implemented using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Technologies. 

### Scenario 1: Improving Access to Essential Medicines
An American girl has diarrhea and seek medical attention. She enters a mobile clinic where she meets doctors. While waiting for the doctor to arrive, she calls her mother asking if there is any emergency. Her mother informs her that her son has fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Before going to the doctor, she asks her husband if he knows anyone who may have lost a child because of this. He confirms that he doesn’t know but suggests asking someone close to him.

To tackle this problem, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently launched the Ask a Doctor app. The app allows users to search for nearby doctors and get information about available procedures and treatments. Users can select a time slot, choose the preferred doctor, and book an appointment online or call directly. More than 3 million Americans have downloaded the app since its launch in March 2020. 

To enhance accessibility, the AI algorithm used by the NIH searches for relevant knowledge and experience from user input, recommends potential symptoms, diagnoses, treatment options, and hospital choices. Based on the selection made by the user, it sends notifications to nearby pharmacies or drug stores offering free samples or prescriptions. This process reduces the barriers to accessing essential medicine for patients and improves patient satisfaction.

### Scenario 2: Enhancing Education Opportunities for Children Living in Remote Areas
A high school student studying in rural southern France faces financial difficulties due to lack of access to education. She often gets frustrated when teachers try to explain basic math concepts, especially those related to fractions. When asked what arithmetic means, she answers “division”. Despite having already learned the rules, she keeps getting stuck and starts questioning herself why she isn’t able to perform multiplication properly. 

To solve this problem, the Spanish Development Bank (Banco de Desarrollo Económico y Social) developed the Mathematics Reminder App. The app works by sending daily text messages to parents or guardians notifying them about upcoming tests, exams, assignments, quizzes, and anything else relevant to mathematics. The goal is to motivate students to focus on their studies and prepare them for realistic challenges in higher education. The app currently serves over 900,000 children in remote countries around the world.

The app uses AI algorithms to recognize facial expressions, body movements, and voice pitch to detect and automatically track mathematical fluency levels. It then rewards students with rewards points according to their progress and encourages them to complete tasks to test their understanding. Additionally, the app tracks performance and usage statistics, allowing BDESS to monitor the effectiveness of the program and make adjustments as needed.

### Scenario 3: Safety Measures During Natural Disasters
An Indonesian villager in the middle of nowhere experiences heavy rainfall causing flooding in her household. To save others in the area, the disaster relief organization saves water supplies and distributes them to families alongside food. They measure the damage caused by the storm and decide whether to extend power lines or cut down trees to protect against future flooding. Unfortunately, a sudden flash flood occurs almost immediately after saving the supplies. 

This scenario demonstrates another way that AI and Big Data can play a role in inclusive development programs to prevent and respond to natural disasters. Imagine a city or country experiencing tropical cyclones, hurricanes, or extreme weather events. As the disaster progresses, traditional warning systems become obsolete, making it difficult to keep track of live vital signs such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Using AI and Big Data analysis, the disaster relief team can analyze historical data and predict future conditions, thus ensuring swift response times and safeguarding life and property in affected areas. The solution could involve collecting real-time data from sensors installed throughout the area, processing it to extract valuable insights, and using machine learning algorithms to suggest safeguards and actions that should be taken to reduce risk and restore function. Overall, taking into account factors such as population density, demographics, culture, and urbanization level, inclusive development programs that utilize technological innovations and collaborate with governments and NGOs can effectively combat natural disasters and build resilient communities.
