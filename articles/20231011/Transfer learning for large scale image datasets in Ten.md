# 1.背景介绍


Transfer learning is a popular technique that allows the training of deep neural networks on small datasets by leveraging knowledge gained from larger datasets. With transfer learning, we can achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging tasks with minimal training data and compute resources, which makes it easier to adapt these models to different domains or applications.

In this article, I will present an overview of how transfer learning works in computer vision, and then explain its implementation using Tensorflow library. Specifically, we will learn about feature extraction techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Networks, and how they are used for transfer learning. We will also see how fine tuning improves the performance of our models on target task and discuss some of the challenges involved in applying transfer learning effectively.

I assume readers have basic understanding of machine learning concepts like deep neural networks, convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, loss functions, activation functions etc., but do not require any prior experience in using deep learning libraries like Tensorflow. If you need refresher materials, please refer to other resources available online.

## Introduction: What is transfer learning?
In brief, transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is fine tuned on a new dataset, rather than training the entire network from scratch. This involves taking advantage of the patterns learned from the existing model while still training the last few layers of the model on the new dataset. The goal is to leverage the knowledge gained from the pre-trained model to improve generalization performance on the new dataset.

For instance, if we want to train a model to recognize cars in images, we can use a CNN trained on ImageNet dataset. In this case, the weights of the first layer of the model will be mostly learned from the features found in ImageNet dataset. However, when we apply transfer learning to another domain, say, flowers, we may find that some of the learned features could still be relevant to recognizing cars. So instead of starting fresh and retraining all the parameters of the model from scratch, we can just fine tune the top few layers of the model on the flower dataset, leaving the earlier layers intact.


In summary, transfer learning involves leveraging the knowledge learned from one problem to solve another related problem. By doing so, we can save time and computational resources needed to develop new models, and achieve better accuracy compared to training them from scratch.

## Key Concepts and Terminology
### Feature Extraction Techniques 
Feature extraction techniques involve transforming raw input into low dimensional representations that contain information useful for classification. These include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Residual Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 

#### CNNs
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and finally ends with fully connected layers for output prediction. Each convolutional layer applies filters to extract local features, typically across several spatial dimensions such as width and height. Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the representation produced by each convolutional layer, reducing the amount of computation required during backpropagation. The combination of these layers results in rich feature maps that capture complex relationships between objects in the input image.

One common application of CNNs is object recognition, where the goal is to predict the class label of an image based on its content. Here's an example architecture for a CNN that takes in grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, consisting of two convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers for output prediction:


#### Residual Networks
Residual Networks, also known as ResNets, were introduced in 2015 by Kaiming He et al. They consist of stacked residual blocks, where each block contains two convolutional layers and a shortcut connection that skips over one or more layers. The key idea behind ResNets is that learning residual connections allows for deeper models that can potentially converge much faster than traditional architectures. A famous quote attributed to ResNets reads: "The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step."

Here's an example architecture for a ResNet-50 model:


#### GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were proposed by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014. They consist of two competing neural networks, a generator and discriminator, that work together to generate fake samples that look real to the discriminator and discriminate between real and generated samples. GANs have been shown to produce high quality outputs in many fields including image synthesis and video generation.

An example architecture for a GAN that generates handwritten digits could look something like this:


### Fine Tuning
Fine tuning refers to adjusting the weights of the last few layers of a pre-trained model on a new dataset, leaving the earlier layers intact. The purpose is to add additional knowledge obtained from the original dataset to the final set of weights, improving their ability to perform well on the new dataset. This differs from regular training, where we would start the process from scratch, and aims to preserve the original performance of the model on the old dataset.
