# 1.背景介绍


As an application developer, I want to display custom error pages when certain exceptions occur during the execution of my web application so that it looks and behaves better than a default error page provided by Flask or any other framework. To achieve this goal, we need to understand how Flask works with exception handling, create our own custom error pages using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, integrate these custom error pages into our Flask application code and test them thoroughly before deployment. In this article, we will go through the steps involved in creating custom error pages for Flask applications from scratch, step-by-step. We will also cover some advanced topics such as integrating CSRF protection mechanisms into our custom error pages and monitoring our server logs to detect and fix errors faster.

Before we begin writing our blog post, let's recap some important concepts that are related to Flask.

1.Flask: Flask is a micro web development framework written in Python. It provides functionality like routing, templating, request dispatching, authentication, sessions management, and many more. The core principle behind Flask is that it does not make any assumptions about what you're doing and allows you to work seamlessly with different programming languages and tools. 

2.Request Handling: Every time your browser sends a request to the server, Flask receives it and handles it according to its configured routes. When a user visits a particular URL on your website, Flask processes it accordingly and responds back with a response generated by your application. This happens through several stages - first, Flask dispatches the request to a specific function based on the route rule defined. Then, Flask performs input validation, argument parsing, etc., based on the configuration specified for that function. Finally, the function returns a response object which contains the data that needs to be sent to the client.

3.Exception Handling: As mentioned earlier, Flask has built-in support for exception handling. If there is any error while processing a request (such as a division by zero error), Flask catches the exception and generates a default error message instead of crashing. You can customize this behavior by defining custom error handlers for each type of exception. These functions respond to HTTP status codes indicating various types of errors, like 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, etc. 

Now, let's get started! We'll start with installing Flask and setting up a basic structure for our project. Once we have our environment set up, we can proceed to implement custom error pages in Flask.

# 2.Core Concepts & Architecture
## 2.1 Installing Flask 
First, we need to install Flask on our system. Installations vary depending on the operating system being used. Here are the commands for installation on Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade # Update packages list
sudo apt install python3-pip   # Install pip package manager
pip3 install flask             # Install Flask library
```

Once installed, verify the installation by running `flask --version` command in terminal. If everything went well, the output should look something like this:

```bash
Python 3.9.7 (default, Sep 16 2021, 13:09:58) [GCC 7.5.0] on linux
App 0.1 (/home/user/myproject/)
Flask 2.0.2
```

This means that we have successfully installed Flask on our machine and verified its version number.

## 2.2 Setting Up Our Project Directory Structure
Next, let's create a new directory called "error_pages" where we will store all our files related to custom error pages. Also, add two subdirectories named "static" and "templates". "Static" folder will contain static assets such as CSS, JavaScript files, images, etc. "Templates" folder will contain Jinja templates that will be used to render our error pages.

Our final project directory structure should look like this:

```
├── app.py
└── error_pages
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── static
    │   └── style.css
    └── templates
        ├── error.html
        └── csrf_token.html
```

Note that we have included "__init__.py" file in both root level and "error_pages" subdirectory. This is required for Python to recognize those directories as modules. Now, let's move onto implementing our first custom error page.

## 2.3 Implementing Custom Error Page in Flask
In this section, we will see how to create a simple custom error page in Flask. Let's assume that we want to create an error page for the case when a user tries to access a nonexistent resource. 

### Step 1: Create A Route For The Nonexistent Resource

To trigger the custom error page, we will create a route for a nonexistent resource such as "/nonexistent". Add the following line at the end of your "app.py" file to define this route:

```python
@app.route('/nonexistent')
def nonexistent():
    return 'The requested page was not found.', 404
```

Here, "@app.route()" decorator binds this function to the given route pattern "/nonexistent". The function simply returns a string message along with the appropriate HTTP status code (404 - Not Found). Note that we have passed a comma after the string message without specifying an encoding. By default, Flask assumes that the content returned by the view function is encoded as UTF-8 if no charset parameter is explicitly provided. However, since we don't actually have any text content here, we can omit the comma.

### Step 2: Define Error Handler Function

Let's now define an error handler function that will handle all uncaught exceptions thrown by Flask due to invalid requests. Replace the contents of your "app.py" file with the following code to do this:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/nonexistent')
def nonexistent():
    return 'The requested page was not found.', 404


@app.errorhandler(404)
def page_not_found(e):
    return render_template('error.html', title='Page Not Found'), 404


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

We added a second route "/nonexistent", similar to the previous one but with a different response. Instead of returning a plain string, we now use Flask's "render_template()" function to load a template file ("error.html") located in our "templates" folder. This template file will contain the actual HTML content for our error page. We then pass additional parameters to this function via the "title" variable to populate dynamic elements within the HTML. Lastly, we register our custom error handler function using the "@app.errorhandler()" decorator. This function takes an integer representing the HTTP status code as an argument, and must return a tuple containing the rendered error page and the same status code. Since we already have a dedicated route for handling the 404 Not Found status code, we choose to map this error code to our newly created error handler function.

Finally, note that we removed the comma after the response string in our original implementation, because it caused Flask to treat it as a tuple rather than a single value. So we needed to include a trailing comma in order to indicate the HTTP status code separately.

### Step 3: Write Our Custom Error Template

Create a new file named "error.html" inside the "templates" folder and add the following HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>{{ title }}</title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      background-color: #f2f2f2;
      color: #333;
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
    }

   .container {
      max-width: 500px;
      width: 100%;
      margin: 0 auto;
      text-align: center;
      padding: 50px;
    }

    h1 {
      font-size: 3rem;
      margin-top: 0;
    }

    p {
      font-size: 1.5rem;
      margin-bottom: 2rem;
    }

    button {
      display: inline-block;
      border: none;
      outline: none;
      background-color: #4CAF50;
      color: white;
      cursor: pointer;
      font-size: 1.2rem;
      padding: 10px 20px;
      border-radius: 5px;
      transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
    }

    button:hover {
      background-color: #3e8e41;
    }

  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    {% if message %}
      <p>{{ message }}</p>
    {% endif %}
    <button onclick="window.history.back()">Go Back</button>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Here, we have defined a simple HTML document with a container div element that centers the content vertically and horizontally. We've also added some basic styling rules for the page layout and buttons. Note that we're using Jinja syntax for dynamically populating variables in our HTML, including the "title" variable that comes from our error handler function. Additionally, we're checking if a "message" variable is present in the context dictionary and displaying it if it exists. This way, we can provide additional information to the user in case they encounter a specific error condition.

That's it! Our Flask application now supports custom error pages when users try to access nonexistent resources. Next, we'll explore some advanced techniques for making our custom error pages more secure.
