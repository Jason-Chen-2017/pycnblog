## Forecasting Industry: The Time is Now! 
In the last decade there has been a massive growth in the forecasting industry. The advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized many traditional methods of predicting stock prices. The popularization of social media platforms like Twitter have also led to an explosion of data related to financial markets. Hence, it’s no surprise that nowadays people are looking towards neural networks for making accurate predictions on future stock market trends. 

Neural networks are powerful tools used for prediction tasks where complex relationships between variables need to be established. They can learn from a given set of training examples by analyzing them and adjusting their weights accordingly. This process helps the model understand patterns and dependencies among various factors affecting the target variable. Moreover, they can perform classification and regression tasks effectively thanks to their ability to adaptively tune the parameters through backpropagation algorithm. 

One of the most famous applications of deep neural networks in finance is the use of technical indicators as inputs to predict stock price movements. Technical analysis involves using various mathematical techniques to identify trends, cycles, or other features of a stock's movement over time. These indicators provide valuable insights into how a company operates and its strategy. In addition to these technical indicators, we can also include fundamental factors such as company valuation metrics, shareholder sentiments, and economic conditions to make more precise predictions.

However, before moving ahead with building a neural network for stock price prediction, let us briefly discuss some basic terminologies associated with the field of stock market prediction.

 ## Terminologies
### Input Features:
Input features refer to the different aspects or factors involved in the prediction task. These could include macroeconomic factors such as GDP, inflation rates, interest rates, unemployment rates, consumer spending, trade volume, etc., as well as fundamental factors such as company earnings per share (EPS), analyst ratings, share price history, dividends paid out, etc. Input features often vary depending on the complexity of the problem being solved. For example, if one needs to accurately predict the direction of the stock market based solely on macroeconomic factors, then only those input features would suffice. However, if a strong degree of uncertainty exists due to several underlying factors, additional input features may become necessary.

### Output Variable:
The output variable refers to the dependent variable that needs to be predicted. It could be either the next day opening price of a stock, its closing price, its volume, or any other relevant metric. Unlike input features, which define the context in which the stock will move, the output variable defines what actually happens after the initial buy-and-hold decision is made. Thus, accuracy in predicting the correct value of the output variable determines whether a successful investment can be made.

### Training Data:
Training data is a collection of input/output pairs used by the model during the training phase. The objective of this stage is to teach the model about the relationship between the input and output variables by feeding it a sufficient number of samples that capture all possible variations in the reality. Additionally, random noise added to each feature helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization performance. For instance, if the dataset consists of daily historical prices and volumes for multiple companies, a portion of the data may contain outliers or abnormal values, which might not represent the actual behavior of the system under study. By adding noise to the input features, we can avoid the potential issues associated with overfitting the model to these irrelevant characteristics.

### Testing Data:
Testing data is a subset of the training data that was not seen during training. After the model is trained, it is evaluated on this testing data to measure its performance. Ideally, the evaluation should show an improvement over the baseline, which indicates that the model is able to correctly infer the future stock price movements. If the testing score remains consistent even after fine-tuning hyperparameters, then we can say that the model is robust enough to handle new scenarios without drastic changes in performance. Otherwise, further improvements may be needed.
