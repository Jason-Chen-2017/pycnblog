# 1.背景介绍


Deep Learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning by enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It allows us to build sophisticated models that can identify patterns in large and complex datasets quickly and accurately. The ability to create powerful AI systems is one of the biggest benefits of deep learning technology today. However, many newcomers are having a hard time getting started with deep learning because it requires expertise in programming and mathematical concepts. In this article, we will help you get started with deep learning using PyTorch — an open-source deep learning framework created by Facebook, Google, and others. 

# 2.核心概念与联系
Before diving into how to use PyTorch, let’s understand some core concepts and terms used commonly in deep learning.

1) Datasets - A dataset is a collection of labeled or unlabeled data samples used to train, validate, or test a model. Examples include images, texts, audio, and video files. 

2) Neural Networks - A neural network (NN) is a mathematical function that maps input data to output predictions. NN architectures typically consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, each representing a mathematical operation such as addition, multiplication, activation functions, etc. Each layer learns to extract features from the input data and then pass them on to subsequent layers. This process continues until the final output prediction is made. 

3) Loss Function - A loss function measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual value during training. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), cross entropy, and binary cross entropy. The goal of training is to minimize the loss over all data samples while ensuring accurate predictions.

4) Backpropagation - Backpropagation is the algorithm used to adjust the weights of a neural network based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights. During backpropagation, the gradients flow backwards through the network, updating the weights based on the local slope of the loss function.

Now let's dive deeper into what actually happens when we run a simple deep learning task using PyTorch. We'll be building a linear regression model using the Boston housing price dataset provided by scikit-learn. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Import necessary libraries
We first need to import the necessary libraries like torch and numpy which are required to implement our Linear Regression Model. If you don't have these libraries installed, please install them before running the code. 

```python
import torch
import numpy as np 
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

Step 2: Load the Dataset
Next, we will load the Boston Housing Price dataset provided by Scikit-Learn library and split it into training and testing sets. 

```python
data = load_boston() # loading the boston dataset from sklearn
X = data['data'] # X contains the features
y = data['target'] # y contains the target values
```
Step 3: Splitting the dataset into Train and Test Sets
We will now divide the dataset into two parts: Training Set(80%) and Testing Set(20%). 

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)  
```

Step 4: Scaling the Features
Feature scaling is important because various algorithms behave differently when the features are on different scales. So we need to scale our feature set so that they have similar ranges. For example, if there are features with range [0, 1], then the range of another feature could be much larger than 1 but still within the same range. Therefore, we should standardize the features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. 

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()   
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)  
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)    
```

Step 5: Creating the Model
The next step would be to define our neural network architecture which includes the number of hidden layers, size of each layer, activation functions, and regularization techniques. Here, we will be implementing a linear regression model. The general formula for a linear regression model is given by:


Here, θ represents the parameters of our model which we want to learn during training. By minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS) cost function with respect to our parameters θ, we hope to find optimal values for those parameters. Here, μ is the mean of the dependent variable y and σ^2 is its variance.  

To implement a linear regression model using PyTorch, we simply create a class called 'LinearRegressionModel' and initialize the class variables with appropriate values. Our forward method implements the above equation for calculating the predicted value.  

```python
class LinearRegressionModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()  

        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)
```

Step 6: Implementing Gradient Descent Algorithm
After defining our model, we need to specify our optimization strategy i.e., the Gradient Descent algorithm. In order to do that, we need to calculate the loss and update the weights of our model using the gradients obtained from backpropagation. 

The loss function calculates the error between the predicted and actual values. The objective of our model is to minimize this loss function to obtain the best possible fit line. In this case, we will be using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as our loss function since it is commonly used in regression problems. MSE calculates the square of the differences between the predicted and actual values. 

In order to update the weights of our model, we will use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. SGD updates the weight vector in the direction of negative gradient at each iteration. The magnitude of the gradient update decreases with each iteration due to the decay parameter. After several iterations, the minimum point of the cost function will be reached and the optimal weights learned. 

Here, we also introduce a momentum term which helps accelerate convergence towards the minimum point of the cost function. Momentum accumulates previous updates in a temporary memory and uses that information to update the weights more efficiently. 

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9) # Defining the optimizer

loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss() # Define the loss function as MSE

epochs = 1000 # Setting the number of epochs

for epoch in range(epochs):
    inputs = Variable(torch.FloatTensor(X_train))
    labels = Variable(torch.FloatTensor(y_train))

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1)%100 == 0:
       print('Epoch [{}/{}], Loss: {:.4f}'.format(epoch+1, epochs, loss.item()))
    
print("Training completed!")
```

Step 7: Evaluate the Model Performance
Finally, after training our model, we will evaluate its performance on both the training and testing sets. Since we are dealing with regression problem, we will measure the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) which tells us the average distance between the predicted and actual values. RMSE is calculated as follows: 

RMSE = √[∑(predicted - actual)^2 / N]

where N is the total number of observations. 

```python
with torch.no_grad():
  inputs = Variable(torch.FloatTensor(X_train))
  labels = Variable(torch.FloatTensor(y_train))

  preds_train = model(inputs)
  rmse_train = np.sqrt(np.mean((preds_train.detach().numpy()-y_train)**2))
  
  inputs = Variable(torch.FloatTensor(X_test))
  labels = Variable(torch.FloatTensor(y_test))

  preds_test = model(inputs)
  rmse_test = np.sqrt(np.mean((preds_test.detach().numpy()-y_test)**2))
  
print('Train RMS :', round(rmse_train, 4))
print('Test RMS :', round(rmse_test, 4))
```

That's it! You just implemented a simple linear regression model using PyTorch. Hopefully, this gives you a good starting point for your journey in deep learning using PyTorch.
