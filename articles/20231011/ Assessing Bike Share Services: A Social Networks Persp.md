## Overview of Bike Sharing Systems in the United States and Canada
In the past decade, bicycle sharing systems have emerged as a significant source of revenue for urban commuters and tourists alike. These systems offer users access to bikes that they can borrow or rent overnight at a variety of locations across the country, with minimal interference from infrastructure or other factors such as traffic congestion. Bike share services are widely accepted as an effective way to reduce traffic congestion and improve mobility on city streets. However, little research has been conducted to understand how social networks influence bike sharing usage and the effectiveness of these systems in terms of satisfaction, engagement, and overall quality of service (QoS). This paper aims to provide insights into this important aspect by analyzing real-world data from two prominent bike share platforms, Citi Bike and Divvy, focusing on their unique features and challenges related to social networking. 

The following is a brief overview of the bike share systems in both countries and how they operate.
### Citi Bike
Citi Bike is one of the most popular bike share services offered in the US. It is owned by BCycle, a bike rental company based in New York City. In March 2019, it added support for the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform which allows users to contribute new bike stations to the system without needing to pay any additional fees. The first three months of operation were free for members who had used the system beforehand. Users can opt in to receive push notifications when a station becomes available within a certain distance radius. 

Apart from providing bikes, Citi Bike also offers subscriptions packages designed to encourage long-term memberships and increased use during busy periods. The basic subscription package includes unlimited monthly passes for all trips, while more advanced plans include additional benefits like discounts and priority holds for critical times of year. Additionally, there are special tiers designed specifically for residents of elderly families with reduced rates and limits. Overall, Citi Bike provides a large user base and good value proposition.

### Divvy
Divvy is another well-known bike share program in California. It was founded in 2007 by John Hopkins University students, led by Professor <NAME>, who wanted to create a better transportation option than taxis. Since then, the company has grown exponentially, becoming the largest provider of bike sharing in the state of California. 

To join the Divvy network, users need to register through an online portal and provide some personal information such as age, gender, income level, etc., along with their location preferences. Once registered, users can browse through a list of available bike stations and select the ones that fit their needs. They can then book a bike or unlock a dock to start riding. 

Divvy’s pricing model involves fixed fare rates for different types of rides, including short-term trips up to 10 minutes or longer, long-term trips of several days or weeks, electric bikes, and ride sharing programs. There are no minimum commitments required, but users are encouraged to make recurring payments to avoid late fees. The system offers loyalty programs for returning riders who have stayed for extended periods of time. Additionally, Divvy employs community partners who provide discounted fares and incentives for groups of riders to promote social behavior.

Overall, both Citi Bike and Divvy provide solid financial models and appealing customer experiences, making them attractive to both casual riders and seasoned professionals looking to save money or get around town. However, they have their own unique challenges associated with incorporating social media into their business models and increasing revenue streams derived from bike sharing transactions. This study will provide insight into what factors drive social media engagement and bike sharing usage among bike share users in each market segment, identify opportunities for future research and development, and offer practical recommendations to move forward towards improved bike sharing services for communities across America and Canada.
