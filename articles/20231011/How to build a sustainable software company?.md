# 1.背景介绍


Sustainability refers to the ability of a system or product to persist in its original state over time and continue working as designed after environmental changes such as weather, natural disasters, pollution, etc. It is essential for all businesses to develop sustainable solutions that can withstand extreme conditions that could cause them to fail or cease functioning.

Sustainability is vital for organizations in many ways including economic growth, employment opportunities, public trust, environmental impact reduction, reduced carbon footprint, and increased competitiveness. 

In this article, we will explore some important principles and techniques used by successful companies to create sustainable products and services. We will look at examples from various industries such as finance, healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, energy and agriculture.

# 2. Core concepts and connections
## Sustainability Policy & Standards
The first principle of building sustainable software companies is having an organization-wide policy and standards around sustainability. This includes setting guidelines on what constitutes “sustainable” design, creating awareness campaigns, communicating and promoting positive social and behavioral changes within the organization, and establishing internal mechanisms for measuring and monitoring performance against sustainability targets.

For example: The World Bank has developed an action plan for sustainable development goals (SDGs) which sets out the responsibilities and obligations of governments, organizations, individuals and communities engaged in responsible global development. It also lays out specific actions and objectives to achieve these goals through prevention, mitigation, adaptation and rehabilitation.

Another example: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) advocates for developing countries to invest in renewable energy generation and utilization. They provide technical guidance, tools and best practices, and support programs and networks for developing countries to implement their policies and measures related to greenhouse gas emissions.

## Continuous Improvement
A critical aspect of being sustainable is continuous improvement. Teams must be able to identify issues with existing processes or products and take steps to improve them. This requires investing resources into learning new technologies, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing systems to reduce waste and maximize output.

Organizations should conduct regular audits to assess how well they are meeting their sustainability targets and devise strategies to continually improve. A robust measurement approach is key to track progress and measure results across multiple dimensions such as efficiency, quality, cost, and material usage. 

Here's an example scenario: Suppose your company sells shoes online and you want to ensure that your inventory management system is efficient and effective so that it doesn't run out of stock quickly due to low demand. You might consider implementing an automated purchase order fulfillment process using robotics to increase efficiencies and save costs. To test the effectiveness of the new process, you would need to generate sufficient sales data to demonstrate significant improvements in inventory turnover rates.

## Reduced Carbon Footprints
One way to measure the effectiveness of reducing carbon footprints is to compare CO2 equivalent emissions before and after implementation of a sustainable solution. By tracking both quantities and sources of emissions, you can see whether the effort is effective and achieving desired outcomes. Additionally, you may wish to integrate sustainability metrics into supply chain planning to account for any losses incurred during shipping or storage.

For example, one industry where there have been significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions include aviation. Since most flights depart and arrive near the equator, the amount of heat generated near the poles tends to decrease, resulting in lower overall temperatures. As a result, airplanes can operate more efficiently than previous models while still maintaining a low CO2 footprint. Similarly, fossil fuel vehicles such as cars, trucks, and buses are contributing significantly to climate change and can benefit from more sustainable options like electric and hybrid vehicles.

## Social Good
To help companies reach greater levels of sustainability, organizations can align their mission with social good objectives. Building on the work of other technology entrepreneurs who have demonstrated passion and commitment towards solving social problems, organizations can partner with nonprofits, volunteer groups, and individual activists to achieve long-term change through better education, infrastructure, and jobs. In doing so, organizations can contribute to solving issues that affect us all, such as addressing food insecurity, ending hunger, improving water quality, reducing poverty, fighting disease epidemics, and saving biodiversity.
