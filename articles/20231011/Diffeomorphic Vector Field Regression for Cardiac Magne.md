# 1.背景介绍

Cardiac MR imaging is widely used in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) based cardiac diagnosis and treatment. The accuracy of CMR-based medical image analysis has been increasingly attracting research interests recently. One crucial issue to be addressed is the motion distortion problem due to large intra- and inter-slice motion variations induced by varying heart beat intervals or flow conditions during dynamic cardiac excitation pulse sequences. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel diffeomorphic vector field regression approach for cardiac MR imaging that can accurately estimate both slice-wise and volumetric displacement fields without compromising spatial resolution and image quality. In this paper, we first provide an overview of related works on differeomorphic techniques for MRI registration and use it as a guidance to motivate our proposed methodology. We then describe the mathematical formulation of our proposed method using a finite difference discretization scheme with a small step size to achieve tractable computational complexity. Finally, we demonstrate its applicability through numerical experiments on synthetic data and clinical data sets. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, robustness, and speed compared to classic registration methods while maintaining high spatial resolution and image quality.
# 2.核心概念与联系We will begin by defining some fundamental concepts and terminologies relevant to understanding our proposed methodology:

Differeomorphic transformation: A diffeomorphism is a smooth deformation between two differentiable manifolds in phase space. It preserves distances, angles, areas, etc., under local deformations, but not globally. By contrast, a diffeomorphic transformation can preserve the global shape and topology of a structure subject to local changes.

Diffeomorphic map: Given a time t and a set of control points x, y(t), z(t), representing the position of objects in three dimensions across multiple slices/images, a diffeomorphic map defines a mapping T(x,y(t),z(t)) -> P, where P represents the corresponding positions of objects after applying a transformation at time t.

Forward model: Forward modeling involves solving partial differential equations (PDEs) such as the Navier-Stokes equation or Laplace equation that represent the transportation of chemical species in solids or fluids. In our context, forward models define how a given displacement field transforms an input image from one space to another according to some underlying physical laws.

Registration algorithm: Registration algorithms are commonly used to align images of the same object taken from different viewpoints, sensors, or times. They take into account various factors like geometric transformations, appearance differences, lighting differences, among others, to produce accurate alignment of the images. 

Reconstruction algorithm: Reconstruction algorithms also known as image synthesis techniques are used to reconstruct missing parts of an incomplete image. Here, they exploit prior knowledge about the distribution of density values or probability distributions within the domain to fill in the blanks in the reconstruction process.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解The main idea behind our proposed method is to leverage the geometry priors encoded in the movement of blood vessels to perform a piecewise-affine transformation of the image intensity function. Specifically, we aim to register pairs of images together to obtain a vector field function F(i,j,k,l,t) that describes the displacement of each voxel relative to the nearest neighbor. This vector field provides us with a prior on the magnitude and direction of the elastic deformation, which enables us to regain lost detail, improve spatial coherence, and reduce noise levels.  

To address the motion distortion problem, we propose to apply the following steps:

1. Decompose the motion between adjacent slices into a translation component Tijkl and a stretch/rotation component Rijkl.
2. Use these components to generate an affine transformation matrix Aijkl(t). 
3. Apply the inverse mapping Aijkl^(-1)(i',j',k') to the displacement vectors along the jth slice in the ith direction (i=1,...,N, l=1,...,M), i.e., T_ij = A_ijlk^(-1)*T_ijkl*A_ijk'(t) + R_ijlk^(-1)*(F(i,j+1,k,l)-F(i,j,k,l)).
4. Interpolate the transformed displacement vectors from adjacent slices using trilinear interpolation, obtaining a new estimated displacement field F' = int_V dS_jk (T_ikl^(t-1) - T_jk'l^(t)), where V denotes the full image domain and S_jk is the surface patch defined by the pixels centered at k,l coordinates on the ith slice and extending towards the jth neighbor slice in the ith direction.
5. Compute the non-linear part of the predicted velocity field by applying a series of iterative regularization steps. We start by fixing the boundary condition of zero displacement at the boundaries of the domain. Then, we compute a smoothed version of the displacement field using Gaussian smoothing, followed by filtering using a Laplacian filter or a bilateral filter. Next, we apply a bias correction step, computing the mean squared error between the fixed and moving displaced shapes of the target image and the smoothed and filtered displacement fields. Finally, we optimize the parameters of the resulting transform using a gradient descent optimization algorithm.

Here's a detailed explanation of the above procedure: 

1. At each time point t, we compute the slice-to-slice displacement vectors using finite difference schemes with a small step size, which result in a sparse displacement field that preserves the longitudinal component of the motion between adjacent slices. Each entry in this displacement field corresponds to a pair of neighboring slices i and j in the image stack, represented by their indices (i,j). For example, let X_ijk^t represent the displacement of pixel at coordinate (i,j,k) at time point t, and let U_ijk^t be the corresponding unconstrained displacement field computed using a weighted sum of all pairwise displacement vectors obtained by integrating the Euclidean metric over the entire image domain. Then, we have

       |X_ijk^{t}| = sqrt(|U_ijk^{t}_x|^2 + |U_ijk^{t}_y|^2 + |U_ijk^{t}_z|^2)

    While this metric may not reflect the exact geometry present in the image stack, it does capture the general trend of similarities and differences across the volume.   

  
  
    
  The left hand side of the equation represents the true distance between the pixels at location (i,j,k) and (i+1,j,k), taking into account any additional warping caused by other nearby pixels that moved along with them. The right hand side is simply the norm of the unconstrained displacement vector U_ijk^t that corresponds to the displacement of pixel at location (i,j,k) at time point t. Since the Euclidean metric is a locally well-defined metric, this means that pixels that move closer to each other contribute more to the overall displacement than those that move farther apart. This property allows us to easily identify the most important features that contribute significantly to the apparent shape and motion of the image, and effectively discard the irrelevant details.  

  Once we have constructed this initial displacement field, we can use it as a starting point for further computations.


 


2. To convert this slice-to-slice displacement field into a volume-wide displacement field, we need to incorporate information from all pairs of adjacent slices in the image stack. However, since there exist large intra-and inter-slice variations induced by varying heart beat intervals or flow conditions during dynamic cardiac excitation pulse sequences, the motion between adjacent slices often cannot be perfectly aligned. Therefore, we need to handle the discrepancies between the pairwise movements before proceeding with the next steps. To do so, we introduce an affine transformation that maps each voxel to its correct position in the registered frame, assuming no deviations from the underlying mechanics of the medium that cause the staggered motion. Therefore, we seek a sequence of affine transformations that minimize the residual between the measured displacement fields and their respective predictions obtained from a piecewise linear approximation.

To accomplish this, we use the translations and rotations obtained earlier to generate a sequence of affine transformations A_ijlk(t), where A_ijlk represents the affine transformation that maps the position of voxel at index (i,j,k) in the original image stack to the position (i',j',k') in the registered frame where i,j,k correspond to the current slice, l indicates the third dimension (typically indicating the slice axis), and t indicates the time point. Formally, we have

     X_ijk^{t} = A_ijlk(t) * U_ijk^t          (1)

    where the asterisk (*) denotes element-wise multiplication of matrices. Using Eq.(1), we can write down a system of N equations and M unknown variables, which correspond to finding the optimal values of A_ijlk(t) for all possible triplets of slices (i,j,k) and time points t. These equations can be solved efficiently using conjugate gradient optimization algorithms.

Once we have generated this complete set of affine transformations, we can use them to predict the corresponding displacement field in the registered frame. Instead of directly interpolating between the pairs of neighboring slices, we now need to interpolate between the transformed displacement vectors using trilinear interpolation. Let S_ijk^l denote the cuboid region centered at pixel (i,j,k) in the ith slice and pointing away from the origin along the lth direction, and let S_jk'l^l' denote the corresponding region in the jth slice after being mapped to the registered frame using A_ijlk(t)^(-1) = [R_ijlk^(-1); T_ijlk^(-1)]^T. Then, we have

      F'_ijk^t = TrilinearInterpolate(F_ijk^l, F_jk'^l', alpha_{ij}, beta_{jl}, gamma_{kl})           (2)

where TrilinearInterpolate() is a bilinear interpolation routine that takes four neighbouring displacement vectors at grid locations {alpha_{ij},beta_{kl}} and returns the interpolated value at location (gamma_{kl}). This formula yields a dense prediction of the displacement field that covers the whole image domain without introducing any artifacts.

Now that we have obtained an improved displacement field, we can continue processing it to eliminate artifacts and enhance the accuracy of the final reconstruction. To do so, we follow a sequence of nonlinear refinement steps that include:

1. Smoothing the displacement field using Gaussian smoothing, to remove any remaining noise and impulse response effects.
2. Filtering the displacement field using a Laplacian filter or a bilateral filter, to attenuate high-frequency oscillations.
3. Bias correction, to adjust the estimates of the displacement field to better match the target image and its associated displacements.
4. Iteratively optimizing the parameters of the resulting transformation using gradient descent optimization, to minimize the loss function between the actual and predicted displacement fields.

Finally, once we have optimized the parameters of the final transformation, we can finally reconstruct the desired volumetric image using ray casting techniques. We can either project the displacement vectors onto a Cartesian grid, or directly sample the raw k-space measurements in the case of spin echo imaging.

# 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明To implement the core ideas described above, we need to write code that implements the necessary operations on tensors, including convolutional neural networks, tensor decompositions, image registration algorithms, sampling routines, and signal processing functions. Here are some pointers to get started:

1. Tensor decompositions: There are several popular tensor decomposition algorithms that can be used to extract lower-dimensional representations of the data, which can help simplify the subsequent tasks and improve the performance of the network. Popular choices include the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and CP (Canonical Polyadic) algorithms.

2. Image registration algorithms: Various image registration algorithms like Lucas-Kanade algorithm, SyN (symmetric normalization) algorithm, Demons algorithm, and ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) solver can be used to find the similarity transformation between two images. Some implementations of these algorithms can be found online, making it easy to integrate them into our pipeline.

3. Convolutional Neural Networks: CNNs have become an essential tool in modern computer vision systems, enabling efficient feature extraction, representation learning, and classification of visual patterns. We can train our own CNN architectures or use off-the-shelf libraries like Keras or PyTorch to build and train our models.

4. Sampling routines: Depending on the imaging modality, we may need to perform multi-resolution reconstruction using subsets of the image data. In such cases, we may need to perform separate sampling procedures at different resolutions. A popular choice for handling image undersampling is to use randomized masking.

5. Signal processing functions: In order to preprocess the input images, we typically perform various types of data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, shearing, and flipping to create diverse samples from the training dataset. We also need to normalize the input images to avoid vanishing gradients during backpropagation. Popular options include standardization and histogram equalization.
