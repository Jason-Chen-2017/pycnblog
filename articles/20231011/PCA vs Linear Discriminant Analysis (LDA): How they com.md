# 1.背景介绍


Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a statistical method used to determine the relationship between two or more sets of variables that may have some underlying relationships but are not fully specified by any single variable. It assumes that there exists some intrinsic dimensionality or "latent structure" in the data that can explain most of the variance among all observed samples, but that this latent structure is hidden from view through the observation of only a few of the variables. The LDA algorithm identifies which directions in the space spanned by these few variables contain most of the information about the data distribution, and it projects the full data set onto a smaller subspace containing just those directions. This projection reduces the dimensionality of the original problem while still retaining most of its most important features. 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), on the other hand, is a common technique for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data. In PCA, the goal is to identify the combination of independent variables that accounts for the largest portion of the variation in the data. PCA seeks to find a new set of uncorrelated variables that explains as much of the variability in the original dataset as possible without regard to the correlations between them. By transforming the data into a new coordinate system defined by these principal components, we can reduce the dimensionality of the original problem while losing less than half of the original information.

In practice, LDA and PCA are commonly used together as a preprocessing step before applying machine learning algorithms such as linear regression or decision trees. However, it's worth comparing their advantages and disadvantages because both techniques address different aspects of the same problem. Here, we'll explore how they work and when one technique might outperform the other depending on the nature of your dataset and application context.

## 2.1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is an approach for analyzing multivariate data consisting of possibly correlated variables that describe a large number of observed cases. The basic idea behind PCA is to identify the direction(s) along which the maximum amount of variance in the data is concentrated. These directions constitute what are known as principal components, and each principal component represents an axis along which there is greater covariance than would be expected under random chance.

The steps involved in performing PCA include:

1. Standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation
2. Compute the correlation matrix of the standardized data
3. Compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the correlation matrix
4. Choose the top k eigenvectors corresponding to the top k highest eigenvalues to form a matrix W of eigenvectors
5. Use W to transform the original data into a reduced set of dimensions

Once transformed, the data will have had significant loss of its original meaning. For example, if we start with a three-dimensional dataset where the x, y, and z axes correspond to height, weight, and age respectively, after running PCA we might end up with a new set of two principal components representing a new measurement called “BMI” based on our choice of units. We might also lose some sense of scale and relation between the original measurements, making interpretation difficult or impossible. Therefore, it’s usually necessary to visualize the results using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) or t-SNE to obtain an understanding of the structures in the data that remain after PCA has been applied.

## 2.2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, which is often used in classical statistics for classification problems. The main difference is that LDA applies to multiple linearly separable classes whereas Fisher's solution was restricted to two categories. LDA also uses the within-class scatter matrix rather than the population scatter matrix in Fisher's method.

The key intuition behind LDA is to maximize the distance between the means of the two populations being compared, assuming that the observations are normally distributed with zero mean and equal variances. Mathematically, LDA involves estimating the following parameters:

1. ΣW: the between-class scatter matrix
2. Σb: the within-class scatter matrices
3. Σbb^(-1/2): the inverse square root of the within-class covariances σ^2_i=Σbiσ^2_i*Σbi^T

where Wi are the transformation vectors that map the original data points to the new space spanned by the principal components. To perform LDA, we use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the values of these parameters given the training data X, Y, and labels y. Specifically, we minimize the negative log-likelihood function:

l = -log[P(X|Y=y)] + trace[(Σbb^(-1/2)Σbw)^T] / m

where P(X|Y=y) denotes the joint probability density function of the input features X given the output label y, w are the transformation vectors, b is the bias term, Σw is the between-class scatter matrix, Σb is the within-class scatter matrix, and Σbw is the weighted sum of the within-class scatter matrices.

Once trained, the model can then be used to predict the output category of new instances, provided that they have already been mapped to the appropriate feature space using the transformation vectors learned during training. Moreover, once we know the optimal transformation vectors, we can project the entire dataset onto the lower-dimensional subspace formed by these vectors, thereby effectively reducing its dimensionality while preserving most of its most relevant characteristics.

## 3.1. Data Preprocessing Steps
Before performing either LDA or PCA, it's always a good idea to preprocess the data by removing duplicates, missing values, and handling categorical variables. One way to handle categorical variables is to convert them into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or binary encoding. Another step is to normalize the data to ensure that all attributes have similar scales. Finally, you might need to impute missing values using methods like mean imputation or KNN imputation.

After cleaning and preparing the data, we can move forward to choose whether to apply PCA or LDA for dimensionality reduction. Both approaches involve calculating various parameters based on the data, so the first step is to understand the differences between the two algorithms and decide which one to use for your specific scenario. After deciding on the algorithm, we can proceed to fit the model using MLE to learn the values of the relevant parameters.

For LDA, we calculate the between-class scatter matrix and within-class scatter matrices for each class separately. Then, we compute the ratio between the total within-class scatter and the squared determinant of the between-class scatter matrix. Next, we optimize the transformation vectors using the training data X and Y, resulting in the equation of motion for Σw and Σb. Once optimized, we can transform the test data into the new space using the learned transformation vectors and classify the instances using supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression or support vector machines.

Similarly, for PCA, we compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data and extract the eigenvectors corresponding to the top k eigenvalues to form a matrix W of eigenvectors. We then use this matrix to transform the original data into a reduced set of dimensions. Again, we can visualize the results using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) or t-SNE to gain insights into the structures in the data that remain after PCA has been applied.

Both PCA and LDA provide us with a new set of uncorrelated variables that captures as much of the variation in the data as possible. However, choosing the correct algorithm and fitting the models correctly requires careful attention to details, especially when dealing with very large datasets or complex problems. With proper care, we can significantly improve the accuracy of machine learning models by reducing the dimensionality of the original problem while preserving most of its most important features.
