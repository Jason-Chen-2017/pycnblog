# 1.背景介绍


> "Clean code" is a term coined by <NAME>, referring to certain aspects of software development that make the code easier to read, understand and maintain over time. It promotes good programming practice through techniques such as minimizing duplication, separation of concerns, and abstraction. Although many different definitions can be used for clean code, common characteristics include low complexity, adherence to best practices, clarity of intent, and error prevention. In this book, we will explore these principles in more detail, with examples from real-world software projects and team experiences. We'll also explore how they fit into agile software development and other iterative development methods. Finally, we'll discuss several practical refactoring tools and approaches you can use to improve your codebase's quality and reduce its complexity. This unique guide to writing better code will help you develop cleaner, more effective software faster than ever before! 

The book was originally published in 2008 and has since become an industry standard resource for anyone involved in producing high-quality software products. Many of today's top programmers have written or read about it, including <NAME>, founder of Stack Overflow and Ruby on Rails creator Chu Kochen-Lee, author of The Mythical Man-Month (which encourages developers to write clean code).

In recent years, Clean Code has been receiving significant attention due to its widespread impact on the way software teams work and what developers value in their codebases. Its popularity is partly attributed to its ability to instill high standards of technical craftsmanship, such as automated testing, modular design, and continuous integration/deployment.

This book presents a comprehensive overview of how to produce high-quality code using various coding conventions, design patterns, and best practices. By learning to follow these principles, you can build solid foundations for creating reliable, scalable, and maintainable software systems. You'll also learn how to apply them to areas such as architecture, performance optimization, security, and even business logic. The information provided should serve as a valuable reference tool for any developer working in an organization looking to improve their own software engineering skills and ensure they deliver great products to users.

Note: This book does not presume prior experience in software development or programming languages. If you are familiar with object-oriented programming concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and others, then reading this book should not be too challenging. However, if you need a refresher on basic programming concepts, I recommend checking out "Introduction to Computer Science" or one of the numerous online courses available. Additionally, some familiarity with Unix command line tools may come in handy during the examples. Some knowledge of version control systems like Git could be beneficial but isn't strictly necessary.

## 2.1 Clean Code Principles
Let’s start by understanding what makes up clean code. According to Robert Martin’s definition, clean code contains six principles:

1. **Readability:** The code must be easy to understand, easy to modify and easy to debug.
2. **Simplicity:** The code must be simple enough so that humans can easily understand it without being bored.
3. **Modularity:** The code must be divided into small modules that do one thing well and interact with each other well. 
4. **Testability:** The code must be testable and easy to verify.
5. **Reliability:** The code must be bug-free and performant.
6. **Usability:** The code must be user-friendly and usable.

These principles describe the fundamental building blocks of clean code. Each principle takes into account factors such as simplicity, modularity, and clarity of intention to create reusable components that are easy to understand and modify. They also align with popular industry best practices such as SOLID design principles and YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It) rule.

We will now dive deeper into each of these principles individually to see how we can apply them in our daily work as developers. Let us begin with “Readability”. 
## 2.2 Readability
### 2.2.1 Meaningful Names
A variable name should convey meaning clearly at a glance. For example, don’t choose names like x, y, z, or i when naming variables. Instead, choose descriptive and meaningful ones like age, product_name, customer_address etc. This helps to quickly identify what the variable represents and can avoid confusion between similarly named variables. Moreover, making use of proper capitalization and spacing improves the overall readability of the code. Good variable names also assist in keeping track of changes made throughout the life cycle of a project.

```python
age = 27 # Good Name
aGe = 27 # Bad Name

productName = 'iPhone' # Good Name
Product_Name = 'iPhone' # Bad Name

customerAddress = '123 Main St, Anytown USA' # Good Name
cUS_dRESS = '123 Main St, Anytown USA' # Bad Name
```

### 2.2.2 Commenting Code
Comments are important to explain the purpose, function, or implementation details of code. Make sure to comment all non-obvious lines of code. Avoid comments that are redundant or unnecessary. One might argue that inline comments are not considered good style and should be avoided altogether. But there are valid reasons why adding extra documentation is helpful to someone trying to understand the codebase later on. Therefore, it’s crucial to strike a balance between adding useful comments and obfuscating unnecessarily complex code. Keep in mind that comments can often get outdated very quickly, especially in larger projects with multiple contributors. Therefore, it’s essential to keep the comments updated whenever relevant parts of the codebase change. Here are a few tips on how to effectively comment your code: 

1. Write descriptive comments: Don’t just repeat what the code itself says; instead, add supplementary explanations that provide additional context or insight.
2. Structure comments logically: Group related comments together under headings or subheadings rather than jamming everything in a single block of text.
3. Use TODO markers: Whenever you need to temporarily disable or fix something, use TODO markers in your comments to indicate where the issue needs to be addressed later on. These markers allow you to prioritize tasks and give yourself clear instructions on what needs to be done next.
4. Delete commented-out code: If you find old or unused code that looks like it hasn’t been removed yet, consider deleting it altogether to avoid confusion or bugs.

Here is an example of well-structured and informative comments:

```python
def calculateTotal(items):
    """
    Returns the total cost of all items in the list
    
    :param items: A list containing dictionaries representing items
                  with keys 'name', 'price', and 'quantity'.
                  
    Example usage:
        >>> items = [
                {'name': 'book', 'price': 9.99, 'quantity': 2},
                {'name': 'pen', 'price': 3.99, 'quantity': 3}
            ]
            
        >>> calculateTotal(items)
        29.97
        
    Note: To handle rounding errors, we round down the final result to two decimal places.
    """

    total = sum([item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items])
    return round(total, 2)
```

### 2.2.3 Formatting Code
Code formatting is an important aspect of maintaining readability and reducing merge conflicts. Using consistent indentation and whitespace can significantly improve the overall readability of the code. Consistent styling guidelines also make it easier for other people to collaborate and contribute to the project. There are many Python-specific formatting recommendations like using four spaces for indentation and no trailing white space. While there aren’t universal rules for all programming languages, consistency within a project or company is essential to ensuring readable code. Tools like Black, Flake8, and Pylint automate most of the required formatting tasks and save time and effort. Here are a few general formatting suggestions:

1. Use soft tabs with four spaces per indent level: Most modern editors support displaying tab characters as spaces, which can lead to inconsistent visual alignment of code. Soft tabs, on the other hand, render both spaces and actual tabs, leading to more readable code.
2. Limit line length to 79 characters: Long lines of code can make it harder to scan and edit, especially when side-by-side with other sections of code. Limiting the number of characters on a single line helps readers stay focused and reduces the likelihood of running off the screen.
3. End files with a newline character: Every file should end with a newline character to prevent issues with auto-formatting tools and diff views.
4. Put blank lines between logical sections of code: Blank lines separate logical groups of code, making it easier to visually locate specific portions of the code.
5. Indent multi-line statements: When breaking long expressions onto multiple lines, indent the continued line to reflect the current nesting level.

Here is an example of properly formatted code:

```python
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, num1, num2):
        self.num1 = num1
        self.num2 = num2
    
    def addition(self):
        return self.num1 + self.num2
    
    def multiplication(self):
        return self.num1 * self.num2
    
    def division(self):
        try:
            result = self.num1 / self.num2
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Cannot divide by zero!")
        else:
            return result
```

And here is an example of improperly formatted code:

```python
class   Calculator:

   def     __init__    (self,    num1     ,        num2       ):
       self.num1= num1
           self.num2         =           num2


    def          addition            (self             )              :
        return self.num1+self.num2+
                 self.num3
         
    def multiplication(self                 ):
           return  self.num1*
                      self.num2


       def         division               (self                          ):
                     try                   :
                         result                =  self.num1/
                             self.num2
                          
                     except                     ZeroDivisionError                           :
                          print ("Cannot divide by zero!"                            )
                              
                    else                             :
                                return result  

```
