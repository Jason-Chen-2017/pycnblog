# 2.核心概念与联系
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful tool in computer science for solving optimization problems. It uses recursion to break down complex problems into smaller subproblems and store solutions to avoid redundant computations. Dynamic Programming has been widely adopted in fields such as machine learning, natural language processing, and finance. Here are some key concepts and terms associated with DP:

1. Memoization: It is a technique where we store previously computed values so that they can be reused later instead of recomputing them every time. 
2. Tabular/Tree-based Search Techniques: These methods use tables or trees to represent states and optimal actions at different stages of the solution process.
3. Recursion formula: It calculates the value of a state based on its successor states.
4. Optimal Substructure: An optimal solution to a problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.
5. Overlapping Subproblems: Dynamic Programming avoids redundant computation by storing intermediate results.
6. Approximation Algorithms: They approximate the optimum value by relying on a relaxation method such as branch and bound or heuristics.

## 3.1 Basic Idea of DP - Iterative Solution
The iterative approach is similar to the recursive approach but relies on iterations rather than recursion. It involves two main steps: 

1. Initialize base cases: We initialize the values of the first few states based on given conditions or known information. For instance, if we want to find the nth term of a sequence, we know that the first three terms are 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, we set dp[0], dp[1], and dp[2] = 1, 2, and 3 respectively. 
2. Compute new values based on previous ones: We iterate from index i=3 to n, compute the dp[i] value based on the current dp[j] value and dp[k] value where j < k <= i.

For any specific iteration i, we have:

```python
dp[i] = f(dp[j],..., dp[k])
```

where f() represents some function that takes multiple inputs and returns a single output. By using dynamic programming, we reduce the number of repeated calculations needed to solve a large class of problems. However, iterative approaches may not always outperform recursive solutions because they require more memory space to store intermediate values compared to the stack frames required by recursive functions. Also, computing values one at a time requires additional input parameters which makes the implementation slightly more complicated. Nevertheless, the advantage of DP comes from its ability to handle larger input sizes due to its use of table storage or tree structures. 

## 3.2 Memoization 
Memoization refers to storing the result of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. The basic idea is to save the results of expensive function calls and return the saved result whenever the same inputs occur again. This reduces the computational cost of the function. There are several ways to implement memoization:

1. Top-down Memoization: Memoization builds up the result recursively starting from the top level of the recursion tree. At each node, we check whether we have already calculated the answer for the subtree rooted at that node. If yes, we simply return the memoized value without further recursion. Otherwise, we calculate the result and update our memo table accordingly. This approach has worst-case complexity O(n^2), since it could lead to infinite recursion if there are cycles in the recursion tree.

2. Bottom-up Memoization: Memoization computes the result bottom-up starting from the leaf nodes of the recursion tree and working our way towards the root node. At each node, we check whether we have already computed the answer for the subtree rooted at that node. If yes, we retrieve the memoized value stored in the parent node. Otherwise, we compute the result and memoize it for subsequent use. This approach has best-case complexity O(n), since no duplicate calculation is performed. However, it has worst-case complexity O(n^2) in case of cyclic dependencies between subtrees.   

    ```
    f(n) = max(f(n-1)+A[n-1], A[n])
    
    Base Case:
        f(0) = A[0]
        
    Recursive Step:
        1. Find maximum of f(n-1)+A[n-1] and A[n]. 
        2. Store the result in the memo table.
    ```
    
In general, memoization can speed up the execution time significantly for some types of expensive functions. One common application of memoization is in matrix multiplication, where we need to repeatedly multiply matrices of identical size.

## 3.3 Problem Types and Techniques
There are many types of problems that can benefit from DP, including sorting, searching, string matching, etc., depending on the type of input and the formulation of the problem. Some of the most commonly used techniques include:

1. Minimum Cost Path Problems: Minimizing total cost while visiting all vertices exactly once. Examples include traveling salesman, minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle, etc.
2. Longest Common Subsequence: Finding the longest common subsequence between two strings.
3. Travelling Salesman Problem: Solving the TSP problem where we want to find the shortest route that visits all cities exactly once.
4. Knapsack Problem: Optimizing items based on their weights and values subject to a constraint of capacity limit.
5. Binomial Coefficient: Calculating factorials very quickly using dynamic programming.
6. Maximum Subarray Sum: Finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers with the largest sum.

## 3.4 Brute Force vs DP - Puzzle & Optimization Problems
One important distinction between brute force and DP is that brute force attempts to solve every possible configuration of a puzzle whereas DP searches for the optimal solution to a constrained optimization problem. To analyze the difference between brute force and DP, let's consider a simple puzzle called “Magic Square”.<|im_sep|>
