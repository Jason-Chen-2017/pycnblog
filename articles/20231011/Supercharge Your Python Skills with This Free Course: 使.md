# 1.背景介绍



The Python programming language has been one of the most popular languages in recent years due to its easy-to-learn syntax and versatility. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, game development, automation, etc., making it a highly sought after skill among developers. However, despite being an interpreted language, Python is also known for its high speed and efficiency compared to other compiled languages like Java or C++. 

In this course, we will explore various concepts related to Python and apply them through hands-on exercises. By the end of the course, you will have mastered the basics of Python, which will help you write more efficient code faster than ever before. We'll also cover some advanced topics like object oriented programming, GUI programming using tkinter, database connectivity, testing frameworks, and profiling tools to provide insights into how to optimize your Python applications further. 

This free Python training programme is designed by Python experts from industry leaders including Guido van Rossum and Raymond Hettinger. The course includes practical exercises that will teach you how to use Python efficiently in real-world scenarios, making it ideal for beginners as well as professionals who want to sharpen their skills and become better software engineers. 

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. If you're already familiar with Python but need a refresher course, check out our previous course "Learn Python Programming Language in 7 Days". Otherwise, let's dive into this new course! 


# 2.核心概念与联系

 - Object Oriented Programming (OOP): OOP is a paradigm based on objects, where classes are defined to represent real world entities such as cars, dogs, books, etc., and instances of these classes are created to model specific real world scenarios. In Python, we can define classes to create our own custom data types, encapsulate behavior, and extend functionality. 

 - Exception Handling: Exceptions are errors or unexpected situations that occur while executing a program. Python provides built-in exception handling mechanisms that allow us to handle exceptions gracefully instead of crashing the program. We can catch exceptions at different levels of the call stack, raise custom exceptions, and debug issues effectively.

 - Functional Programming: Functional programming refers to treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In Python, we can use functional constructs like map(), filter() and reduce() to manipulate collections of data.

 - Regular Expressions: Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are commonly used for string manipulation tasks such as text processing, parsing email messages, and extracting information from log files. Python provides regular expression support through the re module, which allows us to build powerful pattern matching tools quickly and easily.

 - Debugging Tools: When things go wrong, debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs, or errors, within a program. Python comes prepackaged with several debugging tools that include pdb (the Python Debugger), ipdb (an improved version of pdb), pudb (a full-featured console debugger) and others. These tools enable us to step through a program line by line, set breakpoints, and inspect variables during runtime.

 - Testing Frameworks: Testing frameworks are essential components of agile software development that ensure the quality of software products before they are released. There are many test frameworks available in Python, such as Pytest, Nose, and unittest. These frameworks offer a range of features such as automated tests discovery, flexible test running options, and extensive reporting capabilities.

 - Profiling Tools: Profiling tools analyze the performance of a program, identify bottlenecks, and suggest optimization strategies. Python comes packaged with several profilers, including cProfile, profile, and tracemalloc. These tools collect statistical data about the execution time of each function, show memory usage over time, and visualize call graphs.

## What is a list?
A list is an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets [] separated by commas. Lists are mutable, meaning we can change their contents once they are created. Each item in a list can be of any type, including another list, resulting in nested lists. Here's an example of a simple list:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
mixed_list = ['hello', 9, [True]]
```

We can access individual elements in a list by indexing them using integer values starting from 0. For example, `fruits[0]` gives us `'apple'`. Negative indexing is also allowed, so `fruits[-1]` gives us `'cherry'`. We can use slices to extract sublists. For example, `fruits[:2]` gives us `['apple', 'banana']`. We can concatenate two lists using the `+` operator, or multiply a list with an integer n to repeat the list n times.

Lists support several useful methods such as append(), remove(), index(), count(), sort(), reverse(), and copy(). Additionally, there are many built-in functions such as len(), max(), min(), sum(), enumerate(), all(), any(), sorted(), reversed(), zip(), and abs() that operate on lists.
