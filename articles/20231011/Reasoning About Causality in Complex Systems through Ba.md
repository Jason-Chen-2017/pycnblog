# 1.背景介绍


Complex systems are often described as a collection of interacting entities that have both macroscopic properties (such as size or complexity) and microscopic properties (such as the distribution of their constituents). While there is increasing interest in analysing complex systems to identify trends, understand mechanisms underlying dynamics, and predict future events, causality has received less attention from researchers due to its complexity and non-trivial nature. In this paper, we propose a framework for reasoning about causality using Bayesian networks and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to handle the challenges associated with inferring causal relationships across large and complex systems.

Causality refers to how one event causes another event to occur. It can be thought of as an intervention on the system that leads to some observable change in the state variables of the system. Understanding cause and effect relations between different variables plays a crucial role in understanding the emergent behaviors of complex systems such as natural processes, engineering designs, social interactions, biological systems, etc., which are often multivariate, dynamic, nonlinear, uncertain, and multi-agent. Despite the importance of causality, it remains a challenging task because many factors affect multiple variables at once, resulting in unobserved confounding effects and noise in observed data. To overcome these challenges, we need to develop effective methods for causal inference that can capture all relevant influences simultaneously while accounting for uncertainty and irrelevant confounding factors.

Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model used to represent a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies. Each variable node represents an outcome or potential outcome of the system and consists of several attributes or features characterizing them. The edges connect pairs of nodes indicating conditional dependence or influence among the variables. A Bayesian network captures the joint probability distribution of all possible states of the system based on the causal structure. Using Bayesian networks, we can represent causal relationships between variables and use it to infer the posterior distributions of the affected variables given the prior knowledge and new observations.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is widely used for approximate inference and sampling from the posterior distribution. MCMC algorithms work by iteratively computing sample points that are likely to converge to the true posterior distribution, allowing us to draw samples from it. With enough iterations, the MCMC algorithm eventually converges to the exact solution, but convergence can take a long time depending on the number of parameters and the difficulty of the likelihood function being optimized. To speed up MCMC algorithm, we can use parallel processing techniques, shrinkage priors, adaptive proposal distributions, or hybrid sampling algorithms.

In summary, our proposed approach uses Bayesian networks and MCMC to effectively infer causal relationships across complex systems while handling uncertainty and irrelevant confounding factors. We provide specific details and mathematical formulas for representing causal structures, performing inference via MCMC, and validating and interpreting results obtained from experiments. Our methodology can also help address other problems related to causal inference including parameter estimation, missing data imputation, control variates, and estimating the treatment effect under sequential interventions. Overall, this work provides a general framework for analyzing and understanding complex systems involving large numbers of variables, which will aid scientists and engineers to make more informed decisions and improve safety and security in real-world applications.

## 2.1 Complex Systems
Complex systems refer to a wide range of physical, biological, chemical, and technological phenomena that involve interaction among various components. They consist of both macroscopic and microscopic properties. Examples include natural processes such as climate change and ecosystems; social and political phenomena like global economic development and migration patterns; and artificial intelligence systems where the learning process involves continuous interactions between different neural units. 
## 2.2 Interacting Entities
Interacting entities include all entities involved in a system except the agent that makes the decision or produces the output. These entities can be either living or non-living, human or non-human. An entity may consist of multiple interacting subsystems, each responsible for accomplishing a particular task within the larger system. For example, an airplane system includes the engines, flight controls, cabin pressurization, pilot commands, navigational aids, and instrumentation necessary for flying.  
## 2.3 Attributes & Features
Attributes describe the characteristics of an entity. They vary from system to system and can correspond to physical or abstract qualities such as temperature, mobility, size, mass, color, shape, and activity. Features may involve qualitative traits such as gender, race, education level, age, religious beliefs, and nationality. 
## 2.4 Conditional Dependence/Influence
Conditional dependence describes the relationship between two entities, X and Y, when X depends on Y directly or indirectly. For instance, if X changes, then Y typically changes in response to it. In contrast, direct influence means that X causes Y without any intermediate step or factor. E.g. raining causes snowfall. Indirect influence occurs when a changing X affects multiple entities Y and Z, so that X influences Y through Z. E.g. water pressure increases lead to ice formation in glaciers and melting of snow and rain in tropical regions. 
## 2.5 Bayesian Network
A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model used to represent a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies. The graph consists of nodes representing random variables and directed links connecting pairs of nodes representing conditional dependence or influence. At any point in time, the values assigned to each node determine the probability distribution of its children. This representation allows us to represent a rich set of causal relationships between variables and efficiently perform causal inference. A key aspect of Bayesian networks is that they do not assume any functional forms for the probability distributions of the variables. 
## 2.6 Markov Chains and Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation
A Markov chain is a stochastic model that specifies the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another, given certain conditions. Each state corresponds to a configuration of the system's constituent parts, and the probability distribution specifies what transitions are most likely to happen next. Markov chains offer powerful modeling tools that allow us to simulate the behavior of complex systems accurately even before they actually exist. However, calculating the exact probability distribution of a complex system is computationally expensive, making exact inference intractable for practical purposes. Instead, we can estimate the distribution using statistical sampling methods called Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC), which explores the space of possibilities using random walks and generates samples that are highly consistent with the target distribution. By repeating the experiment many times with different initial starting points, we can build up an approximation of the actual distribution.

## 3.1 Representing Causal Relationships
To represent the causal relationships between variables in a Bayesian network, we first specify the types of variables involved. Then, we define the conditional dependencies between the variables according to the domain knowledge. Finally, we construct the Bayesian network to reflect the defined causal relationships. The resulting DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) shows the causal relationships between the variables. 

For example: Consider the case of a bike sharing service where customers choose the duration of rental and pay per hour based on their income and location. If the customer's income increases, he may prefer longer trips and higher fares. Also, if he lives near a busy intersection, his car traffic may increase, leading to slower bikeshare performance. Therefore, the following causal relationships can be captured using Bayesian networks:


Here, the "duration" and "pay_per_hour" are observed variables, whereas the "income", "location", "car_traffic", and "bikeshare_performance" are hidden variables. Each arrow indicates a conditional dependency or influence, which indicates how the value of a parent variable affects the child variable. Note that the arrows point towards the direction of effect rather than cause.  

## 3.2 Performing Causal Inference
Once we have constructed the Bayesian network, we can use it to perform causal inference. The core idea behind causal inference is to quantify the impact of a change in one variable on another variable. We want to know whether one variable is statistically dependent on another variable, i.e., whether the value of one variable would change significantly if we changed the value of the other variable.

### Forward Sampling Algorithms
Forward sampling algorithms start at the root of the causal hierarchy (the parents of the query variable) and generate samples conditioned on the parents' values recursively until reaching the query variable. The forward sampler repeatedly updates its estimates of the joint probability distribution of the hidden variables based on the incoming messages from its parents. After generating sufficient samples, the estimated marginal distribution of the query variable gives rise to a confidence interval around the expected value of the query variable given the observed values of the rest of the variables.

The basic steps of the forward sampler algorithm are:

1. Initialize the observation table with the observed variables' values.
2. Compute the joint probability distribution of the hidden variables using the specified causal structure and the observational data. Store this distribution in the message table. 
3. Recursively compute the joint probability distribution of the remaining variables (i.e., those that are neither observed nor hidden) conditioned on the current estimates of the hidden variables and store these distributions in the message table.
4. Update the estimates of the query variable by adding the product of the evidence and the corresponding entry in the message table multiplied by the appropriate normalization constant. Normalize the result to obtain a proper probability distribution.

Forward sampling algorithms scale well for models with moderate to high dimensionalities and sparse conditional dependencies, but require careful specification of the causal structure to avoid getting stuck in local optima.

### Bidirectional Sampling Algorithm
Bidirectional sampling (BSA) combines the strengths of forward sampling and backward sampling algorithms to capture both direct and indirect influences. BSA alternates between running forward and backward samplers on separate sets of nodes until convergence, updating the shared information as needed.

The basic steps of the bidirectional sampler algorithm are:

1. Run the forward sampler on all variables except the ones being queried, keeping track of the individual log-likelihood contributions from each run.
2. Run the backward sampler on the requested variables, similarly keeping track of the individual log-likelihood contributions.
3. Combine the individual log-likelihood contributions into a combined contribution for each combination of values of the queried variables.
4. Use numerical optimization methods to find the best assignment of the queried variables that minimizes the total log-likelihood.

BSA scales much better than forward or backward sampling for complex models with many variables, although convergence requires tuning of hyperparameters and initialization strategies.

## 3.3 Handling Uncertainty and Irrelevant Confounding Factors
One of the main challenges in causal inference is dealing with uncertainty and irrelevant confounding factors. When working with large and complex datasets, it becomes difficult to analyze the underlying causal relationships solely based on the observed data. Additionally, in real-world scenarios, variables interact spontaneously and in ways that cannot be predicted with certainty. To account for these factors, we need to modify the standard assumptions made by the above methods.

### Imputing Missing Data
If we observe only part of the data, we face the problem of incomplete data. Incomplete data can arise due to various reasons such as sensor failures, insufficient measurements, incorrect entry of data, etc. In such cases, we need to fill in the missing entries with reasonable approximations, such as the mean or median of the available values. 

### Estimating Hidden Variables' Distributions
Hidden variables present additional sources of uncertainty compared to observed variables since they cannot be observed directly. One way to deal with this challenge is to treat them as latent variables and estimate their distributions using the known causal structure. Different approaches have been developed to estimate the distribution of the hidden variables, such as Bayesian linear regression, Gaussian mixture models, and deep learning techniques.

### Adding Control Variates
When we measure a variable that can potentially affect other variables, we introduce confounding effects onto the data. For instance, suppose we have measured a variable that affects both temperature and humidity, and we want to study the effect of sunlight on wind speed. Clearly, the presence of sunlight should not simply shift the measurement of temperature away from its actual value. To mitigate this issue, we add a control variable that does not affect the measured variable. In this case, we might add cloud cover as a control variable since it does not affect the weather directly.

### Implementing Sequential Interventions
Sequential interventions are a common technique in causal inference for measuring the impact of policy interventions. Here, we consider the situation where we intervene on one variable at a time and record the outcomes of the other variables. Once we detect an effect caused by the intervention, we can stop intervening further and continue recording the effects of subsequent policies. Alternatively, we can implement multiple interventions sequentially and compare the outcomes to see how they correlate with each other.
