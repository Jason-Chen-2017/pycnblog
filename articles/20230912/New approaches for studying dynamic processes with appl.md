Manufacturing of integrated circuits and other electronic devices requires the involvement of complex dynamic systems, such as electrical motors, thermal management units (TMS), and vibration-damped converters (VDC). The control strategies employed by these system components have a significant impact on their efficiency and productivity. In this work, we propose an approach that can be used to identify the interactions between multiple dynamic systems and analyze the effects of different process parameters on each system’s performance over time. This is achieved through data mining techniques, which are widely used in scientific research. Specifically, we use clustering algorithms to identify groups of similar dynamic systems based on their behavioral patterns, and then apply classification methods to predict the output of each system given its input and the behavioral pattern of other connected systems. We evaluate our method using several case studies from semiconductor manufacture and show that it outperforms traditional linear modeling techniques. Moreover, we demonstrate how our framework can provide insights into the design space and guide critical design decisions for next-generation semiconductor devices.

## Dynamic systems
Dynamic systems are those systems whose behavior or response changes over time under certain conditions, such as change in temperature or loading on the system. Examples include electric motors, thermal management units (TMS), and vibration-damped converters (VDC) commonly used in integrated circuit technologies. 

Dynamic systems typically involve physical phenomena such as mechanical motion, heat flow, or electromagnetic forces. These phenomena can be analyzed mathematically using dynamical equations, which describe the relationship between state variables and the rates at which they change. For example, if one were interested in analyzing the dynamics of a simple pendulum, the position and velocity of the bob would depend on its angle relative to the vertical (theta), and the rate at which they change would be determined by two constants, g and l:

$\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = \frac{-g}{l}\sin(\theta)$

where $\theta$ represents the angle of the pendulum relative to the vertical. Other examples of dynamic systems include electrohydrodynamic motor drives, where the voltage applied to the coil depends on both current density and time elapsed since last actuation, as well as geothermal heat pumps, where power generation and storage relies on variations in ambient temperature due to climate fluctuations.

## Process parameters
Process parameters characterize various aspects of the manufacturing process, including costs, lead times, production rates, etc., that affect the dynamic behavior of individual components within the device being produced. Commonly used process parameters include feedrates, speeds, loads, torques, friction coefficients, and others. All of these parameters may vary depending on the type and size of the device being produced, the quality specifications, and other factors that influence component performance and yield.

## Behavioral pattern
The behavioral pattern of a dynamic system refers to any characteristic that distinguishes one particular instance of the system from all others in terms of its temporal evolution. One common measure of behavioral pattern is correlation coefficient, which measures the degree to which pairs of time series overlap with each other. A high value indicates strong positive correlation, while low values indicate weak negative correlation or no correlation. However, there are many other ways to define behavioral pattern, ranging from statistical moments to nonlinear functions.

## Classification technique
Classification is a supervised learning task that involves partitioning the dataset into classes based on some attribute or feature of the instances. There are many classification techniques, but here we will focus on two popular ones - K-means clustering and decision trees.

K-means clustering partitions the data into k clusters, where k is specified by the user. Each cluster is represented by the mean of the corresponding instances in the cluster, and points are assigned to the nearest cluster based on Euclidean distance. Decision trees are also known as classification and regression trees (CART), and consist of nodes representing attributes or thresholds, branches leading to child nodes, and leaf nodes giving class labels or continuous outcomes. CART models are trained recursively by splitting nodes along the best split found so far until all leaves contain samples from only one class or are pure (i.e., contain only one sample per node). Tree ensemble methods like random forests, gradient boosting, and support vector machines combine multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce variance. Here, we will focus on decision trees because they are simpler to interpret and explain than neural networks.
