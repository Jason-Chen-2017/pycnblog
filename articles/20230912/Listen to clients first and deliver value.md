# 1.简介
  

在过去的几年里，机器学习技术已经成为行业中的热门话题。据估计，2019 年全球 AI 技术的市场份额预计将达到 7% 左右，同时该领域还处于蓬勃发展阶段。对于企业而言，开发 AI 模型来实现商业价值显然是一种新兴技术，需要投入大量的人力、物力和财力。如何让 AI 更好地服务于公司业务并提升竞争力，是一个亟待解决的问题。

本文将以“Listen to Clients First”（倾听客户需求）以及“Deliver Value”（提供有价值的产品或服务）为中心，分析如何提升 AI 的能力，使其能够更好地满足公司的业务需求。文章将从以下几个方面展开阐述，帮助读者更好的理解 AI 技术及其应用场景。

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
# 2.1 Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed with rules or instructions. It uses statistical techniques such as supervised learning (also known as labeled training data) and unsupervised learning (clustering), and mathematical optimization methods to create models based on patterns found in the input data. These algorithms are trained using large datasets that contain inputs and corresponding outputs. They can make predictions about new, previously unknown inputs by analyzing patterns discovered during training. 

The basic steps involved in building an ML model include: 

1. Data Collection - Collecting training data for training the model. This dataset should have both features and labels.

2. Preprocessing - Cleaning and preparing the data before it is fed into the algorithm. This includes removing missing values, handling outliers, normalization etc.

3. Feature Selection - Selecting relevant features from the given dataset. This reduces overfitting and improves generalization performance.

4. Model Training - The selected algorithm is then used to train the model on the prepared data. It learns the relationship between the input variables and output variable(s).

5. Model Testing/Evaluation - Once the model has been trained, it can be tested against a testing set containing data that was not seen during training. This gives a measure of how well the model will perform on real-world data.

6. Deployment - Deploying the trained model into production can help companies gain insights into their business processes and take action based on these insights.

Overall, machine learning provides automated decision making tools capable of analyzing large amounts of complex data quickly, accurately, and efficiently. This technology promises significant savings in time and resources when applied to problems in various industries.

# 2.2 Deep Learning
Deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms developed using neural networks. Unlike traditional machine learning algorithms like linear regression, support vector machines, and decision trees, deep learning relies on multiple layers of interconnected neural nodes instead of just one. Each node takes its input from other nodes within the same layer and passes this information through hidden layers until finally generating an output. Neural networks can be very effective at processing high-dimensional data, which makes them useful for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to solve complex problems with fewer examples than traditional machine learning approaches. Examples include image classification, speech recognition, and text analysis. While traditional machine learning algorithms often require more preprocessing and feature engineering compared to deep learning models, they can still achieve impressive accuracy levels on many challenging problems. Additionally, deep learning models can automatically adapt to changes in the input data, enabling them to continually improve their performance over time. Overall, deep learning represents an important advancement in computer science that will revolutionize many fields including healthcare, finance, and robotics.
