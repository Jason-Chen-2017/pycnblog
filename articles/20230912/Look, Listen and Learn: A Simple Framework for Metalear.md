（Introduction）
Meta learning (ML), also known as Learning to learn (L2L) or few-shot learning, is a type of machine learning that enables machines to learn new tasks from small amounts of training data using prior knowledge about the task. This prior knowledge can be in the form of large scale datasets like ImageNet or pre-trained models such as VGG networks. In recent years, meta learning has seen significant advances thanks to advances in neural architecture search (NAS). The goal of this paper is to provide a simple yet effective framework for meta learning with applications to computer vision.

This article will first introduce what is meta learning, its basic concepts and terminology, and then discuss how meta learning works, specifically in the context of computer vision. We will focus on two types of meta learning algorithms - functional regression and self-supervised learning. Then we will explore various applications of these algorithms such as few shot object detection, few shot image classification, and domain adaptation. Finally, we will outline some challenges and future directions of meta learning. 

We believe that writing technical articles on complex topics like meta learning can help researchers and developers gain a better understanding of the topic and their respective fields of work. It also encourages them to break down complicated ideas into easy-to-digest pieces. Therefore, it is essential to not only share our knowledge but to do so openly and collaboratively.

Our goal with this series of articles is to provide an accessible and practical introduction to the field of meta learning through short and clear explanations while highlighting key insights and fundamental principles. By doing so, we hope to inspire, educate, and encourage others in the community to dive deeper into this exciting area of research. Thank you for reading!

# 2. 基本概念及术语定义（Basic Concepts and Terminology Definiton）
Before delving into the details of meta learning, let’s briefly define some terms and concepts related to meta learning:

1. Task Adaptation: This refers to the process where a model learns to perform well on one set of tasks but performs poorly on another similar set of tasks. For instance, if your model has been trained on images of cats, it may fail miserably when tested on images of dogs because they have different features and textures than cats. To overcome this problem, we need to find ways to make the model more adaptable and able to generalize across similar sets of tasks. 

2. Few-Shot Learning: This is a subset of meta learning that involves solving tasks involving only a few examples rather than a single example. As an example, consider the task of classifying animals based on pictures taken under different lighting conditions. Here each picture may represent only one possible way to capture an animal, which makes it difficult to learn effectively. On the other hand, if there are multiple pictures per animal under different lighting conditions, then the task becomes much easier and we call it few-shot learning. Similar to regular supervised learning, few-shot learning requires labeled data for both training and testing. However, unlike standard supervised learning, few-shot learning suffers from limited amount of labeled data due to the difficulty in acquiring labels for every example in the dataset. Hence, we aim to develop approaches to obtain good representations of the underlying patterns without requiring a large number of labels.

3. Continual Learning: Continuously learning over time is another aspect of meta learning that aims to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Instead of having to retrain a model from scratch after each change in the environment, continual learning allows us to retain important information learned during previous tasks and apply it to new ones.

4. Batch Meta-Learning: This refers to the scenario where we use a batch of tasks together to train the model instead of individual tasks separately. This approach helps reduce the variance in the gradients computed by the model and improves the overall performance of the model.

5. Domain Adaptation: Domain adaptation refers to the situation where the model needs to perform well on samples drawn from a target domain but struggles to transfer its learning skills to samples from a source domain that contains different distributions or styles of data. One common application of domain adaptation in computer vision is style transfer, where we want to transform an image from one artistic style to another.
