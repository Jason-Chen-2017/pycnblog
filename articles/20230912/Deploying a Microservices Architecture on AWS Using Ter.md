Microservices architecture has become increasingly popular as it offers many advantages compared to monolithic architectures and helps in breaking down large systems into smaller manageable pieces. In this article, we will discuss how to deploy a microservices-based application on AWS using terraform. The aim of the article is to provide step-by-step instructions for deploying a sample application called "The Inventory Management System" on AWS EC2 instances. We will be covering the following topics:

1. Introduction to microservices
2. Basic concepts and terminologies involved with microservices architecture
3. Deployment of a microservices-based application using Terraform
4. Details about the sample application - "The Inventory Management System"

## Microservices
A microservice is a small, self-contained service that performs a specific task within a larger system. Each microservice can communicate with other services using APIs. It provides a modular way to build software applications where different teams develop and deliver independent components. This approach aims to create scalable, reliable, and maintainable solutions that enable continuous innovation and agility while reducing cost, complexity, and risk. Here's a high-level overview of what microservices are and why they're useful:

1. Scalability: Services can scale independently and horizontally based on demand. This allows organizations to quickly add resources when necessary without affecting overall performance.

2. Reliability: Services are designed to be resilient, meaning they can recover from failures and continue running smoothly after being restored. This reduces downtime and improves customer experience.

3. Maintainability: Services are easy to update and modify because each one is responsible for managing its own data and business logic. Teams can make changes to individual services without affecting others.

On top of these benefits, microservices have some unique characteristics that set them apart from traditional enterprise software architecture designs:

1. Loose coupling: Microservices are loosely coupled since they don't rely on shared databases or messaging middleware. Instead, they use lightweight protocols like HTTP/RESTful API calls between themselves.

2. Independent deployment: Services can be deployed independently and updated whenever there's a change. This makes it easier to roll out new features or fixes quickly across multiple parts of the application.

3. Smaller code base: Services are typically developed in small batches and then integrated together. As a result, code bases tend to be much more manageable than monolithic apps. 

4. Flexibility: Services can be easily scaled up or down depending on needs. For example, if a certain service starts showing up frequently, it can be scaled up horizontally to handle increased traffic. Similarly, if it becomes less critical, it can be scaled back down. 

Overall, microservices offer a scalable, flexible, and maintainable way to design and implement complex software systems. However, implementing microservices properly requires careful planning, architectural decisions, and proper implementation techniques. Let's dive deeper into the specifics of the "Inventory Management System".
# 2. Inventory Management System
The inventory management system application is composed of several separate modules including customers, products, orders, and order tracking. Each module communicates with other modules using RESTful APIs. The main purpose of the app is to keep track of customer orders, check stock availability, process delivery, and fulfill customer requests. 

This app consists of four modules:

1. **Customers Module:** This module handles customer registration, login, profile updates, address management, and payment methods.

2. **Products Module:** This module manages product catalogue information, pricing, promotions, shipping details, and description.

3. **Orders Module:** This module processes customer orders by creating sales orders, generating invoice, and sending emails to customers. The Orders module interacts with both Products and Customers modules using APIs.

4. **Order Tracking Module:** This module tracks customer orders' status, location, comments, and delivery history. 

The microservices architecture involves decomposing the whole application into small, self-contained modules that talk to each other over a lightweight protocol like HTTP/RESTful API calls. These modules can be deployed separately and updated independently as needed. 

Here are the basic steps to deploy the microservices architecture using Terraform:

1. Choose a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.
2. Install Terraform on your local machine. 
3. Create an AWS account and access key pair. Configure your credentials locally so that Terraform can authenticate against your AWS account.
4. Define variables for all input parameters required by the modules. For example, define subnet IDs, security group ID, instance type, and AMIs for each EC2 instance.
5. Use HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) syntax to write TF files for each module. You'll need one file per module.
6. Use Terraform's `terraform init` command to initialize the directory containing the TF files.
7. Use Terraform's `terraform plan` command to preview the planned infrastructure changes before applying them.
8. Use Terraform's `terraform apply` command to apply the changes and create the infrastructure.

Let's go through an example TF file for the Customers Module and explain what's happening behind the scenes:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

data "aws_ami" "amzn_linux" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn-ami-*amazon-ecs-optimized"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners      = ["amazon"]
  executable_users = [var.user]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "customers" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.default.id

  ingress {
    from_port = 80
    to_port   = 80
    protocol  = "tcp"

    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = merge(local.common_tags, map("Name", "${var.env}-${var.app}-customers"))
}

module "customers-ec2" {
  source       = "./modules/customer-ec2"
  env          = var.env
  app          = var.app
  vpc_id       = aws_vpc.default.id
  subnet_ids   = aws_subnet.private.*.id
  ami_id       = data.aws_ami.amzn_linux.id
  keypair      = var.keypair
  public_ip    = false
  user         = var.user
  common_tags  = local.common_tags

  depends_on = [
    aws_internet_gateway.gw
  ]
}
```

First, we specify the provider block which tells Terraform to connect to AWS and configure it according to the specified variable values. Next, we retrieve the latest Amazon Linux AMI id using the `data` resource. Then, we create a VPC and a Security Group for the Customer module using the `aws_vpc`, `aws_subnet`, and `aws_security_group` resources. 

We define another module named `customers-ec2` inside the Customers TF file. This module takes care of creating the EC2 instance for the Customers module. We pass the relevant inputs like VPC Id, Subnet Id, AMI Id, Key Pair, User Data script, etc., along with environmental and common tags. Finally, we specify the dependency on the internet gateway so that the EC2 instance gets a public IP address assigned.

Similar modules can be defined for the remaining three modules of the Inventory Management System. Now, let's move onto the Order Tracking Module and see how its TF file looks like:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

module "order-tracking-ec2" {
  source           = "./modules/order-tracking-ec2"
  env              = var.env
  app              = var.app
  vpc_id           = aws_vpc.default.id
  subnet_ids       = aws_subnet.private.*.id
  ami_id           = data.aws_ami.amzn_linux.id
  keypair          = var.keypair
  public_ip        = false
  user             = var.user
  db_host          = module.mysql.address
  db_username      = module.mysql.username
  db_password      = module.mysql.password
  db_database_name = module.mysql.database_name
  common_tags      = local.common_tags
  
  depends_on = [
    aws_internet_gateway.gw
  ]
}
```

Again, we specify the provider block which tells Terraform to connect to AWS and configure it according to the specified variable values. Next, we define another module named `order-tracking-ec2`. This module creates the EC2 instance for the Order Tracking module, similar to the previous example. We pass the relevant inputs like VPC Id, Subnet Id, AMI Id, Key Pair, User Data script, DB host, username, password, database name, etc., along with environmental and common tags. Finally, we specify the dependency on the internet gateway so that the EC2 instance gets a public IP address assigned.

Now, the final step would be to combine all the TF files together and run `terraform init` followed by `terraform plan`. This would generate a detailed plan of the infrastructure changes that Terraform intends to perform. Once the plan looks good, execute `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the infrastructure. That's it! We've now successfully deployed a microservices-based application on AWS EC2 instances using Terraform.
