# 1.简介
  

Recursion is one of the most important concepts in Computer Science and it helps to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems which are similar to the original problem but can be solved independently from each other. In computer science, recursion refers to a process where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case or when some stopping criterion is met. This article will give you an overview on how to implement recursive functions in JavaScript using examples with step-by-step explanations for better understanding. 

The main aim of this article is to provide insights into implementing simple recursive functions in JavaScript as well as sharing tips and tricks that may help developers write more efficient code while working with recursive algorithms. The content covered includes:

## 2.1 Recursion Definition
Recursion is the process of a function calling itself repeatedly until it reaches a stop condition. It involves two parts - the inner loop and the outer loop. The inner loop contains the repeated steps while the outer loop controls the termination of the recursion based on certain conditions. When we call a function recursively, we pass arguments to the same function to achieve the required functionality. Each time the function returns a value, the control moves back to the previous stack frame, and then continues execution at the point where the current function was called again. When the final result is obtained after all the recursive calls have been made, there won't be any more frames left on the call stack. This is known as the "base case". A good example of recursion is calculating the factorial of a number, where the input number n multiplies with every positive integer less than or equal to n. 

In programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, recursion is typically used instead of iteration when dealing with large datasets because it avoids the overhead associated with creating new data structures and memory allocation. However, although recursion has its place in solving complex problems, care must be taken to avoid infinite loops or very deep recursion stacks since they can cause performance issues or even crash the program. To mitigate these risks, programmers should always consider limiting the depth of the recursion using techniques such as tail call optimization (TCO) in compilers. 

JavaScript doesn’t support direct use of recursion without special syntax constructs, but ES6 introduces several features that make it easier to work with recursion including arrow functions, generators, and async/await functions. These features allow us to create more elegant and expressive solutions to common recursion patterns in JavaScript.

## 2.2 Terminology
Before diving deeper into writing recursive functions in JavaScript, let's first understand some terminologies related to recursion:
### 2.2.1 Stack Frame
A stack frame is a region of memory allocated for a single function call. Each stack frame consists of three components: local variables, operand stack, and return address(pointer). As the function executes, additional stack frames are created and pushed onto the call stack to store the state of each nested function call. When a function completes executing, its corresponding stack frame is removed from the call stack. If the function calls another function, a new stack frame is added to the top of the stack.
