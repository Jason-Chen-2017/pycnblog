Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been shown to be highly effective at generating high-quality images in many fields such as computer vision, image synthesis, and music generation. However, they are mostly used for unsupervised learning, which means that the generator model learns the mapping from a random noise input vector to an output image, without being guided by any labeled examples or human annotations. In order to apply GANs to real-world painting tasks, we need to introduce some modifications into the models to ensure that they can generate diverse paintings with different styles and characteristics.
In this article, we will present a comprehensive overview of recent advances on using GANs in painting applications. Firstly, we will discuss what are the challenges involved in applying GANs to painting tasks, including the limited dataset size, the ambiguity of style transfer, and the difficulty of capturing both fine and coarse details. Then, we will provide a detailed analysis of several GAN architectures designed specifically for painting applications, ranging from simple convolutional networks to more complex ones based on transformers and VAEs. Finally, we will highlight potential issues and future directions for further research in this field. We hope that our paper provides valuable insights to researchers who want to use GANs to improve their artistic production capabilities.



# 2.背景介绍
In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become popular tools for generating images, videos, and other visual contents. These models consist of two neural networks called "generator" and "discriminator", where the former takes a latent space input and generates an image, while the latter is responsible for determining whether the generated image is fake or not. The main idea behind GANs is to train these two networks against each other iteratively so that the discriminator can correctly classify between the true data distribution and the synthetic one generated by the generator. During training, the generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating samples that look real, while the discriminator should learn to distinguish them from the true data.
Recently, there has also been much interest in using GANs to create visually compelling paintings. This line of research is particularly exciting because it enables artists to produce unique work without having to spend large amounts of time preparing raw content like textures, colors, and shapes. It also allows designers to experiment with new ideas and techniques, making creativity more accessible than ever before.
However, despite the tremendous success of GANs in various domains, there still exist some limitations when trying to use them for painting applications. One major challenge is the lack of sufficient annotated datasets. As mentioned earlier, GANs require massive amounts of unlabeled data for training, and even though there are some projects such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, they cover only a small part of the possible painting styles. Therefore, the quality and diversity of the generated results cannot be guaranteed. Another challenge lies in the uncertainty caused by adversarial training. Since the goal of GANs is to map a random input vector to a sample with similar properties but not necessarily identical, it may sometimes lead to suboptimal solutions and lead to unexpected outcomes. To mitigate these challenges, researchers are currently exploring ways to overcome the adversarial defenses and encourage the generator to generate images that resemble the original painting style rather than just mimic its appearance.


To address these challenges, we propose a series of modifications that were applied to standard GANs to enable them to generate diverse and consistent paintings. Specifically, we focus on four key areas: Dataset, Style Transfer, Detail Extraction, and Quality Evaluation. Let's go through each of these topics individually.

One of the most critical requirements for using GANs for painting applications is a high-quality dataset containing a wide range of styles and characteristics. Although some public datasets already contain thousands of images, there remains a significant gap between the variety of styles and detail exhibited by traditional paintings and the images captured by modern cameras. Thus, in order to develop robust painting generators, we need to collect additional data from the web or purchase specialized painting instruments. Despite the existence of many well-annotated datasets, we argue that it is crucial to build a customizable pipeline for collecting, annotating, and processing the data. By creating guidelines and best practices, we aim to make it easier for anyone to contribute to the growing collection of painting data available online. Moreover, we suggest leveraging existing annotation tools and platforms to increase productivity and allow non-experts to participate in the process.

The second issue we need to address is how to handle the ambiguous nature of the style transfer problem. When we refer to paintings with specific themes, we usually mean abstract concepts like landscapes, skyscrapers, or animals, whereas when we talk about digital paintings, we usually describe the overall tone or mood. Accordingly, it becomes challenging for a generative system to capture all the relevant aspects of a painting accurately. In fact, it has been shown that GANs trained solely on color imagery perform poorly on tasks requiring precise stylization, such as transferring the texture of a scene from one medium to another. Additionally, although GANs can learn to draw multiple objects with distinct styles, they cannot represent rich spatial relationships within a single picture, which makes it difficult to reproduce the structure and arrangement of a painting accurately.


To address this issue, we propose a hybrid approach that combines GANs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our architecture involves three components: first, we use CNNs to extract features from the given reference painting; then, we pass those features as inputs to the GAN generator network alongside a randomly sampled latent code; finally, we combine the generated output with the extracted features and refine the result using additional layers of the CNN network. This hybrid approach effectively transfers the appealing qualities of the reference painting while maintaining its structural features and adding interesting details to enhance the overall composition.

Another essential aspect of painting is accurate detail extraction. Within the context of GANs, this refers to the task of identifying and extracting finer details that would otherwise obscure the overall shape and texture of a painting. This requires considering both low-level features such as edges and textures, as well as higher-level features such as curves and patterns. On the one hand, the CNN-based encoder-decoder component of our proposed hybrid architecture can take advantage of recent advancements in deep learning to achieve accurate feature representation. On the other hand, we can use a segmentation network to identify regions of interest within the generated output that could potentially contain more fine-grained detail. Overall, incorporating the right combination of machine learning techniques can significantly aid in achieving high-quality detail extraction.

Finally, the last key area we consider is quality evaluation. While the previous steps help us generate consistently styled paintings, they do not guarantee that the final outcome looks realistic enough to satisfy the audience’s needs. In particular, deviations from the target style due to artifacts or inconsistent lighting conditions can negatively impact the enjoyability of a painting. To address this concern, we need to rely on metrics such as perceptual quality metrics, which measure the similarity between two images under different viewing conditions. By combining different computational models and techniques, we can evaluate the performance of our GAN-powered painting generator across different domains, such as stroke and texture quality, palette consistency, and naturalness.



# 7.总结
In summary, this article presents a general review of recent advances on using GANs in painting applications. We reviewed the major challenges involved in this application, discussed several GAN architectures suitable for painting tasks, provided a comprehensive explanation of the hybrid approach that combines GANs and CNNs, introduced several methods for handling the style transfer and detail extraction problems, and highlighted potential issues and future directions for further research in this field. Ultimately, our objective was to present a better understanding of the current state of the art in GAN-based painting generation and offer guidance to researchers looking to leverage GANs for improved artistic production capabilities.
