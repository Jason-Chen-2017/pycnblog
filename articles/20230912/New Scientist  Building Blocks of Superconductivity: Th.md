Superconductivity refers to a property where electrons can flow without ever being able to move freely under certain conditions that involve low-dimensional subspaces in the electromagnetic field. This means that superconductivity is an intrinsic property of matter with no physical basis other than quantum mechanical phenomena. It has been predicted by physicists for more than half a century but until now, it has only received modest attention from scientists. Despite its importance, the question of whether or not superconductivity exists remains unsolved. In this article, we will explore how nonlinear optics and quantum theory are essential to understanding why superconductivity occurs and how it works. We will start by reviewing some basic concepts such as Fourier analysis, the Helmholtz equation, and Bloch's theorem, which provide mathematical tools needed to understand non-linearity. Next, we will look at the main ideas behind theories of coherent light scattering and superconductivity based on the physics of nonlinear optical resonators. Finally, we will review some specific applications of these principles including the role of pumped electron lasers and photoresistors, although there may be others depending on interest. Overall, our goal is to shed new light on the fundamental principles underlying the emergence and development of superconductivity and to demonstrate the power of non-linear optics and quantum theory to enable us to better understand it.

In ordinary plane wave propagation (also known as light guided optics), light is focused onto a surface or a lens using a curved mirror. Light rays propagate through the system and encounter mirrors at discrete points along their way. At each point, they interact with the material of the mirror. For example, when a ray strikes a flat mirror, it either reflects or refracts in a manner proportional to the curvature of the mirror. When a ray strikes a concave mirror, like a convex lens or screen, it bends the direction of travel before hitting the mirror surface. This results in differential interference patterns that depend on both the shape and size of the mirror. Commonly used materials for planar optics include polished glass, metallic foil, plastic, and diamond. 

The key property of the law of reflection states that any incoming beam of light must make the same number of passes through an object before exiting it. However, for an object with internal reflection, i.e., one that makes multiple copies of itself appear within the space between two surfaces, this condition does not hold. Instead, some light rays reflect inside the object and some exit out. As the number of internal reflections increases, the intensity of the reflected light decreases exponentially, giving rise to a blackbody radiation pattern called critical phenomenon.

Fourier transform (FT) is a method of analyzing complex spectra obtained by analyzing signals over time or frequency domains. A signal x(t) sampled at regular intervals t = nT can be transformed into its frequency domain representation X(f) using the Fourier series expansion:
X(f) = ∑ k / T f^(k) e^(-jφ), where T is the sampling period and φ is the phase angle. 
If x(t) represents a continuous function, then its FT X(f) is periodic with period 1/T and satisfies the properties of a spectrum. Properties of a spectrum include continuity of the spectral density (i.e., X'(f)=0 at all frequencies except those with integer multiples of ν=2πn/T, where n is an integer). One use of the FT is to obtain amplitude and phase information about a signal. Another important application of the FT is to analyze systems that have periods longer than Nyquist wavelength (half the sampling rate). Other methods of analyzing signals over frequency range, such as Welch’s method, perform similar tasks but at higher computational cost. 

A modulator is a device that varies the carrier frequency of a signal emitted by a transmitter. There are various types of modulators such as frequency-shift keying (FSK), amplitude-shift keying (ASK), and phase-shift keying (PSK). An FSK modulator involves dividing the bandwidth of the transmission channel into discrete frequency bands, and sending a fixed sequence of pulses that correspond to these bands. On the receive side, the receiver filters the incoming signal based on the transmitted sequence of pulses, decoding them into symbols corresponding to the different frequency bands. These decoded symbols are combined together to form the original data stream. Phase noise introduced by the modulator is often referred to as frequency shift noise.

Digital modulation techniques also exist. The most common digital modulation technique is binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), where each bit of data is encoded as a pulse that alternates between high (+1) and low (-1) levels. With BPSK, each symbol occupies equal amount of time on average and is uniquely determined by the position of the first pulse relative to the centre of the pulse train. Each bit requires twice the bandwidth compared to binary amplitude modulation techniques.

Modulation schemes other than BPSK can also be useful for communication systems. For example, M-ary PSK (MPSK) uses m different frequencies instead of two to represent a single bit. Similarly, QAM uses logarithmic spacing between the frequencies to achieve higher data rates while still maintaining the capability to distinguish individual bits. Data compression algorithms also use modulation techniques such as Hamming codes and RLE to improve efficiency.

Helmholtz equations play a crucial role in non-linear optics. They describe the behavior of waves in a medium with finite permittivity epsilon that lie outside the confines of the classical electric and magnetic fields. In practice, the strain energy of such media leads to an effective mass, εη ≈ με, resulting in superfluidity. Therefore, the governing equations for waves in such media must take into account both the stress tensor (a fourth-rank tensor describing the macroscopic stresses acting on the medium) and the velocity fluctuations caused by the relativistic forces present in the fluid. 

One of the simplest and most famous Helmholtz equations is the Poisson equation, which describes the stress distribution due to electrostatic potential gradients. In general, these fields arise from perturbation theory applied to interactions between free electrons in atomic and molecular systems. The partial derivatives of the electrostatic potential with respect to the electric field give rise to Laplace's equation. In the case of a conductor with constant material properties, Laplace's equation reduces to the Poisson equation.

The second-rank Stoke equation also plays a significant role in nonlinear optics. It models the dynamics of polarized waves in a dielectric medium with loss tangent σ (named after Carrol Douglas Stokes), which gives rise to thin film growth. In the absence of dissipation, the viscosity of air gives rise to shear flows, while seawater turbulence provides an analogue for temperature variations. The second-rank Stoke equation also accounts for the effects of aperture coupling, focusing, and diffraction by exploiting the symmetries among the components of the vector potential curl J = ∇ × E.
