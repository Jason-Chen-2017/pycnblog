# 1.简介
  

Gradient descent is a popular and widely used optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. In this article we will introduce three gradient descent optimization algorithms: steepest descent (SD), conjugate gradient (CG) and quasi-Newton method (QN). We also compare these three methods using some standard test functions. Additionally, we discuss their convergence properties and choose the best one for our problem at hand. Finally, we provide code examples in Python to demonstrate how to use these algorithms for solving real problems. This work can serve as an educational resource for machine learning beginners and advanced practitioners alike.

## 2.1 Optimization Problem
Optimization problem is defined as finding the input values that minimize or maximize a given objective function subject to certain constraints on the variables. The goal is to find optimal solutions with respect to some criterion, such as minimizing cost, maximizing revenue, satisfying KPIs, etc. Mathematically, an optimization problem consists of two parts:

1. Objective function $f(x)$: It is a scalar value that represents the utility or fitness of a solution x. Depending on whether it needs to be minimized or maximized, the sign of f(x) determines whether the goal is to minimize or maximize f(x). 

2. Constraints $\phi_i(x)\leq c_i,\ i=1,...,m$ ($c_i>0$) : These are additional restrictions placed on the search space by defining equality or inequality conditions on the variable vectors. If any constraint condition is not satisfied, then the corresponding solution is called feasible and should be rejected from consideration. 

For example, consider the following optimization problem:
$$\min_{x \in R^n} f(x)= \frac{1}{2}\|Ax-b\|^2$$ where A is a matrix of size n*m and b is a vector of length m, and let us assume that $A^TA$ is invertible. Then the optimal solution to this problem satisfies
$$x^*=A^Tb=(A^TA)^{-1}A^Tb=A^{+}b$$where $A^{+}=A(A^TA)^{-1}$ denotes the pseudo-inverse of $A$. Solving for $x$, we get
$$x=\underset{\text{vector }x}{\arg\min }\frac{1}{2}\|Ax-b\|^2\quad s.t.\ \phi_i(x)\leq c_i,\ i=1,..,m$$Here we have assumed that the constraints $\phi_i(x)\leq c_i$ apply only when $i<m$. For simplicity, we have written all parameters explicitly here but they can vary depending on the specific problem being solved. Thus, we need to identify suitable values for the parameters $x_0$ and constants $a,b$ in order to solve the above optimization problem accurately.

## 2.2 Gradients and Directional Derivatives
The key idea behind most gradient descent optimization algorithms is the calculation of gradients or directional derivatives of the objective function with respect to the variables. Let $\nabla f(x)$ denote the gradient of the objective function $f(x)$ evaluated at point $x$, which gives the direction of steepest increase of $f(x)$ along each coordinate axis. Mathematically, if we have found the local minimum or maximum of the objective function $f(x)$, then there exists a unique direction $\Delta x$ such that $$f(x+\alpha\Delta x)\geq f(x)+\alpha\nabla f(x)^T\Delta x.$$ Here $\alpha$ is some positive step size parameter that controls the distance traveled along the direction $\Delta x$. In other words, we move away from the current position $x$ towards the minimum along the direction $\Delta x$ until the slope becomes zero, at which point the minimum has been found. Therefore, the next iteration of the optimization algorithm starts from the new starting point $(x+\alpha\Delta x)$, and calculates the gradient $\nabla f(x+\alpha\Delta x)$ based on this new location.

Directional derivatives play a crucial role in calculating the gradient of the objective function. They help determine the exact direction of the fastest change in the output of the function for any given input. Mathematically, a directional derivative $\mathrm{D}_\xi f(x;\eta)$ is defined as $$\mathrm{D}_\xi f(x;\eta)=\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\epsilon\eta)-f(x)}{\epsilon}.$$ Here $\eta$ is a unit vector in the direction of interest, while $\epsilon$ is a small number that controls the level of approximation. Intuitively, the directional derivative measures the rate of change of $f$ at a point $x$ in the direction $\eta$, expressed as a scalar factor relative to the scale of $\epsilon$. Hence, large directional derivatives indicate increasingly rapid changes in the output of the function as we approach the limit of small perturbations in that direction.

## 2.3 Conjugate Gradient Method
Conjugate gradient method (CG) is another popular optimization algorithm for solving unconstrained optimization problems. It belongs to the family of iterative methods because it repeatedly applies the directional updates generated by applying the negative of the gradient of the objective function, starting from an initial guess $x_0$. However, unlike traditional gradient descent techniques, CG uses the Hessian matrix of the objective function instead of its gradient. 

In more technical terms, the CG method maintains an auxiliary variable $\delta_k$ that records the direction of the previous update step. At each iteration k, the algorithm computes the product of the inverse Hessian matrix of $f(\cdot)$ and $\delta_k$ to obtain a new search direction $\beta_k$, which is directly conjugate to $\delta_{k-1}$. Specifically, if $\gamma_k$ is an eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix, then $\beta_k = (\gamma_k/\overline{\gamma}_{k-1})\delta_{k-1}$, where $\overline{\gamma}_{k-1}$ is the previous estimate of the largest eigenvector of the Hessian matrix. Similarly, if $\lambda_{k-1}$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $\Gamma_k$ that contains the previous direction $\delta_{k-1}$, $\beta_k = (\lambda_{k-1}/\lambda_{k-1}) \delta_{k-1}$, where $\Gamma_k$ is formed by stacking the previous directions up to $k$. Consequently, the $\beta_k$ obtained from a particular $\delta_k$ ensures conjugacy among all previously considered directions.

Once $\beta_k$ is computed, the CG method generates a new search step $\alpha_k$ as follows: $$\alpha_k=\dfrac{\|\beta_k\|_2^2}{\|\delta_{k-1}\|_2^2}$$ and moves along the line segment connecting $x_k$ and $x_{k-1}$ in the direction of $\beta_k$ scaled by $\alpha_k$. Recall that since the Hessian matrix is always symmetric and positive semidefinite, it has a unique set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Therefore, once $\alpha_k$ is determined, the next step is just $\Delta x_k=\alpha_k\beta_k$.

To avoid numerical errors due to division by zero or computational instability caused by non-smoothness of $f(\cdot)$, the CG method often requires regularization of the objective function to make it well-conditioned. One common strategy is adding a small positive term to the diagonal entries of the Hessian matrix, thus promoting stability and improving convergence rates.

Finally, CG may converge much slower than steepest descent due to its dependence on computing products of matrices. On the other hand, it can handle non-convex optimization problems better compared to steepest descent, especially when the geometry of the optimization surface allows it to escape saddle points more readily.
