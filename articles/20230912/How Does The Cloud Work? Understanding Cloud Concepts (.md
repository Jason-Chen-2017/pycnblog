# 2.Background Introduction
Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of computing resources over the internet through a web service. Cloud computing has become a significant technology area since its introduction during the early 2000s, leading to massive growth and increased usage among businesses worldwide.

Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server, effectively allowing users to purchase more powerful servers when needed while still sharing resources between them. Virtualization technology includes hypervisors which create and manage virtual machines, including VMware ESX/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Citrix XenServer, and Amazon EC2. Each VM runs independently within the host machine, providing a flexible environment for running different applications, such as Windows, Linux, and SQL Server.

With the advent of cloud computing, businesses can now access scalable computing power, storage capacity, and networking capabilities without having to invest heavily in hardware or software licenses. They only need to pay for the resources they actually use, making it easier than ever to experiment and try new technologies.


# 3.Basic Concepts And Terminology
## 3.1 Virtualization
Virtualization refers to the process of creating virtual versions of real-world devices or objects, such as computers, networks, or data centers. It involves creating a layer of abstraction between the actual system and its users, enabling them to interact with the virtual version of the device rather than the physical one. The aim is to increase resource utilization and reduce wastage of physical resources.

There are two main categories of virtualization: hardware-assisted and software-assisted. Hardware-assisted virtualization relies on dedicated hardware components called virtualization hosts, which emulate underlying hardware functionality. Examples include VMware ESX/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Oracle VirtualBox. Software-assisted virtualization uses guest operating systems to simulate the behavior of virtualized hardware, known as virtual machines. Popular examples include QEMU, KVM, and VirtualBox.

Each type of virtualization provides unique benefits, depending on factors such as application compatibility, performance, security, and ease of use. For example, most modern operating systems support virtualization, making migration from one physical machine to another seamless. Additionally, virtual machines offer greater portability and mobility compared to bare metal servers, making it easier to migrate or resize existing workloads.

## 3.2 IaaS - Infrastructure As A Service
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to the provision of computing infrastructure on demand, typically over the internet. It offers a wide range of resources such as compute, storage, databases, and networking capabilities. Users simply rent out their needs, making it easy for organizations to quickly scale up or down as needed. IaaS providers often provide managed hosting solutions, meaning they handle all necessary tasks such as patching, backups, and maintenance automatically, making it even simpler for users to focus on building their applications.

Some common IaaS platforms include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. AWS provides a variety of virtual machine options ranging from small instances suitable for testing to powerful servers suitable for production environments. GCP offers a similar selection of services but focuses on enterprise needs such as Big Data and Machine Learning. Microsoft Azure also offers a range of services, including both IaaS and PaaS options.

IaaS companies tend to charge a subscription fee per month, plus a monthly base rate for using any additional services beyond the free tier. Some providers also offer discounts or credits if the user stays within certain usage limits or meets certain criteria. Overall, IaaS offers a high degree of flexibility and scalability, making it ideal for rapid prototyping, developing applications, and conducting large-scale experiments.

## 3.3 PaaS - Platform As A Service
Platform as a service (PaaS) refers to the deployment and management of a full development and runtime environment, typically hosted on the cloud provider's infrastructure. Developers can deploy their code and make updates without worrying about configuring and managing the entire environment themselves. Instead, they can simply upload their source code and configure settings, which can be saved as reusable templates.

Common PaaS vendors include IBM Bluemix, Oracle Cloud Foundry, SAP Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. These providers allow developers to easily select from a range of preconfigured runtime environments, such as Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Java EE. Their tools also automate many of the common DevOps activities, such as deploying code changes, scaling out or in, and handling failures. Despite the complexity of these environments, PaaS can significantly reduce development time and costs, especially for teams working collaboratively.

Despite their convenience, PaaS should be used judiciously and with caution, as they introduce potential security risks, maintainance overhead, and limit the amount of control that developers have over their applications. Therefore, it's important to monitor activity closely and take steps to mitigate any potential threats or breaches.

## 3.4 SaaS - Software As A Service
Software as a service (SaaS) refers to applications that are hosted online and accessed through a web browser. Customers do not download or install anything locally, instead opting to access the service through a web browser. SaaS companies sell subscriptions to users who can then access the product securely via the internet.

Examples of SaaS products include Google Docs, Salesforce, Zoho, and GitHub. Users subscribe to these services and get access to a range of functionalities, including calendaring, email, file sharing, and customer relationship management. Despite being hosted online, SaaS applications remain tightly integrated with the company's internal IT systems, meaning it's difficult to completely decouple them from the rest of the organization.

SaaS is generally cheaper to use than traditional on-premise deployments, as there are no physical servers or local installations required. However, it requires constant monitoring, maintenance, and updates, limiting the ability to customize the solution for specific business requirements. It's crucial to regularly update and upgrade accounts to ensure ongoing access and reliability.

## 3.5 FaaS - Function As A Service
Function as a service (FaaS) refers to an execution environment where individual functions or microservices execute in response to events, without requiring human intervention. Functions can either be executed directly by a client or triggered by other FaaS platforms. FaaS platforms typically utilize event-driven architecture models to provide automatic scaling, fault tolerance, and resilience to unexpected load spikes. Common FaaS providers include AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.

FaaS is designed for rapid development, test automation, and integration of cloud-based systems. However, it poses several challenges, such as vendor lock-in and lack of control over function configuration, restricting its usefulness in critical domains such as healthcare. Additionally, automated failover mechanisms can result in significant downtime and delay in recovery, making it unsuitable for mission-critical applications.

Ultimately, FaaS represents a novel approach to developing and delivering applications that could greatly benefit businesses looking to minimize risk, speed up time to market, and maximize value creation. With improved visibility into application performance, the right combination of cloud technologies and best practices can enable enterprises to realize their full potential.
