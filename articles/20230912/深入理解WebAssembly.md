# 1.简介
  

WebAssembly（简称Wasm）是一个体系结构层面上的新兴语言，它描述了一种底层字节码指令集，可以运行在现代浏览器、服务端和嵌入式设备上。WebAssembly旨在取代JavaScript，成为下一代客户端开发语言。通过这种方式，WebAssembly将使得网页应用更快，更小，更安全。WebAssembly由Mozilla基金会的创始人之一李靖一起领导设计开发。2017年9月，Mozilla宣布，Firefox 57将支持WebAssembly。近日，Mozilla联合WebAssembly促进基金会发起了一个活动，推动WebAssembly标准制定工作取得重大进展。此次活动得到了许多开发者和厂商的支持，包括英伟达、AMD、微软、IBM等知名芯片厂商。
# 2.为什么要学习WebAssembly？
WebAssembly迅速崛起，引起了越来越多人的关注。越来越多的公司和组织选择移植WebAssembly作为其产品的核心技术之一，如Google，苹果，微软，Facebook等，并希望能够在较短的时间内得到广泛应用。WebAssembly可以让前端开发人员可以用类似C/C++等语言快速编写复杂的计算密集型应用程序，并在浏览器中运行，以提升用户体验和性能。为了充分利用WebAssembly带来的巨大优势，你需要对其内部机制有比较全面的了解，并且掌握相应编程技能。学习WebAssembly可以帮助你深刻地理解它如何工作，解决你的实际问题。另外，WebAssembly也正在吸引越来越多的企业和组织的关注，这也使得WebAssembly的普及和发展变得越来越迫切。
# 3.WebAssembly概述
WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is meant to be an alternative to JavaScript, enabling more efficient and flexible code execution in the browser. WebAssembly has wide support among modern web browsers and other programming languages have incorporated it as their primary compilation target, such as Rust, C++, Go, Swift, etc. The syntax of Wasm modules closely resembles that of WebAssembly text format, which enables easy interoperability between different tools and compilers. Moreover, Wasm modules can be easily embedded into HTML pages through various mechanisms, including <script type="module"> tags or import statements.
The current version of WebAssembly includes several features:

1. Types: Wasm supports multiple value types with size constraints on integers, floats, and other values. This allows for better control over memory usage, reducing the need for runtime checks.
2. Efficiency: Wasm has been designed from the ground up to be both compact and fast, while still providing a high level of abstraction. This means that most applications can run at native speed without significant performance losses due to interpreter overhead. Additionally, the use of typed arrays makes data access efficient and safe, and many operations are implemented natively in hardware.
3. Memory: Wasm provides memory management capabilities similar to other compiled languages. Modules can request memory up front and allocate regions using linear memory instructions. Linear memory is highly optimized and takes advantage of platform specific optimizations, such as multi-threading or DMA engines.
4. Control flow and garbage collection: Wasm has support for structured control flow constructs like loops, if-else statements, and break/continue statements. Garbage collection ensures that unused resources are automatically deallocated, reducing memory fragmentation and making it easier to manage memory in large programs.
5. Standardization: Wasm is an open standard being developed by a community of developers and vendors. Anyone can propose new additions to the language specification, which then undergoes formal review before becoming part of the official standard. Despite its young age, Wasm already supports a range of features that are useful in practice.
6. Platform interoperability: Wasm modules can be executed by any host environment that implements the Wasm engine, regardless of operating system, architecture, or underlying hardware. This means that Wasm code can be ported across platforms without requiring source code changes or special configuration options. 
7. Security: Wasm offers built-in security measures, including sandboxing, reference types, bounds checking, and pointer validation. These features help prevent exploits and ensure safety when running untrusted code.

Overall, WebAssembly is expected to become a fundamental building block for client-side development, unlocking the full potential of computing power available today. With its widespread adoption, we expect Wasm to continue growing in popularity and impact.
