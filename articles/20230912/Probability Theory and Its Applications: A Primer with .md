# 1.简介
  

Probability theory is a mathematical field that studies the likelihood of different outcomes in an uncertain environment or system. It has applications across numerous fields such as finance, biology, medicine, and economics. In this article, we will learn about probability theory by applying it to real-world problems related to optimization. Specifically, we will consider two popular optimization techniques - gradient descent and Newton's method - and demonstrate how they can be used for finding global optima.

We assume readers have some familiarity with basic concepts such as variables, functions, vectors, and matrices, but are not required to understand their full mathematical implications. Furthermore, we do not go into depth on all topics mentioned in the book, so readers should refer to other resources if interested in learning more.

This primer does not include a complete treatment of advanced topics like random variables, stochastic processes, statistics, etc., but rather focuses on the key ideas and methods involved in using probability theory for optimization. We hope this primer serves as a useful starting point for researchers working in machine learning and related areas who want to apply probabilistic tools to solve challenging optimization problems.

# 2.Background Introduction
Optimization refers to the process of finding the best solution (i.e., values for the input parameters) for a given objective function. Common examples of optimization problems include finding the minimum value of a function, maximizing profit while minimizing cost, solving systems of equations, and designing products. The goal is to find the values of the input parameters that lead to the optimal output under certain constraints.

The task of finding optimal solutions has always been central to scientific research since ancient times. Mathematical optimization is considered one of the most important areas of applied mathematics, yet its practical application is limited due to the complexity of many problem instances. Traditional numerical algorithms often require large numbers of iterations, make use of expensive computational resources, and cannot handle large-scale problems efficiently.

To address these issues, modern optimization algorithms have emerged which leverage various probabilistic principles to perform efficient search for optimal solutions. Some popular techniques involve gradient descent, Newton's method, quasi-Newton methods, trust region methods, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization. These methods are capable of handling large-scale problems, converge to local optima within few iterations, and exhibit good performance even when the initial guess is far from the true solution.

In this primer, we will focus on gradient descent and Newton's method and show how they can be used to find global optima for simple unconstrained optimization problems. We also discuss their limitations and potential pitfalls, and provide insights into how they work mathematically. Finally, we explore a specific example where gradient descent fails to converge and shows why it may happen in practice.

# 3.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Variables, Functions, and Vectors
Variables represent physical quantities such as temperature, position, velocity, force, etc., that vary over time. They are usually denoted by lowercase letters, e.g., x, y, z, t, u, v.

Functions map input variables to output variables, representing the dependence between the inputs and outputs. For instance, f(x,y)=2x+3y represents a linear function that maps two input variables (x and y) to a single output variable (f). Another example would be the logistic sigmoid function g(z)=1/(1+exp(-z)), which maps any input variable (in this case, z) to a probability value between 0 and 1.

Vectors represent multivariate quantities such as positions, momenta, velocities, forces, torques, etc., that typically have multiple components associated with each degree of freedom. Vectors can be either column or row vectors, depending on whether the vector elements are arranged horizontally (column vectors) or vertically (row vectors). They are commonly represented by boldface capital letters, e.g., X, Y, Z, T, U, V.

## Matrices
Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that allow us to represent complex relationships between sets of variables and/or functions. Each matrix element depends on a combination of rows and columns. The number of rows and columns determines the dimensions of the matrix. For example, let M be a 3x2 matrix where:

    [ a b ]
    [ c d ]
    [ e f ]
    
Then a=M[1][1], b=M[1][2], c=M[2][1], d=M[2][2], e=M[3][1], f=M[3][2]. 

Matrices can be used to represent linear transformations such as rotation and scaling operations, or polynomial approximations. Matrix multiplication allows us to combine two matrices into larger ones, and can also be used to evaluate the derivative of a composite function.

# 4.Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a scalar function of one or more variables. The idea behind gradient descent is to move in the direction opposite to the gradient of the function at each step, until convergence is reached or a maximum number of iterations is reached. Here are the steps for implementing gradient descent in Python:

1. Initialize the input parameters randomly.
2. Compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to each parameter.
3. Update the parameters according to the negative gradient multiplied by a small step size (known as the learning rate), i.e.,
   `parameters -= learning_rate * grad`
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence or max_iter is reached.

Here is the implementation of gradient descent in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def compute_grad(loss_func, params):
    """Computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter."""
    return np.array([np.sum((loss_func(params + epsilon) - loss_func(params)) / epsilon)
                     for epsilon in epsilons])

def update_params(params, grads, learning_rate):
    """Updates the parameters based on the negative gradient and the learning rate."""
    return params - learning_rate * grads

def gradient_descent(loss_func, init_params, num_iters, learning_rate, verbose=True):
    """Runs gradient descent to optimize the parameters of the loss function."""
    params = init_params
    prev_loss = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(num_iters):
        grads = compute_grad(loss_func, params)
        params = update_params(params, grads, learning_rate)
        
        # Check for convergence
        curr_loss = loss_func(params)
        if abs(curr_loss - prev_loss) < tol:
            break
        else:
            prev_loss = curr_loss
            
        # Print progress
        if verbose:
            print("Iter {}: Loss = {}".format(i+1, curr_loss))
            
    return params
```

Note that the above code uses finite differences to approximate the gradients. This approach works well for smooth loss functions, but can be less accurate for non-smooth loss functions. Alternative approaches such as Hessian updates, conjugate gradient descent, or L-BFGS can improve the accuracy of gradient descent for non-convex loss functions.

Now let's look at an example where gradient descent may fail to converge. Consider the following optimization problem:

Suppose you have a coffee maker that starts making latte's every minute. You want to keep the temperature below 20 degrees Celsius without exceeding your budget. At each minute, there is a chance that the customer orders another cup of latte. Assuming that the cost of producing a new latte is 10 cents per unit, what should be the optimal schedule? 

First, we need to define our objective function, which takes the current temperature and returns the total amount spent on lattes up to that point:

```python
def cost(temp, history=[]):
    """Returns the total cost of lattes up to the current timepoint."""
    return sum(10 * temp for _ in history)
    
def get_schedule():
    """Generates an optimal schedule for producing lattes under the constraint of keeping the temperature below 20 degC."""
    temp = 20   # Initial temperature
    
    def objective(t):
        """Objective function for choosing the next temperature."""
        return min(cost(t, history), cost(max(t -.5, 0), history))
        
    # Run gradient descent to choose the optimal temperature schedule
    opt_schedule = []
    while True:
        history = list(range(len(opt_schedule)))
        schedule = gradient_descent(objective, temp, 10**4, 0.01)
        temp = round(schedule)

        opt_schedule += [(round(t), False) for t in schedule]
        last_added = len(history)-1
        
        if last_added >= 2:
            delta_T = opt_schedule[-last_added][0] - opt_schedule[-last_added-1][0]
            
            if abs(delta_T) <= 0.5 and opt_schedule[-last_added][1]:
                # Temperature difference too small, reject the last added temperature and try again
                del opt_schedule[-last_added:]
            elif delta_T > 0 and opt_schedule[-last_added][0] == opt_schedule[-last_added-1][0]+0.5:
                # Reject adding a second level cooldown period after adjusting the previous cooldown period
                del opt_schedule[-last_added:]
                
            elif delta_T < 0 and opt_schedule[-last_added][0] == opt_schedule[-last_added-1][0]-0.5:
                # Accept decreasing the temperature before increasing the cooldown period
                opt_schedule[-last_added-1] = (opt_schedule[-last_added-1][0]-0.5, True)
                continue
        elif last_added == 1:
            # Adjust the cooldown period before increasing the temperature
            if opt_schedule[-last_added][0] == opt_schedule[-last_added-1][0]+0.5:
                continue
            elif opt_schedule[-last_added][0] == opt_schedule[-last_added-1][0]-0.5:
                opt_schedule[-last_added-1] = (opt_schedule[-last_added-1][0]-0.5, True)
                continue
        
        # Add the latest scheduled temperature
        opt_schedule += [(round(schedule[0]), True)]
            
        break

    return sorted(opt_schedule)
```

Here, we use gradient descent to optimize the temperature schedule for production of lattes while satisfying the constraint of maintaining the temperature below 20 degrees Celsius. Since the costs increase quadratically with temperature, gradient descent converges slowly and does not reach a satisfactory result. Instead, it keeps repeating periods of constant temperature followed by periods of increased cooldown, resulting in suboptimal scheduling decisions. Note that in reality, factors beyond temperature such as humidity and power usage might also influence the cost of lattes, and further complicate the problem. Nevertheless, gradient descent is still a powerful tool for solving constrained optimization problems with continuous variables.
