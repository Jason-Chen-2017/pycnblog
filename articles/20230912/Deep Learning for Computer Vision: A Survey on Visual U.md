# 1.简介
  

Deep learning has made significant progress in computer vision over the past years. Many researchers have proposed novel algorithms to improve image recognition accuracy and object detection performance. This survey provides a comprehensive review of deep learning techniques that are applied to visual understanding and recognition tasks. The aim is to provide an overview of current methods and challenges, as well as future directions and applications. We start by reviewing popular approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers. Then we cover state-of-the-art techniques based on these models including efficient architectures, advanced data augmentation strategies, and fine-tuning strategies. Next, we focus on new techniques that leverage multiple modalities, e.g., RGB images, depth information, or skeleton sequences. Finally, we summarize some open problems related to these topics, including limited robustness to noise, large memory requirements, and handling long videos. Overall, this survey can serve as a useful reference for both practitioners and researchers looking to advance the state of the art in computer vision.
# 2.基本概念和术语说明
Before diving into the details of deep learning techniques applied to computer vision, let’s briefly discuss basic concepts and terms used in the field.

Image
An image refers to a two-dimensional array of pixel values representing light intensity at various spatial locations. In color images, each pixel is associated with three primary colors (red, green, blue) which together form the image. Grayscale images represent a single channel of gray color where each pixel represents a shade of gray. Image resolution indicates the number of pixels along one side of the image. Images can be stored either as digital images or as vector graphics. Digital images are usually represented using numerical arrays while vector graphics are composed of geometric shapes and fill patterns.

Feature extraction
Feature extraction is a process of identifying and extracting features from an image that help to describe its content or distinguish it from other similar images. Features can include edges, corners, textures, and shapes. Feature detectors like Harris corner detector, SIFT feature detector, or ORB keypoint detector are widely used to extract interesting points on an image. They first detect interest points on the image and then apply descriptor functions to extract their corresponding descriptions.

Classifier
A classifier takes input features extracted from an image and produces an output classification label indicating what the image depicts. Classifiers are typically trained on a dataset consisting of labeled training examples, where each example contains an input image and a target class label. Popular classifiers include support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forests, and deep learning models such as CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. 

Region proposal algorithm
A region proposal algorithm generates a set of candidate regions on an image that may contain objects of interest. These candidates may be generated manually by a human annotator or learned automatically through statistical modeling techniques such as clustering or graph cutting. The goal of RP algorithms is to select a small subset of high confidence regions that are likely to contain objects. Popular RP algorithms include Edge Boxes, Selective Search, Greedy Graphical Model, and Pyramid Scene Parsing Networks.

Object Detection
Object detection is the task of identifying and localizing distinct instances of objects in images. Object detectors produce bounding boxes around objects and classify them into different classes. Popular detectors include Single Shot Detector (SSD), YOLOv1/YOLOv2, Faster RCNN, and Mask R-CNN.

Instance Segmentation
Instance segmentation assigns a unique instance ID to every object detected in an image. It involves partitioning an image into multiple overlapping segments and associating each segment with an instance ID. Instance segmentation can help identify individual objects within scenes or videos, track them across frames, and perform downstream tasks like action recognition, anomaly detection, and tracking object trajectories. Popular instance segmentation techniques include Mask R-CNN, Decoupled IOU Loss, PixelLink, and EfficientDet.

Depth Estimation
Depth estimation refers to estimating the distance between objects and the camera in real-time. Depth maps capture the relative distances between objects and the camera’s optical axis. Depth estimation is commonly performed using stereo cameras or multi-view geometry. Popular depth estimation techniques include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ResNet, MobileNetV2, Deformable Convolutional Networks (DCNs), U-Net, Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation (SSME).

Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation aims to assign a semantic category to each pixel in an image. Semantic labels are not restricted to predefined categories but instead encode rich semantics such as “road”, “car”, “person”, etc. Semantic segmentation can play a crucial role in many applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, medical imaging, and surveillance systems. Popular semantic segmentation techniques include Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), Deeplab v3+, PSPNet, HRNet, and DenseASPP.

Video Analysis
Computer vision has benefited greatly from advances in hardware technology and increased computational power. With the advent of fast GPUs and cloud computing services, video analysis and processing has become feasible. Video analysis requires special attention because motion and appearance changes must be analyzed concurrently to understand scene content and generate accurate results. Researchers have developed several techniques to analyze videos using machine learning, including background subtraction, object tracking, event detection, activity recognition, and anomaly detection.
