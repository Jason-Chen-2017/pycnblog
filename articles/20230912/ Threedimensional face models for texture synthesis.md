Texture synthesis is a fundamental computer graphics technique that can be used to create realistic textures in computer generated images or videos. The goal of texture synthesis is to generate an image that appears to have some degree of spatial structure and appearance that reflects the geometry and topology of the object being modeled. Texture synthesis techniques are widely used in computer graphics applications such as video games, visual effects software, architecture visualization tools, and virtual reality environments. The two main categories of texture synthesis algorithms are statistical texture synthesis methods and procedural texture synthesis methods. In this article, we will discuss the use of three-dimensional (3D) face models for texture synthesis using both statistical and procedural approaches. We also provide examples of how these methods can be applied to different types of objects.

2.相关工作与背景介绍
Texture synthesis has been a popular topic in computer graphics research since the mid-eighties when Brownian motion texture synthesis was first proposed by Cline and Lewis[1]. These early works mainly focused on generating solid color or constant tones textures for polygonal surfaces, but they did not consider the varying structures induced by the mesh deformations and topological changes caused by complex surface morphing. Other related work includes Gaussian processes for texture modeling[2], continuous distance fields for mesh rendering[3], linear finite element method based texture synthesis[4] and multiresolution texture synthesis[5]. There are many other texture synthesis algorithms in various fields such as medical imaging, biology, and geology. In this paper, we focus specifically on using 3D face model representations for texture synthesis.

3.概念和术语的定义
In order to understand the concept behind texture synthesis using 3D face models, it is important to define several key terms and concepts:

  Polygonal Mesh: A polygonal mesh is a set of polygons connected together by edges and vertices. It represents a surface with consistent topology and geometry characteristics.
  
  Vertex Parameterization: Given a polygonal mesh, vertex parameterization maps each vertex in the mesh onto a unit interval, which is often referred to as the "u" coordinate. The domain [0,1] is mapped into the range [-1,1], where negative values correspond to points closer to the origin than positive values, and zero corresponds to the center point of the mesh. Similarly, the v coordinates map each vertex onto another unit interval, usually representing the height above or below a fixed base plane, known as the "v" coordinate. This mapping allows us to represent any part of the mesh uniformly using a pair of u and v coordinates.

  Face Center Parameterization: Instead of directly expressing the position of individual vertices, we can compute their positions relative to the centers of the faces to obtain more natural and intuitive results. For example, if a face lies between two vertices at a certain angle, then its center lies along the line segment connecting those two vertices, pointing towards the middle of the face. Thus, if a given vertex is inside one of the adjacent faces, the corresponding uv coordinates may lie anywhere within that face, while for vertices outside all adjacent faces, the uv coordinates may be assigned based on the closest face center.

  Barycentric Coordinates: Representing a point P in a triangle defined by its barycentric coordinates (w1, w2, w3), where w1 + w2 + w3 = 1, gives us information about its location within the triangle. Specifically, if w1+w2+w3=1, then P lies exactly on the edge OPQ, and w1, w2, and w3 specify the proportion of P's projection length over OPQ for each side of the triangle. If w1+w2+w3<1, then P does not lie strictly within the triangle. However, if w1+w2+w3>1, then P intersects the interior of the triangle.

  Faces Normals: Each face in the mesh has a normal vector that points outwards from the interior of the face. When applying UV mappings, we need to ensure that the normals are well-defined at every point on the mesh. Moreover, it is common practice to align the texture space so that the X axis goes through the mean vertex location, Y axis passes through the vertical axis, and Z axis completes a right-handed coordinate system. To enforce these constraints, we typically re-orient the face normals so that they always point towards the viewer regardless of the initial orientation of the object.

  Camera Parameters: Another key component of texture synthesis involves specifying camera parameters like focal length, field of view, and principal point. These control aspects such as depth of field, the area of attention captured by the camera, and perspective distortion introduced by the lens.

  Statistical Texture Synthesis Methods: A variety of statistical texture synthesis methods have been developed recently, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA)[6], Factor Analysis[7], Independent Component Analysis (ICA)[8], Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)[9], and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)[10]. These methods learn a low-rank representation of the data by projecting it into a smaller subspace using PCA or factor analysis, and then reconstructing the original signal using ICA, LDA, or MMSE. By using sparse prior knowledge about the distribution of signals, these methods produce high-quality texture maps without requiring detailed geometry or scene understanding. Some advantages of these methods include speed and simplicity compared to grid-based texture synthesis, reduced computation time due to sparsity constraint, and ability to handle large scale datasets efficiently.

  Procedural Texture Synthesis Methods: While statistical texture synthesis provides a powerful framework for synthesizing qualitatively accurate texture maps, it cannot account for variations in lighting conditions or subjective preferences in the final result. Therefore, procedural texture synthesis offers a new approach to texture synthesis that allows users to customize the resulting texture according to their specific requirements. Popular procedural texture synthesis methods include Perlin noise[11]-based techniques such as Cell Noise[12], Voronoi diagrams[13]-based techniques such as Worley noise[14], or fractals[15]-based techniques such as Marching Cubes[16]. These methods allow for creation of abstract patterns, human-like shapes, and natural textures without relying on explicit geometry descriptions.

4.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤
The core algorithmic ideas underlying texture synthesis using 3D face models are summarized here:

  1. Compute vertex parameterization of the mesh
  2. Assign each face a unique index value
  3. Estimate the face center positions using barycentric coordinates
  4. Re-orient face normals so they point towards the viewer
  5. Create a lookup table of texture values for each face center
  6. Sample random texture values for each pixel based on the face center locations and weights derived from statistical texture synthesis
  7. Use interpolation to fill in gaps left by sample artifacts
