# 1.简介
  

Docker is a popular open-source project that enables developers and administrators to easily package, deploy, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. Developers can work on the application code without worrying about setting up development environments or dealing with dependencies. The same applies for deployment as well. Containers help organizations break down monolithic applications into smaller modules which are easier to manage and update. In this article we will learn how to build a Docker image of our Java application and run it inside a container. We will also discuss some common issues and troubleshooting steps while running Java code inside a Docker container. 

This article assumes you have basic knowledge of Linux commands, working with Docker and Java programming language. If you need an introduction to these topics please refer to other resources such as tutorials, books, or online courses.

In summary, by following the instructions in this article you will be able to:

1. Build a Dockerfile for your Java application.
2. Create a Docker image from the Dockerfile using the docker build command.
3. Run the Docker image inside a container using the docker run command.
4. Test the application inside the container to ensure it works correctly.
5. Identify potential issues and troubleshoot them if necessary.
# 2.核心概念术语说明
Before diving deeper into building and deploying Java code inside a Docker container, let's first familiarize ourselves with some commonly used terms and concepts related to Docker and Java.

2.1. Container vs Virtual Machine (VM)
Containers and VMs are two separate technologies but they serve similar purposes. Both allow users to run applications in isolated environments. However, there are several key differences between the two technologies:

 - VM technology runs software on top of physical hardware, allowing multiple virtual machines to share the same underlying hardware resources. VMs provide a more powerful environment than containers since they offer access to more computing resources, including processors, memory, and storage devices. However, their overhead increases with increased resource usage due to shared resources.

 - Container technology shares the host operating system with other containers instead of requiring its own instance. This allows containers to start quickly and use less memory compared to full VMs. Additionally, containers do not require heavyweight hypervisors like those required by VMs.

2.2. Images vs Containers
A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone executable package that includes everything needed to run an application - the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. A Docker container, on the other hand, is a runtime instance of a Docker image. It runs essentially isolated from the rest of the system and only has access to the resources assigned to it. Unlike traditional virtual machine implementations where a new virtual machine instance is launched each time a virtual machine needs to be created, Docker uses layered filesystems to optimize disk usage and improve performance. 

2.3. Dockerfile
Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Each instruction usually starts with a keyword followed by arguments and flags. Docker reads these instructions and executes them to create the final image. Common Dockerfile commands include COPY, ADD, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, ENV, EXPOSE, FROM, LABEL, USER, VOLUME, WORKDIR.

2.4. Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a public cloud service provided by Docker Inc. It provides both public and private repositories for storing Docker images and sharing them with others. Users can search for available images and download prebuilt images from Docker Hub or push their own custom images. It offers various collaboration tools such as webhooks and Automated Builds to automate builds and deployments across multiple Docker hosts.

2.5. Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you define a YAML file that describes all the services and their dependencies. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your definition. This makes it easy to scale, upgrade, and redeploy your application components.

2.6. Dockerfile best practices
To keep things simple and efficient, we should follow some good practices when writing Dockerfiles:

 - Use a small base image with few layers to reduce the size of the final image.
 - Separate the different parts of the application into different images rather than combining them all into one large image.
 - Keep the number of layers small so that the rebuild process is fast.
 - Avoid installing unnecessary packages and data.
 
# 3.构建Dockerfile
Now that we've covered some background information about Docker and Java, let's dive into creating our Dockerfile!

Firstly, make sure you have installed Docker on your system before continuing. You can check this by typing `docker --version` in your terminal/command prompt.

Next, navigate to the directory containing your Java source files. For the purpose of this tutorial, let's assume the directory is named "myjavaapp". Once you're in the correct directory, create a new file named "Dockerfile" using the touch command:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

Open the Dockerfile in a text editor and add the following lines:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /build
COPY../
RUN javac Main.java && \
    mkdir target && \
    mv *.class target/classes

FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /build/target/.
CMD ["java", "-cp", ".:/app/lib/*", "Main"]
```
Here's what each line does:

1. `FROM`: Specifies the parent image to use. We'll start by using the official OpenJDK image. We specify version 8-jre-alpine because it comes bundled with a JRE rather than a JDK.

2. `AS`: Used to name intermediate build stages. Here, we have two stages: "builder" and "runtime." The "builder" stage compiles our Java code, copies it into a temporary location, and creates a new folder "/build/target/" containing compiled class files.

3. `WORKDIR`: Sets the current working directory inside the Docker image. By default, this would be set to "/root" but we want to change it to "/build" for the first stage and "/app" for the second stage.

4. `COPY../`: Copies all files from the local directory to the working directory ("/build").

5. `RUN`: Executes shell commands during the build process. In this case, we compile our main Java class and move the compiled class files into the "/build/target/" directory.

6. `FROM`: Restarts the build process using a fresh copy of the "openjdk:8-jre-alpine" image. Now that our compilation step is complete, we can start a new build stage called "runtime," based off of the same image.

7. `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory back to "/app" for the next stage.

8. `COPY --from=builder /build/target/.`: Copies the compiled class files from the previous build stage ("/build/target/") into the current working directory ("/app/"). This ensures that our final runtime image has the necessary classes to execute our app.

9. `CMD`: Specifies the default command to run when the Docker image is started. In this case, we run the java command with the appropriate classpath and classname to execute our main method within the Docker container.

That's it! Our Dockerfile is now ready to go. Next, we'll test it out to see if it works properly.
# 4.运行Dockerfile
Once we've built our Dockerfile, we can proceed to testing it. Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and type the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t myjavaapp.
```

The `-t` option specifies the tag to give our newly built image. `.` tells Docker to look in the current directory for the Dockerfile. After a few minutes, Docker should finish building the image and print out a message indicating success.

We can verify the image exists locally by listing all available images using the `docker images` command:

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
myjavaapp           latest              18d7dcdfbfdb        4 seconds ago       657MB
```

Now that the image is built, we can run it inside a container using the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm myjavaapp
```

`-i` specifies interactive mode so that we can interact with the container using standard input, output, and error streams. `--rm` automatically removes the container after it exits. `myjavaapp` refers to the image we just created.

If everything went smoothly, you should see something like the following printed to your console:

```
Hello world!
```

Congratulations, you've successfully run your Java code inside a Docker container!
