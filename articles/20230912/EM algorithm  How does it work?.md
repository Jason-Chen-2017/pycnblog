Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a widely used technique for unsupervised learning in machine learning and statistical analysis. The goal of EM algorithms is to find the maximum likelihood estimate or maximum a posteriori estimate of the parameters given some observed data points. It belongs to the class of probabilistic models that use latent variables as additional sources of information about the distribution of observations. In this article, we will discuss how exactly the EM algorithm works step by step. We will also demonstrate its application using Python code. 

The objective function can be written down as:

$$\ln p(X \mid Z,\theta)=\sum_{n=1}^{N} \ln p(x_n \mid z_n,\theta)+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\ln p(z_n \mid \pi_k).$$

where $X$ represents all the observed data points, $\theta$ represents the model parameters such as the mean values and variance of Gaussian distributions, $\pi_k$ represent the prior probabilities of each cluster, and $Z$ denotes the hidden variables which indicate which cluster each observation belongs to.

In order to apply the EM algorithm, we need to first specify the initial values of the model parameters and then iteratively update them until convergence. Here are the general steps of the EM algorithm:

1. **E-step**: This involves computing the expected values of the hidden variables using the current value of the model parameters. 

2. **M-step**: Once we have computed the expected values, we use them to recompute the optimal model parameters. 

After several iterations, if there are no further changes between two successive updates, then the algorithm has converged and we have found the maximum likelihood estimate or MAP estimate of the model parameters.

Let's now dive into the detailed explanation of the algorithm.<|im_sep|>

## Hidden Variables
Hidden variables, sometimes referred to as "latent variables" or "unobserved factors", refer to those random variables that do not appear directly in our dataset but whose effects on the observed variables are still unknown. They provide valuable insights into the structure of the data, making it possible to identify meaningful patterns and relationships between different variables. Formally, they are defined as follows:<|im_sep|>
<|im_sep|>
$$Z = \{z_1,z_2,...,z_N\}$$ where $z_i$ indicates the cluster assignment of the i-th instance x_i. <|im_sep|>
<|im_sep|>
The goal of clustering is to group similar instances together based on their underlying features. However, the real world is often complex and irregular, making it impossible to explicitly define clusters. Therefore, the role of hidden variables plays an important role in the E-step and M-step of the EM algorithm.

## Expectation Step
The expectation step computes the expected log likelihood of the observed data points under the current value of the model parameters. Mathematically, it estimates the following conditional probability:

$$p(x_n \mid z_n,\theta) \propto p(z_n \mid x_n,\theta)p(x_n|\theta),$$

where $p(\cdot)$ is the joint probability distribution over all observed variables. We can see that the numerator term depends on both the hidden variable $z_n$ and the model parameter vector $\theta$, while the denominator only depends on the observed variable $x_n$. As mentioned earlier, the hidden variables allow us to infer the membership of each observation without observing any other factor of variation. 

Using Bayes' rule, we can rewrite this equation as:

$$p(x_n \mid z_n,\theta) = \frac{p(z_n \mid x_n,\theta)p(x_n|\theta)}{\sum_{j=1}^Kp(z_j \mid x_n,\theta)p(x_n|\theta)}.$$

We want to maximize the right hand side, since we want to find the most likely assignments of the hidden variables given the data points. To compute the left hand side, we need to marginalize out all the hidden variables from the joint distribution. This gives us the product of two terms:

$$p(z_n \mid x_n,\theta) = \prod_{k=1}^Kp(z_n=k \mid x_n,\theta)$$ and $$p(x_n|\theta) = \prod_{d=1}^D p(x_n^{(d)}|\theta_d)$$.

The former is simply a categorical distribution with one parameter per cluster, indicating the probability of each point belonging to a particular cluster. The latter corresponds to the likelihood of the individual dimensions of the feature space given the model parameters. Specifically, for a given dimension $d$, the likelihood is assumed to follow a normal distribution with fixed mean and variance, which depend on the corresponding model parameter $\theta_d$.
