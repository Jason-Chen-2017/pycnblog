# 1.简介
  

The MySQL Audit plugin provides a way to track user activity within your database server and capture details such as the time of each query execution, affected tables or rows, the type of operation performed (read, write, delete), and more importantly - who executed the queries. Additionally, you can also create rules for specific events based on certain criteria like table names or SQL statements, and trigger alerts or notifications when these rules are violated. In this article, we will discuss how to install and configure the audit plugin on an Ubuntu Linux system running MySQL. 

To complete this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Install MySQL Server and Dependencies
2. Create a MySQL Database User Account
3. Configure the MySQL Server Configuration File
4. Install the MySQL Audit Plugin
5. Enable and Start the MySQL Audit Service

By following these steps, we will be able to record all user activities in our MySQL database while providing detailed information about them. We can set up rules for specific actions or events that should trigger alarms or notifications. These features provide a powerful tool for managing and maintaining secure databases with accurate audit logs.

Let's get started!

# 2.1 Background Introduction

MySQL is one of the most popular relational database management systems used today by web developers, businesses, and enterprises around the world. It has been used by many companies, including those involved in financial services, e-commerce websites, social media platforms, and other applications where scalability, high availability, and security are critical requirements.

However, just like any other software application, security vulnerabilities can occur at every stage of its development cycle. One of the common pitfalls of using MySQL is that it does not have built-in mechanisms for tracking user activities or implementing access controls. This means that if an attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data, there is no mechanism in place to identify their activities and trace back their origin. 

To address this issue, MySQL includes plugins known as Audit Log Plugins which allow users to record and monitor changes made to the MySQL database server. TheAUDIT plugin records detailed information about each query executed on the server, including the date and time of execution, the affected tables and/or rows, the type of operation performed (insert, update, delete, etc.), the client hostname, username, and IP address from which the connection was made.

Auditing helps in detecting intrusion attempts, abuse of privileges, fraudulent activities, and malicious attacks on the database server. By analyzing these activities, administrators can take corrective measures to prevent future incidents. The AUDIT log also enables monitoring and control over database usage, allowing administrators to track resource consumption and ensure compliance with established policies.

In this tutorial, we will see how to install and configure the MySQL Audit plugin on an Ubuntu Linux system running MySQL.

Before installing MySQL, make sure that you have installed Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) version 7 or higher on your system. You can download the JDK package from official sources or use your preferred package manager. Once installed, proceed to install MySQL Community Edition Server and related packages according to your distribution’s documentation.

# 2.2 Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before we start configuring the MySQL server, let us understand some basic concepts and terminology associated with MySQL.

## 2.2.1 Data Base Management System (DBMS)
A DBMS is a software program that manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation for end-users and programs. MySQL is one of the most commonly used DBMS. It is a free and open-source project that is widely used in various fields such as web development, business intelligence, and online gaming.

## 2.2.2 MySQL Architecture
MySQL consists of two major components, the server and the client. The server component runs on top of a database engine called “mysqld” and handles requests from clients via a network interface. The client component is responsible for establishing connections to the server and executing commands entered by the user. The communication between the server and client occurs through standard protocols like TCP/IP or Sockets.


## 2.2.3 MySQL Users and Privileges
Every MySQL installation comes preinstalled with a default user named "root" whose password is blank. This root account gives full control over the entire MySQL instance. However, it is recommended to create additional non-administrative accounts with limited privileges instead of using the root account directly.

There are four types of permissions assigned to MySQL users:

  * GRANT OPTION : Allows the grantee to grant permissions to others
  * SELECT : Enables reading of data from the specified tables
  * INSERT : Enables inserting new rows into the specified tables
  * UPDATE : Enables modifying existing rows in the specified tables
  * DELETE : Enables deleting existing rows from the specified tables
  
Each permission can be granted individually or combined together using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. For example, GRANT SELECT ON mydatabase.* TO'myuser'@'localhost'; allows the user ‘myuser’ to read all tables in the ‘mydatabase’ database hosted on localhost. When multiple privileges are granted to a single user, they form a combination. Therefore, for example, GRANT SELECT,INSERT ON mytable TO'myuser'@'localhost' would enable the user to insert new rows into the ‘mytable’ and select data from it simultaneously.

Note: Never grant ALL PRIVILEGES to a user as it grants all possible privileges to the user including the ability to perform DDL operations (CREATE, ALTER, DROP). Instead, grant only the required permissions as per the need.  

## 2.2.4 MySQL Authentication Methods
MySQL supports several authentication methods such as Native Password Hashing Method, Pluggable Authenticators (PA), MySQL Native Authentication Method, and Cleartext Passwords.

### Native Password Hashing Method
This method stores passwords encrypted with a strong hash function inside the mysql database. The hashed password is stored alongside the plain text password in the `mysql` database. Whenever a user tries to authenticate, the plaintext password sent by the client is compared against the hashed password in the database. If both match, then the user is authenticated successfully.

Advantages: 

  * Simple to implement
  * Fast authentication
  * No need to store clear text passwords
  * Can support multi-factor authentication

Disadvantages:

  * Sensitive data could potentially remain exposed if backups or dumps are taken without proper protection
  * Weak encryption algorithm makes it susceptible to dictionary attack

### Pluggable Authenticators (PA)
MySQL supports pluggable authenticators which allows third party vendors to develop authentication modules. PA modules are dynamically loaded during runtime and can be configured separately for different servers.

Advantages:
  
  * Can integrate with external identity providers like Active Directory, LDAP
  * Easy integration with RADIUS, TACACS+
  * Supports advanced multi-factor authentication schemes

Disadvantages:

  * More complex to implement than native password hashing method
  * Not always available out-of-the-box and requires expertise of developer
  * Need to keep updated with latest security patches

### MySQL Native Authentication Method
This method uses the same credentials as those used to login to the MySQL server itself. There is no separate login screen for MySQL clients. The server verifies the credentials provided by the client during initial handshake before granting access to the user.

Advantages:
  
  * Easier to setup
  * Does not require extra configuration
  * Faster authentication process since no round trips needed with the backend database

Disadvantages:

  * Credentials can easily be stolen due to man-in-the-middle attacks
  * May not work well with load balancers and proxies

### Cleartext Passwords
This method stores cleartext passwords in the mysql database making it less secure. Anyone with access to the mysql database can view the password hashes. Use this option only for testing purposes and never for production environments.

Advantages:
  
  * Simple to implement
  * Very easy to setup
  * Great for testing and developing

Disadvantages:

  * Exposes sensitive data
  * Do not recommend for production use.

Overall, the best approach for securing MySQL database is to choose a simple but effective method of storing and verifying user credentials. Avoid storing cleartext passwords and use SSL certificates for encrypting traffic between the client and server. Also, consider using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) for signing and encrypting sensitive data transmitted across networks.
