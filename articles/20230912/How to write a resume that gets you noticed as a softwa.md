In today’s world of high-tech wealth creation technology, the importance of having a good resume has become essential in order to stand out among our competitors. However, with so many different jobs available on the market, it can be challenging to craft an effective resume that impresses potential employers. In fact, few candidates even look at their resume before applying for a job interview. So how do you create one that stands out from other candidates?

In this post, I will guide you through the process of creating an effective software development resume, providing clear instructions and tips on how to write one that sets you apart from others. You will learn:

1. What makes a great software developer resume

# 2.Concepts and terms
## 2.1 Resume Formatting Tools 
The most common resume formats are text based (PDF or.doc) and they usually consist of four sections: 

1. Name 
2. Contact details 
3. Summary/Experience 
4. Skills & Certifications 

Therefore, using any word processor or text editor such as Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc., is recommended as these editors allow us to easily format each section of our resume. Additionally, there are several online editing platforms where we can download templates and edit them according to our needs. Some popular options include: 

1. Canva : https://www.canva.com/resumes/
2. Linkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/69790/create-your-resume?lang=en 

Once the layout of our resume is finalized, we can begin writing our content within each section. We may also add photos or illustrations to enhance our appearance. Finally, we should carefully proofread and test our resume for accuracy.

## 2.2 CV vs Resumes
A resume is a document submitted by a candidate who intends to apply for a job opportunity while a CV is a more formal document containing a detailed account of the candidate's qualifications and education. A resume focuses more on describing your professional expertise and skills whereas a CV gives insight into your personality, background and experiences. Therefore, when deciding whether to use a resume or CV, consider your target audience and intention for your application. If you're seeking a short-term job, then a resume might be sufficient. On the other hand, if you have a long term plan to stay in the industry, you may want to tailor your CV to reflect your personality and experience. For example, instead of presenting all of your professional accomplishments, you could highlight your strengths and explain why you made the right choice to move towards your desired career path.

Another point worth noting is that resumes often display outdated information compared to current work history and educational credentials. Therefore, freshness and relevance are crucial factors when selecting between a resume and CV. 

Overall, resuming is an art form that requires patience, creativity, dedication and hardwork. It takes time but with careful planning and attention to detail, we can produce a polished resume that attracts top talent across various industries. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or comments. Good luck!


 #3.How to Write a Great Software Developer Resume 
Great software developer resumes showcase technical proficiency, problem solving abilities, and team player skills. They demonstrate leadership ability and enthusiasm to take ownership of projects, contribute to large-scale architecture decisions, and collaborate effectively with other developers. Below are the steps to write a successful software developer resume:

Step 1: Research and Define Your Goals
First, research the job descriptions, company requirements, and cultural norms to determine which areas of expertise you would like to highlight in your resume. This includes things like specific programming languages, frameworks, databases, cloud providers, testing frameworks, and toolsets. Next, define your goals and objectives for the role. These could include demonstrating strong understanding of complex algorithms, working knowledge of data structures and system design principles, and excellent communication and collaboration skills. Keep in mind that employers value applicants who possess exceptional skillsets rather than those who only meet certain criteria.


Step 2: Create Your Personal Statement 
This statement explains why you are interested in the specific job opening and identifies your strongest attributes. This serves as your elevator pitch to recruiters and hiring managers. Make sure to provide ample detail about your personal life and your interests, including past work experience, volunteer work, hobbies, and activities. Pay special attention to achievements, milestones, and awards that best represent your passions and achievements. 


Step 3: Add Key Projects and Experience
Presenting your experience in chronological order shows both your commitment and progression. This includes identifying gaps in your knowledge and learning new technologies and techniques alongside real-world challenges. Use examples to back up your claims and give perspective on how you overcame problems and improved upon existing solutions. List your top projects and describe briefly what each project involved.


Step 4: Demonstrate Interpersonal Skills
Your social media profiles, blog articles, and previous talks can help set you apart from other candidates. Ensure that your résumé contains information about your preferred social contacts, such as the name and contact information of your friends and family members. Also, practice communicating concisely and persuasively. Emphasize positive aspects of your behavior, such as being helpful, kind, and respectful. 

Be prepared for Step 5: Apply for a Job 
Finally, don't forget to follow up after submitting your resume. Reach out to colleagues and friends who are willing to review your profile and offer feedback. This way, you can improve your skills and ensure that your resume is current and accurate.
