## Cosmic Inflation Explained: The Obvious Solution?
“Cosmic Inflation” is one of the most mysterious scientific phenomena observed in our universe. Many scholars believe that it has to do with dark energy and other fundamental forces acting on space-time, but their explanations remain controversial. Some have proposed that the expansion rate of space and time depends on changes in density and pressure, while others suggest that it’s due to a violation of the basic laws of physics. Despite these diverse interpretations, scientists still haven’t found an exact explanation for why we observe this strange behavior. Nevertheless, a significant amount of research is being done to understand how inflation occurs in nature, which is the goal of this article.
In this article, I will try to answer some questions about the origin of cosmic inflation and the various explanations offered by different scholars. I will also present my own hypothesis based on my understanding of cosmological models and how they can explain inflation better than the others. Finally, I will discuss some implications and limitations of this theory. 

In general, there are several main reasons behind inflation such as accelerated expansion, increase in the size of the Universe, accretion of matter into galaxies, generation of gravitational waves and more. However, none of these causes seems like the sole reason for inflation since the basic ideas underlying them seem shared among all inflationary scenarios. It would be helpful if we could find out what’s actually causing inflation. This might help us to solve many problems related to inflation such as its physical interpretation, detection, measurement and mitigation. We need to identify the core mechanism responsible for generating and propagating the expanding Universe.

However, theories of inflation provide varying insights on the process of its generation and propagation within the context of the Universe. Some theories propose that the expansion is caused by the presence of massive stars or dark energy bubbles, while others argue that it’s a consequence of gravity and pressure forces acting together. Yet another theory suggests that inflation comes from the interaction between dark matter particles and cosmic rays emitted by radiation from the early universe, rather than electron degeneracy or galactic winds. Each of these explanations offers insight into the root cause of inflation but without any unified theory or model that explains both the mechanisms and the evolution of the Universe as a whole. 


To overcome these challenges, we need a comprehensive model that can capture both intrinsic properties of the Universe (such as the large scale structure) and extrinsic influences such as those from outside (such as nuclear explosions). One possible way to achieve this goal is to combine theoretical and computational techniques that allow us to build up a detailed picture of the Universe at different times and in different phases of its history. Such models can then be used to analyze and understand complex phenomena such as supernova remnants, black holes, and gravitational wave signals. By developing such advanced models, we may eventually obtain a complete picture of the dynamics of the Universe and develop a coherent framework to explain the complex processes that govern it. 

For example, a popular tool for analyzing galaxy clusters, called Markarian N-body simulations, involves simulating the motion of millions of galaxies in the Universe using computer algorithms. These simulations reproduce the effect of gravity on their surrounding gas and dust, leading to the emergence of structures such as groups and clusters. Based on this simulation data, researchers have developed a variety of hydrodynamical and astrophysical models to study cluster formation, merging and evolution. For example, one of these models, called NFW potential, assumes that dark matter particles form concentric shells around larger massive halos and experience self-gravity, similar to a spherical cow. If such models correctly account for the distortion introduced by satellite galaxies and other factors, we should see evidence of the correlation between their distribution and the central galaxies. By combining these models with numerical simulations and observations, we can unravel the entire story of the Universe and gain a deeper understanding of the processes that shape its evolving structure and behavior.
