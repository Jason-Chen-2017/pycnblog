Self-driving cars (SDCs) are an important technology that can significantly change the way we travel and live in cities. In recent years, researchers have shown significant advances in SDC technologies such as advanced perception algorithms, object detection systems, and navigation systems. However, these advancements also face challenges due to various factors such as safety concerns and traffic jams. Despite their great potential, there remains a need for more careful consideration before adopting self-driving cars in urban areas. The impact of these decisions on road users and transportation infrastructure will also require further analysis to determine the long term consequences of abandoning this technology. 

In this article, I present my views on why it is necessary to abandon self-driving cars after all these years of urban deliberation and how this decision can affect both people and infrastructure. Specifically, I argue that the long-term economic and environmental benefits of self-driving cars cannot justify the continued development and deployment costs associated with implementing them effectively. Moreover, my view is that currently available SDC platforms lack sufficiently sophisticated driving behaviors and computational capabilities to fully replace human drivers during automated vehicles' peak hours. This requires a comprehensive overhaul of SDC hardware, software, and data collection mechanisms to enable new forms of mobility that complement current modes of transportation while promoting safer driving practices and improving public health. Finally, my argument demonstrates the importance of considering long-term implications of SDCs when making fundamental decisions about city planning. 

# 2.背景介绍
Self-driving car (SDC) technology has become increasingly popular amongst consumers in recent years. Some top companies including Tesla, Google, Toyota, Waymo, and Niobium are already producing some form of SDC technology or testing its effectiveness in certain scenarios. While these developments are generally considered positive signifies that our society is becoming increasingly dependant on autonomous vehicles for essential tasks such as shopping, moving around, and commuting.

However, it should not be forgotten that despite significant progress made by SDC technology, there remain many questions unanswered regarding its use in urban areas. For example: 

1. How effective is SDC technology at replacing humans in everyday tasks like navigating, routing, parking, and stopping?

2. Can SDC technology be implemented without creating serious conflicts between human drivers and pedestrians?

3. What kind of collisions can occur between SDCs and other vehicles and what measures could be taken to prevent them?

4. Can SDC technology successfully integrate into existing roads without disrupting traffic flow or causing accidents?

5. Do SDCs promote healthy habits like taking regular breaks, staying hydrated, and washing hands?

These questions are relevant because they affect the overall viability of self-driving cars in urban areas. Without careful consideration and prudent implementation, SDC technology may end up being used as a tool for negligent purposes, leading to chaos and injuries to road users and infrastructure alike. It is crucial to ensure that SDC technology does not cause harmful outcomes in critical infrastructures such as roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports. On the other hand, if we choose not to adopt SDC technology, then we risk losing out on numerous benefits provided by this technology such as improved efficiency, convenience, and reduced traffic congestion. 

# 3.基本概念术语说明
Before delving deeper into the core concepts and terminologies related to self-driving cars in urban areas, let's first clarify some basic terms and definitions.

1. Pedestrian crosswalk: A temporary pedestrian passageway intended to accommodate motorists who want to pass through but do not wish to make use of street space. Typically, these facilities allow one-way travel only from right to left and have limited capacity compared to main streets. They are designed to minimize the possibility of collision with automobiles, especially those using multiple lanes to enter busy residential areas. 

2. Front/rear bumper area: A dedicated section of a vehicle's exterior designated for the purpose of providing protection from obstacles and vulnerabilities ahead of the driver. Commonly found along side the windshield.

3. Lane width: Refers to the total distance that a vehicle can travel within a lane. While typically set between 3.5 and 4.5 meters, varies depending on the size of the vehicle, type of road surface, and weather conditions.

4. Traffic signal phase: An individual cycle of green, yellow, and red lights that indicates the presence and direction of incoming vehicles across a highway. Often referred to as the "lights" system. 

5. Autonomous Driving Technology: A combination of computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence technologies that enables a vehicle to navigate and control itself independently of any driver input. Generally speaking, these systems rely heavily on sensors such as cameras, radar, GPS, etc., which capture and interpret visual information and wireless communication signals to identify objects, predict movements, and plan routes.

6. Full Self-Driving Car (FSDC): A single unit consisting of a front-facing camera, rear-facing camera, lidar, radar, GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, and microphone as well as embedded computing hardware and software capable of processing the collected sensor data. FSDCs combine state-of-the-art AI and CV algorithms to generate accurate predictions about the world around them. 

7. Modular Auto Pilot Unit (MAPU): A smaller unit consisting solely of electric motors and controls that allows for remote control of an SDC. MAPUs operate via radio waves transmitted from base stations located near intersections. MAPOs provide a backup in case of emergency situations where the primary MAPU fails. 

8. Collision Avoidance System (CAS): A complex subsystem that coordinates multiple elements of an SDC to avoid colliding with other vehicles and pedestrians. Technically, the CAS consists of safety features such as braking lights, warning sounds, and hazard lights as well as collision prevention mechanisms such as adaptive cruise control, collision detection and avoidance systems, and longitudinal planning. 

9. Advanced Perception Algorithm (APA): A subset of computer vision techniques applied to video feeds captured by the SDC to detect objects, recognize traffic signs, estimate traffic laws, and track nearby vehicles.

10. Object Detection System (ODSystem): Similar to APA, but focuses specifically on detecting specific types of objects rather than general categories such as pedestrians and vehicles.

# 4.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
To understand the reasons behind why SDC technology needs to be abandoned in urban areas, we need to look at several different aspects of the technology. We can start by discussing the core algorithm underlying SDCs. 

The core algorithm for self-driving cars involves applying several machine learning algorithms to process the collected sensor data from various sources. The output generated by these algorithms include driving directions, steering angles, acceleration commands, and throttle settings that dictate the actions of the vehicle. There are several subsystems involved in the algorithm, each with its own unique role and function. Here are a few key points to consider:

1. Perception: The task of identifying and classifying objects in the environment is called perception. This includes recognition of traffic signs, detection of pedestrians, and tracking of nearby vehicles. One common approach to achieving this is to use deep neural networks trained on large datasets of images and annotated labels. 

2. Planning: Once the SDC has identified the surrounding environment, it must selectively drive through safe regions of the road to reach its destination safely. This task is known as path planning. Path planning uses mathematical optimization methods to find the shortest possible route between two points.

3. Control: As soon as the SDC starts following the planned route, it enters into the realm of control. The goal of control is to maintain the desired speed, keep the vehicle inside the road boundaries, avoid collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians, and adjust the steering angle according to the current conditions. 

Overall, the central component of most self-driving cars is the brain that combines perception, planning, and control together to achieve safe and efficient mobility. By introducing such algorithms and components, SDCs aim to offer increased safety and mobility while still maintaining compliance with various safety regulations and best practice guidelines.

It is important to note that the practicality and feasibility of adopting such a technology depends on several factors, including cost, manpower requirements, scalability, robustness, and privacy. Additionally, the ethical issues surrounding the use of self-diling cars in dangerous environments, the need for proper training and monitoring mechanisms, and the potential for biases to arise from the self-driving feature alone make SDCs imperfect tools. Therefore, even though some companies such as Tesla and Google have committed to developing SDC technology and announced plans to produce SDC units in mass production, ultimately it becomes clear that there are many remaining technical and ethical challenges that need to be addressed before widespread adoption takes place. 

Despite these challenges, SDC technology provides many beneficial insights into the inner workings of our cities. Researchers have shown that SDCs can save time and reduce commute times while reducing fuel consumption. Moreover, they can enhance social mobility by enabling people to commute farther and easier distances than ever before, and contribute towards better productivity and employee engagement. Nonetheless, it is crucial to evaluate whether the long-term economic and environmental benefits justified the continued development and deployment costs required to deploy SDCs effectively. Nevertheless, if SDC technology is truly an indispensable part of our future, then we need to ensure that we address these issues head-on and take reasonable steps towards paving the way for new ways of living and interacting in cities.
