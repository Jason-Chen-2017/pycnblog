# Introduction 

With the rise of big data technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most significant research areas in recent years. While there are many applications of AI in various industries such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and retail, the real impact of this technology on society is still unclear. As a result, it’s essential to understand how AI can play an important role in shaping the way we live our lives and interact with each other. In this article, I will explore whether AI-powered algorithms could be used for helping individuals achieve social justice through effective recommendation systems, information sharing, and supportive services. Specifically, I will focus on understanding the potential benefits and challenges of applying AI techniques to improve social welfare, while also identifying some practical issues that need to be addressed before AI can take its full potency.

# Terminology, Concepts & Definitions
Before delving into the core algorithm, let's first clarify some basic terms and concepts related to social justice, AI, and machine learning. 


## Social Justice

Social justice refers to a set of principles and norms that govern individual behavior towards others and promotes fundamental human rights and equality. It strives to ensure fairness, dignity, and autonomy for all people by recognizing the diversity and uniqueness of cultures and lifestyles across countries, races, genders, sexual orientations, socioeconomic statuses, and ethnicities. The goal of social justice is to promote a better and more equitable world where everyone has a meaningful role within society. 


## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation and interaction of human thought processes using machines. Within AI, there are several subcategories including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and deep learning. These fields have revolutionized the field of computer science by enabling machines to perform tasks previously considered too complex or impossible for humans alone. However, these advances come at the cost of introducing biases and limitations that affect human values such as privacy, security, inclusivity, and transparency. Moreover, the use of AI technologies often leads to a decreased accuracy level and lack of robustness which makes it difficult to handle large amounts of data effectively. Therefore, it’s crucial to evaluate the suitability of AI for specific contexts and situations to avoid harmful outcomes. 


## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning (ML) involves training computers to recognize patterns and make predictions based on existing data without being explicitly programmed. This technique enables computers to learn from experience and improve their performance over time, making them ideal for solving problems that require a continuous stream of input data. ML algorithms consist of three main components: inputs, outputs, and a model. The model learns to map inputs to outputs by adjusting weights iteratively until it accurately predicts new inputs. Similarly, the output layer consists of activation functions like sigmoid function or softmax function depending on the type of problem, and the loss function measures the difference between predicted and actual outputs. Therefore, when designing an AI system, it's critical to choose appropriate models, optimize hyperparameters, select metrics, and fine-tune data preprocessing steps to ensure optimal performance.

# Core Algorithm
In order to develop an AI system capable of delivering effective recommendations, reminders, and support services, we will need to identify key features and considerations that contribute to overall system success. Here are some key aspects of the core algorithm: 


### Data Collection
The first step in building an AI-powered recommender system is collecting and cleaning the dataset. The dataset should contain user preferences, demographics, past interactions, historical behavior, and contextual factors. There are different methods of data collection such as surveying users, conducting interviews, recording customer feedback, analyzing online reviews, etc., but ultimately the dataset must represent a comprehensive view of user preferences, behaviors, needs, interests, and concerns.


### Data Preprocessing
After obtaining the raw data, the next step is to preprocess the data by cleaning missing values, handling outliers, normalizing numerical variables, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature selection. Feature selection helps reduce noise and dimensionality, improving the performance of the classifier.


### Model Selection
Once the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and ready to be fed into the algorithm, the next task is to select the best model for the given scenario. Different types of models such as classification, regression, clustering, and ranking can be used for different purposes. Some commonly used models include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. After selecting the model, the next step is to tune its parameters to optimize performance. Tuning includes optimizing the regularization parameter, changing the splitting strategy, adjusting the threshold value for binary classifiers, and selecting the number of neurons in a neural network.


### Evaluation Metrics
Finally, after training the model, evaluation metrics should be selected to measure the quality of the results. Common evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, AUC/ROC curve, mean squared error, and R-squared. When evaluating the model, care should be taken not only to compare performance among different models but also to verify whether bias exists in the dataset. Bias may arise if certain groups receive disproportionate representation, exhibit particular preferences, or behave differently than the majority group. To address bias, the dataset should be balanced, and any discriminatory factors identified should be removed from the analysis.


### Deployment
When deploying the AI system, several additional steps need to be taken to ensure scalability and reliability. First, the AI system should be tested extensively on a variety of datasets, platforms, and devices to ensure consistency and reliability. Second, the system should be monitored closely to detect any anomalies and errors. Finally, the model should be optimized further to ensure consistent performance over time.


# 4.Practical Issues
As mentioned earlier, AI tools are becoming increasingly powerful and able to solve complex problems with minimal supervision. Despite this, however, it is important to keep in mind the potential pitfalls and limitations that can negatively impact societal wellbeing and progress. Below are some practical issues that need to be addressed before AI can fully take advantage of its potential: 


### Privacy Concerns
Privacy is central to ensuring that individuals' personal information remains confidential. Governments around the world are working hard to protect citizens' personal information from malicious actors, but little attention has been paid to the ways in which AI tools collect and analyze sensitive data about individuals. For example, recently, facial recognition technologies were implemented in major hospitals across the country, allowing doctors to access patient information instantly, even without a visit. Although this can provide great convenience and save time, it raises questions about privacy and potentially violates government regulations. Additionally, internet companies have long been known for tracking web browsing history, surfing habits, and search queries without consent. By enabling the collection and analysis of this data, AI tools risk exposing sensitive private information to advertisers, third-party providers, and law enforcement agencies.


### Biased Algorithms
One of the biggest challenges facing AI algorithms is the possibility of biased outcomes. One common cause of biased outcomes is sample bias, where samples collected during training may not reflect the true population. Another issue is distribution shift, where the underlying distribution changes significantly over time due to technological advancement, economic development, or political events. Addressing these challenges requires careful consideration of data collection, modeling approaches, and testing procedures, as well as employing responsible stakeholders who bring diverse perspectives and experiences.


### Historical Context Matters
Without accurate historical context, AI tools cannot draw conclusions or reach accurate insights about current trends or opportunities. Accordingly, it’s vital to ensure that AI tools are trained on relevant data and gather sufficient evidence to inform decisions. For example, while artificially intelligent chatbots have made remarkable advances in recent years, they depend heavily on text data extracted from social media platforms, leading to biased results. Even when applied correctly, chatbot assistants may not offer equal opportunity and treatment for low-income communities compared to those with higher incomes. Understanding historical context and the effects of social movements on society can serve as a useful framework for analyzing the social and environmental impact of AI systems.
