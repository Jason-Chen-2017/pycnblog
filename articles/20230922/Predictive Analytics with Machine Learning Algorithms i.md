# 1.简介
  

Predictive analytics is the field of data mining that involves making predictions based on historical or current data using statistical methods and algorithms to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. In this article, we will discuss predictive analytics by exploring various machine learning algorithms available in Python language. Specifically, we will cover linear regression, decision trees, random forests, k-means clustering algorithm, support vector machines (SVM) and neural networks. We will also see how these algorithms can be used for different types of datasets such as numerical, categorical, textual, image and time series data sets. The end goal of our article is to provide an overview of predictive analytics techniques and help beginners understand the potential applications of machine learning in their day-to-day work.

To start with, let's first define some basic terms:

1. **Data**: A set of observations from a source which contains both descriptive and quantitative attributes that are subjected to analysis to find patterns and make predictions. It may contain either structured or unstructured data.
2. **Attributes**: Independent variables that influence the dependent variable(s). They describe the properties of an object being studied. For example, in medical research, it could be age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels etc., while in financial analysis, it might include account balance, interest rates, stock prices etc. 
3. **Dependent Variable**: An attribute whose value depends upon other attributes, known as independent variables. For instance, the profit of a company would depend on sales revenue, market share, number of employees, products sold per unit cost, marketing budget, and so on. 

Now, let us move ahead with the main content of the article.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
Before diving into the details of machine learning models, let’s quickly go through some important concepts and terminologies related to predictive analytics.

## 2.1 Linear Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning technique where we try to fit a line (or a hyperplane in higher dimensions) between input features and output variable. This model assumes a linear relationship between input variables and the response variable. If there exists an intercept term, then we use multiple linear regression where we have more than one input feature. Here’s what linear regression looks like:


In the above equation, y is the predicted target value, x is the input feature, w is the weight parameter, b is the bias parameter, and ε is the error term. The objective function tries to minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS), i.e., RSS = Σ((y_i - ŷ_i)^2) over all training samples. To learn the weights and bias parameters, we need to optimize the cost function J using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. Once we obtain the optimal values of w and b, we can use them to predict the target value for new inputs. There are many variations of linear regression such as ordinary least square (OLS), ridge regression, Lasso regression, and Elastic Net regression.

## 2.2 Decision Trees

Decision trees are non-parametric supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. It works by breaking down the dataset into smaller subsets based on a chosen feature, and fitting a simple rule to each subset to determine its class label. Tree models are easy to interpret, visualize, and explain, but they often suffer from high variance, especially when applied to noisy or incomplete data. Therefore, they are typically not preferred for complex datasets that require better generalization performance. Instead, ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, and stacking are commonly used instead. Bagging combines multiple decision trees to reduce variance and improve accuracy. Boosting involves sequentially adding weak classifiers to build a strong learner. Stacking uses two or more layers of base estimators and a meta estimator to combine their outputs.

Here’s what a decision tree looks like:


The above figure shows how a decision tree splits the data into two regions – node A and node B – at the level of a particular feature. Each region is further divided until the sample reaches pure nodes, at which point it stops growing. During prediction, the input is tested against each branch starting from the root of the tree until a leaf node is reached, indicating the predicted class label.

## 2.3 Random Forests

Random forests are another type of ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to create a strong classifier. Unlike regular decision trees, random forests use randomly selected features to split nodes rather than selecting the best feature. Additionally, random forests involve building several decision trees on bootstrapped samples of the original data, leading to better stability and reducing variance. Overall, random forests produce highly accurate and reliable classifiers compared to individual decision trees.

## 2.4 K-Means Clustering Algorithm

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points together. It works by partitioning n objects into k clusters, where each object belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. When initialized, centroids are assigned randomly to the clusters, and the process of assigning objects to closest clusters is repeated iteratively until convergence. Here’s what k-means clustering looks like:


In the above figure, we have three data points belonging to three different clusters. Initially, we choose three centroids at random, and assign each data point to the nearest centroid. After this step, the centroid locations are updated to reflect the center of gravity of the corresponding cluster. We repeat this process until convergence is achieved, meaning that the assignment of objects to the same cluster does not change anymore. At this stage, we have learned the centroid locations, which represent the clusters themselves. Then, any new data point is assigned to the nearest cluster based on the Euclidean distance metric.

## 2.5 Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support vector machines (SVM) are another supervised learning algorithm that can perform binary classification. SVM optimizes the margin between the hyperplanes defined by the separating hyperplane and the data points, and assigns the data points to the most difficult cases based on their proximity to the hyperplanes. Similarly, SVM finds the maximum margin separator that maximizes the width of the margin between the classes. Below is a diagram showing how SVM performs binary classification:


In the above figure, the dashed lines show the decision boundary that separates the blue and red dots, which represents the separation between the positive and negative classes. The points inside the margins are called “support vectors” because they contribute significantly towards determining the location of the decision boundary. Intuitively, if you were to drop a small circle around one of these points, it wouldn’t move much away from the boundary; hence, they serve as good candidates for the support vectors. However, if you were to add a new dot outside of the margins, the decision boundary changes, because the new point becomes far enough from the existing support vectors that they become irrelevant to defining the separating hyperplane.

## 2.6 Neural Networks

Neural networks are deep learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, which receive input signals, pass them through a nonlinear transformation, and generate output signals. These networks are trained using backpropagation, a popular gradient descent-based optimization algorithm, to update the network’s weights and biases iteratively. They are capable of approximating arbitrary functions and solving problems that are extremely complex even for traditional machine learning algorithms, although they may take longer to train due to the large numbers of parameters involved. Here’s an illustration of a typical neural network architecture:


In the above figure, the input layer receives the raw input features, the hidden layer applies a nonlinear transformation to the input, and the output layer produces the final output signal. Note that neural networks do not necessarily map directly to the mathematical formulation of linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or SVM, nor do they always have clear-cut boundaries or gradients that can be easily visualized. Nonetheless, they offer powerful modeling capabilities and demonstrate promise across a wide range of domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
