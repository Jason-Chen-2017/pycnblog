# 1.简介
  

Quaternions have become one of the most popular mathematical objects in computer graphics and robotics because they are efficient for rotation calculations with minimal numerical error. They are a special case of dual numbers, which provide an elegant solution for representing rotations in three dimensions. Quaternions are defined by four components: w, x, y, z. The scalar component (w) represents the real part of the quaternion while its vector components represent the imaginary parts of the number. 

The concepts behind quaternions can be confusing at first glance, but they offer many benefits when it comes to complex arithmetic operations. In this article, we will go through various common math functions that are useful when working with quaternions, including multiplication, inverse, dot product, angle-axis representation, and spherical linear interpolation.

## Quaternion representation

A unit quaternion is represented using 4 values: w, x, y, z. This notation simplifies computations involving quaternions by reducing them down to simple multiplication and addition operations. The identity quaternion is given by (0,0,0,1).

## Rotation matrix representation

The rotation matrix R(q) converts a point p from the local frame to the world frame where q is the unit quaternion representing the orientation between these frames. Given a normalized quaternion q = [qw, qx, qy, qz], the rotation matrix is calculated using the following formula:

R(q) = [[1 - 2qy^2 - 2qz^2,     2qxqy + 2qzqw,    2qxqz - 2qyqw ],
        [   2qxqy - 2qzqw,  1 - 2qx^2 - 2qz^2,     2qyqz + 2qxqw ],
        [   2qxqz + 2qyqw,    2qyqz - 2qxqw,  1 - 2qx^2 - 2qy^2 ]]
        
Note that the transpose of this matrix corresponds to the inverse of the original quaternion, so that if q_1 is a rotated version of q_2, then R(q_1) * R(q_2)^T = I or equivalently, R(q_1*q_2^-1) = I.

## Angle-axis representation

Another way to represent a 3D rotation is by specifying the axis of rotation and the angle of rotation about that axis. We define two vectors: u = (ux, uy, uz) and v = (vx, vy, vz), where u and v are perpendicular and their dot product uv = 0. To convert a unit quaternion into an angle-axis representation, we use the following formula:
    
[angle, u] = atan(|u|sin(angle/2)), cross(v, cross(v, u))

where angle is the angle of rotation around the axis u in radians and |u| is the length of the axis. If angle = 0, then u = 0 and this is known as the null quaternion.

## Slerp interpolation

Slerp interpolation is a method for interpolating between two quaternions that has been adapted specifically for rotational interpolation. It takes into account the shortest path along the great circle connecting both quaternions, allowing us to smoothly interpolate orientations over a large range without discontinuities or gimbal lock. The general equation for slerp interpolation is:
    
slerp(t, q1, q2) = sin((1-t)*angle(q1,q2)/2) / sin(angle(q1,q2)/2) * q1 + sin(t*angle(q1,q2)/2) / sin(angle(q1,q2)/2) * q2
    
    
where t is the interpolation parameter ranging from 0 to 1, q1 and q2 are the start and end points respectively, and angle(q1,q2) is the angular distance between them on a sphere. The resulting interpolated quaternion lies on the line segment connecting the endpoints with equal weight to each endpoint, thereby providing a more natural and intuitive interpolation than lerping.
