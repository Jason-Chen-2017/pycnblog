# 1.简介
  

Microservices is one of the most popular architectural styles in software development that allows for service-oriented architecture (SOA). In this article, we will explain how to build a microservice using Spring Boot framework and docker containerization technologies. We will use IntelliJ IDEA as our IDE, Maven as our dependency management tool, MySQL database as our primary data source and RabbitMQ message broker as our messaging middleware. Finally, we will deploy our application on Kubernetes cluster running on Google Cloud Platform. 

This article assumes readers have some basic knowledge about Java programming language, Spring Boot framework, RESTful API, Docker containerization, Kubernetes cluster deployment, RabbitMQ messaging system, and GCP cloud platform. Additionally, if you are already familiar with these tools or technologies, feel free to skip sections marked "Prerequisites".

This article is structured into six parts:

1. Introduction
2. Terminology
3. Building blocks of microservices
4. Creating a new project using Spring Initializr
5. Configuring the project dependencies
6. Writing code for user endpoints and creating Dockerfile for building image
7. Running the Docker container locally
8. Pushing your Docker image to Docker Hub
9. Deploying the app on Kubernetes cluster using Helm Charts
10. Testing the deployed microservice

By the end of the article, you should be able to create a working microservice using Spring Boot and deploying it on Kubernetes cluster using helm charts.

# 2.Terminology
Before diving into details, let's clarify some common terms used in microservices architecture:
## Service
In microservices architecture, a single application is split into several small services that communicate with each other via APIs. Each service has its own functionality, which can be accessed through HTTP/REST APIs. The main goal behind splitting an application into multiple services is to increase scalability, reliability, modularity, and maintainability of the application by isolating concerns and enabling developers to work independently. Services can also run on different machines across various networks, allowing them to scale horizontally when needed without affecting each other.

Each service runs inside its own process and communicates with other services over a network. The communication between services happens either synchronously or asynchronously depending upon the requirements of the service. Synchronous communication means that the calling service waits until the response from called service is received before proceeding further while asynchronous communication involves sending a request and receiving a reply later.

## API Gateway
API Gateway is responsible for handling incoming requests, routing them to appropriate backend services based on defined policies, aggregating responses, and returning final results to clients. It provides a single point of entry to all the services, enforcing authentication, authorization, throttling limits, caching mechanisms, rate limiting, and logging capabilities at different layers of the infrastructure stack. API gateways typically sit outside the microservices environment but within the client-facing load balancers. They provide a secure interface between external clients and services and act as a single point of failure by shielding downstream services from failures caused by upstream components such as databases and third-party systems.

## Message Broker
Message brokers receive messages sent by microservices and forward them to interested consumers. These messages can be simple notifications, commands, or events that need to be processed by specific subsystems. Message brokers offer decoupling and centralizes the message flow, making it easier to develop loosely coupled distributed applications.

RabbitMQ is a widely used open-source message broker that supports multiple messaging protocols including AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, WebSockets, etc. RabbitMQ offers high availability, durability, reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance characteristics. It enables us to easily implement pub/sub messaging patterns among microservices, ensuring eventual consistency and reliable delivery of messages.

## Containerization
Containerization refers to the packaging of an application along with all its dependencies and configurations into a standalone unit known as a container. Containers are lightweight and portable and can be easily transported across environments and clouds. Containers enable efficient resource utilization, lower costs, faster time to market, and better collaboration among teams. 

Docker containers are Linux containers created specifically for running applications. Docker uses namespaces, cgroups, and filesystem isolation to limit access to the underlying host OS. It provides a way to package and distribute apps and their dependencies together with configuration files so they can be easily reproduced anywhere. Docker makes it easy to manage deployments because you can automate builds, test, push, and deploy processes.

## Kubernetes Cluster Deployment
Kubernetes clusters consist of worker nodes and master node(s) where pods are deployed. Master nodes handle scheduling of pods, controlling the overall cluster state, and managing etcd database. Worker nodes are responsible for running pods and carrying out the requested tasks.

Google Cloud Platform provides managed Kubernetes clusters that make it easy to deploy and manage applications using kubectl command line tool. You can create a cluster on GCP, configure its settings, add nodes, and install your microservices. By default, GKE automatically manages pod scaling, load balancing, health checks, and DNS resolution. You can also monitor your cluster performance using GCP monitoring dashboard.

## Helm Charts
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies installing and managing Kubernetes applications. A chart is a collection of YAML files that define a related set of Kubernetes resources. Helm charts help you define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications. Helm Charts repository provides ready-to-use charts for commonly used microservices like Kafka, MongoDB, Redis, Prometheus, and more.

Helm Charts allow you to define templates for various Kubernetes resources, providing flexibility in configuring and customizing your microservices according to your needs. Helm Charts also simplify updating and maintaining your application since changes are applied incrementally instead of redeploying everything from scratch every time there is a change.
