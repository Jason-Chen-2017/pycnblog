# 3.核心概念术语说明
To get started with analyzing Bluetooth audio devices, let's first understand some key concepts and terminology related to BLE and audio technologies. 


## Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

## Advertising and Scanning
Advertising is the process whereby a Bluetooth device broadcasts messages called advertisements. These messages contain information about itself, such as name and manufacturer identification codes, as well as services and characteristics that it offers. Devices scan for advertising messages to find each other and establish connections with them. Each device sends out multiple advertisements with different intervals depending on the number of active connections and their usage patterns.

Scanning involves listening for incoming advertisements sent by other devices within a certain range. Once a device detects an advertiser’s signal, it attempts to connect with it if it meets certain criteria, such as having compatible service UUIDs and matching encryption keys. Connections are established through secure sockets layer (SSL) encrypted tunnels and depend on cryptographic algorithms such as AES-128 for encryption and Diffie-Hellman for key exchange.

For example, when you pair your phone with another device via Bluetooth, it starts advertising itself as a possible match. Other devices in the area might start scanning for possible matches and initiate connections with the phone after receiving their advertisement signals. During the connection setup process, they agree on a shared secret key that remains static throughout the session until disconnection. To summarize, BLE provides wireless connectivity and communication capabilities, enabling rapid transfer of data between devices across large distances.


## Service and Characteristic
A service is a collection of related BLE attributes that define the behavior and appearance of a device. Services are identified by unique IDs called UUIDs, which help identify them and allow interaction between different parts of a system. A characteristic is a basic building block that defines the type, format, value, and permission level of data exchanged between a client and server application. Charactersistics belong to a service and specify what kind of data they expect or return, along with the way it should be interpreted. Examples of common BLE services and characteristics include heart rate monitoring, microphone input, battery status, and image capture.


## Audio Streaming
Audio streaming allows for transmission of digital audio data between two endpoints, whether connected or disconnected. Most modern Bluetooth audio devices support simultaneous multi-directional audio streams with adjustable levels and volume controls. This feature makes it easy for listeners to listen to music from anywhere, even when not connected to the speaker.


## Media Playback Control
Media playback control includes functions such as play, pause, skip forward, and rewind. Some devices have dedicated buttons or knobs for controlling these actions, while others integrate these options into the user interface provided by the operating system. Users can set custom playlists and shuffle songs automatically, all without interrupting the current playing song.


## Notifications
Bluetooth audio devices often incorporate built-in notification systems that send alerts to the user of upcoming events or changes in the device's state. Push notifications can alert the user immediately of important updates or reminders, providing quick access to critical information. Different types of notifications can be configured to deliver customized content, such as weather reports, news headlines, or traffic alerts.
