# 1.简介
  

COVID-19 pandemic has caused a tremendous impact on people's lives. According to WHO website, as of March 17, more than two million cases have been confirmed globally. The situation is still evolving day by day. In this article, we will present an approach using time series analysis and deep learning techniques to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different regions over time. This work can help us understand how social behavior changes during these difficult times, and identify potential epidemiological patterns or factors that may be contributing to the spread of COVID-19. To accomplish this task, we will use a large dataset comprising multiple countries' daily reports of confirmed cases and deaths, alongside population information for each region. We will also apply several machine learning algorithms such as long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN).

To start our discussion, let’s first define some relevant terminology:

1. **Case**: A person who contracted COVID-19 and tested positive within a given period of time.
2. **Confirmed case**: A person who tests positive for COVID-19 outside of symptomatic testing. This term refers specifically to those newly diagnosed with the disease who are not yet showing any symptoms but have been in close contact with others who have tested positive. It does not refer to patients who test positive for the disease after recovery from symptomatic disease.
3. **Death**: An individual who has passed away due to COVID-19.
4. **Recovered**: An individual who has survived and recovered from COVID-19.
5. **Region**: Any geographical area where there is significant community transmission of COVID-19, such as a city, state or country. Each region is defined by its population size, medical resources, healthcare infrastructure, transportation networks, etc., and thus it affects both the rate at which new cases emerge and their mortality rate.

The overall strategy behind our approach is to analyze historical data collected from various sources to obtain insights into the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we aim to develop models that can accurately predict future trends in the spread of the virus based on current events and predictions. We plan to do so through the following steps: 

1. Data Collection: Collecting reliable and accurate data about COVID-19 cases, including both confirmed cases and reported deaths, is critical to building effective models. The best way to achieve this goal would be to gather data from various public sources such as news articles, official government websites, university research papers, online dashboards, etc., and then clean, preprocess, and organize the data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Once we have obtained the data, we need to perform exploratory data analysis to gain insight into the dynamics of the pandemic across different regions. Here, we should explore the available features and see if they provide any useful information for prediction. For instance, we could look at the relationship between mobility trends and COVID-19 cases, examine the effectiveness of different policies, examine the correlation between weather conditions and COVID-19 cases, compare the distribution of fatalities among age groups, gender, race, etc., and observe whether any patterns emerge. All of these analyses help us understand what drives the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to better understanding its evolution.

3. Feature Engineering: Based on our exploration results, we now need to engineer suitable features for training our machine learning models. Since the spatiotemporal nature of the problem requires us to consider temporal dependencies of variables, we can extract time-series features, such as lagged values, rolling averages, seasonal patterns, etc., to capture the changing behavior of different variables. We can also derive statistical features, such as moving averages, ratios, etc., to capture non-linear relationships between variables. Finally, we need to ensure that our model is able to handle missing values, i.e., when certain observations are missing either because the feature is unavailable or the patient didn't attend to it, our model must still learn from them.

4. Model Selection and Training: After preparing the data and engineering appropriate features, we can proceed to select and train various machine learning models. Specifically, we can try out LSTM, CNN, and RNN models to see which one works best for the given problem. These models require specific input formats, which depend on the type of data being fed into them. Therefore, we need to convert the original dataset into these formats before feeding them into the model.

5. Evaluation and Tuning: Once we have selected and trained our model, we need to evaluate its performance on various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, and confusion matrix. If necessary, we can fine-tune hyperparameters such as the choice of optimizer and activation function to improve the model's performance.

6. Prediction and Visualization: After the model is fully trained and evaluated, we can deploy it to make predictions on new data coming in continuously. We can visualize the predicted outputs to understand the impact of different factors on the spread of the disease, and identify potential areas for targeted intervention.
