Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables an agent to learn from interaction with an environment through trial-and-error. The goal of RL is to find optimal policies or strategies that maximize the reward it receives over time by taking actions that lead to better outcomes than those taken previously. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex control problems in robotics and autonomous vehicles. However, there are still many challenges in applying RL algorithms to continuous control tasks, such as handling high-dimensional states and ensuring realistic performance on challenging environments. 

To understand the success of modern RL algorithms in continuous control applications, we need a systematic review of existing research papers that address these issues. This article presents the results of our literature review, which covers four main areas related to understanding the success of RL algorithms in continuous control settings: 

1. Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

2. Model-based Methods for Reinforcement Learning

3. Exploration Strategies for Reinforcement Learning

4. Transfer Learning for Reinforcement Learning

In addition, we also provide insights into how current methods improve their convergence properties, dealing with sparse rewards, using parallel computing resources, and addressing exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Overall, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive view of the state-of-the-art and future directions in the field of reinforcement learning for continuous control applications. We hope that this study will be helpful in identifying potential gaps in the development of effective RL algorithms for continuous control and inspire new ideas for improving their effectiveness and scalability in real-world scenarios. Finally, we welcome your comments and suggestions about the content and format of this review!

Continuous control refers to the problem of controlling a dynamical system that exhibits low-level dynamics, such as a pendulum, under uncertainties in both the input and output spaces. Given a continuous-time system with inputs $u(t)$ at times $t$ and outputs $y(t)$ at other times $t'$, the task of finding a policy $\pi(a|s)$ that maximizes expected reward over all possible trajectories subject to constraints on the action space and terminal conditions is known as policy optimization. Policy evaluation estimates the value function of the policy and is usually done with Monte Carlo sampling, while policy improvement typically involves iteratively evaluating the quality of different policies and selecting the best one according to some criterion. Both policy optimization techniques can be further modified to incorporate model uncertainty or stochasticity, leading to more robust decision making.

Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) treats the system dynamics and policy as unknown functions that must be learned from data gathered during interactions with the system. This approach uses dynamic models that capture the underlying physics and the transitions between states, along with probabilistic forecasts based on past observations. MBRL relies heavily on sample efficiency and requires careful design of the transition model to avoid introducing bias into the policy.

Transfer learning is a technique used to adapt pre-trained policies to new environments without the need for extensive training on the original task. It often leads to faster learning speed and better generalization performance compared to directly training policies on the new environment. To transfer knowledge effectively, it is important to carefully select suitable source domains and target domains where transferable skills exist, since transferring poorly learned skills may result in degraded performance or instability. Additionally, domain randomization is a popular methodology to prevent catastrophic forgetting when adapting policies to new environments.

Exploration strategies refer to the set of heuristics used to explore the state-action space to ensure that agents can discover valuable solutions even in the face of limited exploration. Traditional exploration strategies include random walks, simulated annealing, and epsilon-greedy. While random walks use simple but efficient heuristics, simulated annealing is computationally expensive but can help guide exploration towards regions of higher reward. Epsilon-greedy can balance exploitation and exploration based on a user-defined probability threshold. Newer approaches involve constructing Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) based on prior experience and applying reinforcement learning techniques to optimize them efficiently. These MDP-based methods can account for dependencies among the variables and potentially handle high-dimensional states and actions.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), also known as deep Q-learning, combines neural networks with reinforcement learning techniques to solve control problems in high-dimensional state spaces. DRL architectures consist of multiple layers of artificial neurons connected by weights that can adjust automatically to minimize loss. Deep Q-networks (DQN), convolutional DQN (C51), and dueling networks form a class of models that use non-linear activation functions, deeper hidden layers, and separate value and advantage functions to represent the value of being in each state relative to its advantages and drawbacks. Other variants of DRL include Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC).
