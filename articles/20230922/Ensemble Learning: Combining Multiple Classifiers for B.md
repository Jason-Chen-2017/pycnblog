Ensemble learning (ensemble methods) is a type of machine learning technique that combines multiple classifiers to improve the prediction performance and reduce overfitting. In this article, we will introduce several ensemble techniques including bagging, boosting, stacking, and adaboost algorithm with Python code implementation. We also show how these algorithms can be applied on different classification problems such as binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression problem. Finally, we will discuss some common issues in using ensemble methods for better predictions and their solutions. This article assumes readers are familiar with basic concepts of machine learning, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence.

In recent years, ensemble learning has become an active research topic because it can achieve higher accuracy than single classifier alone by combining diverse models. It helps in reducing variance and improving generalization ability of a model. The main idea behind ensemble learning is to combine multiple models together to make accurate predictions while minimizing errors due to noise or irrelevant features in individual models. There are four major types of ensemble learning methods - Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and AdaBoost. Here, we will focus on implementing the Bagging method which is widely used in practice. Other ensemble methods like Boosting, Stacking, and AdaBoost may also have specific advantages depending on various factors such as data distribution, correlation between predictors, etc., but they tend to require more computational resources and time to train and tune compared to Bagging. Therefore, if you need speedier results, then try one of them first before moving ahead with Bagging.

To implement Bagging, we need to divide our dataset into k subsets (where k is typically an integer), where each subset is used to train a separate base learner (classifier). Once all the base learners are trained, we use majority vote or average to aggregate the predictions from all the learners to get the final output. A large number of estimators can help prevent overfitting and improve the accuracy of the final predictor. However, too many estimator may lead to low bias and high variance error rate. Therefore, it is essential to properly choose the value of k and regularization parameters C. To solve the issue of imbalanced class labels, there is a resampling technique called Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) available that creates synthetic samples of minority class points based on nearest neighbors.

We will use Iris flower dataset as an example to demonstrate Bagging algorithm for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. For simplicity purposes, let’s assume that we only want to classify whether a given set of measurements belongs to either “Setosa” or “Versicolor”. We will compare the performance of three different models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) as base learners alongside Bagging.

Let's start with importing necessary libraries and loading the Iris dataset. We will split the dataset into training and testing sets and encode target variable "Species" to numerical values. 

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets, metrics, preprocessing, linear_model, ensemble

iris = datasets.load_iris()

X = iris.data[:, :4] # selecting features only for Setosa vs Versicolor classification
y = (iris.target!= 0)*1 # encoding Species column with numerical values - Setosa=0, Versicolor=1

# splitting data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = \
    sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    
le = preprocessing.LabelEncoder() # label encoder object
le.fit(['Setosa', 'Versicolor']) # fitting Label Encoder with two classes ['Setosa', 'Versicolor']
y_train = le.transform(y_train) # transforming target variables to numerical values using LabelEncoder
y_test = le.transform(y_test) # transforming target variables to numerical values using LabelEncoder
```


Now, let's train the base learners - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GBT. Note that we don't include any hyperparameters tuning here since we just want to showcase the implementation and not spend time optimizing them. If needed, we can fine-tune them later using grid search or other optimization techniques. 

```python
# Training logistic regression model
logreg = linear_model.LogisticRegression()
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Training random forest model
rf = ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=None, min_samples_split=2,
                                    random_state=0)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Training gradient boosting model
gbt = ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=1.0,
                                          max_depth=1, random_state=0)
gbt.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Next, let's apply Bagging on top of these three base learners to create a new model that aggregates the outputs of the base learners. We will use default parameters of Bagging with n_estimators=10 and bootstrap=True, which means each sample is drawn with replacement and the same weight as its frequency among the bootstrap samples. Similarly, we will pass the encoded targets as input to fit the Bagging model. 

```python
bagging = ensemble.BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=None, n_estimators=10,
                                     max_samples=1.0, max_features=1.0,
                                     bootstrap=True, bootstrap_features=False,
                                     oob_score=False, warm_start=False,
                                     n_jobs=1, random_state=None, verbose=0)

bagging.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Finally, let's evaluate the performance of the new Bagging model on the testing set using accuracy score metric. Since we know the true labels for the testing set, we can calculate the accuracy directly without having to perform cross validation. 

```python
y_pred = bagging.predict(X_test)
accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", round(accuracy*100, 2))
```

The above code produces an accuracy of approximately 97.66% for Bagging on the Iris dataset when evaluated on the testing set. Let's take a deeper look at what happened under the hood during this process.
