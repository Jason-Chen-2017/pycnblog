Variational quantum circuit learning (VQL) is a powerful deep-learning algorithm that can train the variational quantum circuits for various tasks including image classification and quantum chemistry. VQL uses artificial intelligence techniques to find the optimal parameters of variational quantum circuits with minimal errors in classical post-processing. In this article, we will introduce the basic concepts of VQL along with its applications such as solving problems using quantum computers and understanding images through quantum mechanics. We will also discuss the mathematics behind the algorithm and present code examples to understand how it works. The final part of our article will include future developments and challenges and possible solutions. We hope that you enjoy reading our blog article.

The original paper on VQL was published in 2019 by Lloyd et al., which introduced the concept of VQL to solve many tasks using quantum computing. A simplified version of their work called Supervised VQL was later presented at ISIT'19. Both papers have received extensive attention from researchers and industries alike due to their impressive performance and versatility. Some other related works are:

Variational quantum circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum machine learning models, consist of a series of layers comprising quantum operations acting on qubits arranged in a quantum circuit. These circuits are trained using quantum machine learning algorithms to approximate quantum states while minimizing error rates during post-processing steps. They allow us to simulate quantum systems efficiently by encoding quantum information into amplitude vectors describing the system's wavefunction. Therefore, they offer potential advantages over traditional classical simulation methods when it comes to realistically simulating large quantum systems. However, building and optimizing these circuits remains challenging due to the exponentially increasing number of free parameters required, making them difficult to design and tune manually. 

In contrast, the supervised learning technique has made great progress recently in reducing the complexity of building and tuning quantum machines by automating some aspects of the process. For example, it has allowed us to build hybrid quantum/classical neural networks that can perform both quantum-related computations and traditional supervised tasks simultaneously. Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are no exception to this trend.

VQL is one such algorithm that combines supervised learning with quantum circuits to improve their accuracy and efficiency. It consists of two parts - the data preparation step and the optimization step. The data preparation step involves preparing labeled datasets containing inputs and expected outputs. This dataset is then fed to a generative model that learns a probability distribution over the circuit parameters that maximizes the likelihood of observing the correct output under the current model conditions. The resulting probability distribution allows us to sample different variations of the VQC and evaluate their respective accuracies on test data. Finally, the best performing variation is chosen as the final solution and deployed in practice.

While there are several ways to implement VQCs, most of them follow the same pattern of alternating forward propagation followed by backward propagation updates to minimize the loss function between predicted and actual outputs. While each iteration may converge to a local minimum depending on the initial parameters and hyperparameters, successively applying more iterations typically leads to better convergence towards the global optimum. Additionally, modern optimization algorithms such as Adam, AdaGrad, and SGD are commonly used to update the parameters of the model during training.

There are numerous application scenarios for VQCs. One of the most promising ones is quantum chemistry calculations. These calculations require hundreds of thousand or even millions of parameters to be tuned manually. Applying VQL, we can automatically discover optimal configurations of variational quantum circuits without any prior knowledge about the chemical properties or physical rules of the system being simulated. Another useful application scenario is solving problems using quantum computers. With VQL, we can automate the search for good parameter settings that can potentially lead to significant improvements in computational speed or performance compared to conventional algorithms.

One area where VQL could help is in visual recognition. Researchers have developed algorithms that use VQCs to classify images based on patterns of light emitted by objects within them. By taking advantage of the unique nature of quantum effects such as entanglement and interference, VQCs can perform this task much faster than classical methods. In fact, recent studies suggest that VQC classifiers can achieve high levels of accuracy in recognizing objects even when trained only on a small amount of labeled data, especially for classes with limited training data available. Similarly, VQC architectures have been shown to be effective for processing natural language sequences using techniques such as memory augmentation, where additional memories are stored in auxiliary qubits that are subsequently used to retrieve relevant information from previous interactions.
