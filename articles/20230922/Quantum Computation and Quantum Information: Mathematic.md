## 概述
量子计算（quantum computing）与量子信息（quantum information）的概念起源于两个非常不同的领域。量子计算研究的是如何构建可以解决某些复杂计算问题的系统，而量子信息研究的是如何处理、传输、储存和处理高带宽、长距离的信息。在实际应用中，它们经常组合在一起成为“量子计算+量子信息”（quantum computation + quantum information，QCI）。由于许多应用都是由计算支配的，因此只有理解了其基础才能更好地理解相关理论和技术。
在本文中，我将介绍量子计算与量子信息的一些最重要的 mathematical basis和 applications。我会从以下几个方面展开：
- Basic concepts of quantum mechanics
- Basic concepts of quantum physics and related theories
- Probabilistic and tensor networks
- Quantum error correction codes
- Shor's algorithm for factorization
- Grover's algorithm for database search
- Cryptography based on entanglement
- Quantum algorithms for graph problems
- Quantum machine learning techniques
- Quantum chemistry simulations using superconducting qubits

# 2.Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
## 概述
量子力学（quantum mechanics）是关于物质、能量及其相互作用的微观世界的一门新型物理学。它由德国的马库斯·奥尔金（Max Planck Institute for Quantum Physics）和丹麦物理学家艾登·布洛赫（Adrian Blöcke）于上世纪八十年代创立。量子力学的一个主要目标是研究不同粒子、原子和分子在各种宇宙尺度下的行为。然而，要理解量子力学并不容易。在本节中，我将简要回顾一下量子力学中的一些基本概念。
## Quantum States
一个量子态（quantum state）指的是量子系统处在某种特殊状态，这个状态由一组复数 amplitudes 定义。每个 amplitude 表示系统处于一个特定的 quantum state 的可能性。通常情况下，我们用希腊字母 $|q\rangle$ 来表示一个 quantum state ，其中 $q$ 是表示状态的数字。例如， $|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$, $|+\rangle$, $|-\rangle$, etc., are commonly used states. The notation $|\psi\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle$ is also commonly used to represent a general quantum state where $\psi$ is some label that we choose to denote it. We can also write more complicated quantum states using tensor products of simpler ones such as $|a\rangle |b\rangle$. For example, $|\psi_1 \otimes \psi_2 \rangle = |x_1 x_2\rangle$, where $x_1, x_2$ are binary numbers (0 or 1) indicating whether the first or second quantum system is in the $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$ state respectively.
To obtain a concrete understanding of what a quantum state represents, let’s consider an example. Suppose we have two electrons in a single ionized atom with spin-orbit coupling. One electron is initially located at one of its orbitals, and the other electron is located far away from the nucleus but very close to the position of the other electron. We want to compute the probability of finding both electrons in different positions over all possible configurations of these two electrons. This gives us a problem known as the two-particle Hilbert space. However, since this system has a large number of degrees of freedom due to the coupling between the spins, representing them explicitly is not feasible. Instead, we will use a representation called a wave function. A wave function is a complex-valued function that describes how the quantum state transitions between different energy levels as we manipulate it under certain applied field and interaction processes. In terms of our example, the wave function might look something like:
$$\psi(x_1, x_2,\theta,\phi)= e^{-i(k_1 x_1 + k_2 x_2)}R(\theta)\cdot R(\phi)|0\rangle $$
where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the quantum numbers describing each particle’s energy level splitting, $R(\theta)$ and $R(\phi)$ are rotation matrices describing any orientations of the particles in the system relative to each other, and $x_1, x_2$ are binary values indicating the occupation of each orbital. If we apply an external potential to the system, such as a magnetic field, then the resulting wave function changes according to the Schrödinger equation, which involves solving time-dependent Schrodinger’s Equation. While this is beyond the scope of this article, it should be noted here that the same principles that govern classical waves also apply to quantum waves. More generally, a quantum state can be described by a wave function, which is essentially just another way of representing the state’s behavior.
In summary, a quantum state is defined by a set of amplitudes corresponding to each of its constituent subspaces. Different types of quantum systems exhibit different types of behaviors when measured, so it is important to understand the basic properties of quantum mechanics and the various representations they may take before we attempt to solve quantum-mechanical problems.
## Quantum Gates
A quantum gate is a unitary operation performed on a quantum state, usually represented by a matrix. A gate performs a transformation on the input state into an output state that is determined entirely by the input state itself and a fixed set of parameters specified by the matrix defining the gate. Examples of gates include quantum logic gates such as NOT (negation), AND, OR, and XOR, as well as common single-qubit gates such as Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard, and phase shift, among many others. Gates can act on individual qubits (single bits), pairs of qubits (two bits combined into a higher dimensional Hilbert space), and even entire systems consisting of multiple qubits. There are several ways to implement gates using classical computers today, including gate decomposition methods and quantum circuits.
Gates themselves cannot transfer any information directly without being subjected to additional processing or measurement. When working with quantum information, we need to use encoding and decoding protocols to encode data into quantum states, and then decode them back into useful forms. These protocols involve manipulating the quantum state using quantum gates and measuring the resultant quantum state to extract the encoded data. Many practical uses of quantum gates fall within the realm of cryptographic encryption and fault tolerant communication, and their performance is often evaluated through benchmarks such as quantum teleportation, Shor’s algorithm, and Grover’s algorithm. By understanding the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum computation, we can begin to develop a better understanding of how to design, analyze, and optimize quantum algorithms for real world applications.
