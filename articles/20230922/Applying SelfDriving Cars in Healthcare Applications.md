Healthcare industry is one of the top sectors that is affected by the growing digitalization and automation technologies. With more advanced diagnosis tools and remote monitoring devices, it becomes even harder for healthcare professionals to provide optimal care at a reasonable cost. In order to overcome this challenge, many companies have started developing self-driving cars as alternative solutions, which can help healthcare professionals save time and improve patient outcomes. However, while these systems are promising, they need further development to become truly useful in real-world applications such as in hospitals or health clinics. In this article, we will introduce the core concepts, algorithms, code examples, and future trends of applying self-driving cars in healthcare applications. We will also discuss some challenges faced during the implementation process and explore potential benefits and risks associated with using self-driving cars in medical practice.
Self-driving car (SDC) technology has emerged as an efficient way to reduce traffic congestion and enhance mobility in urban areas. It is already being used in several high-profile industries like Apple's self-driving car program in California and Tesla's autopilot feature in US cities. The increasing popularity of SDCs has led to increased interest in its use in various domains including transportation, logistics, manufacturing, retail, and healthcare. However, there exist several practical challenges when it comes to deploying such technology into public spaces where patients' safety and wellbeing should be considered. 

In recent years, there has been significant progress towards unlocking the power of SDCs through various advances in computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques. Over the past decade, advancements in deep neural networks and object detection have made possible complex tasks like mapping and navigation much easier than ever before. Additionally, multi-modal data integration and fusion techniques enable us to combine multiple sensors like radar, lidar, cameras, etc., making it possible to build robust and accurate perception models. In this era of artificial intelligence, we see a shift from traditional rule-based systems towards fully automated decision-making based on large amounts of data. These changes make it feasible to deploy SDCs into public spaces like hospitals or health clinics without risking life and property. Therefore, it is essential for healthcare practitioners to understand the key considerations involved in their deployment and adoption of SDCs.

 # 2. Key Concepts and Terminology
This section provides a brief introduction to the main concepts and terminology required to understand self-driving cars in healthcare applications. Some of these terms may be familiar to readers who have experience working with self-driving cars, but others require additional explanation. 

 # Road Network
A road network consists of roads and intersections that connect different streets together. Typically, these roads and intersections are designed so that vehicles can travel between them efficiently and safely. When driving alongside other vehicles, however, accidents occur frequently due to traffic jams and other factors. To avoid these issues, drivers need to stay within certain distance from each other and move slowly enough to avoid obstacles. It is not uncommon for police to issue citizen speed warnings when speeding is detected on a roadway. Similarly, SDCs can use visual recognition techniques to identify obstacles and avoid collisions with them. This reduces the risk of accidents and improves driver comfort. 

 # Lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) Sensor
Lidar stands for Light Detection And Ranging. It is a scanning sensor that detects objects in the environment by illuminating a laser beam and measuring the time delay caused by reflected light back to the sensor. This technique allows it to measure distances up to several kilometers away. This information is then processed by the vehicle's control system to decide how far to drive ahead. In addition to tracking obstacles, SDCs could leverage LiDAR to track microbes and pathogens to better manage diseases spread across the body. 

 # Radar (Radio Detection And Ranging) Sensor
Radar stands for Radio Detection And Ranging. It uses microwave radiation instead of visible light to scan the surrounding area. Unlike LiDAR, it cannot penetrate deep underground structures because of its low energy density. However, radar is sensitive to electromagnetic noise generated by nearby objects and therefore suitable for monitoring urban environments where electromagnetic interference is common. SDCs could use radar to detect sudden increases in temperature or sound levels, indicating signs of respiratory disease or tissue damage. 

 # Camera
A camera captures images of the surroundings. By analyzing these images, SDCs can identify specific features, like pedestrians crossing the street or vehicles approaching from behind. They can then take corrective action to prevent incidents and optimize safe driving conditions. Furthermore, SDCs could use camera mounted on the windshield or dashboard to monitor breathing rate and alert the driver if necessary. 

 # Vehicle Model and Control System
The choice of vehicle model, construction, and configuration play a crucial role in the performance and effectiveness of any SDC system. Models vary depending on the type of application and the intended user audience. For instance, sedan or SUV options are popular choices for urban delivery services whereas off-road vehicles are more appropriate for rural settings. Different configurations like automatic transmission and geared differential allow the vehicle to maintain a smooth grip and adjust speed according to the current situation. Finally, the control system is responsible for interpreting incoming data from all the sensors and actuators and directing the vehicle movement accordingly. 

 # Path Planning Algorithm
Path planning algorithm determines the sequence of actions needed to reach a destination. One example of a path planning algorithm is A* search algorithm, which computes the shortest path between two points on a map. The algorithm takes into account many factors like road curvature, traffic flow, and existing obstacles. Once the desired path is calculated, the SDC system can send commands to the actuators of the vehicle to follow it accurately.

 # Data Fusion Techniques
Data fusion involves combining data from multiple sources to create an accurate representation of the world around us. Traditionally, data was collected from multiple sensors and then manually merged together. Today, with the advent of big data analytics, it is becoming increasingly feasible to collect and analyze vast amounts of data from diverse sources simultaneously. With the rise of SDCs, new methods of data fusion have evolved, allowing us to integrate data from multiple sensors to produce a single representation of the world. Examples include multi-sensor fusion, odometry, particle filters, graph-based localization, and probabilistic inference.

 # Mapping
Mapping refers to the creation of a digital representation of the physical world using sensors and data processing. Mapping enables SDCs to navigate the environment and plan routes to goals. There are various types of maps available, including static maps, satellite imagery, and point clouds. Static maps are created by taking photos of the surroundings taken from different angles. Satellite imagery is obtained by capturing pictures of Earth’s surface using various satellites orbiting the planet. Point cloud is a set of three-dimensional coordinates representing the positions of objects in space. Processing of point clouds extracts valuable information about the structure, topology, and dynamics of the environment. SDCs could use mapping to identify places where it needs to stop to evacuate people, plan routes to visit family members, or find food sources that are too close to the border.

 # Perception Module
Perception module is responsible for extracting meaningful information from raw sensory input. The output of the perception module includes relevant information about the state of the environment, such as objects located near the SDC, pedestrians crossing the road, moving objects in the scene, and ambient sounds. The perception module combines data from various sensors to generate a comprehensive understanding of the world. 

 # Decision Making Module
Decision-making module makes decisions based on the inputs received from the perception module and applies safety rules and constraints to ensure that the SDC does not cause harm to humans or property. The decision-making module takes into account critical factors such as priorities, constraints, and resource availability. It produces a series of instructions to the vehicle control system instructing it what actions to take next.

 # Driver Assistance Systems
Driver assistance systems (DAS) typically consist of hardware components, software modules, and interfaces that assist drivers in accomplishing various tasks related to navigation, obstacle avoidance, and lane keeping. DAS usually come equipped with built-in sensors, actuators, and computing capabilities that give drivers enhanced capabilities beyond just following the road. The advantage of DAS is that they eliminate the need for human intervention, reducing the risk of accidents and improving overall safety. Examples of commonly used DAS systems include headlights, wipers, brake assist, and auto-parking.
