# 1.简介
  

Cloud computing has become a popular platform that offers flexible scalability and elasticity in terms of both resources and workload. The demands on cloud platforms are increasing day by day due to the ever-increasing growth of businesses and industries all over the world. In such scenarios, there is a need for dynamic resource allocation that can respond quickly to varying workloads and reduce wastage of resources. There have been several research works focused on automatic scaling of cloud resources based on predicted or measured metrics, but they have limited their scope to predefined services or applications with stable workloads. For example, if an application experiences sudden spikes in traffic or user activity during peak hours, it may not be able to scale up its cloud instances easily without manual intervention. 

In this paper, we propose new methods for adaptive autoscaling of cloud resources that adaptively adjust the number of cloud instances according to evolving workloads while taking into account non-functional requirements like latency, throughput, and cost constraints. We use machine learning techniques to predict future workloads based on historical data collected from various sources like logs, monitoring systems, and performance counters. Based on these predictions, our algorithm then adapts the number of cloud instances using an optimization approach that minimizes both energy consumption and resource utilization. Our algorithm also considers different types of clouds like public and private, hybrid and multi-cloud environments as well as edge and fog devices within the network. Additionally, our method provides insights into how individual components contribute to overall system performance under different loads and identifies bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement. Finally, our experimental results show that our proposed method consistently outperforms other existing adaptive autoscaling algorithms in terms of resource utilization and cost savings.

2.相关工作背景
Autoscaling is widely used to manage application and service resources in cloud platforms. However, previous research works only focus on predefined services or applications with static or relatively fixed workloads. This makes them unable to adapt dynamically to changing workloads in real time. Furthermore, most approaches require manual tuning of parameters like scaling factor, threshold values, and cooldown periods, which limits their effectiveness in dealing with unexpected events like sudden changes in workloads or high volatility caused by seasonal fluctuations in users' behavior. To address these limitations, we propose a novel methodology called Neural Adaptive Resource Scaling (NARScal) which uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn patterns and relationships between metrics and workload trends, and automatically scales the number of cloud instances accordingly.

However, NARScal requires significant expertise in designing DNN architectures, gathering large volumes of data, and fine-tuning hyperparameters. Moreover, it does not take into account potential issues like latency, throughput, and cost constraints that may arise when scaling cloud resources. Therefore, we cannot apply it directly to autoscaling of cloud resources. Nonetheless, NARScal's principles of pattern recognition and prediction still hold valuable insights for addressing similar problems.

Adaptive autoscaling methods also exist for single-tenant environments like virtual machines running on physical servers. These methods rely on heuristics or mathematical formulas to determine appropriate resource allocations based on past performance measurements. However, these methods ignore the fact that workloads in the cloud environment vary rapidly over time and that optimal resource allocations change frequently. Consequently, these methods are insufficient for managing the whole lifecycle of cloud resources.
