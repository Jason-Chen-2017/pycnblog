Big data has become a key industry in recent years, and it’s only going to continue to grow exponentially over the next few years. However, setting up enterprise-level big data infrastructure is not straightforward because of many complex components involved, from distributed file systems such as Hadoop HDFS to query engines like Apache Hive or Presto, to resource management tools such as YARN or Mesos. To simplify this process for enterprises and save costs, companies often rely on cloud computing services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which offer pre-configured big data solutions but are limited by capacity, pricing models, and performance constraints. 

In contrast, enterprises can set up their own big data infrastructure using open-source software called Cloudera. Cloudera provides all necessary components for building a big data ecosystem: 

 - Distributed File System (HDFS): A scalable storage layer that supports petabytes of data across multiple servers

 - Resource Management Tool (YARN/Mesos): A cluster manager that manages resources and schedules tasks across nodes

 - Query Engine (Apache Hive or Presto): A tool used to analyze large datasets stored in HDFS

 - Data Warehouse (Cloudera Navigator or Spark SQL): A database optimized for storing and analyzing large volumes of structured and unstructured data
 
This article will cover how to create an enterprise-grade big data infrastructure with Cloudera, including installation, configuration, security, monitoring, and optimization. Specifically, we'll be installing Cloudera Manager on one server, configuring YARN and HDFS, setting up Apache Hive, and optimizing the environment for performance and cost-effectiveness. By the end of the article, you should have a fully functional big data platform that meets your specific needs. 

Let's get started! 

# 2.Overview
The following steps outline the basic architecture of our Cloudera-based big data platform:

  - Install Cloudera Manager on a single node: We will install Cloudera Manager on a Linux machine running Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS, which will act as the central point of control for managing our big data platform. The first step is to download the latest version of Cloudera Manager from https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/manager/5-x.html and copy it onto the target server using SCP. Once downloaded, untar the package into the desired directory using `sudo tar xzf cloudera-manager-installer*.tar.gz --directory /opt`.

  - Configure High Availability (HA): In order to ensure high availability and fault tolerance of our system, we need to configure HA for each service in our big data platform. For example, if any hardware component fails, we want our platform to automatically switch over to redundant hardware without interruption to user operations. To enable HA for our platform, we will need to install and configure HDFS NameNodes, YARN ResourceManagers, and Hive Metastores in HA mode using ZooKeeper as a coordination service. 

  - Create a Cluster: After enabling HA for our various services, we can now add them to a new cluster within Cloudera Manager. Each service added to the cluster must also be properly configured before being added, making sure they communicate securely with each other and use appropriate hardware resources according to our requirements.

  - Set Up HDFS: First, let's create directories for our HDFS name nodes and secondary name nodes. On the primary namenode, run these commands:
  
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /data/hdfs/namenodes && \
  sudo chmod g+w /data/hdfs/namenodes && \
  echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_191" >> ~/.bashrc && \
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
  
  Next, start up the HDFS service using Cloudera Manager. Once the service is up and running, navigate to its Configuration tab and click on the Directory and Journal Nodes section. Here, we can modify some important settings related to journal node replication, block size, and disk space allocation. Also, under Advanced, make sure to select the Automatic repair option so that the service repairs itself automatically in case of failure. Finally, restart the HDFS service after making any changes. 

  - Set Up YARN: Similarly, we will set up the YARN service by navigating to the Clusters page within Cloudera Manager, selecting the Default Cluster created during setup, and clicking on Add Service. Choose the YARN role and follow the prompts to configure the service. Make sure to specify the correct port numbers for communication between clients and the YARN resource managers. Also, select the Global ResourceManager HA option when configuring the service. Ensure that the Active Standby Nodemanagers are set up correctly and perform health checks regularly.  

  - Set Up Hive: Now, we're ready to set up the Hive service. Click on the Add Service button again and choose the Hive role. Follow the prompts to complete the service configuration. Ensure that the metastore URL points to the Zookeeper quorum responsible for maintaining metadata about tables and databases, and that client configurations include the location of the Thrift JDBC driver. Ensure that there are sufficient resources allocated to the service to handle queries appropriately. 

  - Optimize Performance and Cost: With our platform installed and functioning, we can begin tuning the various parameters to optimize performance and reduce costs. Navigate to the General tab within the YARN service configuration, and increase the heap size and CPU cores allocated to the active nodemanagers if needed. Also, consider disabling unused applications to minimize unnecessary processing overhead. If possible, use compressed formats for data storage instead of raw text files, and avoid excessive use of mapreduce jobs that involve shuffling large amounts of data. Lastly, monitor usage statistics and adjust the environment accordingly based on observed bottlenecks and hotspots.
