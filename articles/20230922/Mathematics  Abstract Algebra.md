Abstract algebra is a branch of mathematics devoted to studying structures and operations that can be performed on elements of various mathematical objects such as sets, vectors, matrices, rings, fields, algebras, etc., regardless of their internal structure or implementation details. In this article, we will discuss the basics of abstract algebra including terminology, basic concepts, main theorems, proofs and algorithms. We will also include relevant code snippets in Python along with explanations for each step. Finally, we will discuss the future trends and challenges ahead for more complex topics like Galois theory and Lie algebras.

2.基本术语
Let’s start by defining some basic terms related to abstract algebra:

1. Elements: An element is an object that can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided (in some cases) using arithmetic operations. Examples of elements are numbers, letters, vectors, squares, polynomials, graphs, and so on.

2. Sets: A set is a collection of distinct elements. Some common sets include finite sets (such as integers), countable sets (such as natural numbers), uncountable sets (such as real numbers), infinite sets, and dependent sets. A special type of set called a power set is used to describe all possible subsets of any given set.

3. Operations: The fundamental operations in abstract algebra are addition, multiplication, scalar multiplication, negation, inverse, division, and exponentiation. These operations act on individual elements or entire sets of elements and produce new elements or sets respectively. For example, addition acts on two numbers to produce a sum; multiplication acts on a number and vector to produce a product.

4. Rings and Fields: Two important types of algebras are rings and fields. A ring is an associative algebraic structure consisting of one or more commutative and unital binary operations (+ and *) that form abelian groups under multiplication, where every non-zero element has an inverse. A field extends a ring with a least one element whose additive inverse exists, resulting in a division operation (/). Field extensions allow for exact computations without rounding errors due to limited precision. The most commonly used examples of rings and fields are integers, rational numbers, and reals.

5. Modules and Vector Spaces: Modules are a generalization of rings and fields that can have additional properties beyond just being a group/ring structure. Specifically, modules over a ring $R$ are typically free abelian groups with invertible elements denoted by $\lambda$, meaning they satisfy the condition $\lambda \cdot x = x\cdot \lambda = 1_R$. A module over a ring may contain zero elements which do not violate any property of the underlying ring, while a submodule must be generated by at least one non-zero element. Commonly used examples of modules are matrices and polynomial rings, while vector spaces are often seen in computer graphics applications.

6. Algebras: An algebra is a collection of generators, same as a monoid, and a series of multiplication rules that combine these generators according to specific patterns. One simple example of an algebra is a group, such as the integers modulo n, where the generator is -n+1 and the rule is $(a + b)\mod{n} = (a \mod{n}) \mod{n}$. Another example of an algebra is a Boolean algebra, where the generator is either 0 or 1 and the rule is XOR, meaning if both operands are true then the result is false, otherwise it is true.

7. Homomorphisms: A homomorphism between two categories is a mapping that preserves the products of morphisms within the source category and respects the identities of its target category. A functor from Category A to B is a homomorphism between A and B if there is a unique homomorphism between any pair of objects X and Y in A and their image in B. This allows us to map between different contexts and models of reality depending on our needs.

8. Isomorphisms: An isomorphism between two structures means that they have the same representatives in each category and are therefore equivalent up to an isomorphism of homomorphisms. A bijection is an isomorphism when both directions are defined.

9. Categories: A category consists of a collection of objects and morphisms between them. There are several classes of categories, including sets, topological spaces, functors, modules, and algebras. The notation for specifying a category is C(A,X) where A is the set of objects and X is the set of morphisms between them.

10. Lie Algebras: A Lie algebra is a non-commutative algebra that contains infinitely many copies of itself with different names but equal content. It is useful in describing physical systems that exhibit rotation and translation transformations. There are multiple versions of Lie algebras, including Cartan, Burnside, and Adjoint algebras. Additionally, Lie algebras are used extensively in quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and hydrodynamics.
