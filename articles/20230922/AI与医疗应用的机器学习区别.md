> 医疗行业最需要的基础科技正在成为人工智能（AI）在医疗领域的新焦点。随着医疗IT产业的迅速发展，越来越多的公司、组织、政府机构纷纷布局医疗IT方向，要求各类医疗机构从事医疗数据分析、运营管理、风险管理等方面的技术支持，让医疗服务更加科技化、高效化。由此带来的机遇就是给予企业应有的信心和能力，积极参与到医疗IT领域中来。但是对于医疗IT领域的专业技术人员而言，它与传统计算机技术相比又存在着一些差异性。本文将详细介绍AI与医疗应用的机器学习的区别，并希望通过文中所述的知识对读者有所帮助。

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 什么是机器学习？

机器学习（Machine Learning，ML），亦称“智能学习”，是一门与日俱增的研究领域。简单地说，机器学习是借助于计算机科学、统计学和人工智能的一些方法，让计算机能够自己发现并利用数据中的规律和模式，从而进行预测、分类、回归、聚类及其他任务。一般来说，机器学习可以分成三种类型：监督学习、无监督学习和半监督学习。在这三种类型的机器学习中，监督学习可以训练出一个模型，使其对已知数据的输入产生正确的输出，而不用人工指定每个样本的输出标签。无监督学习则不需要输出标签，它可以自主发现数据中的结构性特征。半监督学习即同时使用有监督学习和无监督学习的方法。

## 2.2 什么是深度学习？

深度学习（Deep Learning，DL），是指深层神经网络的机器学习方法。深度学习是基于数据集上学习的神经网络，它以特征向量作为输入，通过反复迭代，用优化算法寻找最佳的权重参数，最终达到能够预测或分类新的、未见过的数据的能力。深度学习具有良好的普适性、透明性和泛化性能。

## 2.3 什么是语音识别？

语音识别（Speech Recognition，SR），也称声纹识别、语音合成，是指利用计算机系统把用户发出的声音转换成文字、命令、指令等信息的过程。其主要目的是为了方便人们使用智能手机、电脑和其他设备进行交流。语音识别系统通常由四个组件组成，包括前端、后端、语言模型和声学模型。前端负责音频采集、信号处理、频谱分析；后端负责语音识别、文本理解；语言模型用于计算语言概率；声学模型用于建模语音信号。目前最常用的语音识别系统都是基于深度学习的。

## 3.1 Linear Regression
Linear regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses linear equations to model relationships between input variables and output variables. The goal of this algorithm is to find the best fit line or curve through a set of data points by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE) between actual and predicted values. In other words, it estimates the parameters of a linear equation such as y = b + w*x that minimize the error between the expected outcome and the predicted outcome for each individual data point. 

The formula used to calculate the slope parameter (w) is:



where n represents the number of training examples, xn denotes the feature value for example i, yn denotes the target value for example i, Σx denotes the sum of all features, and Σy denotes the sum of all targets.

The intercept term (b) can be calculated using any method such as least squares, maximum likelihood estimation, or ridge regression. If there are multiple input features, they need to be combined into one predictor variable before applying linear regression, which is known as multi-dimensional linear regression. This process involves adding new columns of ones to the matrix containing the original features and concatenating them with the result of the previous calculation.

## 3.2 Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is another type of classification algorithm that is commonly used in medical applications. It is similar to linear regression but instead of predicting a continuous value, it outputs a probability score between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of an instance being classified into a particular category. The logistic function serves as the activation function in the final layer of a neural network architecture that produces binary output (e.g., true or false).

## 3.3 Decision Trees and Random Forests
Decision trees and random forests are two types of ensemble methods that are often used in medical application fields. Both decision trees and random forests involve creating a series of if-then rules based on input features, where each rule maps an observation to a leaf node in the tree. Each branch corresponds to a single condition that is checked at each node during prediction time. When building a decision tree, the optimal split involves finding the most informative feature and threshold value that maximize information gain. On the other hand, random forests combine many decision trees together to reduce overfitting, while also increasing accuracy and robustness.

In order to create a random forest, several decision trees are trained independently on different subsets of the data and then combined to make predictions. During training, each decision tree selects a subset of samples randomly from the entire dataset, and creates its own tree structure. After all the trees have been constructed, their outputs are averaged or voting to obtain the overall prediction. Therefore, random forests are very accurate and robust classifiers. They are also computationally efficient because each tree requires only a small amount of memory and can handle large datasets. Additionally, random forests automatically detect and avoid overfitting due to bagging, which reduces the correlation between the models and prevents them from memorizing specific examples or characteristics in the training set.
