# 2.1 Introduction to AI and its Terminology
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes that delivers advanced capabilities and cognitive abilities through machines or software. It has gained widespread adoption over recent years with applications ranging from medical diagnoses to self-driving cars. Although the concept of artificial intelligence is simple, it involves a large number of concepts and terms such as machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, data analytics, natural language processing, and ethical concerns. In this section, we will introduce some fundamental concepts and terminologies related to AI and explain their significance for privacy and security considerations.

### What Is AI?
Artificial intelligence (AI) was first coined by computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950's. The term "intelligent" refers to having the ability to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. One way to achieve intelligence is by developing machines that can recognize patterns and make decisions on their own based on data inputs provided by humans. These machines are called "artificial agents."

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Machine learning and deep learning have emerged as two main branches of AI research. Both of them share similarities in how they model complex systems using statistical techniques. However, there are key differences between these two approaches:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Supervised learning is where the algorithm learns from labeled training examples. For example, if you were trying to train an image recognition system, you would provide a set of images along with labels indicating which ones contain specific objects or faces. Then the system can identify new instances of those objects or faces in other images during testing. This approach requires a lot of labeled data, making it more challenging than unsupervised learning, which can infer patterns from unlabeled data.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning is used when you don't have any pre-existing labels for your dataset. Instead, the system identifies clusters or groups of similar data points without any guidance. For example, clustering algorithms like k-means group together similar data points based on their features and distance measures. They then use this information to make predictions about new data points.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning models the decision-making process as an interactive game between the agent and its environment. An agent interacts with the environment by taking actions, getting rewards, and receiving feedback about its performance. It learns by trial-and-error by playing games against itself. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find the best strategy through trial-and-error interactions with the environment.

In contrast, deep learning models are made up of many layers of interconnected nodes. Each node takes input from previous layers, performs a transformation on it, and passes the output to the next layer. At the end of the network, you have a set of learned features that can be used to classify or predict new data.

### Neural Networks
A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of multiple layers of neurons, each connected to one another via synapses. Each neuron receives input from various sources, processes it, and then signals the neurons in the adjacent layers. The final output of the neural network is usually passed through an activation function, such as sigmoid or softmax, before being interpreted as the predicted class label. A neural network typically includes several hidden layers and uses backpropagation for training. Backpropagation updates the weights of the connections between neurons based on the error gradient calculated during forward propagation.

### Data Analytics
Data analytics refers to tools and techniques used to analyze and extract valuable insights from large amounts of data. Common methods include descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, clustering, time series modeling, and pattern recognition. Big data analytics frameworks are used to handle datasets that exceed traditional computing resources.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing is a subfield of AI focused on understanding and manipulating human language. NLP algorithms take textual input and convert it into structured or semi-structured formats. Some common tasks include sentiment analysis, entity recognition, topic modeling, and document classification.

### Ethics and Governance Concerns
Ethical issues such as bias, fairness, accountability, and transparency arise in all aspects of AI development, deployment, and operation. To address these issues, governments, businesses, and academic institutions often require compliance reports covering AI technology usage, governance structures, and legal frameworks. Companies also need to demonstrate that they are not engaging in discriminatory practices, such as hiring or retaining employees who are underrepresented in certain fields, or encouraging bad actors to exploit vulnerabilities in their products. Lastly, regulators must ensure that the technologies do what they are supposed to do within the constraints of law and social norms.
