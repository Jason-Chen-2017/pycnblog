Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which has been introduced to the research community for its ability to process and remember time series data without the vanishing gradient problem. The LSTM model is an extension of traditional RNNs that can better handle sequential data by introducing forget gates or gate mechanisms that control the amount of information retained at each step. In this article, we will demonstrate how to implement LSTM models using Keras library in Python language. We will use the MNIST dataset as an example to showcase the implementation. 

The purpose of writing this article is to provide technical details about LSTM networks including basic concepts, algorithms, and code examples. By reading through this article, you will be able to understand the working principles behind LSTM models and build more advanced applications based on these ideas. If you are familiar with machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn, then it should not be too difficult for you to follow along. However, if you have never used any deep learning libraries before, some knowledge about coding skills would help you get started faster. 

By the end of this article, you will have learned:

1. How to design and train an LSTM model using Keras library
2. What is an LSTM model and what problems does it solve?
3. How do LSTMs retain information over long periods of time and why they work well with sequence data?
4. How to interpret and analyze the results of LSTM models

## 2.1 LSTM模型概述
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It was developed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997 to deal with the vanishing gradients problem in traditional RNNs. Similarly to traditional RNNs, LSTMs also process sequences of inputs. Unlike traditional RNSs though, LSTMs offer several advantages such as:

1. They have "memory" capabilities, meaning they can retain previous states and contextual information over long periods of time. This makes them ideal for processing sequences of variable length where there is a need to maintain stateful representations across multiple steps of computation. 

2. They allow long-range dependencies to occur between elements of a sequence. For instance, when predicting the next word in a sentence, the relationship between the current word and the upcoming ones may depend on previous words rather than just the current one. Traditional RNNs tend to lose this information due to their fixed hidden state size.

3. They use different gate structures than traditional RNNs to regulate the flow of information into and out of cells. These gates enable LSTMs to learn complex relationships between input and output values during training while controlling the flow of information across time steps.

In summary, LSTMs combine features from both RNNs and feedforward networks to address the issues associated with vanilla RNNs and improve performance on sequential data.

### 2.2.1 遗忘门、输入门、输出门
Before looking into the mathematical details of LSTMs, let's first take a look at how they manage the flow of information within cells in order to ensure efficient processing of sequential data. The following figure shows how LSTMs work at a high level. Each cell consists of three gates:

1. The **Forget Gate** controls how much existing information in a cell should be discarded or kept. It takes two inputs: the previous state $C_{t−1}$ and the input $\tilde{x}_t$ from the current timestep. Based on this input, the forget gate decides which parts of the cell state to keep and which parts to discard. To calculate the forget gate activation value, we pass all four inputs through a sigmoid function and multiply the result by the previously calculated cell state $C_t$, obtaining a new candidate cell state $\widetilde{C}_t$. Then we add this new candidate cell state to the product of the input $\tilde{x}_t$ and the forget gate activation value, resulting in the updated cell state $C_t^*$.

2. The **Input Gate** controls how much new information should be added to the cell state. It works similarly to the forget gate but instead of taking the cell state and the previous input, it takes the previous state and the proposed new input $\tilde{x}_t$. The input gate calculates the activation value of a Tanh layer that produces a vector of candidate values that are added to the cell state to update it. Again, we multiply the result by the previously calculated cell state $C_t$ to obtain the final update.

3. Finally, the **Output Gate** controls what information should be outputted from the cell. It takes the updated cell state $C_t$ and applies another sigmoid function to produce the output probability distribution $\hat{y}_t$. Note that the output gate doesn't affect the calculation of future updates or predictions since it only affects the present prediction made by the LSTM unit.



### 2.2.2 LSTM单元结构

Once we understand how LSTMs manage the flow of information in cells, we can move on to understanding the overall structure of an LSTM unit. An LSTM unit contains a number of layers stacked together, each responsible for a specific function. Here is a graphical representation of an LSTM unit architecture:


Here is a brief description of each component:

1. Input Layer - This layer receives the input at each time step, either from the previous layer or generated internally. In our case, the input layer receives the original pixel intensities of the image flattened into a single vector.

2. Hidden State Cell - This is the main component of the LSTM unit. At each time step, the input signal passes through several fully connected layers, producing a set of candidate values for the cell state. After passing through the layers, these candidates are added to the previous cell state to create the new cell state.

3. Gates Controller - This layer consists of three gates: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. Each gate determines whether to remove or add information to the cell state, and also controls the extent to which the new information contributes to the output of the LSTM unit. All three gates receive inputs from the previous cell state, the input signals, and the output of the previous layer.

4. Output Layer - Once the cell state has been updated, it is passed through a final fully connected layer to produce the predicted class label or other output signal.
