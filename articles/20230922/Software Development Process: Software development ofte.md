# 1.简介
  

Project Management is an essential skill for any software developer. It ensures that the software development process runs smoothly, efficiently and effectively. In this article we will talk about different roles of Project Managers and their responsibilities while managing a software project. We will also discuss various project management concepts such as Sprints, Product Backlog, User Stories, Agile methodologies etc., and how they are applied while developing a software product. 

# 2. Roles Of Project Manager
In general, there are four types of persons who play a role of a Project Manager during the software development process:

1. Business Analyst: The business analysts work closely with stakeholders and provide them with insights into requirements from users, system owners, and other departments within the organization. They communicate these requirements to the developers in a structured manner through use cases, functional specifications, and data models. 

2. Developers: The developers interact closely with all the stakeholders during the design phase and implement the functionality described by the business analysts. Their primary focus is to write clean code which adheres to coding standards and follows best practices of object-oriented programming. During implementation, the team uses unit testing and integration testing to ensure that the software works correctly without breaking it.

3. Tester: The testers ensure that the software developed by the developers functions properly according to its specifications and intended behavior. They perform manual and automated testing using tools like Selenium, JUnit, and SoapUI. Based on the results, the developers make necessary changes in the code before proceeding further.

4. Architect: The architects handle the overall technical direction of the software project, defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and communication protocols between various modules. They oversee the quality assurance and security aspects of the software throughout the entire lifecycle.

While each person plays a specific role, some overlap exists between them. For example, the business analyst may also be responsible for writing user stories and acceptance criteria. Similarly, both the developers and tester may have a hand in designing the architecture of the software. However, it is crucial for every project manager to understand the purpose of each individual role and balance their contributions accordingly to deliver the desired outcome.

# 3. Key Concepts And Terms
Now let’s dive deeper into the key concepts and terms used while managing a software project. 

1. Sprint : A sprint typically lasts one week or less depending on the size of the project. At the end of each sprint, the completed tasks are reviewed and refined based on feedback received. During the sprint, the developers work on bug fixes, improvements and new features. These should be prioritized against the backlog items and completed within the allotted time frame.

2. Product Backlog : This list contains all the feature requests, enhancements, and defects that need to be implemented in the software. Items in this list are ranked and prioritized based on customer needs and priorities. Each item has a detailed description, priority level, and estimated effort required. During the planning phase, the product owner reviews the items in the backlog and identifies what features are most important and critical to the success of the project.

3. User Story : A user story describes a particular feature, improvement, or requirement of the software being built. It includes the details of what the user wants the software to do, why he or she wants it, and what the expected outcomes might look like. It also helps in defining the acceptance criteria, ensuring that the final product meets the expectations set forth by the client. Examples of user stories include “As a user I want to be able to search for movies” or "As a developer, I want to add more test cases so that our application is better tested".

4. Agile Methodology : Agile refers to a collection of principles, values, and practices that emphasize adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and customer collaboration. One common agile methodology is Scrum, where teams break down large projects into smaller sprints, called iterations. Within each iteration, the team decides what to build, how to build it, and tests it before moving on to the next task.

5. Impediments To Flow: Impediments to flow occur when the flow of work is interrupted due to unexpected circumstances. Common causes of impediments to flow could be changes in scope, unforeseen issues, external factors or disruptions in service providers. Although sometimes difficult to detect, proper documentation, communications, and regular monitoring are vital in keeping everyone involved involved in the progress of the project successfully.

6. Retrospective : After each sprint, the development team reflects upon their performance and identifies areas for improvement. The retrospective is conducted to identify the root cause of the problems faced and come up with solutions that would improve the processes going forward.

These key concepts and terms constitute the building blocks of successful project management. By understanding these concepts and applying them effectively, you can help your team deliver higher-quality software products faster.
