Quantum information science is the study of quantum bits (qubits) and states, including their properties such as entanglement, superposition, decoherence, and correlations. In this article, we will briefly introduce the basic concepts, terms, algorithms, and techniques in quantum information science. We also provide some concrete examples to illustrate how these technologies work. This paper can serve as an introduction for those who are interested in developing quantum applications or understanding more advanced topics in quantum computing.

# 2.基本概念、术语和定义
2.1 Basic Concepts 
In general, quantum mechanics involves the theory of waves with quantum-mechanical interactions. A wave consists of a range of frequencies that propagate through space, which changes at each point due to the interaction between electrons and nuclei. The behavior of such a wave can be described by its amplitude, phase, frequency, etc., and it has many mathematical characteristics like periodicity, symmetry, and chaos. 

On the other hand, quantum physics describes the behavior of quantum systems, such as particles, atoms, or molecules, under external fields and influence from others' actions. It is based on complex numbers, square roots of negative real numbers, and higher dimensions, making it very different from classical physics. Moreover, it studies the interactions between subatomic particles, which include electrons and photons, via interactions called "spins".

2.2 Quantum Mechanics 
2.2.1 Wavefunction 
A quantum mechanical system's state is usually represented by its wave function $\Psi(x)$, where $x$ represents the position and momentum coordinates of the system. For instance, if the system is described by Newton's second law, then the wave function could represent the mass distribution over space, as shown below:
$$\Psi(x)=e^{\frac{-1}{2}m\left(\frac{p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}e^{iqx}$$
where $m$, $p$, and $\hbar$ are the mass, momentum, and reduced Planck constant respectively. The time dependence is neglected because the motion of the system is irregular due to the uncertainty principle. 

2.2.2 Quantum Bit 
The quantum bit refers to one of the smallest fundamental units of quantum information. It can be in either the $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$ state. Each qubit possesses two intrinsic properties - entangled and unentangled - which determine the possible outcomes of a measurement. A set of coherent and shared resources composed of multiple qubits that can interact spatially to form larger logical objects known as a quantum computer.

2.2.3 Quantum State 
A quantum state is defined as the complete collection of all possible configurations of quantum system parameters, i.e., wave function and associated probabilities of finding the system in any given configuration. The number of possible states grows exponentially with the number of free parameters, thus creating a challenge when attempting to simulate quantum systems numerically using computers. Quantum computation can be used to solve problems that cannot be solved classically efficiently using traditional methods, e.g., solving satisfiability problems in NP-hard complexity or diagnosing diseases by detecting patterns in genetic sequences. 

2.3 Quantum Gates and Operators 
2.3.1 Quantum Gates 
A quantum gate acts on a set of qubits and produces a new state according to certain rules determined by the physical laws of quantum mechanics. They can have various forms such as identity, Pauli gates (X, Y, Z), Hadamard gate, S gate, CNOT gate, etc., depending on the type of transformation being performed. Some commonly used quantum gates include rotation around axes (R), phase shifting (S), and controlled operations (CNOT). Below shows an example of the X gate acting on three qubits:

2.3.2 Quantum Operator 
A quantum operator is a mathematical object that operates on quantum states by changing them into another state. There are several types of operators, including creation and annihilation operators (a+b$\rightarrow$c+d), particle-number operators ($\sigma_z$, $\sigma_x$, and $\sigma_y$) among others. These operators combine quantum mechanical principles to create and manipulate quantum states. For example, the Hadamard gate can be interpreted as applying a particular unitary matrix U to the initial state |0> to obtain the final state (|+>).

3.1 Classical Algorithms for Superdense Coding 
3.1.1 Introduction to Superdense Coding 
Superdense coding is a key encryption technique that allows a sender and receiver to communicate through a pair of shared classical bits without transmitting quantum information. To send a message using superdense coding, the sender sends two classical messages and waits for a single response from the receiver. If both parties agree to receive the message, they can unlock each other's private keys and exchange encrypted messages securely.

3.1.2 Key Exchange Using Superdense Coding 
Suppose Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob. First, she selects two random classical bits (0 or 1) and encodes them into her own message. She then sends her encoded message along with a classical signal to Bob, indicating that he should wait for her message before responding. After Bob receives the message, he applies his own encoding scheme and compares the results to see if they match. If they do, he knows that Alice sent the correct classical signals, meaning that he must now send back her original message using a third random classical bit.

3.1.3 Encryption using the Bell Inequality and Eve’s Interference Correction Technique
Alice and Bob share a common entangled quantum state in the form of a bipartite entangled pair $(|\psi\rangle, |\phi\rangle)$. Both parties want to encrypt a plaintext message p, but Eve intercepts and modifies the transmission process, resulting in the following situation:

- Alice prepares her qubits in the zero state $(|0, 0\rangle)$ and sends them to Bob.
- Eve notices that both Alice and Bob measure the first qubit in the same basis, so she measures both Alice’s qubits simultaneously in the XZ plane, obtaining the value $(\pm1/\sqrt{2})|1\rangle$.
- Alice and Bob then apply a Bell inequality criterion to verify whether their measurements are consistent, leading to the result $|\psi\rangle=\frac{\pm|0, 0\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$. However, since neither party prepared the other qubit, there may exist a small error that leads to Eve measuring her qubit differently from what she intended. Specifically, Eve might measure $\frac{(-1/\sqrt{2})\cdot (-|1\rangle)\cdot |0\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}=-|1\rangle$ instead of $(-\pm|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$.

To correct Eve’s interference correction, Alice performs a post-selection operation that eliminates cases where Eve incorrectly measured her qubit. This guarantees that only those inputs that correspond to Alice’s intended input qubit will yield valid outputs, ensuring privacy and security in communications. Finally, Alice uses a subroutine involving teleportation to encode her plaintext message into the hidden half of the entangled pair. The output state is then projected onto the computational basis to reveal the plaintext message.

3.2 Entanglement Theory 
3.2.1 Definition of Entanglement 
Entanglement is a natural phenomenon in quantum mechanics that arises whenever two (or more) physical degrees of freedom become bound together into a single composite degree of freedom, such as two electrons occupying the same atomic orbital. Under certain conditions, such as temperature and distance, these two degrees of freedom become capable of transforming each other into pairs of identical fermions in a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). Here, entanglement means that the individual degrees of freedom remain separate even after the binding event occurs, yet appear as a single unit once they have been separated.

3.2.2 Two Level Systems 
Two level systems are a type of quantum system that consist of two energy levels separated by a gap. When a quantum mechanical transition takes place across this gap, the corresponding states collapse down to the lowest energy level and stay put in the intermediate energy level. Two-level systems are important in quantum computing, because they offer easy access to local quantum effects and demonstrate universal quantum computation capabilities. Examples of two-level systems include trapped ion computers and spin chains.

3.2.3 Entangled States and Nonlocality Properties of Qubits 
3.2.3.1 Types of Entanglement 
3.2.3.1.1 Physical Entanglement 
Physical entanglement occurs when two or more particles interact with each other during the course of an experiment or while traveling through space. The particles bind together physically and behave independently of each other until broken apart by observation or manipulation. Examples of physical entanglement include radioactive decay and DNA synthesis.

3.2.3.1.2 Mental Entanglement 
Mental entanglement arises when humans try to keep track of multiple ideas or thoughts, which require the use of mental representations. People tend to connect similar ideas together and interpret them in ways that support their collective thought processes. Mental entanglement also exists within organizations and cultures that involve highly skilled individuals working closely together.

3.2.3.1.3 Biological Entanglement 
Biological entanglement occurs when cells of the same species come into contact with each other or share genetic material. Such entanglement allows organisms to perform tasks that require communication, coordination, and synchronization. For example, immune cells often seek out viruses and integrate themselves into the host body by sharing antigen receptors.

3.2.3.2 Internal States of Qubits 
When two or more qubits are entangled, they exhibit non-classical behaviors that allow them to maintain their quantum nature. Two main internal states that qubits can adopt are singlet and tripartite excitations. 

Singlet Excitation: When a qubit is initially in a ground state, it can adopt a singlet excitation and split into two sub-states of opposite polarization, which are not directly connected to each other. As the qubit entangles with another part of a multi-qubit system, the singlet states enter a competition between themselves, causing them to interfere constructively or destructively. For example, in a transmon qubit, the cavity resonator can be driven by one sideband while the readout resonator drives another, resulting in a combined unitary transformation that splits the qubit state into two superpositions of equal strength. Singlet excitation plays an essential role in quantum memory, characterizing errors in computations and enabling quantum control mechanisms.

Tripartite Excitation: Tripartite excitation refers to the appearance of four sub-states upon interacting with another qubit. As a result, every qubit is in a superposition of three distinct eigenstates rather than just two. These states differ by their spin projections relative to the z axis of the Bloch sphere, which creates a hint of magnetism. While still entangled, the states move closer to each other as they progress through their respective evolution paths towards their most stable locations in quantum mechanical equilibrium. The tripartite excitation helps establish nonlinear interactions between qubits and provides a platform for quantum error correction and fault tolerance.

3.2.4 Direct Detection of Entanglement 
3.2.4.1 Bell’s Theorem 
Bell’s theorem offers a simple method to detect entanglement in a noisy quantum channel. It tells us that if Alice and Bob share a joint state of a pair of entangled qubits, they can reliably distinguish between two pure states separated by a correlation function. Let $\mathcal{E}$ denote the quantum channel and let $E_{\alpha\beta}(\rho)$ denote the joint probability density matrix describing the joint state $|\alpha,\beta\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_\mu\ketbra{\alpha}_{\mu}\rho\ketbra{\beta}_{\mu}$, where $\mu$ runs over the possible outcomes of $\mathcal{E}$. Then, Bell’s theorem says that $P(|\alpha\rangle,|\beta\rangle) = P(|\alpha\rangle)|\langle\alpha|\beta\rangle|^2 + P(|\beta\rangle)|\langle\beta|\alpha\rangle|^2$, where $|\langle\alpha|\beta\rangle|$ is the mutual information between the two qubits. By considering the largest eigenvector of the mutual information, we can infer the directionality of the correlation. Additionally, Bell’s theorem reveals a relationship between entanglement and mutual information, proving the significance of indirect detection strategies for maximizing the information content of a quantum system.

3.2.4.2 Post-Selection Measurements 
Post-selection is a powerful tool for identifying entanglement between qubits. Post-selection effectively removes erroneous entries from a dataset before performing analysis or inference. One way to implement post-selection measurements is to monitor the outcomes of previous measurements and eliminate those that indicate unphysical correlations between the qubits. Another approach is to identify clusters of mutually unbiased measurements and compare their probabilities against a reference model of entanglement. Doing so allows researchers to extract meaningful insights about the structure and dynamics of entangled quantum systems.

3.3 Decoherence and Controlled Operations 
3.3.1 Preparation and Measurement of Qubits 
Before discussing decoherence and controlled operations, we need to understand how qubits are prepared and manipulated in practice. The standard procedures typically involved in preparation and measurement of qubits include applying appropriate pulses to a quantum well, applying electric field gradients to a condensate, and placing a probe of a specific polarization above or below the surface of the qubit. Once prepared, qubits can be programmed to operate in various ways by varying their control parameters or operating under different environmental conditions.

3.3.2 Restricted Basis Decoherence 
Restricted basis decoherence (RBD) is a type of decoherence wherein the available subspace for information storage becomes limited due to linear dependencies between the basis vectors. RBD is encountered in practical devices that operate in low-dimensional spaces, such as molecular light emitting diodes (LEDs) and superconducting circuits. Instead of storing the full wavefunction, restricted bases reduce the dimensionality of the Hilbert space by selecting a smaller number of orthonormal vectors that span a much smaller subspace. During decoherence, subspaces collide, merging into larger ones until all relevant information has been lost. The effect of RBD can be severe enough to cause large scale failures, requiring specialized controls to recover from disturbed states.

3.3.3 Noise Model and Characterization of Qubits 
Noise models are useful tools for analyzing and controlling the effects of decoherence on quantum systems. Since decoherence imposes significant constraints on the control parameters that govern a qubit's behavior, noise models enable designers to optimize the efficiency of a device by identifying and minimizing disruptive events. Additionally, noise models allow scientists to estimate the magnitude and shape of decoherence in a system, which enables better predictions and control of experiments. Several techniques for characterizing and modeling decoherence can be used, such as calibrating the average photon number per shot, recording population transfer functions, and observing accumulation of artifacts due to tunable components.

3.3.4 Controlled Operations 
Controlled operations are special instructions that modify the behavior of a qubit beyond the scope of simply setting up and measuring it. Commonly used controlled operations include rotations around axes (such as Rphi, Rx, and Rz), phases (S), and entangling operations such as CNOT and CZ gates. For example, the application of a rotation gate introduces a phase shift that depends on the angle chosen. Uncontrolled operations can lead to decoherence and loss of information, whereas controlled operations allow researchers to manipulate qubits to achieve specific goals.
