# 1.背景介绍


在当前信息技术飞速发展的时代，数据量的激增、计算能力的提升、算法的复杂化、需求的日益变化等因素都导致了人工智能、云计算、大数据等新兴技术的广泛应用。这些技术不断地产生海量的数据，人们需要通过处理大数据进行有效的分析和决策。然而，如何高效地处理大数据、减少计算成本，使得数据得到更好的利用，是每个科研工作者和工程师都会面临的课题。
人类历史上已经有了很多专门研究优化方法的领域，如控制论、信号处理、遗传学等。其中，遗传学最早用于解决种群数量稀缺的问题，其理论基础是建立在进化论和数理统计学的基础上的，已被广泛应用于各种领域。例如，在生物信息学中，遗传算法用于解决基因序列的设计，找到具有高度适应性且具有代表性的个体；在贸易中，遗传算法用于寻找符合双方利益的商品组合；在工程领域，遗传算法可用于求解函数极值问题，设计结构更加有效、精准的产品或装配方案。
在现代工程技术发展的背景下，人们又将目光投向了机器学习和统计学习方法，并从各种角度重新发现了优化问题的内涵。在优化问题中，目标函数通常是一个连续可微函数，目标是在给定约束条件下，找到全局最优解。因此，优化问题主要属于数学科学的一部分，具有十分重要的理论价值。

## 2.1 优化问题
### 2.1.1 定义
Optimization Problem is a problem where we want to find the best solution for some given set of variables. The best solution can be determined based on different criteria such as minimum or maximum value, shortest time or least amount of resources required, etc. An optimization problem may have several objective functions and constraints that limit the search space and guide the decision making process. Optimization problems are typically classified into linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP), integer programming (IP) and non-linear programming (NLP). We will focus on LP and QP in this article. 

### 2.1.2 例子
Let's consider an example: Imagine you need to sell a car. You own two cars - a red one with price $p_r$ and a blue one with price $p_b$. Your budget is limited so you need to choose which car to buy and how much money to spend. What would be your optimal strategy? One possible answer could be to purchase both cars and then compare them to determine the cheaper option, even if it means spending more than your budget. Alternatively, you might prefer to make a conservative choice and buy only the most expensive car while keeping the other one at home. This approach would save you from any losses but might not result in the highest profit. In general, there are many factors that affect the decision making process and thus the optimal strategy varies widely depending on specific situations.

In mathematical terms, we can formulate this optimization problem as follows: Given prices $p_r$, $p_b$, budget $\pi$ and a certain criterion function $c(x)$, design an algorithm that finds the combination of car color and spending that maximizes the expected return of sales ($\pi + \mathbb{E}\left[p_r x\right] - \mathbb{E}\left[p_b (1-x)\right]$), subject to the constraint that you cannot exceed your budget. Here, $x$ represents the fraction of money spent on the red car (between 0 and 1). Thus, our goal is to maximize the following expression:

$$max_{\mathbf{x}}(\pi + p_rx - p_bx(1-x))$$

subject to the constraint that $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1$ and $\forall i:\quad x_i \leq b_i,\quad 0\leq x_i \leq 1$, where $\mathbf{x}$ contains the fractional amounts spent on each car and $b_i$ is the corresponding budget limit for car $i$. By solving this optimization problem, we obtain the optimal combination of colors and fractions spent on each one, along with its corresponding expected return.
