　　Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks are two of the most commonly used types of recurrent neural network architectures in deep learning applications. In this article, we will introduce these important models and how they can be utilized for time-series prediction tasks such as stock price or weather forecasting.

         ## 2.1 LSTM 网络结构
         Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is widely used for sequence processing tasks like natural language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation. The key idea behind LSTM is the cell state that captures long-term dependencies between input sequences. This makes it easier for an RNN to learn long-term patterns in sequential data. The architecture consists of several layers:
         
            Input Layer - Consists of one input gate, which determines whether each neuron in the LSTM should be activated based on its inputs and previous hidden states. It takes in the input vector and applies weights to get updated values through time.
            
            Forget Gate - Takes in both the current input vector and the previous hidden state, along with other contextual information from the past if applicable. It decides which parts of the memory cell should be forgotten by setting them to zero while retaining some of the old values.
            
              Cell State - Is responsible for storing the long term memory state information that is passed around between time steps. It is computed using a combination of the new input, forget, and output gates applied to the previous cell state and the input vector at each time step.
              
                Output Gate - Decides what part of the cell state should be fed back into the next time step as the final output of the LSTM unit. It controls how much of the cell state gets carried over into the next time step by multiplying it with appropriate weights before adding it to the input vector weighted by another set of weights.
                
                  Hidden Layer - Generates the actual outputs of the model, representing the predicted value(s). It takes in the cell state after applying activation functions to help control the rate of change and limit vanishing gradients.

                                 As you can see from the above diagram, the basic structure of the LSTM model includes an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Each component has a different function within the overall model.
                                 
                                     Inputs : X
                                     
                                     Hidden Layers : h_t
                                     Output Layer : y^T
                                     
                                         where
                                         
                                             x^(t) = [x^(t-1), x^(t)]      
                                             W^{f}   - Weight Matrix for Forgetting Gates (Forget)
                                             
                                             U^{i}   - Weight Matrix for Input Gates (Input)
                                             
                                             W^{c}   - Weight Matrix for Carry State (Cell State)
                                             
                                             W^{o}   - Weight Matrix for Output Gates (Output)
                                             
                                             b^{f}   - Bias Vector for Forget Gates (Forget)
                                             
                                             b^{i}   - Bias Vector for Input Gates (Input)
                                             
                                             b^{c}   - Bias Vector for Carry State (Cell State)
                                             
                                             b^{o}   - Bias Vector for Output Gates (Output)
                                             
                                             f_{t}   - Value from Forget Gates
                                             
                                             i_{t}   - Value from Input Gates
                                             
                                             c_{t}   - Value from Carry State
                                             
                                             o_{t}   - Value from Output Gates
                                             
                                             t       - Time Step
                                          
                                       The computations involved in the forward propagation of the LSTM include:
                                       
                                            f_t      = sigmoid(W^{f} * x + U^{i} * h_(t-1) + b^{f})   
                                            i_t      = sigmoid(W^{i} * x + U^{i} * h_(t-1) + b^{i})   
                                            o_t      = sigmoid(W^{o} * x + U^{i} * h_(t-1) + b^{o})   
                                            c_t      = tanh(W^{c} * x + U^{i} * h_(t-1) + b^{c})   
                                            c~_t     = c_t.* i_t + f_t.* c_(t-1)   
                                            h_t      = o_t.* tanh(c~_t) 
                                       
                                       Where h_t represents the predicted value(s) generated by the LSTM at time t.
                                   
                                   Weights Initialization
                                       
                                        There are several ways to initialize the weight matrices in the LSTM model. One common method is to randomly assign values from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance equal to 1 / number of input features. Another approach involves initializing all biases to zero and all weights uniformly between –sqrt(number of inputs) and sqrt(number of inputs), although this may not work well when there are many layers and units in the network.
                                    
                                   Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
                                       
                                        To train the LSTM model, we use backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. During training, we propagate errors backwards from the last time step to update the parameters of the model. The error gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters can then be calculated efficiently using automatic differentiation techniques.
                                       
                                           Let’s assume our cost function is Mean Squared Error (MSE), and let Y denote the target variable and O denote the predicted output of the LSTM model at each time step. Then, our loss function during training becomes:
                                           
                                               J = 1/N * sum((Y - O)^2)
                                          
                                           where N is the total number of samples in the dataset. To compute the derivative of the MSE wrt. the parameters of the model, we use the chain rule:
                                           
                                               ∂J/∂W^{f} = 1/N * ∑((Y - O)*tanh(c~)) * d(tanh(c~))/dW^{f}          
                                                 ∂J/∂U^{i} = 1/N * ∑((Y - O)*tanh(c~)) * d(tanh(c~))/dU^{i}            
                                                 ∂J/∂W^{c} = 1/N * ∑((Y - O)*tanh(c~)) * d(tanh(c~))/dW^{c}           
                                                 ∂J/∂b^{f} = 1/N * ∑((Y - O)*tanh(c~)) * d(sigmoid(f_t))/db^{f}       
                                                 ∂J/∂b^{i} = 1/N * ∑((Y - O)*tanh(c~)) * d(sigmoid(i_t))/db^{i}       
                                                 ∂J/∂b^{c} = 1/N * ∑((Y - O)*tanh(c~)) * d(tanh(c~))/db^{c}         
                                                 ∂J/∂W^{o} = 1/N * ∑((Y - O)*tanh(c~)) * d(sigmoid(o_t))/dW^{o}       
                                                 ∂J/∂b^{o} = 1/N * ∑((Y - O)*tanh(c~)) * d(sigmoid(o_t))/db^{o}
                                          
                                           Note that the second order derivatives involving the tanh function cannot be evaluated directly without approximation methods, so we need to approximate their values instead. However, approximating these values doesn’t affect the performance of the LSTM model significantly since they only play a minor role in computing the updates to the weights during training.
