The article aims to provide an in-depth technical explanation of text mining techniques for sentiment analysis in financial statements and highlight the significance of pre-processing data. The reader will understand how to apply machine learning algorithms to extract features from financial statement texts, tokenize them, and classify their sentiments as positive or negative based on predefined lexicons and patterns. They will also learn how to evaluate the performance of these classifiers using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC-ROC. Finally, they will be able to identify weaknesses and improve the classifier's performance by leveraging external resources such as expert-annotated data sets or state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models. 

This article assumes that readers have some knowledge about finance and its application in business decisions. It is recommended that the reader has a good understanding of Natural Language Processing concepts such as Bag-of-Words Model, Tokenization, Stemming/Lemmatization, Part-of-Speech Tagging, etc., and should have basic familiarity with python programming language. Additionally, the reader should be familiar with machine learning terminologies like classification problem, feature extraction, training set, test set, hyperparameters tuning, cross validation, and evaluation metrics.

Finally, this article covers three main parts:

 - Data Preparation and Feature Extraction: In this part, we explain how to preprocess financial statements data and derive features from it using bag-of-words model. We use NLTK library to perform tokenization, stemming and lemmatization operations, POS tagging, and named entity recognition tasks. 

 - Classifier Training and Evaluation: In this part, we train and evaluate various supervised machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks on extracted features. We compare their performance using different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, ROC Curve, AUC-ROC.

 - Improving Performance with External Resources: In this part, we showcase how to leverage external resources like expert-annotated data sets or pre-trained NLP models to enhance our sentiment analysis classifier's performance. We implement Named Entity Recognition (NER), Dependency Parsing, Word Embeddings, Sentence Similarity Metrics, and Knowledge Graph Reasoning Techniques to further enrich the input features.
 
To conclude, through this article, we hope that readers can gain a deep understanding of the fundamental principles behind text mining techniques used in sentiment analysis in financial statements, and acquire practical skills required to build robust and accurate sentiment analysis systems. With these tools, businesses can analyze customer feedback, market trends, and company earning reports to make better business decisions and increase profitability.

# 2.数据预处理及特征提取
Financial statements are usually published as unstructured documents containing a mixture of text, tables, and graphics. To process them for sentiment analysis purposes, we need to follow certain steps including cleaning up the data, identifying entities, normalizing words, filtering out stop words, converting all words into lowercase letters, removing special characters, stemming/lemmatization, and applying POS tagging. These steps help us obtain valuable insights from the raw text data that cannot be obtained directly from structured sources like databases.

## Cleaning Up the Data
Firstly, we remove any irrelevant information such as page numbers, footnotes, headings, headers, watermarks, and unnecessary whitespaces using regular expressions. Then, we replace any abbreviations with full form using a dictionary. Next, we convert all words into lowercase and filter out stop words that do not contribute to sentiment classification. We also perform stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their root form so that similar words receive the same representation while maintaining contextual meaning. Lastly, we tag each word with its corresponding part-of-speech (POS) label using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. 

After performing these preprocessing steps, we get a cleaned and standardized financial statement dataset which contains only relevant information related to the stock being discussed. Let’s call this dataset X_train. Now, we move towards extracting features from the cleaned data.

## Extracting Features Using Bag-Of-Words Model
A Bag-Of-Words Model represents a document as the bag of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping multiplicity. Each document becomes a sparse vector of word counts where the dimensions correspond to unique words in the corpus. This approach ignores the sequence of words within a sentence or document, thus treating each document as a bag of individual words.

We represent each financial statement as a bag-of-words model where each sentence is represented as a row and each column corresponds to a unique word occurring in the entire corpus. Here is one possible implementation in python:

```python
import nltk
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

def create_bag_of_words(corpus):
    # Initialize count vectorizer
    cv = CountVectorizer()

    # Fit and transform the count matrix
    X = cv.fit_transform(corpus).toarray()
    
    return cv, X
    
```

In this function, we first initialize a `CountVectorizer` object which creates a vocabulary of all unique tokens found in the corpus. We then fit the transformer over the given corpus and transform it into a sparse matrix of word counts, where each row corresponds to a sentence in the original corpus and each column corresponds to a word in the vocabulary.

The resulting sparse matrix `X` can be passed to machine learning algorithms for classification purposes. However, before moving forward, let’s discuss two important details regarding feature selection and dimensionality reduction. 

### Reducing Dimensionality of Input Vectors
One common technique to reduce the number of dimensions in high dimensional spaces is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA finds a low-dimensional subspace that maximizes the variance between the data points along those directions. Once we have reduced the dimensions, we can either ignore the smaller ones or use them as additional features to improve the performance of the classifier. Since PCA involves projection onto a new space, we can still keep track of the original features for later usage if needed.

### Selecting Relevant Features
Another way to reduce the number of features is to select only those that carry more weight in determining the sentiment of a sentence or document. One popular method is to compute TF-IDF scores for each term in the vocabulary, representing the importance of a particular word in a sentence. We can then rank the terms according to their relevance and eliminate those whose contribution falls below a specified threshold. Alternatively, we can use other methods like correlation coefficient or mutual information between features and the target variable to determine their importance.

However, since the aim of this article is to focus solely on building a sentiment analyzer, we won’t dive too much deeper into the topic of feature selection here. Instead, we simply use the default parameters provided by scikit-learn’s `CountVectorizer`, which already eliminates stop words, converts all words to lowercase, performs stemming and removes punctuation marks. By default, it uses binary occurrence frequency encoding, i.e., every non-zero element in the output vectors represents the presence of a specific keyword in the sentence, regardless of its frequency within the document.
