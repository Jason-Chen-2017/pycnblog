Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a crucial problem in many real-world deep learning applications, especially when dealing with complex hyperparameters that require fine tuning to obtain satisfactory performance. In this work, we propose an efficient HPO framework called reinforced evolutionary transfer learning (Retu), which employs reinforcement learning algorithms to adaptively optimize the hyperparameters and select diverse neural network architectures. Specifically, Retu leverages metalearning techniques to automatically learn an abstract representation of the underlying task distribution, and uses actor-critic networks for training the agent during exploration/exploitation process. Furthermore, we present several enhanced strategies such as policy distillation, ensemble selection, and early stopping to further improve the generalization ability of the learned models. We also provide an ablation study on different components of the proposed method to validate its effectiveness and practicality. Finally, our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Retu outperforms state-of-the-art HPO methods by a significant margin.

In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic concepts and formulas involved in HPO, followed by the detailed explanation of the core algorithm Retu. Next, we present a step-by-step tutorial to show how to implement Retu using Python. We then discuss some important aspects of designing an efficient HPO system, including model architecture selection strategy, hyperparameter initialization strategy, and evaluation metric selection strategy. Last but not least, we summarize some key findings from our experiments and provide suggestions for future research directions. 

本文将从 HPO 的基本概念、公式、流程及 Retu 的工作原理入手，并详细阐述其核心算法。然后，我们将用 Python 在样例数据集上实现 Retu，并讨论 HPO 系统的设计要点。最后，我们将总结实验结果，并提出未来的研究方向。

Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been widely studied in recent years due to the importance of finding good parameter configurations that can significantly impact the final performance of machine learning models. There are numerous works on optimizing hyperparameters for individual models or pipelines, where only one specific configuration is evaluated at each iteration. However, most existing HPO approaches focus more on selecting optimal configurations over multiple runs, while ignoring the potential contribution of transferring knowledge between tasks or domains, leading to suboptimal solutions and degraded generalization capabilities. To address these limitations, there have been various efforts devoted to leveraging transfer learning techniques in HPO. These include multi-task learning, adversarial transfer learning, etc. Another direction towards solving HPO problems is through Bayesian optimization, which explores both local and global search spaces based on probabilistic estimates obtained from past evaluations. Nevertheless, these methods often suffer from high computational complexity, limited expressive power, or low convergence speed, making them impractical for large-scale and complex systems.

Reinforced Evolutionary Transfer Learning (Retu) is a novel HPO framework designed specifically for complex, multimodal tasks involving heterogeneous data types and domain shifts. It combines the advantages of HPO and transfer learning methods by introducing the concept of metalearning, i.e., learning an abstract representation of the task distribution, and utilizing actor-critic policies for continuous control of the exploration/exploitation process. By combining these two techniques into a unified framework, Retu can find better solutions than conventional HPO methods under certain constraints. This motivates us to explore whether it is possible to achieve similar or even better results by incorporating extra information about the underlying distribution in the objective function and updating the agent's behavior accordingly. Moreover, the enhanced strategies like policy distillation, ensemble selection, and early stopping can further enhance the generalization capability of the learned models. Despite their conceptual contributions, the majority of prior work focused on evaluating single-model or pipeline HPO approaches rather than integrating them together.

综上所述，在现有的多任务学习、对抗迁移学习等方法之外，近年来出现了 Reinforced Evolutionary Transfer Learning (Retu)，它在 HPO 方法中引入了一个元学习的过程，目的是为了能够自动地学习到任务分布的一个抽象表示，并且通过演化策略与强化学习的机制进行探索、利用的过程。通过与传统的 HPO 方法相结合的方式，Retu 可以在一定条件下获得更优秀的解决方案，这引起了我们对于是否能够借助额外的信息进一步增强学习效果的思考。除此之外，Retu 提供了一些额外的策略来提升模型的泛化能力，例如策略蒸馏、集成学习等。然而，由于它仅限于特定领域的应用场景，因此并没有找到大规模的测试验证。因此，本文将通过对比 Retu 和其他已有的方法，展示它们之间的异同，并试图提出一些新的方向。
