# 1.简介
         

         The Delphi programming language is a high-level programming language developed by Borland in the early 90s and was initially released as an internal tool only to selected clients. However, it quickly became popular worldwide due to its easy integration with Windows and Linux operating systems and support for multiple platforms and databases such as SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL etc. The development of Delphi has also been followed by other high-level programming languages like Python, Ruby on Rails, Java, C# among others. It is considered one of the most popular programming languages today. 
         
         This article will be about how to get started with Delphi programming language and give you a comprehensive guide along with best practices to help you write quality code efficiently and effectively. We will cover all important concepts and techniques in detail while taking examples from real-world applications using Delphi. 
         
         Let’s start our journey with Delphi!
         # 2.Concepts and Terminology
         
         Before we proceed further, let’s understand some basic terminologies used commonly in delphi.
         
         ### Packages/Namespaces
         
         In Delphi, packages are used to group related units of code into logically organized modules that can easily be reused across different programs or projects. Each package defines a separate namespace that contains its own set of declarations (types, variables, functions) without affecting any declarations outside the package. Package names should always begin with uppercase letters to conform to Pascal naming conventions.
         
         Syntax: 
         ```delphi
           UnitName;                        // unit name 
           Package Name;                    // package name  
             Type... End;                  // type definition 
             Const... End;                 // constant declaration 
             Var... ;                      // variable declaration 
             Procedure... End;             // procedure declaration 
             Function... End;              // function declaration 
           End Package;                     // end of package 

         ```

         Example: 
         ```delphi
            Program HelloWorld; 
            Uses MyUnit1,MyUnit2;           // uses statement - includes two packages  
            Begin 
              WriteLn('Hello World');      // print message to console 
              Readln;                      // wait for user input   
            End.                             // program termination   

         ```

         
         ### Modules/Forms/Controls
         
         Modules, forms and controls are fundamental building blocks of Delphi application architecture. A module typically contains global variables, constants and procedures which define behavior common to various parts of the program. Forms represent visible windows where users interact with your software. Controls, on the other hand, are components displayed within forms and provide interactive functionality for the user. There are several types of controls available in Delphi including edit boxes, combo boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, labels, images etc.
         
         Syntax: 

         ```delphi
           Module ModuleName;            // module definition 
           Private 
             var1 : datatype;          // private variables 
             proc1,proc2 : procedure; // private procedures 
           Public 
             const1 : integer = value; // public constants 
             var2 : datatype;          // public variables 
             func1 : function;         // public functions  
           End Module;                   // end of module 


         ```

         
         Example:

         ```delphi

           { MainForm.dfm }

             uses Vcl.Forms, Vcl.Controls, Vcl.StdCtrls;  

             type 
               TMainForm = class(TForm) 
                 Edit1: TEdit;
                 Label1: TLabel;
               private  
                 { Private declarations } 
               public  
                 { Public declarations } 
               published  
                 property Caption;
                   procedure ButtonClick(Sender: TObject); 
                   constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); reintroduce; overload;
                 end; 
               var 
                 Form1: TMainForm; 

              implementation 

                procedure TMainForm.ButtonClick(Sender: TObject); 
                begin 
                  ShowMessage('Welcome!'); 
                end; 

                constructor TMainForm.Create(AOwner: TComponent);  
                begin
                  inherited Create(AOwner); 
                end;

              initialization 
                SetMultiByteConversion:= True;
              end.

         


         ```



         ### Interfaces
         
         An interface is a collection of method signatures declared by a class but not implemented by the class itself. An object implementing an interface must have implementations for all methods defined in the interface contract. Interface definitions are similar to class definitions in syntax except they do not include implementation details. Classes can implement multiple interfaces and inherit from single base class.
         
         Syntax: 

         ```delphi
           Interface IInterfaceName;     // interface definition 
           [ ] Property propname : datatype readwrite;  
                                                 // properties 
           [ ] Function funname([ ] parameters) : returntype;  
                                                  // functions 
           [ ] Procedure procnam([ ] parameters);  
                                                 // procedural signature  
           End Interface;                // end of interface

         ```

         
         Example:

         ```delphi
           Interface IAnimal;        // interface definition 
           [ ] procedure Speak();   // interface function prototype 
           [ ] function GetType(): String;   
                                    // interface function prototype 
           End Interface; 

        // Implementation 

        // Class Animal implements interface IAnimal 
        Type  
          TAtelopus = class(TInterfacedObject, IAnimal)      
          protected 
            FType: string; 
          public 
            procedure Speak; virtual; abstract;              
            function GetType: String;                           
              begin 
                Result := 'Mammal';                         
              end;                                             
          end;                                                            

        // Child class Horse inherits from TAtelopus   
        Type  
          THorse = class(TAtelopus, IAnimal)                          
          public                                                                     
            procedure Speak; override;                                 
            begin                                                       
              Writeln('Woof Woof');                                   
            end;                                                        
          end;                                                             
        End.                                                        
       
                                                                      
        // Usage example                                                  
                                                                      
        Type                                                              
          TBulldog = class                                                     
          public                                                                
            procedure Speak;                                                   
            begin                                                           
              Writeln('Bark Bark');                                           
            end;                                                              
          end;                                                                  
        End.
