# 1.简介
         

        Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a popular area of research in Artificial Intelligence that aims to enable computers understand and manipulate human languages naturally. It involves the use of computational algorithms for extracting insights from text such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, topic modeling, named entity recognition etc.
        
        The prevalence of neural networks has greatly increased over the last few years due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships from large amounts of data. However, training these models requires a significant amount of time and resources. Therefore, there has been an increasing demand for using pre-trained models to help improve the performance of NLP tasks. Among them, the transformer model is one of the most popular ones used for pre-training. In this article, we will be discussing the working principles behind the transformer architecture and how it can be applied to different NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, question answering, or text classification. Finally, we will also discuss about its advantages and limitations in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalization capabilities.
        

         # 2.预训练模型Transformer
        Transformer is a type of neural network architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. in July 2017. It is a deep neural network architecture based on self attention mechanism which allows it to process input sequences in parallel with multi-head attention mechanisms. Its ability to parallelize computation makes it very efficient compared to RNNs and CNNs. Transformers are widely adopted for many natural language processing applications including language modeling, machine translation, speech recognition, image captioning, and zero-shot learning.
        
        Pre-trained transformers have been shown to significantly improve the performance of downstream tasks when fine-tuned on specific datasets. Transfer learning enables us to leverage the knowledge gained through pre-training on a large corpus and adapt it to our specific needs without having to start from scratch. This way, we don’t need to spend hours or days annotating new data sets and reducing the overall quality of results. We can simply reuse existing annotated data and train our model only on the additional data we have collected. Here's what happens at the core of the pre-trained transformer:
        
        1. **Input Embedding:** Input words are first embedded into vectors representing their meaning using word embeddings. Word embeddings capture the semantic and syntactic properties of individual words and represent them in a dense vector space where similar words tend to be located closer together. These embeddings are learned during the training phase while performing a supervised task.
        2. **Positional Encoding:** Positional encoding serves two purposes in the transformer architecture. Firstly, it helps the model capture long range dependencies between tokens within a sentence. Secondly, positional information helps the model focus more on relevant content instead of just the order in which words appear in the sentence.
        3. **Encoder Layers**: Encoder layers consist of six fully connected layers each followed by a residual connection and layer normalization. Each encoder layer consists of a Multi-Head Attention layer and a Feedforward Network layer. 
        4. **Multi-Head Attention Layer:** The key idea behind the Multi-Head Attention layer is to break down the representation space of each token into multiple subspaces, known as heads. This allows the model to selectively pay attention to different parts of the input sequence rather than relying solely on global representations. The resulting feature maps obtained after applying the attention mechanism are then concatenated before being passed through another feedforward network.
        5. **Feed Forward Networks**: These layers are responsible for learning the non-linear mapping from the output of the previous layer to the final output of the network. They contain two fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions, respectively.
        6. **Output Head(s):** Depending upon the application, we may choose to have single or multiple output heads. For example, in case of sentiment analysis, we would want one output head per class label, whereas for text classification, we would require a separate output head for every category.

        All these components form the base of the pre-trained transformer architecture which can be adapted further to perform various NLP tasks.

        Let’s now move on to the actual implementation details of the transformer model in code alongside some useful features such as masking, causal padding, and gradient checkpointing.

         # 3.Implementing Pre-trained Transformer in Code
        Before getting into the actual implementation, let’s first go through some important terminology related to transformer models. The following table summarizes the main concepts involved in building a transformer model:
        
              | Terminology       | Description                                                                                                                       |  
            |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
            | Token             | An individual unit of text such as a word, punctuation mark, or any other meaningful element                                          |
            | Embeddings        | Representations of tokens in a continuous vector space                                                                               |
            | Attention Mechanism| Mechanisms that assign weights to input elements based on their relationship with each other                                        |
            | Scaled Dot-Product Attention   | Computes attention scores using scaled dot product between query and key vectors                                                  |   
            | MHA               | Multi-headed attention layer consisting of several attention heads                                                                |            
            | FFN                | Neural network layer composed of two linear transformations combined with activation function                                       |          
            | Self-Attention     | One way to compute attention between tokens is to use the outputs of earlier layers as queries and current inputs as keys and values.| 
            | Cross-Attention    | Another option is to attend to both the input sequence and the output sequence generated by an encoder-decoder model                    |                        
            
            
            Now that you are familiar with the basic terminology, let’s proceed towards implementing the transformer model in Python.<|im_sep|>
