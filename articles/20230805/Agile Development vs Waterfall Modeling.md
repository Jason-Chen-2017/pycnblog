# 1.简介
         
1970年代，IBM公司的一名叫Peter的工程师提出了一个有关开发方法论的问题。IBM希望借助新的开发方法论改善软件开发流程，而不是重复造轮子。其后，Peter和他的团队决定建立一个全新的开发方法论——Agile Development(敏捷开发)。他们建议使用迭代和循序渐进的方法不断增强产品质量和交付速度，而不要依赖于计划、文档、设计和构建，让产品始终保持最新、灵活和可扩展性。
         
         从那时起，Agile开发已经成为一种常用词汇。但直到最近，才逐渐被认识到，Agile开发也有着它独特的优点，在某些方面，它与传统的Waterfall开发模型之间存在着根本性差异。

         本文将对Agile Development与Waterfall Modeling进行比较，并阐述两者之间的一些区别及优劣势。另外，还会尝试分析为什么Agile开发在现实世界中的应用更为广泛。
         
         # 2.基本概念及术语
         
         ## 2.1 Basic concepts and terms of agile development
        
         ### 2.1.1 Agile Manifesto
         
         The Agile manifesto is a document written by <NAME>, one of the original creators of Agile software development methodology. It outlines four values that guide the philosophy behind the creation of this methodology:

         1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
         2. Working software over comprehensive documentation 
         3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
         4. Responding to change over following a plan

         These principles underpin much of the philosophy in the Agile community as they aim to provide practical solutions for complex problems faced by organizations in fast-paced environments where change is constant. 


         ### 2.1.2 User Story
         
         A user story defines what needs to be done or added to a product backlog, which can then be used as a basis for developing features within an iteration cycle. Each user story typically includes: 

          1. A short description of who wants it 
          2. What it should do (in plain language) 
          3. Why it's needed 
          4. Acceptance criteria that define when the feature is complete 

         User stories are key components of any Agile project management tool. They enable team members to collaborate on prioritizing work, managing scope, estimating effort, and communicating progress more clearly.


         ### 2.1.3 Product Backlog
         
         The product backlog is a list of all features and functionality required for the next release or sprint. Each item represents a user story and details what needs to be developed, how difficult it will be to implement, and the dependencies between different tasks. This list should be ordered based on the priority of each task and allow for continuous improvement through feedback from users and customer input.


         ### 2.1.4 Sprints

          In Agile projects, sprints are defined as short timeframes during which the team works together to complete some number of user stories. During a sprint, the team produces working code, tests the system with stakeholders, and demonstrates its value to customers. There are several techniques used to run sprints, including Scrum and Kanban, but both share similarities in the way teams organize themselves and their workflow.

          At the end of each sprint, the completed user stories are gathered into the sprint review meeting, where stakeholders discuss what was accomplished, identify areas for further refinement, and set goals for the upcoming sprint. The goal of the sprint review meetings is to help ensure that the work delivered in each sprint meets the highest standards possible while also identifying areas for future improvements.


         ### 2.1.5 Continuous Integration & Delivery

          Continuous integration refers to the practice of frequently integrating changes to a codebase, running automated builds, and testing those builds regularly to detect errors early in the development process. By integrating early and often, developers catch bugs before they become larger issues, enabling them to focus on fixing them effectively. Continuous delivery enables developers to create releases without having to wait for every build to pass testing, ensuring that changes are always available to customers quickly. Both practices promote better quality, reduced lead times, and happier teams.

          
         ### 2.1.6 Standup Meetings
          
          Standup meetings are held daily at the same time across the organization, usually starting at 9am and lasting up to half an hour. Participants typically cover recent progress toward completing user stories assigned to them, so that other team members have context around current status. Any blockers or challenges are discussed immediately to prevent delays and help everyone stay aligned on priorities.


         ## 2.2 Basic concepts and terms of waterfall model

         
         ### 2.2.1 Planning stage

         In the planning stage, the client and business analysts determine the requirements of the product, including functional specifications, nonfunctional requirements, and technical specifications. As part of this phase, the design team creates wireframes or mockups of the UI layout, using prototyping tools like Adobe XD or Sketch. The specification documents are reviewed and approved by the client.

         ### 2.2.2 Design stage

         Once the product is specified, the design team begins creating the visual design elements such as color scheme, typography, and icons. These design artifacts form the foundation of the final product. The design team ensures that the final product is intuitive, visually appealing, and easy to use.

         ### 2.2.3 Development stage

         In the development stage, developers start writing code according to the specifications provided by the business and the client. Developers may utilize programming languages such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, Ruby, etc., depending on the type of product being developed. Testing is conducted throughout the development process to ensure the product is robust and follows best practices.

         ### 2.2.4 Test stage

         After the product is fully developed, it goes through thorough testing by multiple parties, including clients, users, and testers. If there are no critical issues found during testing, the product is launched for public use. Otherwise, the necessary fixes are made and retested until the product passes acceptance criteria.

         ### 2.2.5 Maintenance stage

         Overtime and after launch, maintenance is necessary to ensure continued usability, security, and performance. Regular updates, bug fixes, and support requests come along with this responsibility, making sure that the product remains reliable and efficient.

         ## 2.4 Benefits and Challenges of Agile Development

        One advantage of Agile development is that it provides flexibility and adaptiveity in response to changing requirements, customer preferences, and market conditions. Within a given timeframe, iterations and sprints allow teams to tackle large products with confidence and manage complexity in a manageable manner. Another benefit is that the Agile approach encourages frequent interaction among team members, reducing communication costs and facilitating learning and sharing.

        However, there are also challenges associated with implementing Agile methods successfully. For example, it takes longer to develop and deliver software than traditional models due to the increased overhead in managing cross-functional teams and adapting to changing requirements. Furthermore, unlike traditional models, Agile methodologies can result in slower turnaround times because multiple milestones need to be met and deadlines pushed back if needed. Additionally, the lack of detailed documentation and clear roles can make it challenging for junior developers to understand the architecture and logic behind the system.


        On the positive side, Agile development offers many benefits, especially in smaller businesses and organizations seeking high levels of customization and personalization. Despite these drawbacks, Agile has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional development models, becoming increasingly popular as companies adopt automation and cloud computing platforms to reduce manual labor costs and speed up the pace of innovation.
