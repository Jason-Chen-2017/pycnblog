# 1.简介
         

         The development of natural language processing (NLP) models has been a significant progress over the past few years, as it is essential for applications such as chatbots, speech recognition systems, text summarization, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and many others. In this article, we will provide an overview of NLP history from its early beginnings to today’s state-of-the-art technologies, covering topics such as neural networks, deep learning, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning. We also discuss important developments in large-scale pretraining techniques and evaluate their effectiveness against conventional word embeddings methods. In addition, we highlight the latest breakthroughs in NLP research that are highly impactful on industry, including transformer-based language models like GPT-3 and BERT, pre-trained multilingual language models, and new model architectures like Longformer and Linformer. Finally, we list the top 20 hottest blog articles in the field of artificial intelligence and describe how they benefit both practitioners and students alike.
          
         2.历史回顾
         
         Natural language processing (NLP), originally known as computational linguistics, refers to the use of computers to understand human languages with sophisticated algorithms. Within recent decades, several powerful approaches have emerged for solving various problems related to NLP, such as rule-based systems, statistical models, and deep learning based approaches. However, there were no general guidelines or frameworks developed to organize these approaches into coherent sets of principles that would enable anyone to compare different modeling techniques and design appropriate solutions. As a result, much of the progress in NLP has been ad hoc and driven by individual research groups or companies. This lack of consensus prevented interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers and practitioners and stifled long-term progress towards better understanding and communication across diverse domains. To address this problem, several organizations formed around the area of NLP, each promoting a set of best practices and standards to guide future research. Some of the leading organization include the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL), the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), and the NAACL HLT System. 
         
         For example, ICCL established the task force on Neural Network-based Approaches to Natural Language Processing (NN-NLP). It recommended three basic steps for developing a NLP system: 1) data acquisition, 2) feature extraction, and 3) algorithm selection/implementation. NN-NLP researchers then proposed various architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models. Meanwhile, ACL developed a Roadmap for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) Systems, which identified five main components needed for building SMT systems: Data Collection, Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Model Selection/Design, and Evaluation. Moreover, EMNLP advised on the foundation principles for Text Summarization tasks using Deep Learning. Specifically, it encouraged papers to focus on fundamental issues such as explanatory power, simplicity, efficiency, robustness, interpretability, and non-parametricity, while also encouraging papers to be transparent about the assumptions underpinning their approach. These guidelines helped to standardize the research community and facilitate effective comparison and communication within the field. 
         
         During the course of centuries, different NLP techniques evolved from simple rules-based models to complex neural network-based models and finally to hybrid methods combining rule-based and neural approaches. While some technological advancements led to improvements in performance, other breakthroughs provided insights into the structure and mechanisms underlying human language. Over time, more advanced techniques became commonplace, but often at the cost of increased complexity, requiring expertise in multiple areas such as statistics, mathematics, computer science, and engineering. Nevertheless, despite the rapid pace of technology development, NLP remains one of the most active fields in modern computing, spanning many disciplines such as computer vision, biology, finance, social sciences, and medicine.
          
         3.基本术语与定义
         
         There are several key terms and concepts used in NLP research that may not be familiar to everyone, so let's briefly go through them here:

         - **Corpus**: A corpus is a collection of texts, typically organized in documents or sentences. Corpora are used to train natural language models to recognize patterns and meanings in natural language.

         - **Tokenization**: Tokenization is the process of separating a sentence into words, phrases, or other meaningful units called tokens. Tokens can represent either standalone words or multi-word expressions depending on the context. Common tokenization techniques include whitespace splitting, word n-grams, character-level n-grams, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS) tags, etc.

         - **Embedding**: Embedding is a vector representation of a token, typically represented as a dense real-valued vector of fixed dimensionality. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between tokens, allowing NLP models to learn relationships even when given sparse representations of text data. Typical embedding dimensions range from 50 to 500 dimensions and are learned jointly during training. Two popular embedding techniques are Word2Vec and GloVe.

          - **Model architecture**: An NLP model architecture specifies the way the inputs are mapped to output predictions, and consists of a sequence of layers connected together. The most commonly used architectures are RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers.

           - **Training**: Training is the process of adjusting the parameters of the model architecture to optimize its performance on a particular dataset. Different strategies involve iteratively updating the weights of the model using backpropagation and gradient descent, employing regularization techniques to avoid overfitting, and selecting hyperparameters that trade off between convergence speed and accuracy.
           
           - **Pre-training**: Pre-training is a technique where a large amount of unlabelled data is fed to an NLP model before being fine-tuned on a specific task. This helps to improve the quality of initial predictions and reduce the need for extensive amounts of labeled data.

            - **Transfer learning**: Transfer learning involves transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model trained on a large, general-purpose dataset to a smaller target dataset relevant for the downstream task.
