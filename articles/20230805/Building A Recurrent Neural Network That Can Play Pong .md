# 1.简介
         

         Deep learning has been playing an increasingly important role in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning over the last few years. One of the most popular algorithms used for deep learning is recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are capable of processing sequential data such as text or speech. The field of reinforcement learning uses RNNs to model complex systems with memory and decision-making. While these advancements have made significant progress towards building powerful AI models, they still face some fundamental challenges that limit their practical applications. One such challenge involves training large RNNs on small datasets and handling long sequences, which can be challenging even for high-performance computers. 
         
         In this article, we will explore how to build a simple version of the game Pong using a recurrent neural network (RNN). We will use Tensorflow, a popular open source library for deep learning, to implement our model. By doing so, we hope to inspire further exploration into applying deep learning techniques to new problems, including computer games. Additionally, we hope to encourage readers to apply their own creativity and imagination to create more complex versions of the game or develop other interesting projects using deep learning.

         # 2.背景介绍
         Game Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games created by Atari. It consists of two players competing against a virtual ball bouncing around the table. Each player attempts to score a goal by moving their paddle up and down without letting the ball bounce off of it. The object of the game is to keep the ball from getting past your opponent's paddle before you allow them to score. There are different rules depending on whether the ball is moving horizontally or vertically; if the ball is stationary, both players receive points based on where the ball stops while in play. 
        
        Our task is to train an agent that learns to play Pong autonomously by making decisions about when to move left or right at each time step, given the current state of the game. Since the actions taken by either player depend on the previous actions, we need a model that can process sequential input data. Specifically, we want our model to take in a sequence of inputs representing the positions of the paddles and the position of the ball at every time step, and output a probability distribution over possible actions at the next time step. We'll start with a simplified version of Pong consisting of just two frames: the current frame and its immediately preceding frame. This makes our problem easier to solve since we don't have to consider temporal dependencies between consecutive frames.

        Once we have learned to make good decisions in Pong, we can extend our solution to handle longer sequences, such as those seen during competitions. To do so, we could include additional information such as the motion of the balls, the speed of the paddles, and any obstacles in the way. However, to keep this article focused on implementing basic functionality, we will stick with a simpler version of the game for now.

        # 3.基本概念术语说明
        ## Recurrent Neural Networks（RNN）
        
        Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are designed to work well with sequential input data, such as audio or natural language. They are typically composed of multiple layers of nodes that pass information through the network sequentially. The key feature of RNNs is that they maintain an internal memory of previously processed input data, allowing them to store relevant information and make predictions based on this context. For example, let’s say we wanted to predict the weather based on historical temperature readings. We would feed this sequence of temperature values into an RNN, which would learn to remember patterns across the entire sequence and produce accurate predictions for future temperatures. Similarly, RNNs are commonly used for modeling sequential data in many fields, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series prediction.


        The figure above shows an illustration of how an RNN works. At each time step t, an input x(t) is fed into the RNN. The RNN processes this input and produces an output o(t+1). Also, the RNN maintains an internal state s(t) that captures information about the history of all previous inputs. When presented with a new input x(t+1), the RNN updates its state according to equations that preserve existing knowledge and integrate new information. 

        In our case, we will use an RNN to train an agent that plays Pong. The agent takes in a sequence of images depicting the state of the game at every time step, along with metadata such as the velocity of the ball and the location of the paddles, and outputs a probability distribution over four possible actions: no movement, left movement, right movement, and forward movement. We assume that the first image represents the current state of the game, while subsequent images represent states shifted one time step to the left. Therefore, we call our model a recurrent neural network.

        ## Convolutional Neural Networks（CNN）

        Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are another type of artificial neural network that are particularly effective at capturing spatial relationships within visual data. CNNs are specifically designed to analyze large amounts of multidimensional data, such as images, videos, or sound clips, but they also have the capacity to extract higher-level features like edges, lines, shapes, and textures. These features are then passed through fully connected layers to produce the final output. Unlike traditional neural networks, which rely heavily on weights to capture nonlinear relationships, CNNs use filters to detect specific features in the input data, reducing the amount of computation needed compared to dense layers.

        CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks, including object detection, scene classification, and facial expression recognition. Here's an example architecture diagram for a CNN used for image classification:


        In our case, we won’t use a CNN directly to generate the input sequence for Pong. Instead, we will convert the raw pixel values produced by the game itself into a format suitable for our model. This means converting the game screen to grayscale and resizing it to a fixed size (e.g., 64x64 pixels). We will then stack these resized images together to form the input sequence for our model. This approach allows us to retain the high level spatial structure present in the original game screens while greatly simplifying the input representation required by our model.

        ## Data Preparation
        
        First, we need to gather a dataset of expert human demonstrations that guide the agent’s behavior in Pong. We trained several agents from scratch using reinforcement learning, but due to the time constraints, we chose to instead use pre-recorded human demonstrations as our dataset. The following steps summarize the process of cleaning and preprocessing the dataset:

        1. Clean the dataset by removing faulty examples and incomplete sequences
        2. Normalize the input images by scaling each pixel value to lie between [0, 1] 
        3. Reshape the input sequences into tensors of shape (num_samples, sequence_length, height, width, channels) 
           - num_samples: number of samples in the dataset
           - sequence_length: length of each sample in the tensor
           - height: height of the image
           - width: width of the image
           - channels: number of color channels in the image (grayscale = 1, RGB = 3)  

        After performing these steps, we end up with a set of cleaned and preprocessed training data that we can use to train our model. 

        
        Next, we need to define our model architecture. As mentioned earlier, we will use an LSTM layer followed by a fully connected layer to perform classification. The LSTM layer operates on the flattened input sequence to preserve the temporal structure of the data. The fully connected layer maps the output of the LSTM layer to logits corresponding to the probabilities of each action being taken at the next timestep. Finally, we will use cross entropy loss to measure the difference between predicted labels and true labels during training.

        During testing, we will simply run the trained model on unseen test data to see how well it performs.
