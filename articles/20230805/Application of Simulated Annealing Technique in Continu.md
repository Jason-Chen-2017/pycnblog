# 1.简介
         
　　Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic metaheuristic technique for solving complex optimisation problems such as those associated with continuous variables. The algorithm simulates the cooling process of a physical system over time and explores the parameter space by accepting or rejecting candidate solutions based on their relative "energy," which is determined through heuristics and based on simulated annealing's random walk approach to search for better solutions. This process continues until the algorithm converges to a local optimum solution or until it reaches a specified stopping criterion (e.g., maximum number of iterations).

         　　In this article, we will explore how SA can be applied to solve real-world continuous optimization problems, including linear programming, quadratic programming, and mixed integer programming. We will also discuss some related techniques that have been proposed recently. Our work aims at providing researchers and developers with a practical guide on using SA in various types of continuous optimization problems, enabling them to quickly prototype and implement different ideas and algorithms to solve these challenges.

         　　This article is organized into six sections: section 1 introduces the problem setting; section 2 describes key terms and concepts used in the paper; section 3 presents the core algorithm, steps, and math formula to help readers understand its working mechanism; section 4 includes code implementation details and explanations about how to use SA in specific optimization problems; section 5 discusses future directions and challenges in research, and finally section 6 lists common questions and answers from the field of continuous optimization and their corresponding answers in our experience.

         　　# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
         　　## Definitions 
         　　1. **Optimization**: The task of finding the best possible solution within certain constraints. In this context, optimization refers to minimization, maximization, or finding global optima among a set of potential solutions. 

         　　2. **Continuous variable**: A variable whose value ranges from positive infinity to negative infinity.

         　　3. **Objective function**: The function that provides information about the performance of the optimized model. It takes a set of input parameters and produces one single scalar output.

         　　4. **Gradient descent** : One of the simplest iterative optimization methods that repeatedly adjusts the values of the input parameters in a direction opposite to the gradient of the objective function until convergence. Gradient descent is guaranteed to find the optimal solution but may take longer than other optimization algorithms when searching large spaces.

         　　5. **Quadratic programming** (QP): A special case of convex optimization where the objective function is quadratic with respect to the input parameters, i.e., it is written in the form f(x) = 0.5*x^T Q x + c^T x subject to a set of linear constraints Ax <= b.

         　　6. **Linear programming** (LP): A type of mathematical optimization problem that seeks to minimize or maximize a linear function while ensuring that the constraint conditions are met. LP problems typically involve matrices of coefficients and vector constants that relate the decision variables to each other.

         　　7. **Mixed integer programming** (MIP): A generalization of LP problems that allows for discrete decision variables. MIP problems may include both binary and integer variables, allowing for more precise control of the decision process.

         　　8. **Heuristic**: An approximate method of solving a problem that often has suboptimal performance, but can provide good solutions in a short amount of time. Heuristics can significantly reduce computational time compared to exact approaches like brute force enumeration or dynamic programming.

         　　9. **Annealing schedule**: A sequence of temperatures assigned to the current state of the system during the simulation process, representing the degree of exploration versus exploitation of the search space.

         　　10. **Acceptance probability**: The likelihood of accepting a new solution that is worse than the current one based on their difference in energy levels.

         　　11. **Temperature**: A measure of the current state of the system, inversely proportional to the distance traveled from the current position. Initially, the temperature is high, indicating a preference towards exploring unexplored regions of the search space. As the temperature decreases, the agent becomes more conservative, preferring not to make drastic changes in his/her path.

         　　12. **Cooling schedule**: A rule that controls the rate at which the system transitions between states, with lower rates leading to slower equilibration times and higher rates leading to faster convergence to the global optimum.

         　　13. **Energy level**: The sum of two functions: the first represents the quality of the solution itself, while the second penalizes poor alignments between the solution and the constraints.

         　　14. **Perturbation:** A small change in the input parameters to test if they can improve the solution. If the perturbation improves the solution, then we accept it with some probability greater than zero, otherwise we discard it according to a Metropolis acceptance probability.

         　　15. **Convergence criteria**: Conditions under which the algorithm terminates without completing all desired iterations. Convergence criteria usually depend on the nature of the problem being solved and the required accuracy.

           ## Notations
           To simplify notation, let us denote the following quantities -

           * n: Number of decision variables.
           * m: Number of constraints.
           * K: Upper bound on the magnitude of the input parameters. 
           * γ: Cooling factor that determines the rate of decrease in temperature per iteration.
           * ε: Tolerance level below which the algorithm should terminate.
           
           
           Let us now introduce some relevant symbols used in the rest of the document. These symbols indicate the role of individual components involved in the algorithm.

           1. $    heta$: Current solution vector (n dimensional).
           2. $p_i$ : Random perturbation vector (n dimensional).
           3. $f(    heta)$: Objective function evaluated at the current solution $    heta$.
           4. $A    heta=\hat{b}$: Vector product of matrix A and current solution $    heta$, equal to the right hand side vector $\hat{b}$.
           5. $d_{    heta}={\rm argmax}_{p}\quad\{f(    heta+p)-f(    heta)\}$, i.e., the direction in which we wish to move next.
           6. $E(    heta,\hat{b})=f(    heta)+\frac{1}{2}(||A    heta-\hat{b}||_2^2+\sum_{j=1}^m h_j(\hat{a}_j^{    op}    heta))$: Energy level of the current solution, given the feasible region defined by the constraints.
           7. $\eta$: Temperature parameter, initially set to a high value to encourage exploration.

        # 3.Core Algorithm
        ## Problem Setting
        We consider three categories of continuous optimization problems: linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP), and mixed integer programming (MIP). Each of these problems involves a finite set of decision variables $x \in R^n$ and a target set of constraints, $\{\leq, >, =, 
eq\}$ or inequality or equality constraints $Ax \leq b$ or $Cx = d$. The goal is to find a point or a subset of points $(x^\star)$ that minimizes or maximizes the objective function $f(x)$ subject to the constraints. For example, consider the following quadratic program - 

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \min_{x} & \quad (1/2)x^TQx+c^Tx \\
        s.t.& \quad Ax \leq b
        \end{aligned}
        $$
        
        Here, the variable $Q$ is symmetric and positive semidefinite, so it forms the Hessian matrix of $f$. Similarly, the diagonal elements of $C$ must be non-negative, making it a valid cost function for optimizing the above problem.

        More generally, we assume that there exists a finite set of reference vectors ${r_1}, {r_2},..., {r_K}$ that define a bounded region around the feasible region, commonly referred to as the trust region. Given a starting point $    heta_0$, the algorithm searches for a minimum or maximum of the objective function $f$ subject to the constraints, within a specified tolerance threshold $\epsilon$.

        ## Approach
        ### Key Ideas 
        #### Markov chain Monte Carlo
            SA is a probabilistic technique that generates candidates for improving the solution either directly or indirectly through Monte Carlo simulations, known as markov chains. SA works by gradually reducing the acceptance probabilities as the algorithm progresses, encouraging more promising moves, and eventually eliminating ones that don't meet the necessary quality standard. By doing so, SA avoids getting stuck in local minima and escapes from plateaus early, effectively combining the benefits of local search algorithms like gradient descent with the theoretical guarantees of stochastic approximation.
            
            Specifically, SA uses a simple yet elegant trick called simulated annealing to generate new solutions to explore the parameter space. The idea behind simulated annealing is similar to classical annealing, where the heat transfer between two solid objects is controlled by varying the temperature of the surrounding environment, i.e., the temperature affects the probability of accepting worse solutions. However, instead of just altering the temperature alone, SA randomly alters the accepted or rejected status of a candidate solution based on its contribution to the overall movement of the system towards the optimum.
            
            In essence, SA maintains a Markov chain that represents the system’s behavior under different scenarios. At any given moment, the system is in one particular configuration, represented by the state vector $    heta$. The temperature determines how much the system is allowed to vary, depending on whether it wishes to increase or decrease the total energy level. According to the probability distribution of the acceptance probabilities, the system can jump to another configuration with a better objective value, but with some probability that may result in deteriorating the overall system performance.
            
        #### Metropolis Criteria
            When applying SA to solve continuous optimization problems, we need to ensure that the resulting algorithm meets certain requirements. One such requirement is the Metropolis acceptance criterion, which specifies the probability of accepting a candidate solution if it improves upon the previous best solution. This ensures that only qualitatively improved solutions are retained in the final solution pool.
            
            Intuitively, if we are currently at a low temperature and receive a good solution, we might want to keep it since it is likely to be useful later. On the other hand, if we are in a high temperature and receive a bad solution, we might decide to revert back to the previous state because we fear losing valuable knowledge. However, if we are in a moderate temperature and receive a slightly better solution, we still need to assess whether it is worth keeping. The Metropolis acceptance criterion gives us a way to determine the probability of accepting a solution based on its improvement over the current best solution.
            
            To compute the Metropolis criterion, we compare the current solution to the best solution found so far, and determine the ratio of the probability of accepting the new solution divided by the probability of accepting the old solution. If the ratio exceeds 1, we accept the new solution with full confidence. Otherwise, we choose a uniform random number $u \in [0,1]$ and accept the new solution with probability $u/    ext{acceptance probability}(    heta',    heta)$, where $    heta'$ is the new solution and $    ext{acceptance probability}(    heta',    heta)$ indicates the likelihood of accepting the new solution over the old one.
            
        ### Procedure
            1. Initialize the initial solution $    heta_0$.
            2. Set the initial temperature $\eta$ and cooling constant $\gamma$. 
            3. Repeat until termination condition is satisfied:
                 3.1 Generate a new candidate solution $    heta' =     heta_0 + p_i$, where $p_i$ is a random perturbation vector drawn from a normal distribution N($\mathbf{0},\sigma I$) with mean 0 and variance $\sigma$. 
                 3.2 Compute the energy level $E_{    heta'}(    heta')$ of the candidate solution.
                 3.3 Accept the candidate solution $    heta'$ with probability $u_{accept}(    heta',    heta)$ based on the Metropolis criterion.
                  
                 Where $u_{accept}(    heta',    heta)$ is calculated as follows - 
                     
                     $$    ext{acceptance probability}(    heta',    heta)=\exp(-\frac{(E_{    heta'}(    heta')-E_{    heta_k}(    heta_k))/(\gamma T)}{\delta}),$$
                     
                     where $E_{    heta_k}(    heta_k)$ is the energy level of the best solution found so far ($    heta_k$), $\gamma$ is the cooling constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $\delta$ is the spacing between adjacent temperatures. 
                   
             3. Update the temperature $\eta := \gamma T$ and continue to step 3.

        ## Math Formulas
        ### State Transition Function

        Suppose that we start at some configuration $    heta_0$ and apply a perturbation $p_i$ to obtain a candidate solution $    heta'$. Denoting $\Delta E$ as the change in energy level after taking the perturbation, we would like to calculate the probability of accepting this candidate solution $    heta'$ over the current solution $    heta_0$. Mathematically, we could write this as follows - 

                $$
                P_{    heta'}(    heta_0) = \frac{\exp(-\beta \Delta E_{    heta'})}{\sum_{j}^{M} \exp(-\beta \Delta E_{j})}
                $$
                
        Here, $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, which decides the rate at which the system slows down, and $M$ is the set of all possible configurations reachable from $    heta_0$ via perturbations. The denominator of the expression computes the normalization term that makes sure that every possible outcome has an equal chance of happening, even though the actual proportion of outcomes depends on the acceptance probabilities obtained throughout the simulation.

        ### Relative Probability of Moving to Another Configuration
        Consider two adjacent configurations $    heta_{k-1}$ and $    heta_k$ separated by an infinitesimal displacement $\delta_    heta$. Assuming that the system remains at temperature $\eta$ and that we do not violate any hard constraints, we would like to evaluate the probability of moving from $    heta_{k-1}$ to $    heta_k$. Using the Boltzmann equation, we have

                $$
                \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta (\Delta E_{    heta_k}-\Delta E_{    heta_{k-1}})}
                $$
                
        where $Z$ is a normalizing constant that ensures that the probability integrates to one across the entire domain of admissible configurations. Substituting the definition of the energy level and computing the derivative of the Boltzmann equation with respect to $    heta_k$, we get
                
                $$
                \frac{\partial }{\partial     heta_k} \left[ \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta (\Delta E_{    heta_k}-\Delta E_{    heta_{k-1}})} \right] 
                = \frac{e^{-\beta \Delta E_{    heta'}}}{Z} \frac{d E_{    heta'}}{d     heta'}
                $$
                
        where $d E_{    heta'}/d     heta'$ is the Jacobian of the transformation from the Cartesian basis to the parameterized basis at $    heta_k$. This expression tells us the relative probability of moving from $    heta_{k-1}$ to $    heta_k$, assuming that we have already selected a perturbation $p_i$ that leads to $    heta'_k$.

        ### Global Optimization Problem
        Finally, suppose that we start from an arbitrary point $    heta_0$ and follow the simulated annealing procedure described earlier to reach a local optimum $    heta_*$. We would like to know what is the global minimum of the objective function $f$ within the trust region $\mathcal{R}$? Mathematically, we can write this as follows - 

                $$
                \min_{x \in \mathcal{R}}\ f(x)
                $$
                
        where $\mathcal{R}$ is a bounded subspace of the parameter space that contains the current solution $    heta_0$. Under the assumption that $\mathcal{R}$ does indeed contain the global minimum, we can show that the global minimum is always attained at some point $    heta_*$ inside the trust region. Therefore, the question of determining the global optimum reduces to the same as the problem of locating the nearest local optimum to the current solution.
