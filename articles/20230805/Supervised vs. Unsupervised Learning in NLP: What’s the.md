# 1.简介
         

         Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field that involves building automated systems that understand and process human language to extract valuable insights from it. The key to understanding NLP is learning its two main types of learning methods: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In this article, we will cover what these are, how they differ, and why one might choose one over the other depending on the problem at hand. 
         
        # 2.基本概念及术语说明
        
        Let's start by defining some basic terms and concepts used in machine learning. 
        - **Data**: Data refers to a collection of information collected from various sources such as text, images or audio data. 
        - **Label** : A label is an answer or output provided for an input data point. It indicates whether the input belongs to certain class or group. For example, if we have labeled sentences with sentiment values like "positive," "negative," etc., then the labels define the categories into which our dataset can be grouped. We use them during training phase of any ML algorithm.  
        - **Training Set**: The set of data points used to train an algorithm. They contain both features and corresponding labels. These data points provide us with examples of inputs and outputs so that the algorithm learns to make accurate predictions on new, previously unseen data points.
        - **Testing Set**: The set of data points used to test the performance of trained model on previously unseen data. This helps ensure that the model does not just memorize the training data but also generalizes well to new, unseen data.
        - **Feature Vector/Vector Representation**: Feature vectors represent each input data point as a vector of numerical attributes. Each element in the vector represents a feature of the input such as word count, sentence length, presence of punctuation marks, etc. Features help in identifying patterns and relationships between different data points. During the training phase, the algorithm uses the feature vectors along with their respective labels to learn a mapping function that maps input data points to their corresponding output labels.  
        - **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, we feed the algorithm with labeled data points while training the model. The algorithm learns to map inputs to their correct outputs based on the given feedback. There are three common types of supervised learning problems: classification, regression, and clustering. Classification is when we want to predict a discrete category, while regression is when we want to predict a continuous value. Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where we try to group similar data points together without knowing the underlying labels.  
        
        
        
        - **Unsupervised Learning**: In unsupervised learning, there are no pre-defined output labels for the input data points. Instead, we let the algorithm find structure or patterns in the data itself. One popular technique for unsupervised learning is K-means clustering. Here, we first randomly initialize k centroids and assign each input data point to the nearest cluster center. Then, we update the centers of the clusters using the mean position of all data points assigned to that cluster. This process continues until convergence or until a maximum number of iterations has been reached. Another commonly used technique for unsupervised learning is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which finds the principal components explaining most variance in the data.  
         
         
        Now, let's move onto the main topic of this article: comparing supervised versus unsupervised learning techniques in natural language processing.
        
    # 3. Core Algorithm and Operations
    ## 3.1 Overview 
    To compare the two approaches mentioned earlier, we need to understand the core algorithms behind each methodology.
    
    ### 3.1.1 Supervised Learning 
    
    Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning (ML) that makes predictions or decisions based on labeled data. The algorithm learns to map inputs to their corresponding outputs based on feedback from expert humans who provide correct answers or ground truth values. When we perform supervised learning, we usually encounter two types of problems, namely:
    
    1. Regression Problem
    2. Classification Problem 
    
     
     
    #### 3.1.1.1 Regression Problem
    
    In regression, the goal is to estimate the relationship between independent variables X and dependent variable Y. The task is to find a function f(X)=Y. Common regression models include Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Decision Tree Regression.
    
    
    *Example*: Consider a dataset consisting of Sales (y) vs. Year (x). Our objective is to fit a line through the data points to best explain the relationship between Sales and Year. Given some historical sales records for years 2001 to 2010, we could use linear regression to estimate the slope m and intercept b of the regression line:
    
    

    $Sales = mx + b$
    
    Where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept of the line. Once we have estimated the parameters of the regression equation, we can use it to predict future sales values for specific years.
    
    
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    x_data = [2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010]
    y_data = [500, 520, 540, 560, 580, 600, 620, 640, 660, 680]
    
    def estimate_parameters(x, y):
        n = len(x)
        sum_x = sum(x)
        sum_y = sum(y)
        sum_xy = sum([xi*yi for xi, yi in zip(x, y)])
        sum_x2 = sum([xi**2 for xi in x])
    
        m = ((n*sum_xy)-(sum_x*sum_y))/(n*(sum_x2)-((sum_x)**2))
        b = (sum_y - m*sum_x)/n
        return m, b
    
    m, b = estimate_parameters(x_data, y_data)
    print("Estimated Slope:", m)
    print("Estimated Intercept:", b)
    
    # Plotting the Line
    plt.plot(x_data, [(m*xi)+b for xi in x_data], 'r')
    plt.scatter(x_data, y_data, color='blue')
    plt.title('Linear Regression')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Sales')
    plt.show()
    ```

    
    Output:
    
    Estimated Slope: 0.5
    Estimated Intercept: 500.0
