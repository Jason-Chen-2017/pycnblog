Parallel computing is one of the most important techniques for improving the performance and efficiency of software applications. It enables multiple threads or processes to work simultaneously on a single computer system to improve the overall processing time and reduce the wait times for user input. The goal of parallel computing is to break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently on different processors or cores in order to exploit the available resources more efficiently. To develop programs using parallel programming, we need to know several essential concepts such as synchronization, memory access patterns, data distribution strategies, and scheduling policies. In this article, I will introduce you to the world of parallel computing using the OpenMP standard which has become an industry-standard API for parallel programming. 

The OpenMP standard provides a set of directives that allow developers to write portable and efficient parallel code without having to worry about underlying hardware details. The directives specify how the program should be parallelized and how the shared variables are synchronized between threads. This makes it easy for developers to port their codes across various platforms without changing them. With its vast support from vendors and compilers, OpenMP is becoming increasingly popular among developers who want to take advantage of multi-core CPUs to improve the performance of their software applications.

In addition to OpenMP, there are other parallel computing libraries like Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB), CUDA, MPI, etc., each of which offers unique features and advantages depending upon your specific requirements and constraints. Therefore, it's essential for any developer to choose the right library based on his/her application needs and preferences.

In this article, we will learn how to use the following core concepts of parallel programming:

1. Scheduling Policies
2. Memory Access Patterns
3. Synchronization Methods
4. Data Distribution Strategies
5. Shared Variables and Reduction Operations

Before we start with these concepts let’s understand what exactly does parallelism mean? A simple definition would be the ability of a computational task to be divided into smaller, independent pieces that can be executed concurrently. To implement parallel computing, many computers have multiple processing units (cores) that can execute instructions independently at the same time. These individual units are connected together and form a cluster that executes all instructions within a program simultaneously. Each thread runs independently from the others, sharing data through explicit communication channels that must be explicitly established. At the end, when all threads complete execution, the results are combined to produce the final output.

Therefore, to achieve high levels of concurrency and scalability in parallel computing, we need to partition our tasks into small manageable chunks, distribute the chunks across the nodes of our cluster, and synchronize them so that they don't interfere with each other. For instance, if we have two tasks, T1 and T2, and we split them into four parts, then each part can be assigned to a separate processor or core, allowing both tasks to run simultaneously. However, before assigning each part to a processor, we need to make sure that none of the parts interferes with each other due to race conditions or data dependencies. 

To optimize the performance of our parallel programs, we need to select the appropriate scheduling policy that determines how threads are mapped onto processors. There are several commonly used scheduling policies including static scheduling, dynamic scheduling, guided scheduling, and runtime scheduling. Static scheduling assigns the first n tasks to the first m processors, where n is the number of processors and m is the maximum number of threads per processor. Dynamic scheduling dynamically adjusts the mapping of threads to processors based on their workload, ensuring that every processor has enough work to do while minimizing idle periods. Guided scheduling uses feedback from previous iterations to predict the behavior of future iterations and adaptively assign tasks accordingly. Runtime scheduling allows us to control the degree of concurrency during run-time by setting environment variables and manipulating the number of threads being used by the application.

Memory access pattern plays an essential role in determining the optimal performance of our parallel programs. Since each processor or core has its own cache memory, accessing data frequently leads to better cache locality. Locality means that nearby data elements tend to be accessed together, leading to faster access times than random accesses. We also need to consider memory hierarchy issues such as cache coherency, false sharing, cache line padding, and locality optimization.

Synchronization methods play an integral role in achieving reliable and correct parallel execution. During initialization phase, threads may need to communicate with each other to share data or perform reduction operations. Mutex locks provide mutual exclusion to avoid conflicts between threads trying to modify the same resource. Barriers ensure that no thread leaves the barrier until all participants have arrived. Semaphores signal the availability of a certain resource and help coordinate execution of tasks. Monitors are used to protect critical sections of code and prevent deadlocks.

Finally, data distribution strategies determine how the data is distributed across processors in a parallel program. One common strategy is to scatter the data evenly over the processors according to some criteria, known as data distribution methodology. Another strategy is to replicate the data across all processors, which is called replication methodology. Data partitioning helps reduce contention between processors and improves load balancing. Additionally, we need to evaluate the impact of message size on the performance of parallel programs, especially when dealing with large messages. Finally, we can combine the above mentioned concepts to design scalable and optimized parallel algorithms.
