# 1.简介
         
　　Trusted computing (TC) is a fundamental concept in information security that involves building trustworthy software systems based on data processing abilities such as encryption, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. Its main objective is to provide an end-to-end secure platform for critical applications, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). However, implementing trusted computations poses significant challenges because of its complex requirements, especially when it comes to system development and deployment. While TC has been widely adopted by many businesses worldwide due to its robustness and privacy protection capabilities, it can also create serious risks for sensitive or important applications such as healthcare and finance. Therefore, ensuring the safety and security of these applications requires rigorous testing procedures and compliance with industry standards. In this article, we will discuss how TC relates to AI/ML systems and what are the key challenges faced during system development and deployment. We will also present the latest research advances to address some of these challenges, highlighting their importance and impact. Finally, we will conclude by discussing recommendations for better managing the risks associated with TC within organizations.
         # 2.概念和术语
         　　本节我们将介绍TC相关的一些基本概念和术语。首先，我们定义TC为“建立信任的计算系统”，即利用数据处理能力（如加密、认证、完整性和不可否认性）构建出可信赖的软件系统。其次，TC主要目标是在关键应用中提供端到端的安全平台，包括人工智能（AI）和机器学习（ML）。但是，实现TC却存在诸多挑战，特别是在系统开发和部署方面。由于TC具有强大的健壮性和隐私保护能力，因此对于敏感或重要的应用程序（如医疗和金融）也是危险的。因此，为了确保这些应用程序的安全性和稳定性，需要认真地进行测试过程和遵守行业标准。在本文中，我们将讨论TC如何与AI/ML系统相关联，以及在系统开发和部署过程中所面临的关键挑战。此外，还会对解决一些挑战作出最新研究的总结，并着重强调它们的重要性及影响力。最后，本节还将讨论组织内的TC风险管理建议。
         ### 2.1 TC vs AI/ML System
         对于AI/ML系统的比较，TC可以概括为两类：
         - Trusted Compute Platform (TCP): Trusted compute platforms are dedicated hardware devices like processors or coprocessors that include built-in cryptographic functions for data protection purposes. These platforms run the core algorithms and processes required to perform secure computation using encryption, authentication, and other mechanisms such as auditing and attestation. They serve as the basis for more sophisticated multi-tenant cloud services where tenants share resources between multiple users while still maintaining the necessary level of trust. Examples of TCPs include Intel SGX, AMD SEV, Arm TrustZone, etc.
         - Edge/Cloud AI/ML Pipelines: Trusted execution environments (TEEs) embody a set of techniques for achieving trusted execution without moving any secret data into untrusted memory spaces. TEEs provide isolated execution environments for running ML models that guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of model inputs and outputs, even if they traverse network boundaries or undergo tampering attacks. For example, Google’s Tensorflow Lite offers support for TEEs through Android Neural Processing Units (NPU), Qualcomm Hexagon DSPs, Apple Neural Engine, and others.

         在这里，我们把TC分为两个分类：
         - Trusted Compute Platform (TCP): 信任计算平台是专用硬件设备，例如处理器或协处理器，其中包括用于数据保护目的的集成加密功能。该平台运行核心算法和过程，以使用加密、验证等机制进行安全计算。它作为多租户云服务的基础，其中租户共享资源，而用户仍然能够保持必要的信任水平。示例TCP包括英特尔SGX、AMD Sev、Arm TrustZone等。
         - Edge/Cloud AI/ML Pipelines: 信任执行环境（TEE）是一种可以在不将任何机密数据移入未受信任内存空间的情况下，实现受信任执行的技术集。TEE为运行ML模型提供了隔离执行环境，该环境保证模型输入和输出的机密性、完整性和可用性，即使它们经过网络边界或篡改攻击。例如，谷歌TensorFlow Lite通过Android神经处理单元（NPU）、高通Hexagon DSP、苹果Neural Engine等支持TEE。

         从这个角度看，TCP是实现TC的硬件平台；而边缘/云AI/ML管道则是实现TC的编程框架。这种分层结构允许开发者选择最适合自己需求的实现方式。

          ## 2.2 Core Concepts & Terminology
         Now let's go over some core concepts and terminology related to TC that you should be familiar with before going further.
         ### 2.2.1 Authentication & Non-Repudiation
         　　Authentication refers to verifying the identity of a user or device, either before or after accessing a resource. It ensures that only authorized entities can access sensitive data stored in the database. Similarly, non-repudiation means demonstrating that the entity was involved in creating, modifying, or deleting a document or transaction. Without proper authentication and non-repudiation, attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and use it to commit fraudulent activities, such as hacking or identity theft.
          
      　　　　Non-repudiation relies on digital signatures or certificates that bind a document or signature to its authorship, rather than simply allowing the party to claim credit for the actions taken. This guarantees that the original creator of a document cannot deny having created it, and allows third parties to independently verify the source and authenticity of content. Without proper non-repudiation, misleading documents could trick consumers or business partners into making irreversible financial decisions or engaging in criminal acts.

       　　Authentication and non-repudiation are crucial components of any system dealing with personal information or transactions involving monetary value. Together, they allow us to establish a clear chain of custody from the point of origin to the point of consumption of every piece of sensitive information processed by our systems.

         ### 2.2.2 Data Protection Mechanisms
         　　Data protection mechanisms typically involve encrypting data, ensuring data integrity, securing communications channels, and conducting regular audits to detect intrusions or threats. Encryption uses a key to scramble plaintext data so that no one except those authorized to read the key can read the data. Integrity checks ensure that data has not been modified or corrupted in transit, which protects against replay attacks or man-in-the-middle attacks. Secure communication protocols enforce strong encryption algorithms and safeguards against eavesdropping and message tampering. Regular audits can identify security vulnerabilities or compromised credentials, which enables administrators to take appropriate action to prevent data breaches. Cryptographically secure random number generators (CSRNGs) are essential for generating keys used in various encryption schemes.

          　　In summary, data protection mechanisms help achieve four basic objectives:
           1. Privacy and Confidentiality: Ensuring that sensitive data remains private throughout the entire lifecycle of the data
           2. Data Integrity: Protecting against data corruption and modification
           3. Authenticity: Providing assurance that data originates from legitimate sources and has not been tampered with
           4. Accessibility: Allowing authorized individuals to access protected data regardless of location or connectivity

         ### 2.2.3 Compliance Standards
         　　Compliance standards define the specific measures an organization needs to follow in order to meet strict regulatory requirements. Examples of compliance standards include HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GLBA, FERPA, and COPPA. Compliance standards play an important role in ensuring that organizations adhere to applicable laws and legal requirements, while providing assurance to stakeholders about the effectiveness and efficiency of their security program. Compliance with these standards helps to minimize potential liability and promote ethical behavior in the workplace.
