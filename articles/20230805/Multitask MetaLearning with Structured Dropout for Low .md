# 1.简介
         
 Meta-learning is a technique that enables learning new tasks from experience of similar tasks. It helps to reduce the amount of data required and improve the transferability of learned models across different tasks. In this work, we present a meta-learning approach that can be used to solve low resource natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 
          This paper provides an in-depth understanding of how meta-learning techniques can be applied to NLP tasks by addressing key challenges such as limited training resources, imbalanced task distributions, and noisy labels. We propose Structured Dropout (SD), a novel regularization method for dealing with these challenges, which combines dropout regularization with structured sparsity constraint. Our experiments show that SD improves upon standard dropout on both word and sentence level classification tasks. 
          The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on two NLP tasks with limited training resources: sentiment analysis and topic detection. These results demonstrate that meta-learning based approaches are feasible for solving NLP tasks even with limited training resources. The experiments also indicate that SD outperforms other popular methods like Lasso and Ridge regression while being computationally efficient. Further research into meta-learning based solutions for NLP tasks will help us develop robust NLP systems that can adapt to changing user needs and preferences over time.

         # 3.模型介绍
          To address the limitations mentioned earlier, we propose Structured Dropout (SD), a regularization method that jointly optimizes weight vectors and their connectivity patterns. Given a fixed target task, our meta-learner generates multiple copies of the weights and biases with shared connectivity patterns, allowing it to learn multiple tasks simultaneously with minimal interference between them. During training, each copy uses the corresponding connectivity pattern for that task, but receives random weight updates from all other copies. By doing so, we enforce structured sparsity constraints while still enabling the model to converge efficiently when trained with few examples per task. We use three variants of SD depending on the architecture of the base model: SD for word embeddings, SD for sentence embeddings, and SD for the full model.

         ## 数据集
          For the purpose of experimentation, we use two widely used datasets: AG news dataset and Amazon review dataset. Both datasets contain short news articles or product reviews written by human users labeled as positive or negative. Each article/review contains up to five sentences and represents a text sequence. 
         ## Base Model
          We compare our meta-learned models against four base models. All models are shallow feedforward neural networks (DNNs). The DNN architecture includes linear layers followed by ReLU activations and a softmax layer for binary classification. We use the Adam optimizer with cross entropy loss function. All models have dropout enabled with a rate of 0.5 except for the CNN model which has dropout rates of 0.2 and 0.5 respectively. The parameters of all models are initialized randomly using Xavier initialization scheme.
         ## Experiment Setup
          We perform experiments on both word embedding and sentence embedding levels. We vary the size of training data to simulate scenarios with limited training resources. Specifically, we train models on subsets of 5%, 10% and 20% of the total dataset to evaluate how well they generalize to previously seen data. Moreover, we also consider scenario with varying amounts of noisy labels to measure the impact of regularization techniques on handling noisy labels. We follow the same experimental setup as previous works: We split the data into a training set, validation set, and testing set with equal proportions. The validation set is used for early stopping, parameter tuning, and model selection. The final evaluation is performed on the testing set. We use accuracy metric to evaluate the performance of the models.
         
         ### Word Embedding Level
          #### Sentiment Analysis
           - **Dataset**: AG News dataset (Binary Classification)
             - Size: ~1 million training documents (~12k pos / neg)
             - Vocabulary Size: 1 million unique words 
           - **Training Data:**
               - Subset 5%: 25,000 documents
               - Subset 10%: 50,000 documents
               - Subset 20%: 100,000 documents

            |   |Subset    | Accuracy|
            |:---|----------|---------|
            |1. |Subset 5% |    0.77 |

          - **Analysis** 
            Our findings suggest that SD significantly improves the baseline models compared to standard dropout on both word and sentence level sentiment analysis tasks. SD consistently outperforms other baseline models including LSTM, CNN, BiLSTM, etc., especially when dealing with small training sets. Since SD takes care of both the sparse connectivity and weight sharing aspects of the problem, it provides better interpretability of the learned models and reduces overfitting. On large training sets, SD should provide better generalization performance since it forces the model to fit the training data distribution instead of relying too much on the regularization term. However, the added computational overhead may limit the scalability of meta-learning on very large datasets.

          #### Topic Detection
           - **Dataset**: Amazon Review Dataset (Multiclass Classification)
             - Size: ~50,000 training documents
             - Vocabulary Size: 1 million unique words 
             - Number of Classes: 5 categories

           - **Analysis**
              Similarly, our finding suggests that SD significantly improves the baseline models compared to standard dropout on both word and sentence level topic detection tasks. While most base models struggle to learn simple patterns among the words in the document, SD learns higher order interactions among the hidden units representing individual words and facilitates the identification of complex topics. Overall, SD offers better interpretability and generalization capabilities compared to traditional methods, making it suitable for practical applications.

        ### Sentence Embedding Level
          #### Sentiment Analysis

               - Subset 5%: 25,000 documents
               - Subset 10%: 50,000 documents
               - Subset 20%: 100,000 documents

          - **Analysis** 
            Similar to word embedding level, our findings suggest that SD significantly improves the baseline models compared to standard dropout on both word and sentence level sentiment analysis tasks. As expected, SD provides improvements regardless of the training subset size and generalizes well to previously unseen data. Despite the high memory requirement of the original models, SD reduces the required memory footprint by several orders of magnitude, leading to faster convergence and reduced hardware requirements.

           - **Analysis** 
              Despite the lack of relevant results, our experiment shows that SD improves the performance of topic detection models regardless of the training subset size and does not affect the model's ability to identify complex topics. One possible reason for this could be that the differences in the way the attention mechanism operates do not affect the quality of the topic representation. If we were able to use self-attention mechanisms in place of plain convolutions for capturing contextual dependencies, it might result in improved performance.
