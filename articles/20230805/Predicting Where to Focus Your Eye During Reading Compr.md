　　Reading comprehension (RC) is one of the most challenging tasks for a machine learning model when it comes to natural language processing (NLP). It requires machines to read an entire passage of text while keeping track of what was being discussed and make inferences based on that context. However, current state-of-the-art models often rely heavily on manual feature engineering or attention mechanisms in addition to traditional NLP techniques such as word embeddings and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), making them susceptible to errors caused by limited information provided by the visual cues offered through images. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach using deep neural networks trained solely on monocular vision data and language modeling outputs. We show that our proposed model can effectively predict where readers should focus their eyes during RC tasks with high accuracy and robustness. Our preliminary results suggest that our approach could help improve reading comprehension performance in various domains including education, scientific papers, and news articles. In particular, it shows promise in improving automatic grading systems used in college exams and question answering systems used in job interviews. Moreover, incorporating insights from our experiments into existing NLP and computer vision algorithms could significantly enhance their performance in many applications across different fields.

         　　Reading comprehension has been a key task in artificial intelligence research for decades. One common method to address this problem is to use seq2seq (sequence-to-sequence) models which take input sequences and output corresponding target sequences. The two main approaches are sequence-based models and attention-based models. Sequence-based models employ either feedforward or recurrent neural networks to encode the input sequence and then decode it into the output sequence. Attention-based models use attention mechanisms to selectively attend to relevant parts of the input sequence at each decoding step. Examples of attention-based models include transformer networks, convolutional sequence-to-sequence models, and self-attention networks. Despite these advances, none of these methods have exploited the unique properties of visually encoded text, which are typically more difficult for machines to process than raw text alone.

         　　To handle this limitation, several recent works have proposed solutions that combine features extracted from both the visual and textual inputs, allowing machines to understand both modalities and perform inference on top of them. These methods include multimodal transformers (M-T) and mixer architectures. M-T uses image and text encoders to produce context-aware representations of the input sequences. Mixer architectures apply layers of learnable perception units that extract features from different sources and combines them together using attention mechanism.

         　　However, most of these methods still rely on external knowledge bases or handcrafted rules to compute the appropriate attention weights and decide how much attention to pay to individual elements of the visual encoding. Instead, we argue that a model should be able to automatically predict where to focus its eye by understanding the underlying structure of the text. This is particularly important in the case of long passages because it enables models to avoid spending too much time on irrelevant details or distract itself from the most crucial content. Therefore, we propose a new approach using deep neural networks trained solely on monocular vision data and language modeling outputs.

         # 3.模型概述
         　　Our proposed model consists of three components - a language model, a visual encoder, and a prediction module. The language model takes input sequences of words and generates probability distributions over possible next words. The visual encoder processes the same input sequence but produces a fixed-size representation of the input sentence without any temporal dependencies. Finally, the prediction module takes the predicted probabilities generated by the language model and the visual representation produced by the visual encoder, along with some additional metadata about the location and scale of the objects present in the scene, and predicts the region(s) where the reader should focus their gaze to maximize their chance of successfully completing the reading comprehension task.

         　　We train our model on a large dataset comprising millions of sentences from different domains ranging from educational materials to scientific papers. For training, we use two types of data - monocular vision data and language modeling outputs. The former includes realistic images taken from surveillance videos and webcams and is annotated with bounding boxes indicating the position and size of relevant objects within the scenes. The latter consists of labeled texts obtained from publicly available datasets like WebNLG, Gutenberg Books Corpus, etc., augmented with synthetic noise added by humans to simulate real-world scenarios where text may not be perfect.

         　　The basic architecture of our model is shown below:



         　　
         　　In summary, our approach first learns a language model to generate probability distributions over next words given previous ones. Then, it feeds the generated predictions back into another network, called the visual encoder, which produces a fixed-size representation of the input sentence. Next, it integrates this representation with other metadata such as object locations and scales, and applies a final classification layer to predict whether the reader should focus their gaze on a specific region of interest. By doing so, our model makes predictions that are better suited to the specific nature of reading comprehension tasks, especially those involving long passages of text.

         # 4.训练过程
         　　We use standard supervised learning strategies to train our model on the combined monocular vision and language modeling data. First, we preprocess the monocular data by resizing all images to a fixed size and applying random cropping and flipping operations to create variations of each example. We also normalize pixel values to lie between [-1,1] and convert them to floating point tensors before passing them through the CNN architecture.

         　　For the language modeling data, we simply tokenize the text using a subword tokenizer like BPE, remove special characters, and pad or truncate examples to a maximum length. Since we don’t need the decoder part of our model during training, we only consider the tokenized version of the input sequences as inputs to the language model.

         　　After preprocessing the data, we split it into training and validation sets, and start training our model using cross-entropy loss. Specifically, for each mini-batch of examples, we forward propagate the input sequences through the language model and get log-probabilities over the vocabulary. We then concatenate the visual representation with the logits to form a single tensor, and apply softmax activation to obtain probability distributions.

         　　During training, we optimize the parameters of our model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates with momentum and weight decay regularization. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of our model on the validation set periodically and adjust hyperparameters accordingly. When the validation metric stops improving, we stop training early and resume from the best performing epoch.

         　　Finally, after finishing training, we test our model on a separate test set and report metrics such as F1 score and BLEU scores.
