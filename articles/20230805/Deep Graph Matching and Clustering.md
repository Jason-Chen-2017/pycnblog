 Deep Graph Matching and Clustering (DGM) is a powerful framework that allows us to learn the similarity between graphs or objects represented as graphs. DGM can be used for various applications such as recommendation systems, anomaly detection in social networks, pattern recognition in images, fraud detection in e-commerce transactions, etc., where data are represented by graphs or graph-like structures. The main goal of DGM is to find a mapping function from one graph to another while keeping the nodes and edges of both graphs as similar as possible. 
          
           In this article we will cover the basic concept and terms used in deep graph matching, including representational learning, adversarial training, hyperbolic embedding, graph matching loss functions, spectral clustering, procrustes analysis, and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Then, we will go through the core algorithmic details using these concepts to implement DGM on real world datasets, such as drug repurposing, human action recognition, and electric grid fault diagnosis. Finally, we will explore some future directions and challenges in DGM research and development. 
         
         # 2.Basic Concepts and Terms
         ## Representational Learning
         Representation learning refers to the process of extracting meaningful features from raw data, which could then be used for downstream tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, or visualization. It involves transforming inputs into low dimensional representations with the help of neural networks, which map input patterns into a shared latent space, making them amenable to distance computations and comparisons. Commonly used algorithms for representation learning include autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and self-supervised learning techniques like contrastive learning and cycleGAN.

         Adversarial training is a common technique used during representation learning to improve model generalization capability. It encourages the network to discriminate between samples that look similar from a feature perspective but belong to different classes. This can be achieved by adding an extra objective to the loss function that penalizes the discriminator network’s predictions when compared to ground truth labels. For example, the triplet loss function consists of anchor points paired with positive and negative examples, all sampled from the same class. 
         
         Hyperbolic embeddings are commonly used to visualize high-dimensional data and preserve its geometric properties. They can capture complex relationships among data points and provide better visual insights than Euclidean spaces. Hyperbolic geometry provides an intuitive way to measure distances between objects based on their shapes rather than measuring physical dimensions. One advantage of using hyperbolic embeddings over Euclidean ones is that they handle larger variance in data points more efficiently, leading to improved performance in many machine learning tasks. To obtain hyperbolic embeddings, several variants of the Mercer kernel can be used, each corresponding to a specific type of dataset. 
         
        
        Fig.2: Example visualization of embedded data using hyperbolic embeddings. The shape of the dots corresponds to the distribution of data points, whereas their position indicates how close or far they are from each other. 
        
         Graph matching loss functions consist of metrics that quantify the difference between two graphs, such as the graph edit distance, Laplacian kernel-based losses, and wavelet coefficients. These metrics enable us to compare the structure and dynamics of graphs without requiring exact matches between node positions or edge connections. Moreover, the choice of graph matching loss function also affects the level of accuracy obtained by the model and requires careful tuning depending on the characteristics of the task at hand.

The blue line represents the optimal solution and the red lines show suboptimal solutions caused by noise introduced into the original graphs. The black line shows the threshold at which the optimization problem becomes computationally tractable. 

         Spectral clustering is a clustering method based on eigenvector decomposition of the normalized laplacian matrix of the graph. It clusters vertices of the graph based on their similarity within a certain radius around the cluster center. By minimizing the intra-cluster variation and maximizing inter-cluster separation, it leads to good results in practice. Procrustes analysis is a statistical technique for comparing two sets of curves, typically by aligning their shapes and dimensions. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are designed to embed high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces while preserving most of the information retained in the original data. Commonly used nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques include principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS).

         # 3.Core Algorithmic Details
         ## Graph Matching Losses
         ### Local Sinkhorn Algorithm
         The local sinkhorn algorithm (LSA) is one of the fundamental tools used in graph matching loss functions. It operates on a pair of graphs G1 and G2 and computes the transportation plan P that aligns their nodes closely according to the given cost matrix C. Mathematically, the transportation plan satisfies the following constraints:
        
         $$P_{i,j}=p_{ij}+\epsilon \delta(c_{i,j}-p_{i,j})$$
        
         $$\sum_{j\in J_{i}}\frac{p_{i,j}}{\epsilon}=\delta(\mu_1-\lambda_i)$$
        
         $$\sum_{i\in I_{j}}\frac{p_{i,j}}{\epsilon}=\delta(\mu_2-\lambda_j)$$
        
         Where $I_i$ and $J_j$ denote the set of incoming and outgoing neighbors of node i and j respectively, $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, $\lambda_i$, and $\lambda_j$ are the vector parameters of flow conservation laws, $\epsilon$ is the entropy regularizer parameter, and $p_{ij}$ is the probability of moving a single edge from vertex i to vertex j. The LSA algorithm iteratively updates the transportation plan until convergence or a specified maximum number of iterations is reached. The iteration procedure for solving the above constraints uses a block coordinate descent algorithm that alternates between updating the transportation values and adjusting the vectors of flow conservation laws.  
         
         ### Adjacency Consistency Regularization
         Another important tool in graph matching is adjacency consistency regularization (ACR). ACR aims to minimize the differences between the topological properties of the matched pairs of graphs. Specifically, it imposes constraints on the predicted matchings that enforce their degree sequence to match those of the reference graphs. The idea behind ACR comes from the observation that the connectivity structure of graphs can affect their matching quality. While simple graph edit distance measures may not reflect the structural similarity between connected components in multi-graph problems, ACR guarantees that the learned mappings retain the topological structure of the reference graphs, ensuring faithfulness in subsequent prediction tasks.

         ### Hungarian Method
         The hungarian method is another popular approach for finding minimum weight perfect matchings in bipartite graphs. Given two matrices X and Y, it finds a permutation p of rows of X and columns of Y such that the sum of absolute differences between elements of X and Y along any row and column is minimal. Similarity scores between the elements of the two matrices are calculated using various distance metrics, such as squared error or cosine similarity. The algorithm works well for small to medium sized matrices and scales linearly with respect to the size of the matrices.  
         
        
        Fig.6: Illustration of the hungarian method for computing minimum weight perfect matchings in bipartite graphs. In this example, there are three unmatched rows in the left matrix and four unmatched columns in the right matrix. Each element in the matrix is assigned a score based on the chosen metric, such as squared error or cosine similarity. The optimal matching has two rows (blue) and three columns (orange) that result in the smallest sum of absolute differences across all pairs of elements.  

        ## Graph Neural Networks 
        Graph neural networks (GNNs) are recently emerging as a promising technique for representing and predicting on large-scale graphs. They leverage the power of deep neural networks to automatically extract abstract representations of nodes and edges from the graph structure. Popular GNN architectures include Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Transformers. GCN exploits the neighborhood context of each node to update its hidden state, while GAT incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on informative parts of the graph. Transformers use sequential modeling techniques to encode long sequences of tokens, enabling them to exploit temporal dependencies in time series data.  
         
        
        Fig.7: Overview of popular graph neural network architectures, illustrating their strengths and weaknesses in handling large-scale graphs. The color coding scheme identifies different levels of abstraction of the graph, starting from global views to fine-grained node-level interpretations. GNNs tend to perform well in a wide range of tasks related to graph processing, such as link prediction, sentiment analysis, and node classification.  


        ## Clustering Algorithms
        There exist several clustering algorithms for graph data, including k-means, spectral clustering, and agglomerative clustering. K-means is a popular non-parametric clustering algorithm that assigns observations to clusters based on their proximity to the centroids of existing clusters. It starts with randomly initialized centroids and repeatedly moves them towards the mean of their respective clusters until convergence or a fixed number of iterations is reached. However, k-means does not work well for graphs because the intrinsic geometry of graphs makes it difficult to assign nodes to appropriate clusters, especially if the density of the graph is high. 

        On the other hand, spectral clustering relies on eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, which naturally captures the topology and geometry of the data. The idea is to partition the eigenvectors of the graph into a few highly overlapping groups of nodes, where each group corresponds to a cluster. Weights associated with the eigenvectors are interpreted as probabilities of membership in the corresponding clusters. Spectral clustering can handle very large graphs effectively, but it assumes that the graph is well-connected and sparse enough so that it can be decomposed into smaller pieces using SVD. Overall, spectral clustering may produce less accurate results than k-means for some types of data.   

         
        
        Fig.8: Overview of popular clustering algorithms, demonstrating their ability to discover clusters in different types of data. The shaded regions highlight key aspects of the algorithm, such as the initialization step and the stopping condition. K-means generally performs well in cases where the clusters are roughly evenly sized, whereas agglomerative clustering often produces much coarser clusters with fewer members.  

        ## Visualization Tools  
        There are numerous visualization tools available for analyzing graph data, including Gephi, Cytoscape, and Networkx, which allow users to create customizable visualizations. Most of these tools offer built-in functionalities for graph layout and labelling, allowing users to quickly identify interesting patterns and trends in the data. Other tools, such as Google Maps and Gephi, provide specialized interfaces for displaying geospatial or biomedical data on top of maps, providing additional contextual information about the spatial relationships between entities.
