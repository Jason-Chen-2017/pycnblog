Augmented reality(增强现实) is the technology that combines digital and real-world objects into a single immersive experience with computer generated images or video feed. It enables users to interact with the virtual environment using their senses such as touch, sound, and vision. In this article, we will be building an augmented reality mobile application for iOS/Android devices using Unity engine which allows us to view different objects in our surroundings on top of a live camera feed. This will allow our user to get a better understanding of how various objects interact within a real-world scenario while also exploring new objects around them. Let's dive deep into it!<|im_sep|>
This article assumes basic knowledge of programming, object oriented programming, C#, game development fundamentals (such as scenes, scripts, prefabs), and unity basics such as importing assets, creating materials, setting up lighting, and optimizing performance. If you need more guidance on these topics, please refer to other resources available online.

## 2.1 What Is Augmented Reality?
Augmented reality(AR) is a type of mixed reality that blends the physical world with digital information by placing digital content overlaid on top of real-world objects. AR applications use sensors to capture real-time data about the environment surrounding the device, allowing developers to place virtual objects anywhere, any time they want. The goal of an AR app is to create an immersive and interactive experience that engages the user and provides valuable insights into their everyday lives.

For example, Amazon's Fire TV launch featured a feature called "Amazon Lights Out", which allowed users to turn off their lights without having to leave the home. Similarly, Google presented its Daydream viewer, which uses smartphone-based cameras to provide a live video feed overlayed with 3D graphics of virtual objects placed throughout your daily activities. 

In the past few years, AR has become increasingly popular among businesses, educational institutions, and gaming industries due to its potential to transform the way people interact with complex systems and processes. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Oculus VR, Sony PSVR, and Microsoft HoloLens are rising quickly because of their ability to offer incredible experiences to end-users.

The technical challenges involved in developing AR apps have been accelerating since the introduction of high-end phones and programmable graphics processing units (GPUs). The increased demand for fast and responsive applications coupled with the limited computing power of many older devices have put AR apps at risk of being rendered obsolete before reaching mainstream status.

Overall, AR has the potential to revolutionize the way humans interact with the world around us. However, there is still much work ahead to enable widespread adoption across all categories of users including developers, designers, marketing teams, and researchers alike.

## 2.2 Fundamental Techniques For Building An AR App
There are several fundamental techniques required for building an AR app:

1. Tracking - Identifying and tracking the position and orientation of the device in space
2. Perception - Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the user's environment through sensor data
3. Modeling - Creating a detailed model of the real-world environment using 3D modeling tools
4. Rendering - Presenting accurate and detailed imagery to the user via displays, projectors, or head mounted displays
5. Interaction - Allowing users to interact with virtual objects using gestures, voice commands, or hand controls
6. Emerging Technologies - Utilizing emerging technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analysis to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the system.

Each technique requires specialized hardware and software components, making it challenging to implement AR applications across multiple platforms and devices. Additionally, each technique involves a range of algorithms and mathematical models that require expertise in applied mathematics and computational science.

However, despite these challenges, AR continues to grow rapidly and is poised to become one of the most significant trends in mobile and social media interaction. Many companies are already investing in developing advanced AR solutions to deliver compelling augmented reality experiences to their customers.
