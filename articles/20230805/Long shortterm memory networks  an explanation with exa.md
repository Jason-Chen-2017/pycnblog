 Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network that can handle long sequences and maintain the contextual information for better predictions over time. In this article we will explore LSTM in detail and implement it using Keras library in Python programming language to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews data set. We will also compare its performance with other popular neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs) and Recursive Neural Networks(RNNLs).
          Before diving into details, let's start with understanding what Sentiment Analysis means? Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the attitude, emotional sentiment, or overall evaluation expresses by a speaker, writer, or other communicator in a piece of written language, audio, or video content.
          # 2.LSTM basics
           As mentioned earlier, LSTMs are designed to solve problems related to sequential data. Sequential data refers to any collection of data items where each item is dependent on previous items in the sequence. Common examples include weather reports, financial transactions records, stock prices, speech recordings, machine logs, and so on. These kinds of data require sophisticated models that can capture the temporal dependencies between events happening at different points in time. For instance, when predicting the stock price tomorrow based on today's opening price, our model should be able to understand that the future value of a share is likely to depend on the past behavior of investors, market trends, news, social media posts, company announcements, and so on.

           There are several types of RNNs available: SimpleRNN, GRU, and LSTM. Here, we'll focus on LSTM specifically because they are more powerful than simple RNNs while still maintaining some of their simplicity. But before going deeper into how LSTM works, let us first look at the structure of an RNN cell.

          ## Structure of an RNN Cell
           An RNN cell takes in a vector of inputs $x_t$ at timestep $t$, passes it through a transformation layer ($    anh$ activation function here), and then combines it with the output from the previous time step $(h_{t-1})$ to produce the new state $h_t$. This process happens repeatedly for each input in the sequence until the end of the sequence is reached. At each point in time, the state $h_t$ contains information about all the inputs seen up to that point, allowing for dynamic representations to be learned over time. 

          ### How does an LSTM differ from a standard RNN cell?
          One major difference between LSTM and standard RNN cells is in their memory unit. A standard RNN cell uses a single scalar value to represent the current state of the network, which captures only the last input received. On the other hand, an LSTM has three values to store a multi-dimensional representation of the internal state, called the cell state. Each of these components has separate gates that control the flow of information into or out of them.

          Another significant change is in the way information flows through the LSTM cells. Standard RNN cells pass the output of one time step directly to the next, but LSTM cells have a feedback loop that allows information to propagate backwards and forwards across multiple time steps. This enables the LSTM to learn long-term dependencies in the sequence, as well as regulate the flow of information between different parts of the network.

          Finally, although traditional RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem due to the repeated multiplication of weights during backpropagation, LSTMs address this issue by introducing a mechanism called "gating". Gating allows the LSTM to selectively block or allow certain gradients to be passed along, leading to improved training performance and reduced memory usage.

          Now that you know the basic idea behind LSTM architecture, let's move onto implementing an LSTM network using Keras library to perform sentiment analysis on movie review data set.
