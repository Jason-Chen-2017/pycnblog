# 1.简介
         
 Logistic Regression is a popular classification algorithm used for binary classification problems such as predicting whether an email is spam or not (positive/negative) based on its features like sender’s address, subject line and content of the mail. In this article we will explore logistic regression using Python scikit-learn library. 

         # 2. Background Introduction

         ## Types of Classification Problems

         Binary classification: The problem of distinguishing between two mutually exclusive classes of objects, typically labeled "positive" and "negative". One example of a binary classification problem would be classifying emails into spam vs non-spam.

         Multi-class classification: The problem of classifying objects into one of several possible classes, where each object can belong to only one class. For instance, in image recognition applications, the goal could be to classify images into categories like animals, vehicles, etc.

         Multilabel classification: The problem of assigning multiple labels to an object. An example application might be labeling a photograph with different attributes like landscapes, cityscapes, people, and buildings.

      
         ## Why Use Logistic Regression?

        ### Advantages

         * Simple to understand and explain: Logistic Regression is easy to interpret, requires minimal prior knowledge about data and makes predictions using linear coefficients rather than curves or splines. This makes it easier for beginners to learn and use.

         * No assumptions about distribution: Unlike other types of models, Logistic Regression does not assume that dependent variables follow any specific probability distribution. It works well with both categorical and continuous dependent variables.

         * Easy to implement: Logistic Regression can be implemented efficiently using various optimization algorithms available in modern libraries such as Scikit-Learn.
         
        ### Disadvantages

         * Can't handle missing values or outliers: Because Logistic Regression uses maximum likelihood estimation, it cannot handle missing values or outliers well. Therefore, it may underperform compared to more advanced models when dealing with large datasets containing many missing or noisy observations.

         * Sensitive to feature scaling: Features must be scaled to zero mean and have unit variance before applying the model. If they are not scaled properly, the model performance may degrade significantly.

    
     # 3. Core Algorithm and Mathematical Formulation
     
    ## Introduction
    
    Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. It is a type of supervised learning technique which belongs to the category of linear models because it assumes that the relationship between the independent variable(s) X and the dependent variable y is linear. 
    
    Linear Regression helps us find the relationship between a single independent variable x and a single dependent variable y by fitting a straight line through the data points. Whereas, Logistic Regression fits a curve called sigmoid function between the predicted value y_pred and the actual outcome y. It is also known as logit function since it represents the logarithm of the odds ratio.

    We will now discuss how the sigmoid function works and how it relates to Logistic Regression.


    ## Sigmoid Function 

    
    The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that takes any real number and maps it into a value between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function always outputs values between 0 and 1 even if the input lies outside the range of (-inf, inf). The formula for sigmoid function is given below:

    $sigmoid(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

    Here's why it works:

    1. As x tends towards positive infinity, the sigmoid approaches 1.
    2. As x tends towards negative infinity, the sigmoid approaches 0.
    3. For all intermediate inputs x, the sigmoid function stays between 0 and 1.
    4. At the point when x=0, the sigmoid is exactly equal to 0.5.
    
Now let's see how this relates to Logistic Regression.


## Logistic Regression Model 

### Hypothesis Representation 
The hypothesis representation for logistic regression looks like:
$h_    heta(X) = g(    heta^T. X)$, where $    heta$ is the parameter vector and $g()$ is the sigmoid function.

Here, hθ(X) refers to the estimated probability that Y = 1 on input X, computed using the dot product of the parameters θ and the input features X. Note that hθ(X) ranges from 0 to 1. When Y = 1, hθ(X) is close to 1; when Y = 0, hθ(X) is close to 0.

In general, the larger the output of the sigmoid function (i.e., closer to 1), the greater the confidence that the corresponding X belongs to class 1 (Y = 1). Conversely, the smaller the output of the sigmoid function (i.e., closer to 0), the greater the confidence that the corresponding X belongs to class 0 (Y = 0).
