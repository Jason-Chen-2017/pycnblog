# Abstract 
In this paper, we will discuss how to develop an effective text summarization tool with Python and deep learning techniques. We will begin by introducing the concept of text summarization and some fundamental terms in NLP such as bag-of-words model and word embeddings. Then, we will describe three popular text summarization methods - greedy algorithms, graph-based models, and neural networks - and their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we will discuss different types of deep learning architectures for implementing text summarization functions using Python libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and NLTK. Finally, we will demonstrate our approach by applying these methods on real-world data sets and summarize news articles into brief texts suitable for news consumption.

# Introduction 
Natural language processing (NLP) is widely used for various applications from text classification, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and search engine optimization (SEO). However, most existing text summarization tools are rule-based or heuristic approaches, which produce suboptimal results due to the limited contextual information provided by raw text. In recent years, researchers have proposed several machine learning based approaches for generating highly informative summaries that capture important aspects of the original text while being concise and meaningful. These techniques can be broadly classified into two categories - extractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization involves identifying key phrases and sentences from the original text while abstract summarization generates new ideas or concepts based on the identified topics. Nonetheless, both techniques suffer from issues related to lexical diversity, semantic coherence, and naturalness. 

As mentioned earlier, there are numerous challenges involved in developing an effective text summarization tool. The first challenge is the selection of appropriate algorithmic technique, which determines the output quality, speed, and accuracy. There are mainly two classes of algorithms - linear programming techniques and graph-based models. Linear programming techniques involve optimizing a cost function subject to certain constraints and mathematical expressions. On the other hand, graph-based models use graphs to represent relationships between words, sentences, and concepts, allowing them to identify the salient features within the document that contribute towards its summary. While these models provide high precision at the expense of slower computation time compared to linear programming techniques, they also offer better interpretability and flexibility. Among the graph-based models, the Most Significant Vertex Set (MVS) algorithm has been proven to be quite effective in summarizing text. 

The second challenge is the choice of deep learning architecture, which provides significant advantages over traditional ML algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Despite their effectiveness, CNNs require extensive preprocessing steps that may result in loss of useful information from the input text. RNNs and LSTM networks, on the other hand, require more complex structures than MVS and cannot handle variable length inputs well. Furthermore, training deep learning models requires large amounts of labeled data, making it challenging to obtain even small amounts of labeled text data for training purposes.  

To address these challenges, we propose a novel solution using Python programming language and deep learning techniques. This approach is outlined below along with detailed explanation about each step.
