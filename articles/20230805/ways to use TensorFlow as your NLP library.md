# 1.简介
         
5 years ago Google launched its new machine learning framework Tensorflow for both research and production applications. The framework has become the most widely used deep learning tool available today. In this article, we will explore how you can leverage tensorflow for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text classification, etc. We will also go through some of the core concepts in machine learning along with practical examples using python programming language.

         Machine learning is a powerful technique that allows us to build complex models based on large datasets to perform various prediction tasks. Deep neural networks are particularly well-suited for solving complex problems in natural language processing because they have been shown to be effective at capturing high level semantics from raw text data. However, it's important to note that there are many other types of machine learning algorithms that can solve similar tasks. Nonetheless, if you're looking for an easy-to-use solution for building NLP systems, then tensorflow may provide you with more than enough flexibility and power. 

         This article assumes that you already have a basic understanding of tensor manipulation and linear algebra. If not, please refer to these resources before proceeding:

         # 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
         ## 2.1 Linear Algebra Review
         Before diving into Natural Language Processing, we need to review some of the fundamental concepts and terminology related to linear algebra.
         1. Vectors: A vector is a set of values associated with a specific dimension or attribute. They represent a quantity that changes over time or space, like position, speed, temperature, etc., represented by different variables. For example, a two dimensional vector could represent the direction of motion or velocity of a particle. Each component of a vector represents one of those variables, while the vector itself represents all the components collectively. Mathematically, vectors are denoted using bold lower case letters, e.g., $\vec{v}$. 
         2. Matrices: A matrix is a collection of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It provides a way to organize and manipulate multidimensional arrays of data. To define a $m     imes n$ matrix $A$, each element of $A$ is denoted by $A_{ij}$, where $i$ and $j$ are integers between 1 and m and n respectively. Some commonly used matrices include identity matrices, which are square matrices with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere; and zero matrices, which are square matrices full of zeros. MATLAB uses capital letters to denote matrices, whereas Python typically uses lowercase letters. Examples of common matrices include the transition probability matrix P(t), where t refers to a particular state and i and j correspond to possible states, and the covariance matrix C, where each row corresponds to a variable and each column corresponds to another variable. 
         3. Operations: There are several operations that can be performed on vectors and matrices. These include addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, transpose, determinant, and inverse. Addition adds corresponding elements from two vectors or matrices together, while subtraction subtracts them. Scalar multiplication multiplies every element of a vector by a constant factor, while dot product returns the sum of products of corresponding elements in two vectors. Transposition reverses the order of rows and columns in a matrix. Determinants calculate the volume of a 3D object given its 3D coordinates. Finally, inverting a matrix calculates the matrix that "undoes" the effect of the original matrix. 
         ## 2.2 Neural Networks
         Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons. Each neuron receives input signals, performs some mathematical calculations on the inputs, and produces output signals that are passed to downstream neurons. Multiple layers of neurons are stacked to form a network, and connections among neurons allow information to flow easily between layers. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (rectified linear unit), softmax, and TanH. A dropout layer randomly drops out units during training to prevent overfitting. The architecture of a neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. The size of the hidden layers determines the complexity of the model and the number of parameters in the network. 
         ## 2.3 Word Embeddings
         Word embeddings are dense representations of words in a continuous vector space. They capture semantic relationships between words and help to learn the context of words. One popular approach is called GloVe, which stands for global vector for word representation. It learns vectors for words by considering their co-occurrence statistics within a corpus. Another approach is called Word2Vec, which trains vectors for words by predicting the surrounding words in a sentence. Both approaches create embeddings that reflect the meaning of words in the same manner. 

         When working with NLP tasks, we often want to map sequences of tokens to vectors. For instance, we might want to convert sentences or documents to numerical vectors so that we can feed them to a machine learning model for further processing or analysis. To do this, we first need to represent each token as a numeric value. One straightforward method is to assign a unique integer ID to each word, but this would result in a very sparse and unstructured vector space. An alternative approach is to use pre-trained word embeddings that have been trained on large corpora of texts and are capable of representing meaningful semantic relationships between words.

         
         

         # 3. Sentiment Analysis Using CNNs
         ## Introduction
            Sentiment analysis is a challenging task in natural language processing where we try to determine whether a piece of text expresses positive, negative, or neutral opinion towards a certain topic. In this tutorial, we will cover a simple approach to sentiment analysis using convolutional neural networks (CNN).  

            Convolutional neural networks are great for image processing tasks due to their ability to extract features efficiently from pixel intensities across a grid of filters. Similarly, we can apply convolutional filters to sequential data to obtain features that characterize the overall behavior of the sequence. For example, we can design filters that look for patterns in short windows of text to identify sentiment polarity. By combining multiple filter outputs, we can create a unified representation of the entire sequence. 

            In this tutorial, we will start by loading a dataset containing movie reviews and labels indicating their corresponding sentiment. Then, we will preprocess the data by converting the text to lowercase and removing stopwords. Next, we will encode the target classes as binary values using one-hot encoding. Afterwards, we will split the dataset into train, validation, and test sets. We will then implement our own version of a CNN using Keras, followed by testing its performance on the held-out test set. We will evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure its effectiveness in detecting sentiment polarity.

        ## Step 1: Import Required Libraries
        Let's begin by importing necessary libraries. The `tensorflow` module contains tools for building neural networks, including modules for handling text data via the keras API. We'll also import pandas and numpy for data preprocessing and visualization, respectively.
