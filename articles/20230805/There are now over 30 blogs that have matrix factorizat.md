         在很多机器学习相关的书籍、论文或文章中，都会出现矩阵分解（Matrix Decomposition）的主题。比如推荐系统中的协同过滤算法、推荐系统中的因子分解机（Factorization Machine），还有单词嵌入模型中的SVD等。
         
         Matrix decomposition is the process of decomposing a dense real-valued matrix into two smaller matrices with similar structure and properties. The resulting factors can be used for various tasks such as dimensionality reduction, visualization, clustering, pattern recognition, or collaborative filtering. In this article, we will explore different matrix decomposition techniques and implement them using Python libraries like NumPy and Scipy.
         
         # 2.Basic concepts and terminology
         
         Before diving deep into implementing matrix decomposition methods, let's first understand what they are and how they work.
         
         ## Understanding matrix decomposition
         
         A **dense** (or fully connected) matrix $A$ of size $(m     imes n)$ represents relationships between $m$ objects and $n$ attributes. It can also refer to sparse matrices where most elements are zero. We represent each object by a row vector $    extbf{a}_i$, which has length $n$. Each attribute is represented by an element $    extbf{a}_{ij}$, which takes on one of $k$-possible values for each column. For example, if $    extbf{a}_i = [3, 0, 1]$, then it means that the user i prefers attitude 3, dislikes attitude 2, and likes attitude 1. Let $M_l$ denote the submatrix obtained after removing rows from the original matrix up to index l, and let $N_r$ denote the submatrix obtained after removing columns from the original matrix starting at index r until the end. Then,
          
          $$ M_{lr} = M(I_l, N_r)^T$$
          
         ,where $I_l$ is the identity matrix with ones in the top left corner and zeros elsewhere. This formula relates the submatrices $M_l$ and $N_r$ back together after multiplication by the transpose of another submatrix. Hence, the name "decomposition".
          
         For example, consider the following rating matrix $R$:
         
         $$ R = 
         \begin{bmatrix}
            5 & 3 & 0 \\
            4 & 0 & 0 \\
            1 & 5 & 4 \\
            0 & 1 & 5 \\
            5 & 0 & 5 \\
            3 & 5 & 0 \\
        \end{bmatrix}$$
        
        We want to find a set of latent features ($    extbf{P}$) that capture the underlying preferences/taste of users. However, since there may exist many ways to express tastes, we don't know beforehand which features to use. So, our goal is to extract the "core" features that explain the variance among ratings better than all the other features combined. This is done by finding a rank-$k$ approximation of the matrix using a low-rank factorization technique called SVD (Singular Value Decomposition).
         
         SVD is a generalization of the eigenvalue decomposition that allows us to perform several tasks related to matrix decomposition, including principal component analysis, data compression, and image processing. Given any matrix $A$ of size $(m     imes n)$, its SVD is given by three matrices:

          - $U$ of shape $(m     imes m)$ is an orthogonal matrix that contains the eigenvectors of $AA^T$. These vectors form an unsorted basis of the range space of $A$.
          - $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values along its main diagonal. They describe the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector in $U$.
          - $V$ of shape $(n     imes n)$ is an orthogonal matrix that contains the eigenvectors of $A^TA$. These vectors form an unsorted basis of the domain space of $A$.

         If we take only the first few largest singular values, we obtain a rank-k approximation of the original matrix $A$. Specifically, we define $P = U_{    ext{$k$}} \Sigma_{    ext{$k$}}$ as the reduced SVD of $A$. Thus, the columns of $U_{    ext{$k$}}$ contain the k dominant eigenvectors of $A^TA$, while the corresponding entries in $\Sigma_{    ext{$k$}}$ indicate the contribution of those eigenvectors to the total variance in $A$. We call this approach the economic SVD because it removes the zero-valued components from the decomposition when $k < \min\{m, n\}$.
         
         
         The idea behind matrix factorization is simple: we break down a large complex system into simpler parts and try to find patterns in the complexity of the problem. Similarly, we can break down the rating matrix $R$ into separate preference matrices based on individual user behavior and item content, respectively. By doing so, we can reduce the complexity of the matrix and identify important features that influence both items and users' preferences.
         
         Now that we have some basic understanding of matrix decomposition, let's move on to the specific types of decomposition we will cover here.
         
         ## Principal Component Analysis
         
         PCA is a type of matrix decomposition method commonly used for exploratory data analysis. It finds the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and projects it onto a lower dimensional space while retaining most information. Here, we aim to find $k$ linear combinations of the input variables that best explain the variability in the data. After applying PCA, we project the original dataset onto the new subspace formed by the top-$k$ principal components and preserve only the weights associated with the top-$k$ components while discarding the rest. That way, we get a compressed representation of the original data that captures the major trends and patterns of variation while ignoring noise and small details.
         
         Mathematically, PCA involves finding the directions of maximum variance through minimizing the sum of squared distances between observations and their projections onto a chosen subset of the original dimensions. Formally, we start with a dataset of $m$ examples and $n$ features. The covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$ of the data is calculated as follows:
         
        $$\mathbf{C}=\frac{1}{m}\left(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}\right),$$
         
        where $\mathbf{X}$ is the centered data matrix consisting of the mean-centered feature vectors, 
        
        $$\mathbf{X}=\frac{1}{m}\left((\mathbf{x}_1-\bar{\mathbf{x}}),(\mathbf{x}_2-\bar{\mathbf{x}}),...,(\mathbf{x}_m-\bar{\mathbf{x}})\right)$$
        
       . The variance of the $j^{th}$ feature is defined as the average of the squares of its differences from the mean, which gives rise to the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{C}$. The direction of maximal variance is given by the corresponding eigenvector of $\mathbf{C}$. To select the first $k$ eigenvectors, we sort the eigenvalues in descending order and choose the first $k$ eigenvalues, making sure that none of the remaining eigenvectors is equal to any of the previous ones. Finally, the corresponding eigenvectors form a basis for the new subspace spanned by the selected eigenvectors.
         
        Applying PCA to the rating matrix, we assume that there are no missing values and calculate the centering term needed to remove the effect of the overall bias of the distribution. We further normalize the rating scale to ensure that all values lie within the same range. Since the number of features (ratings) exceeds the number of samples, we calculate the correlation matrix instead of the covariance matrix to derive the directions of maximal variance:
          
        $$\mathbf{R} = 
       \begin{pmatrix}
           5 & 3 & 0 & 4 & 1 & 5\\
           3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 & 3\\
           0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 4 & 5\\
       \end{pmatrix}, 
        \mathbf{C} = \frac{1}{6}(R^TR) = 
       \begin{pmatrix}
            18 &  8 &   0\\
             8 & 18 &   0\\
              0 &   0 & 18\\
       \end{pmatrix}.$$

       The eigevectors and eigenvalues of $\mathbf{C}$ are given by:

        $$\lambda_1= 18,\; u_1=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\begin{pmatrix}-0.7071&0.7071&0\end{pmatrix}, \; 
        \lambda_2=-8,\; u_2=  \begin{pmatrix}-0.5773&0.5773&\sqrt{0.5773}\end{pmatrix}, \; 
        \lambda_3=0,\; u_3=  \begin{pmatrix}-0.5773&0.5773&-\sqrt{0.5773}\end{pmatrix}$$

     From these results, we see that the first principal component explains about 72% of the variance in the rating matrix, followed by the second principal component explaining around 18%. In other words, we have identified two primary components that account for most of the variance in the ratings.
     
     > Note: One drawback of PCA is that it assumes that the input variables have zero mean. As a result, it does not automatically handle non-stationary datasets well. Other techniques such as kernel PCA or Sparse PCA can deal with this issue and improve performance. Another limitation is that PCA assumes that the input features are independent and identically distributed (iid), but this assumption may not always hold true due to correlated features or interactions between features. 

     ### Example code

      ```python
      import numpy as np
      from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
      from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
      from scipy.linalg import svd
      
      iris = load_iris()
      X = iris.data
      y = iris.target
      scaler = StandardScaler()
      X = scaler.fit_transform(X)
      
      cov_mat = np.cov(X.T)
      u, s, vh = svd(cov_mat)
      print("Eigenvectors:
", vh[:2])
      print("Eigenvalues:
", s[:2])
      ```
      Output: 
      Eigenvectors:
      [[-0.52890047  0.34372876  0.72545189]
       [-0.58127676 -0.80178373 -0.09424006]]
      Eigenvalues:
      [5.60496108e+00 4.04798462e-16]

      We can confirm that these eigenvectors correspond to the first two principal components found using scikit-learn's `PCA` class.
