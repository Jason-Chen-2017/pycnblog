Healthcare systems are essential to modern societies and have been a major driver for economic growth over the past decades. As such, it is crucial that healthcare systems are well-designed and functioning properly in order to maintain their integrity and provide timely and accurate medical care to patients. Within this paper, we present an extensive systematic review on characteristics of successful large-scale healthcare systems, including their design approach, infrastructure design, technology usage, data management, decision making processes, and other aspects related to improving quality of life and reducing costs. We aim at identifying key factors influencing these characteristics across various healthcare domains, emphasizing how cross-domain learning can enhance effective interventions across different areas, and identify research gaps in various fields where improvements are needed. Our findings could inform the development of new technologies or methodologies designed to optimize performance and efficiency within existing systems. Overall, our work may provide insights into the potential challenges, barriers, and opportunities in developing more efficient and effective healthcare systems in the future.

We begin by providing some background knowledge and concepts relating to healthcare systems as they relate to modern societies. Some key definitions include:

1. Medical care: The provision of healthcare services to individuals who need them, based on the individual's medical condition and their needs.

2. Hospital: A place where people with serious illnesses are admitted and treated, allowing specialists to diagnose, treat, and recover from those diseases.

3. Emergency department: An area within hospitals dedicated to quickly addressing emergency situations when a patient cannot be easily reached.

4. Pharmacy: A retail establishment that sells medications to individuals, often through prescription.

5. Patient safety: Ensuring that patients do not receive harmful or unsanitary products or experience unsafe working conditions.

6. Quality of care: The degree of satisfaction one receives during treatment and recovery from illness. It is important to ensure that all medical professionals deliver high-quality care.

7. Costs: The amount of money spent on maintaining and operating a healthcare system, both monetary and non-monetary resources. These include personnel, supplies, equipment, etc.

8. Insurance coverage: The financial protection provided to individuals who rely upon healthcare services. This includes health insurance, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance.

Some key issues addressed by healthcare organizations today are:

1. Lack of access to high-quality medical care: Patients who require high-quality medical care face significant difficulties obtaining it due to limited availability of physicians, specialized clinics, and pharmacies.

2. Difficulties accessing information: Many patients find it challenging to obtain necessary information about their medical condition, procedures, and symptoms online. Even after finding the right website, there is still a barrier to understanding what specific procedures should be followed or what diagnosis to seek help for.

3. Limited use of diagnostic tests: Most healthcare organizations offer limited use of diagnostic tests, focusing instead on routine screenings and imaging studies. While these measures improve patient outcomes, they also limit the diversity of testing and associated therapeutic options available to patients.

4. Lack of universal prevention programs: To effectively prevent disease, many healthcare organizations are investing in universal preventive programs that target common causes of disease rather than targeted prevention strategies for individual cases.

5. Lack of evidence-based approaches: Innovative approaches to treating disease often involve multiple techniques simultaneously, each contributing individually to improved outcomes. However, current practice guidelines rarely consider these synergistic effects, leaving consumers to make judgements on their own regarding which combination of methods works best.

Overall, the complexity of modern healthcare systems poses several challenges, ranging from technical to social. Understanding the characteristics of successful large-scale healthcare systems will allow us to develop better solutions that meet the diverse needs of patients while minimizing costs and risks.
