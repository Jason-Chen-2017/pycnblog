This article discusses the key decisions and considerations when choosing a database for an Internet of Things (IoT) solution that involves processing large volumes of data from multiple devices and applications. The following topics are covered in this article:

1. Introduction to IoT
2. Data Analytics Platforms for IoT Solutions
3. Requirements for IoT Applications with High Volumes of Data
4. Choosing the right database for high-volume IoT solutions

The main objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive guide on selecting the best database technology for a high-volume IoT platform architecture using industry standards such as MQTT protocol or RESTful APIs to communicate between devices and cloud platforms. This will help you choose the most appropriate database based on your specific requirements, performance needs, scalability, features, and compatibility with other systems involved in your project. 

We assume that you have basic knowledge about databases, their characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, pros and cons, and how they can be used for various types of application scenarios. If not, please read some good resources online before starting this journey.

In summary, this article aims to guide readers through the process of selecting the right database for their IoT platform architecture. It also provides clear guidance on how to approach this decision making process by understanding the current trends in IoT development and analyzing the different options available in the market today.

Overall, our goal is to make IoT developers' lives easier by providing them with practical guidelines on which database technology should be chosen for a particular scenario, rather than being overwhelmed by many choices. By following these principles and strategies, we believe that IoT projects will become more successful and sustainable while reducing risks and costs associated with traditional IT infrastructure.

Let's get started!
# 2.Introduction to IoT
Internet of Things (IoT) refers to any device or system connected to the internet capable of transmitting and/or receiving data or information via wireless technologies. These devices range from small sensors like motion detectors, temperature monitors, humidity meters, etc., up to large smart home appliances like washing machines, refrigerators, lighting fixtures, etc. In simpler terms, it refers to the ability to connect anything anywhere and make it interact seamlessly with the rest of the world around us. One of the major challenges faced by businesses and organizations working with IoT is how to manage and analyze massive amounts of data generated by these devices, especially if they need to support real-time analytics and automated decision-making across disparate sources of data. 

Data volume has grown exponentially in recent years due to the increased use of IoT devices and the rise of new business models built upon this technology. As a result, there has been a tremendous increase in interest and demand for efficient and cost-effective ways of storing, managing, and analyzing this type of data. Among several factors affecting the choice of database for an IoT solution, two dominant approaches are: 

1. Cloud-based storage - Most IoT companies rely heavily on cloud-based storage solutions for managing large volumes of data since they offer scalability, security, and flexibility without needing to purchase dedicated servers. However, cloud-based storage does come with its own set of limitations including reduced performance, high latency, and limited functionality compared to on-premises solutions.

2. On-premises storage - Companies that opt for on-premises storage usually either deploy their own Hadoop clusters or rent virtual private clouds (VPCs) to host their Big Data ecosystem. Within the VPC, the company typically deploys a variety of distributed file systems (HDFS), message brokers, and databases to handle the increasingly complex workload required by IoT applications.

As the majority of IoT companies now rely more on cloud-based storage solutions, let's dive deeper into what makes each one unique and compares their strengths and weaknesses. We'll look at common characteristics and considerations that govern the selection of each database.
