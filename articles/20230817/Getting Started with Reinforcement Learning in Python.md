Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning approach that involves an agent interacting with an environment to learn how to optimize its behavior over time. In this article, we will introduce the basic concepts and terms of RL using the popular open-source library called OpenAI Gym. We'll then use the simplest algorithm, Q-learning, to train an agent to play simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe or Flappy Bird. Finally, we'll briefly discuss some advanced algorithms and tools for reinforcement learning development, such as Deep Q Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient Methods (PGM), and A2C/A3C methods. 

This article assumes readers have some programming experience and are familiar with Python programming language. The examples presented in this article can be easily adapted for other environments or games by modifying the code. This article is not meant to provide comprehensive coverage of all the topics related to RL, but rather serve as a starting point for those who are interested in building intelligent agents. Moreover, although we cover only the basics of RL here, more advanced content will also be added in future articles.

## 2. Prerequisites and Preparation
Before jumping into the topic of RL, it's essential to understand several fundamental concepts such as Markov decision process (MDP), value function, policy, reward system, and exploratory strategy. Additionally, it's important to install and import necessary libraries before starting our project: OpenAI gym and numpy. If you haven't already installed them on your computer, please follow these steps:

1. Install Anaconda: It provides a user-friendly data science platform for individuals, researchers, and businesses. You can download and install it from https://www.anaconda.com/.

2. Create Conda Environment: Create a new conda environment named `rl` and activate it using the following commands:
```bash
conda create -n rl python=3.7 # create conda environment 'rl'
conda activate rl           # activate conda environment 'rl'
```

3. Install Libraries: Once inside the active conda environment, run the following command to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install gym[atari]   # installs the atari game environments needed for the Atari Games example
pip install tensorflow  # optional installation if you want to use TensorFlow backend instead of PyTorch
```

4. Import Libraries: Once the libraries are successfully installed, you need to import them into your Python script. Here's an example of importing OpenAI gym and NumPy:

```python
import gym          # for creating environments
import numpy as np  # for numerical operations
```

Now that we're set up and ready to go, let's dive into the fun part! Let's start by introducing some key concepts of RL.

# 2. Basic Concepts of Reinforcement Learning
## Markov Decision Process (MDP)
The MDP defines the task as well as the state space, action space, transition probabilities, discount factor, initial state distribution, terminal states, and reward structure. To illustrate, consider the Tic-Tac-Toe board game. Each position on the board has one of three possible values: empty cell, X mark, O mark. At each move, the player selects a blank square and places either an X mark or an O mark depending on whether they prefer to make the first move. After making their move, the opponent takes their turn placing marks in any available squares until someone wins or there are no more moves left. Based on the outcome, the players receive different rewards such as +1 for winning, −1 for losing, and 0 for drawing.

In general, the MDP consists of four main components: 

1. State Space: Set of all possible states observed during interaction with the environment.

2. Action Space: Set of all possible actions taken by the agent during interactions with the environment. Actions could range from moving up, down, left, right, or taking specific actions in complex environments like chess or Go.

3. Transition Probabilities: Probability of moving from one state to another given an action. For instance, if the current state is s1 and the agent performs an action a1, what is the probability of ending up in state s2? How about s3?

4. Reward System: Feedback provided to the agent based on the result of their action. Positive rewards indicate positive outcomes while negative rewards indicate negative outcomes. Zero reward means neutral outcome. For instance, after placing an X mark in the center of a Tic-Tac-Toe board, the agent would get a reward of +1 because he won the game. On the other hand, placing an O mark where it doesn't matter would yield zero reward since the game didn't end yet.

Finally, the MDP specifies two additional parameters: Discount Factor and Initial State Distribution.

## Value Function
Value functions represent the expected long-term return associated with each state in the MDP. They quantify how good it is to be in a particular state compared to all other states. Formally, the value function V(s) represents the expected sum of discounted rewards obtained after being in state s. Mathematically, we can write the value function recursively as follows:

V(s) = E[G_t|S_t=s]
where G_t denotes the total discounted reward after t time steps, S_t denotes the state reached at step t, and E[] denotes the expectation operator.

The value function depends heavily on the reward function specified in the MDP. One common way to evaluate the value function is to use Monte Carlo estimation, which samples episodes from the MDP and estimates the value function based on the returns generated during the episodes. Another method is temporal difference learning, which updates the value function based on previous updates. However, both approaches rely heavily on sample efficiency and may be slow to converge. Therefore, more efficient algorithms for estimating the value function will be discussed later in the article.

## Policy
Policies define the agent's behavior when facing different situations in the MDP. Policies specify the action that the agent should take in each state to maximize its long-term expected reward. Specifically, policies map states to actions. In simpler words, a policy determines the next best action to take in each state according to its knowledge of the value function. One of the most commonly used policies is greedy policy, which chooses the action that leads to the highest immediate reward. Other types of policies include random policy, epsilon-greedy policy, softmax policy, and REINFORCE policy.

## Exploratory Strategy
Exploratory strategies help the agent explore the environment to find better solutions than those found through pure exploitation. Exploiting the existing knowledge in the value function often results in suboptimal decisions because the agent cannot anticipate everything ahead of time. By choosing random actions instead of optimizing the value function, the agent relies on its own exploration abilities and stretches the search space even further. One common exploratory strategy is $\epsilon$-greedy, which randomly selects actions with a small probability $ε$ and chooses the optimal action otherwise.

## Summary
In summary, the key concepts of RL are Markov Decision Process, Value Function, Policy, Exploratory Strategy. These concepts govern the interaction between the agent and the environment, allowing the agent to select actions, learn from experience, and update its beliefs based on observations made by the environment.
