Data mining is an essential tool in today’s business analytics ecosystem. It helps organizations to identify valuable insights from their data sources by analyzing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as emails, customer feedback, social media posts, online transactions, and other types of structured data that are difficult to analyze manually. Companies use data mining to make more informed decisions on various aspects ranging from marketing campaigns, sales strategy, product development, customer service, fraud detection, supply chain management, healthcare analytics, and many others. 

In this primer article, we will explore the basics of data mining and its applications in big data analysis, including unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and deep learning algorithms. We also discuss the importance of feature selection and preprocessing techniques, clustering methods, and evaluation metrics used during data mining projects. Finally, we provide practical examples and tips to help you get started with data mining projects at your workplace or personal interest.

This primer article provides a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in learning about data mining technologies, whether they have basic knowledge or not. The article will be useful for both technical professionals who need to refresh their memory after spending some time working with data mining tools and analysts, and novice researchers seeking to gain insights into the field of data mining.

We hope that this article can serve as a good starting point for any undergraduate/master's student, graduate/professional, or career-switcher looking to learn more about data mining. We also hope it will inspire those already familiar with data mining to dive deeper into the subject and apply what they learned in real-world scenarios.

# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning refers to the task of identifying patterns and relationships among unlabeled data without reference to known outcomes or goals. In other words, unsupervised learning involves finding hidden patterns and structures within data without prior understanding of what we want to find. 

There are several categories of unsupervised learning techniques:

1. Cluster Analysis: Identifies groups or clusters of similar objects based on their attributes. 

2. Association Rule Learning: Finds interesting items (e.g., products) that frequently occur together, called associations. For example, if someone buys item A, they might buy item B subsequently.

3. Anomaly Detection: Detects rare occurrences or events that do not conform to expected behavior. For example, detecting credit card fraud.

4. Density Estimation: Determines the probability density function (PDF) of the input data and finds regions of high density where the underlying distribution may exist.

## 2.2 Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training machines using labeled data, which consists of inputs paired with correct outputs. The goal of supervised learning is to develop models that can accurately predict future outcomes given current observations. There are several categories of supervised learning techniques:

1. Classification: Divides the input space into discrete classes according to a specified target variable. For example, predicting whether an email is spam or ham based on text content.

2. Regression: Predicts continuous output values (e.g., stock prices).

3. Prediction: Predicts new values based on historical data without knowing the future outcomes.

## 2.3 Deep Learning
Deep learning is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that utilizes multiple layers of interconnected nodes to process complex input data. The key idea behind deep learning is to mimic how the human brain processes visual information, enabling it to learn complex features from raw data. This technology has revolutionized fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition, making it highly competitive with conventional machine learning approaches.

Here are some popular deep learning architectures:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Used for image classification tasks.
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Used for sequential data prediction problems, such as language modeling.
3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Special kind of RNN used for time series prediction tasks, particularly when there are long periods of missing data.
4. Autoencoders: Uses dimensionality reduction to encode and decode input data, allowing them to preserve important features while removing noise.

## 2.4 Feature Selection and Preprocessing Techniques
Feature selection and preprocessing techniques play a crucial role in data mining projects. They enable us to transform our raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis. Here are some common techniques:

1. Filter Methods: Selects only relevant features, discarding irrelevant ones. Commonly used filter methods include correlation analysis, mutual information, and variance thresholding.

2. Wrapper Methods: Optimizes model performance by searching over all possible combinations of features and selecting the best subset. Examples of wrapper methods include forward selection, backward elimination, and recursive feature elimination.

3. Embedded Methods: Automatically learns feature representations that capture underlying relationships between variables. Examples of embedded methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

## 2.5 Clustering Methods
Clustering methods group similar objects together based on their attributes. These methods fall into two main categories:

1. Hierarchical Clustering: Clusters objects into a hierarchy of nested subclusters, typically by measuring similarity between pairs of objects and merging clusters until certain stopping criteria are met.

2. Partitioning Methods: Forms distinct partitions of the object set, each containing objects that are similar to one another but dissimilar from members of other partitions. Common partitioning methods include K-means, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

## 2.6 Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation metrics measure the quality of predictions made by data mining models. Here are some commonly used metrics:

1. Accuracy Score: Measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.

2. Precision Score: Measures the ability of a classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative.

3. Recall Score: Measures the ability of a classifier to find all positive samples.

4. F1 Score: Combines precision and recall scores into a single metric that balances both measures.

5. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC): Represents the area under the curve of true positives vs false positives for binary classifiers.

# 3. Algorithmic Principles and Operations
## 3.1 k-Means Clustering
k-Means clustering is one of the simplest and most widely used clustering algorithms. Given a dataset of n objects, k-Means algorithm tries to cluster these objects into k different groups. Each object belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, i.e., centroid, as determined by the distance formula.

1. Step 1: Choose the value of k, the number of clusters to create.

2. Step 2: Initialize k centroids randomly. Centroids are chosen such that they minimize the sum of squared distances between each object and the corresponding centroid.

3. Step 3: Repeat steps 4-5 until convergence:

   a. Assign each object to the nearest centroid.
   
   b. Update the position of each centroid as the average position of all objects assigned to it.
   
4. Step 4: Compute the sum of squared distances between each object and its assigned centroid.

5. Step 5: If the total change in the sum of squared distances is less than a predefined tolerance level, stop; otherwise, go back to step 3.

The resulting cluster assignments and centroid locations constitute the final result of the k-Means algorithm.

## 3.2 DBSCAN
DBSCAN stands for "Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise". It is a density-based clustering algorithm that identifies dense regions of data points separated by regions of low density.

1. Step 1: Set parameters epsilon and minPts. Epsilon specifies the maximum distance between two points for them to be considered neighbors, whereas minPts specifies the minimum number of neighbors required for a core point to be identified.

2. Step 2: Start with a seed point, mark it as visited, and add it to a new cluster. Repeat until all points have been visited:

   a. Find all neighboring points within distance ε of the current point and add them to the neighbor list.
   
   b. Check if the size of the neighbor list is greater than or equal to minPts. If yes, then the current point becomes a core point, else it becomes a border point.
   
   c. Move to next unvisited point and repeat steps a-c.
   
3. Step 3: Create a cluster for each core point found in step 2. Two points belong to the same cluster if they are connected by a path of non-border points. Mark all other points as noise.

The resulting cluster assignments and noise points constitute the final result of the DBSCAN algorithm.

## 3.3 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points come from one of k multivariate normal distributions with unknown means and covariances. GMM is often used for clustering purposes, where we assume that the datapoints form clusters and try to find the optimal numbers of clusters k.

1. Step 1: Initialize k random means and covariance matrices Σi for each component i=1,...,k.

2. Step 2: While the model hasn't converged yet:

   a. Expectation step: Compute the responsibilities πjik=P(zij|xi,Σi) for all xj in cluster j. That is, compute the probability that observation xi belongs to cluster j, assuming that the true cluster assignment zij is generated by the model described by component i.

   
   b. Maximization step: Reestimate the parameters of the components by updating the means μi and covariance matrices Σi based on the weighted data. Specifically, update the weights wij and the means μi as follows:

      i. Calculate the numerator nij = P(xij|zi,μi,Σi)*P(zi|θ)=p(xi|zi)*p(zi)
      ii. Calculate the denominator wij = Σ p(xi|zi)*p(zi)
      iii. Update mu_i as the weighted average of previous means plus a fraction of the diff between old and new data divided by the sum of updated weights minus old weights

      iv. Update Sigma_i based on the following equations:

        - Sigma_i = Σ[wij*(xj-mu_i)(xj-mu_i)^T]
        - M = (1-wij)*Sigma_i + wij*N_i-1*((N_i-1)/N_i)*mu_i*mu_i^T 
        - C = N_i/(N_i-1)*(M+sigma^2_old)*((N_i+1)/(N_i))-1
        
        Where N_i denotes the effective number of points in cluster i before adding xi, sigma^2_old is the sum of squares of differences between old data points and their respective means, and gamma_1=(N_i-1)/N_i and gamma_2=(N_i+1)/N_i are scaling factors that ensure stability in cases where the numerators or denominators become very small or zero respectively.


      v. Normalize the weights so that they add up to 1.

3. Step 3: The final estimate of the parameters are the means μi and covariances Σi for each component, along with their probabilities πjik defined above. Use these estimates to assign each data point to the appropriate cluster.
