# 1.简介
  

在自然语言处理(NLP)领域，Transfer learning是一种迁移学习的技术，通过将已有的数据集（例如语料库）应用于不同的任务上，可以获得优秀的性能。它是机器学习的重要方法之一，可以帮助我们解决很多实际的问题，提升模型的泛化能力。传统上，NLP任务都需要大量的训练数据，但是也可以利用预训练词向量（pre-trained word embeddings）的方式进行迁移学习，从而取得不错的效果。本文将会详细介绍利用预训练词向量进行迁移学习的方法。
# 2.核心概念术语
## 2.1 词向量
词嵌入(word embedding)是一个词和一个固定维度的向量之间的映射关系。通常来说，词向量具有很好的语义性质，可以通过对上下文中的词语进行聚类等方式提取。

在词向量中，每个单词被表示成了一个固定维度的实向量，并且不同词之间具有相似的词向量。词向量通常基于训练文本生成，是不可微分的。因此，它们不能用于训练任务。

词向量的生成方式有两种：CBOW和Skip-gram模型。其中，CBOW是上下文窗口内目标词上下文向量的均值，Skip-gram则是目标词上下文出现过的其他单词的向量的平均值。两种模型可以看作是一种迁移学习过程，即使用大量训练数据生成全局的语义空间。

## 2.2 预训练词向量
预训练词向量是在大规模语料库上的词向量表征。一般来说，这些词向量是从非常大的语料库中训练得到的，并且已经经过充分的训练，可以提供良好的语义表达能力。这就像训练好的猫脸识别模型一样，可以在小的噪声图像上取得良好准确率。因此，我们可以直接用这些预训练的词向量作为初始化参数，来进行一些NLP任务的迁移学习。

## 2.3 Transfer Learning
迁移学习是指将已有的数据集应用到新的任务上，从而实现更好的性能。在自然语言处理领域，迁移学习一般分为两步：第一步是选择一个预训练的词向量模型，如GloVe、Word2Vec、ELMo或BERT；第二步是在此基础上进行下游任务的微调，来解决特定任务下的性能瓶颈。

# 3.Transfer Learning Using Pre-trained Word Embeddings in NLP Tasks
In this section, we will discuss how to perform transfer learning using pre-trained word embeddings for different natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition (NER). 

Firstly, let's understand the basic concepts of word embeddings and pre-trained word embeddings. Secondly, we'll see how these can be used for transfer learning in NLP tasks. Finally, we will also look at some concrete examples on how to use pre-trained word embeddings in different tasks. Let's get started!


## Basic Concepts: Word Embeddings & Pre-trained Word Embeddings
### Word Embeddings
Before discussing about Transfer Learning, let's understand the basics of word embeddings. In short, a word is mapped to a vector space where similar words are placed closer together. Each dimension represents a particular feature or property related to the word. The vectors can capture various semantic relationships between words, which makes it easier to identify similarities and differences. Here's an example visualization:

We can observe that similar words like "cat" and "dog", "tree" and "forest", etc., tend to occupy nearby locations in the vector space. Moreover, they share certain properties such as color, shape, size, etc., which makes them easy to cluster based on those features. These properties make sense because all animals have striking similarities with each other, i.e., their fur, teeth, tails, eyes, body structure, etc., but still maintain distinct identities. 

However, what if we want to train our own models? This is where pre-trained word embeddings come into picture. They represent a large collection of commonly occurring words and phrases from different languages and domains and map them to high dimensional vectors called word embeddings. We just need to download the pre-trained embeddings and plug them directly into our model during training. This saves us time and computational resources by providing us with very strong initial weights for our models. Also, since most of these embeddings were trained on a massive corpus of text data, they naturally capture rich linguistic information and handle noise better than traditional approaches.





### Pre-trained Word Embeddings
Pre-trained word embeddings generally come in three flavors - GloVe, Word2Vec, ELMo and BERT. Below is a brief description of each of them:

#### GloVe
GloVe stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation. It was developed by Stanford researchers in 2014, and uses cooccurrence matrix approach to generate the embeddings. The method involves counting the number of times two words appear together in a sentence, then averaging the context vectors for each pair to obtain a global vector representation for the target word. Unlike traditional methods, GloVe does not rely solely on local statistics, which helps in capturing more complex patterns. However, it requires a lot of memory and computation power for creating the embedding table. Additionally, due to its sparse nature, it cannot capture many rare or unseen word pairs accurately. Overall, GloVe has been shown to be effective in capturing semantic relationships between words while being efficient enough to work on small datasets. 

#### Word2Vec
Word2vec is another famous technique used for generating word embeddings. The key idea behind Word2Vec is to learn distributed representations of words. In simple terms, it means that similar words should have similar vectors, and dissimilar words should have dissimilar vectors. Word2Vec achieves this by treating words as points in a high-dimensional space, mapping them onto vectors such that neighboring words in the vector space are likely to occur in similar contexts. Word2Vec has been successful in capturing syntactic and semantic relationships between words across different domains, making it widely used today.

#### ELMo
The novel architecture called "Embedding from Language Models" or ELMo (short for Contextualized Embeddings from Long Short-Term Memory Networks) captures the meaning of a word by considering both the word itself and the surrounding context. It uses bi-directional LSTM networks to extract meaningful representations of words from various layers of a deep neural network. The resulting representations are combined through a linear transformation layer and softmax function to predict the next word in a sequence. ELMo performs well in NLP tasks such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging.

#### BERT
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is Google's state-of-the-art technique for NLP tasks. It is a transformer-based machine learning model that combines multiple transformer layers to create fixed sized representations of tokens. Each token is represented as a set of learned parameters obtained by backpropagating from the loss gradient back to input hidden states of the previous transformer layers. BERT provides state-of-the-art performance in several NLP tasks including question answering, text classification, and natural language inference. 

In summary, pre-trained word embeddings provide a robust way to initialize the weights of any new model without relying on extensive amounts of labeled data. They allow us to solve challenging NLP tasks quickly and efficiently, especially when dealing with limited labeled data. 




## Transfer Learning Using Pre-trained Word Embeddings for NLP Tasks
Now that we've understood the basics of word embeddings and pre-trained word embeddings, let's talk about applying them in transfer learning scenarios for solving NLP problems. As mentioned earlier, Transfer learning is a powerful mechanism to help machines learn faster and more effectively by leveraging expert knowledge from existing models. It involves transferring the knowledge gained from one problem to another. For instance, a CNN model could be trained on ImageNet dataset containing millions of images, and then fine-tuned on a specific domain’s task, thereby utilizing the common patterns learned through the entire process. Similarly, in NLP tasks, a pre-trained word embedding model like GloVe, Word2Vec, ELMo or BERT could be leveraged to improve the accuracy of downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and so on. 

In general, the steps involved in using pre-trained word embeddings in transfer learning are:
1. Choose a pre-trained word embedding model that best suits your requirement. Some popular ones include GloVe, Word2Vec, ELMo and BERT. 
2. Convert your text inputs into numerical vectors by loading the pre-trained embedding matrices. You may use tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries to do this easily. 
3. Train your custom model on top of the pre-trained embedding layer, adding additional layers or further finetuning the model for your specific NLP task. During the final phase, you would freeze the pre-trained embedding layer and only train the added layers or the entire model. 
4. Evaluate your model on test data to verify whether it's able to achieve good results. If required, fine-tune the hyperparameters of your model until you find the optimal configuration. 


Here's an illustration of the overall pipeline for performing transfer learning using pre-trained word embeddings for sentiment analysis:


As seen above, the main difference between standard training vs. transfer learning for NLP tasks is that in transfer learning scenario, we don't start from scratch, rather we use pre-trained word embeddings as starting point and add extra layers or train the whole model end-to-end for the given task. Another crucial factor to consider is that, instead of retraining the entire model from scratch, we only update few of the layers of the network to optimize it towards the given task.
