Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique used for analyzing and understanding complex data sets by transforming the original variables into new uncorrelated variables that capture most of the information in the dataset while minimizing the loss of important structure or relationships among them. In this article, we will explore how to perform kernel PCA using scikit-learn library on various datasets such as breast cancer wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, handwritten digits MNIST dataset, diabetes dataset, etc., along with example code implementation. The same set of steps can be followed for other popular machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN, etc. Kernel PCA is an extension of traditional PCA where a nonlinear function called kernel is used to transform input features before performing principal component analysis. We will also explain some key concepts associated with kernel PCA including kernel functions, decision boundaries, and eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Finally, we will see the impact of selecting different hyperparameters like gamma value, bandwidth parameter, degree of polynomial kernel on accuracy of PCA projection. All these aspects will enable us to apply kernel PCA effectively on real world problems. Overall, our goal is to provide practical insights about the kernel PCA algorithm, how it works under the hood, and demonstrate its efficacy on several challenging datasets to help developers get started with this powerful yet widely applicable technique.

Overview
In the previous article, we discussed what is Principal Component Analysis and why it is useful in reducing the dimensions of high-dimensional data sets. Now let's dive deeper into the inner workings of PCA and its connection to Kernel methods. 

Before proceeding further, it would be good if you have a good understanding of basic concepts of Linear Algebra and Statistics. If not, I suggest going through Linear Algebra Review and Probability Theory For Machine Learning Beginners articles first. Let’s start!

The basics of PCA
Principal Component Analysis involves two main components - the transformation of the data space and the selection of the principal components. 

Let’s say we want to analyze the relationship between three quantitative variables X, Y and Z. One way to do this is to plot their scatter plots against each other. However, since there might be too many points involved, it becomes difficult to visualize all the trends and patterns accurately. Instead, we can use techniques such as PCA to extract meaningful patterns from the data and then represent the data in a lower dimensional space so that we can easily observe the patterns.

The general idea behind PCA is to find directions in which the data varies the most. These directions correspond to the principal components (PC). The PCs are constructed such that they maximize the variance of the data projected onto each one of them. They are orthogonal to each other because the projection does not change the magnitude of the vector. The direction of maximum variance is known as the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.

After calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the data, we select the k highest-variance vectors as our principal components, where k represents the number of dimensions we want to reduce the data down to. The resulting transformed data contains only these selected principal components and hence has significantly reduced the dimensions compared to the original data.

Using Kernels for Nonlinear Projections
So far, we assumed that the data lies on a plane or line. But if the data does not lie on a line or plane, we cannot project it onto a straight line without introducing errors. To overcome this issue, we can use non-linear transformations such as Radial Basis Functions (RBF), Sigmoidal Neurons (SNU), Gaussian Processes (GP), etc. instead of simple projections. 

A non-linear transformation takes a weighted sum of basis functions applied to the inputs, instead of just applying weights to the inputs directly. It allows us to model more complex relationships between the inputs. One common type of kernel used in kernel PCA is the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The RBF kernel expresses the similarity between two inputs x and y as follows:

K(x,y)=exp(-gamma ||x-y||^2)

where gamma is a positive scalar constant referred to as the bandwidth parameter. When gamma increases, the width of the Gaussian bell curve shifts towards infinity, leading to a smoother and less bumpy transformation. Decreasing the value of gamma leads to a sharper transformation and greater smoothing. Intuitively, smaller values of gamma indicate that we care more about the local structure of the data, whereas larger values focus on global structures.

To implement kernel PCA, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the pairwise distances between the samples in the training data.
2. Choose a kernel function such as RBF kernel.
3. Compute the kernel matrix, which represents the similarity between all pairs of samples in the training data. 
4. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the kernel matrix, sorted by decreasing eigenvalues.
5. Select the top k eigenvectors as our principal components.
6. Transform the data by multiplying it with the top k eigenvectors.
7. Project the transformed data back into the original feature space. 

We now know how to apply kernel PCA to high-dimensional data sets and how it uses kernels to create nonlinear projections. Before moving forward to examples, let’s discuss choosing the right hyperparameters for kernel PCA.
