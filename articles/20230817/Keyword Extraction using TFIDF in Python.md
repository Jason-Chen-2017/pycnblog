## 1.1 文章写作背景及目的 
Keyword extraction is one of the most popular NLP tasks that allows us to identify and extract significant words or phrases from a document for better search engine optimization (SEO), information retrieval (IR), text classification, topic modeling, and many other natural language processing applications. In this article, we will discuss how to perform keyword extraction using the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm in Python programming language. We also need to cover some basic concepts such as documents, terms, stop words, and tokenization.

The main purpose of this article is to help beginners who are interested in learning about Natural Language Processing (NLP) but have limited knowledge about it can get started easily with these techniques. The goal is to provide clear explanations of each step involved in performing keyword extraction and presenting code examples along with comments to make it easy for readers to understand what exactly they are doing. 

This article assumes that the reader has some background in Python programming language and basic understanding of machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVMs, etc., and their use cases. If you are not familiar with any of them, please refer to other articles on the internet before reading this one. 

To conclude, our objective here is to create an accessible article that anyone can read and learn more about keyword extraction using TF-IDF technique. This will enable people who are new to NLP and want to start exploring this area easier.

We will first introduce keyword extraction and explain its importance for SEO, IR, Text Classification, Topic Modeling, and various other NLP applications. Then, we will go through the basics of TF-IDF algorithm, which is widely used for keyword extraction. Next, we will demonstrate how to implement TF-IDF algorithm in Python using Scikit Learn library. Finally, we will summarize key points and suggest future directions for further research. At the end of the article, we will include frequently asked questions and answers in appendix A. 

# 2. Background and Basic Concepts
Before diving into the details of TF-IDF, let’s briefly talk about the basic concepts required for understanding the algorithm. These concepts are documents, terms, stop words, and tokenization. 

1. Documents: A document refers to a set of words that make up a sentence, paragraph, or a complete piece of text. It could be a news article, email message, product review, or anything else written in plain English.

2. Terms: Terms represent individual tokens extracted from a document. For example, if we tokenize a sentence “I love programming” into individual words, then the terms would be "I", "love", and "programming". 

3. Stop Words: Stop words are common words that do not carry much meaning and serve no purpose while extracting keywords. Some commonly used stop words are "the", "and", "a" etc. They usually appear at the beginning, middle, or end of a term and do not contribute much to the overall meaning of the phrase. 

4. Tokenization: Tokenization involves breaking down a document into individual terms by identifying and separating the different parts of speech, creating chunks of words that capture important aspects of the document. Examples of tokenizers are stemmers, lemmatizers, and n-grams where we break down sentences into smaller units. 

With these basic concepts out of the way, let's move forward to the core part of the article – TF-IDF!
