Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly critical in today’s world as organizations struggle to protect sensitive data from hackers and cyber criminals who seek to exploit vulnerabilities in their systems. In this article, we will discuss fundamental concepts such as intrusion detection, prevention, and response (IDPR), and explore various types of attacks that can pose a threat to your organization's network. 

This is an essential reading for anyone involved in securing networks or organizations against cyber threats.

# 2.核心概念与术语
Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDPS) are crucial tools used by security professionals to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts on computer systems. They work by monitoring network traffic and identifying patterns or anomalies that could indicate attempted intrusion activity. The IDPS then takes appropriate action to either block or allow access based on established rules and policies set forth by the system administrator. 

The following are some key terms used throughout the rest of the article:

 - **Attacker:** A person or entity that tries to gain unauthorized access to a computer system through illicit activities, such as hacking, spear-phishing, etc.
 - **Vulnerability:** An issue within a system that makes it susceptible to attack, which can be exploited by attackers. 
 - **Exploit:** An action taken by a hacker that targets a vulnerability and gains control over the system. 
 - **Incident:** A single instance of unauthorized access attempt by an attacker, often accompanied by other harmful events such as data breaches, loss of revenue, etc. 
 - **Threat:** An overall attitude, feeling, or state towards something, typically characterized by distress or hostility.
 - **Risk:** The likelihood that a particular situation could result in harm or damage. 
 - **Security Policy:** Rules and guidelines designed by an organization to secure its systems from known and potential threats.

## Intrusion Detection System (IDS): 
An IDS monitors network traffic to identify any unusual activity that might represent an attempt to compromise the system. It alerts the system administator of any anomaly detected and allows them to take corrective actions using rule-based policies. This includes blocking specific IP addresses, URLs, user accounts, etc., until they can be trusted again. Common technologies used in the field include Snort, Suricata, and Wireshark.

### Monitoring Techniques:

1. **Network Flow Analysis**: Analyze network traffic flows to determine what protocol packets are being exchanged between devices. You may use Network Watcher in Microsoft Azure to perform this analysis. 

2. **Host-based Signatures**: Use predefined signatures provided by vendors or open source developers to detect malicious activities on hosts. For example, you may create custom signatures to detect common malware including trojan downloads, SQL injections, botnets, ransomware, and exploits.

3. **User Behavioral Analytics**: Monitor user behavior on web applications to identify suspicious activities like login attempts, brute force attacks, file uploads, etc. This can help detect evasion techniques like captchas, spam filters, honeypots, etc. You may use Microsoft Azure Sentinel's User Analytics feature to analyze user behavior.

4. **Session Tracking**: Keep track of multiple sessions across different machines and users to detect anomalous behavior at the session level. For example, you may compare the amount of data downloaded during each session with previous average values.

### Alert Generation Methods:

1. **Signature-Based Alerts**: Generate alerts when a signature matches a part of the network flow, indicating that an intruder is attempting to exploit a vulnerability. This helps reduce false positives caused by noise.

2. **Statistical Alerting Algorithms**: Identify trends in network activity and generate alerts when there is a significant change in the pattern of activity. This helps ensure timeliness of alert generation.

3. **Correlation Between Alerts**: Combine alerts generated from several sources into one to reduce notification fatigue.

4. **Holistic Evaluation**: Assemble all information available about the incident to provide a comprehensive picture of what went wrong and where the problem exists. This helps prioritize the most critical issues while providing contextual clues for forensics and resolution.

## Pen-Testing Tools:

Pen-testing tools provide a platform for assessing the security posture of a company's network and identifying any weaknesses that need patching. Some popular pen-testing tools include nmap, Metasploit, Nikto, Skipfish, and Burp Suite Pro. These tools allow companies to scan their networks for any vulnerabilities before going live and mitigate those vulnerabilities before they become real threats. Here are some general steps to follow when conducting penetration tests:

1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: Begin by gathering initial information about the target. Conduct discovery scans to find out more about the system architecture, services running, and version details. Also, collect lists of common software vulnerabilities to identify risks early on.

2. **Scanning Phase**: Once you have identified the target, start scanning the network to discover potential vulnerabilities. Use well-known scanners like nmap, Metasploit, Nikto, Skipfish, etc. to do so. Often times, these scans come back with both “open” and “filtered” ports. Open ports indicate services that should be protected but are accessible to the public. Filtered ports indicate potentially exploitable services that require additional testing.

3. **Exploitation Phase**: Once you have identified a service vulnerable to attack, begin exploiting it to gain remote control over the machine. Use tools like Metasploit or exploit frameworks to carry out targeted attacks. When possible, try to stay hidden from casual observation by using stolen credentials or social engineering techniques.

4. **Post-exploitation Phase**: After successfully exploiting the target, you must complete a series of tasks to establish persistence on the machine. Persistence gives an attacker access to the machine even after it has been restarted or logged off. There are several methods of maintaining persistence on Windows machines. Some examples include using scheduled tasks, registry modifications, adding new users, injecting code into legitimate processes, etc.

5. **Reporting Phase**: Finally, document all findings alongside mitigation measures to assist management in making strategic decisions later on. Provide reports that detail how many vulnerabilities were found, what type of attacks were successful, and how effective each attack was. Include recommendations on further testing if necessary.

Let us now move onto the practical aspects of cybersecurity and understand how attacks work. We'll go through a few sample attacks below:


**Example 1: Denial of Service Attack**

A denial-of-service (DoS) attack occurs when a hacker sends large amounts of invalid requests to a server causing it to crash or stop responding properly. DoS attacks can cause great financial losses for businesses that rely heavily on online transactions, so careful planning is required to defend against them. Here's an overview of how a DoS attack works:

1. **Initiation**: An attacker starts sending floods of SYN (synchronization) packets, also called "half-open" TCP connections, to the affected server.
2. **Valid Response**: The server accepts the connection request and creates a new TCP connection to handle the incoming data. However, since the attacker cannot send enough data to keep up with the sender's rate, the receiver becomes congested and begins discarding valid responses.
3. **Back Pressure**: Eventually, the congestion causes the server to stop accepting new connections and slow down processing of existing ones. At this point, the server stops processing legitimate requests and effectively becomes nonresponsive.
4. **Complete Denial-Of-Service**: Since no legitimate clients can connect, users receive errors or timeout messages. Additionally, servers may decide to take automated action, such as restarting, blacklisting, or temporarily blocking certain IP addresses.

To defend against DoS attacks, organizations can use a variety of techniques such as load balancing, firewall filtering, and DDoS protection. Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers to minimize the impact of a DoS attack. Firewall filtering blocks unauthorized communication attempts, while DDoS protection provides backup capacity in case of repeated attacks.


**Example 2: Spyware Attack**

Spyware is a category of malicious software that gathers private information, tracks browsing history, intercepts calls, and installs itself silently on infected computers without the knowledge of the user. Attackers can install spyware via email attachments, link clicks, or USB drives. Malicious websites can be created that trick users into installing spyware, or adware (also known as popups) can automatically display themselves when visited. To combat spyware, organizations can use antivirus programs that scan files for viruses and remove them, configure browser settings to block popups, and enable URL filtering to prevent unknown sites from loading.

One way to test whether a website is safe from spyware is to check the status of the Google Safe Browsing service, which uses signals such as domain names, IP addresses, and page content to flag unsafe sites. If a site is flagged, contact the owner and ask them to disable the service or add the site to a whitelist.


**Example 3: Phishing Attack**

Phishing emails contain urgent or important messages intended to look trustworthy but sometimes contain links or attachments asking the recipient to click on links that appear to be legitimate. Hacker bots can be programmed to generate fake or convincing phishing emails with tailored payloads, similar to those used in ransomware. Users may mistakenly click on the fake links leading them to a malicious website that looks authentic and steals sensitive information such as passwords, credit cards, or bank account information. To defend against phishing attacks, organizations can implement anti-virus software and require multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations such as bank transfers.
