All these applications require NLP technology and solutions. Therefore, it becomes essential to have a good grasp of the fundamentals of NLP to build effective and reliable AI-powered applications.

## What Are the Different Types of NLP Techniques?

Now let's talk about the different types of NLP techniques. There are three main types of NLP techniques according to Wikipedia:

1. Rule-Based Methods: Rule-based methods use fixed rules or patterns to match words and phrases in a sentence. For example, regular expressions are commonly used in rule-based approaches.

2. Statistical Methods: Statistical methods analyze large corpora of text data and create probability distributions that represent word frequencies, patterns, and relationships. Popular examples of statistical methods include bag-of-words model and Naïve Bayes classifier.

3. Deep Learning Methods: Deep learning methods apply neural networks to learn complex representations of language. The networks take into account both local and global context while extracting meaningful features from text. Two prominent examples of deep learning methods are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

For specific details regarding each type of technique, please refer to our next section "Basic Concepts & Terminology". 

# 3.Basic Concepts & Terminology

Before we proceed further, let's clarify some basic terminologies and concepts related to NLP. Below table summarizes the most commonly used terms and concepts in NLP:


|Term           | Definition                                                                           |

Next, we will discuss the four core algorithms used in NLP tasks such as Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling. 

# 4.Core Algorithms

## Part-of-Speech Tagging

Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is a task of assigning a corresponding tag to each token (word) in a given sentence. Each tag indicates the syntactic function of the word, such as whether it is a subject, object, verb, adverb, preposition, etc. POS tagging plays a pivotal role in various natural language processing tasks, such as information extraction, sentiment analysis, question answering, and machine translation. Typical tags used in POS tagging include NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, PRON, DET, ADP, NUM, CONJ, and SCONJ. Part-of-speech tagging requires significant amount of annotated training data and labeled datasets. Many state-of-the-art libraries and tools exist for performing POS tagging, such as NLTK, spaCy, CoreNLP, and Stanford Parser. Here is a sample implementation of POS tagging using NLTK library in Python:

``` python
import nltk
from nltk import pos_tag, ne_chunk
 
sentence = 'I went to the bank to deposit my money.'
 
 
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
 
print("Tokens:", tokens)
print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)
```

Output:

```
Tokens: ['I', 'went', 'to', 'the', 'bank', 'to', 'deposit','my','money', '.']
POS Tags: [('I', 'PRP'), ('went', 'VBD'), ('to', 'TO'), ('the', 'DT'), ('bank', 'NN'), ('to', 'TO'), ('deposit', 'VB'), ('my', 'PRP$'), ('money', 'NN'), ('.', '.')]
```

This code uses `nltk` library to tokenize the sentence and perform POS tagging using `pos_tag()` function. The output includes the list of tokens and their respective POS tags. Note that this is just a sample implementation, and there are many ways to customize your own model for POS tagging based on your requirements.

## Named Entity Recognition

Named entity recognition (NER) is another important NLP task that identifies and classifies named entities in a given sentence. A named entity can be a person, location, organization, date, time, currency, percent, email address, phone number, duration, URL, or product name. NER play a significant role in many downstream NLP tasks, such as information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, and dialog systems. There are many existing tools and libraries available for performing NER, such as StanfordNER, Apache OpenNLP, and spaCy. Here is a sample implementation of NER using spaCy library in Python:

``` python
import spacy
 
nlp = spacy.load('en')
text = """Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"""
 
doc = nlp(text)
 
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text + ": ", ent.label_)
```

Output:

```
Apple: ORG
U.K.: GPE
startup: ORG
1 billion: MONEY
```

In this code snippet, we first load the English version of spaCy library. We then define the input text string and parse it using the loaded pipeline. We iterate over the parsed document entities using `.ents` attribute and print out their label and text representation. The output shows us the recognized named entities and their labels. Note that this is just a sample implementation, and there are many hyperparameters and strategies involved in designing your own NER system.

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the attitude or opinion expressed in a piece of text. Polarity refers to the degree of positiveness or negativeness of a statement, whereas intensity refers to the degree to which a statement expresses joy, fear, surprise, anger, sadness, trust, anticipation, disgust, or indifference. Sentiment analysis allows businesses to gain insight into customer behavior and predict market trends. There are numerous tools and libraries available for performing sentiment analysis, such as VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), TextBlob, and AFINN. Here is a sample implementation of sentiment analysis using TextBlob library in Python:

``` python
from textblob import TextBlob
 
text = """I had a great experience with my new hotel! It was clean and comfortable."""
polarity = TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
 
if polarity > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif polarity < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Neutral")
```

In this code snippet, we first define the input text string and pass it to the `TextBlob()` constructor. We then call the `.sentiment.polarity` method to calculate the polarity score of the text, which ranges between -1 and 1. If the polarity score is greater than zero, we print "Positive", else if the polarity score is less than zero, we print "Negative", otherwise we print "Neutral". Note that this is just a sample implementation, and there are many hyperparameters and strategies involved in designing your own sentiment analysis system.

## Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling for discovering latent topics in a set of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular algorithm for topic modeling. LDA takes a corpus of documents as input and outputs a set of topics that reflect the underlying structure of the documents. Topics can capture abstract ideas or highlight specific aspects of a document. Once we identify topics in a dataset, we can use clustering algorithms to group documents together based on their similarity to the identified topics. One of the most widely used clustering algorithms for topic modeling is K-means clustering. Additionally, there are many visualization tools available for exploring the topics generated by LDA, such as pyLDAvis and interactive DataTables.
