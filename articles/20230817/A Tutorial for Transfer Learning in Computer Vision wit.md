：Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that allows us to leverage the knowledge learned on one task and apply it to other related tasks, thereby reducing the need for training from scratch on these tasks. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to transfer learning in computer vision using PyTorch library. In this article, we will cover how to use pre-trained models such as VGG, ResNet and DenseNet for image classification tasks, also discuss about feature extraction and fine-tuning techniques used while doing so.

# 3.核心概念:

1) Transfer Learning: Transfer learning refers to taking an already trained model and applying it to new data without having to train it completely from scratch, but instead focusing solely on updating the weights of the last few layers or the fully connected layers of the network. This technique can help us achieve significant improvements in accuracy and speed up the process of training deep neural networks.

2) Pre-Trained Model: Pre-trained models are those that have been trained on large datasets and then made available for public use through various repositories like Caffe, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. These pre-trained models provide us with a base on which our problem can be tackled quickly by just tuning the final layers of the model based on our specific dataset. For example, a commonly used pre-trained model for image classification is VGG-19. 

3) Feature Extraction: Feature extraction involves extracting important features or information from an input image or a video clip, typically after removing any unnecessary background or distracting elements. It helps us identify relevant objects, shapes, and patterns within the image, and extract meaningful representations of them for further processing or analysis.

4) Fine-Tuning: Once we have extracted the relevant features, we can fine-tune the parameters of the network on our own dataset. This means adjusting the weights and biases of the fully connected layers of the model to better match the unique characteristics of our target domain.

In summary, transfer learning enables us to leverage powerful pre-trained models for solving different types of problems efficiently, without requiring extensive computation power and time. We do not need to train the entire network from scratch, rather focus solely on modifying only a small portion of the network’s architecture and updating its weights accordingly. 

Let's start writing! 

4. Transfer Learning in Computer Vision with PyTorch:

The first step towards implementing transfer learning for computer vision tasks is to import necessary libraries. Here we are importing PyTorch, torchvision, and numpy libraries. 

```python
import torch 
import torchvision 
import numpy as np 

print(torch.__version__) # Version Check
```

After installing the above mentioned libraries, we proceed to load the pre-trained models such as VGG, ResNet and DenseNet. Let's download and load VGG-19 here. We can easily access the VGG-19 pre-trained model using torchvision library's built-in method. 

```python
vgg = torchvision.models.vgg19() 

for param in vgg.features.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
    
classifier = list(vgg.classifier._modules.values())[-1] 
num_ftrs = classifier.in_features 
classifier[6] = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, len(class_names)) 
vgg.classifier = nn.Sequential(*classifier)

vgg.eval() # Set Evaluation Mode
```

We set all the weights of the pretrained layer to false except for the linear layer at the end, so that they cannot be updated during training. Finally, we create a sequential object of classifier consisting of the output layer. We freeze the gradient updates by setting requires_grad attribute to False. After loading the VGG-19 model, we can move forward to implement some common transfer learning strategies such as feature extraction and fine-tuning. 

5. Feature Extraction: In feature extraction, we remove the last layer (classifier), save the remaining convolutional layers, and then pass the processed images through the saved layers until we get the desired features. In order to perform feature extraction on an image, we follow the following steps:

1. Resize the image to the size required by the pre-trained model
2. Convert the PIL Image format into a Tensor format using torchvision transforms
3. Normalize the tensor to ensure consistent scale across all pixels and channels 
4. Pass the normalized tensor through each of the saved layers in sequence
5. Average pool the resulting output feature maps to obtain a single vector representing the image’s features.

Here's the code implementation for performing feature extraction:

```python
def extract_features(image):
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize((224, 224)), 
        transforms.ToTensor(), 
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) 
    ])
    
    img = transform(image).unsqueeze_(0)
    return vgg(img)

img = Image.open('path/to/test_image')
features = extract_features(img)
```

In the above code snippet, we define a function named `extract_features` which takes an image file path as input, applies transformations including resizing, normalization, and tensor conversion. Then we call the loaded VGG-19 model with the transformed test image and obtain the features.

6. Fine-Tuning: In fine-tuning, we update the last layer of the pre-trained model (output layer) alongside the previous layers or replace them altogether with custom layers according to our requirements. This technique allows us to learn more specialized features on our target domain by effectively retraining the top layers of the network. There are several ways to fine-tune a pre-trained model for transfer learning, which include: 

1. Freeze the existing layers and train only the newly added layers.
2. Unfreeze all layers and fine-tune all of them using a small learning rate.
3. Use a smaller learning rate for the earlier layers and a larger learning rate for the later layers. 

Regarding freezing the existing layers and train only the newly added layers approach, let's assume that we want to add a new layer to our pre-trained VGG-19 model to classify animals vs vehicles. First, we freeze all the original layers except for the last one, and then modify the last layer to suit our needs.

```python
vgg = torchvision.models.vgg19()

for param in vgg.features.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
    
classifier = list(vgg.classifier._modules.values())[:-1] 
new_layer = nn.Linear(4096, num_classes)
classifier.append(new_layer)
vgg.classifier = nn.Sequential(*classifier)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()  
optimizer = optim.SGD(vgg.classifier.parameters(), lr=learning_rate, momentum=0.9)  

vgg.train() # Switch to Training Mode
```

Next, we split off the original VGG-19 classifer, append a new linear layer with appropriate dimensions, and assign the modified classifier back to the VGG-19 model. Next, we initialize the loss function and optimizer for fine-tuning. Finally, we switch the model to training mode by calling the `.train()` method. Now we can begin fine-tuning the model using our labeled dataset. During this process, we should monitor the performance of the model on the validation set to avoid overfitting.

7. Conclusion: In this tutorial, we discussed about transfer learning and introduced basic concepts, terms, and algorithms involved in performing transfer learning in computer vision tasks using pre-trained models such as VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet. We demonstrated how to use pre-trained models for feature extraction and fine-tuning to solve image classification tasks and discuss possible approaches to optimize the fine-tuning strategy. By combining multiple transfer learning strategies, we can improve the accuracy and robustness of our models against adverse environment conditions.
