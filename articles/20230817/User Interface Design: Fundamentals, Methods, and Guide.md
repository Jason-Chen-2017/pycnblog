## 2.1 Cognitive Load Theory
Cognitive load theory (CLT) is a theory about human cognition that posits that cognitive processes are interrelated but can be administered to different tasks or activities without disrupting each other. The CLT predicts that multitasking leads to decreased performance and increased stress levels among individuals who perform multiple unrelated tasks simultaneously. It also suggests that managing cognitive resources effectively can help improve overall productivity and user satisfaction.

The basic premise behind the CLT is that humans have limited working memory capacity and must retain relevant information in short-term memory so it can make decisions quickly. To achieve efficient multitasking, designers need to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks, and prioritize them based on their relative importance. This approach promotes healthy working memory strategies by allowing individuals to focus on one task at a time instead of trying to keep track of everything they're supposed to do.

Moreover, CLT argues that even though we may not always remember all details of what we did during our previous tasks, we tend to use them more effectively when we encounter similar situations again. When people need to switch contexts, they often reuse previously learned skills and adapt them to new circumstances. In contrast, if we don't learn something in an organized manner, we'll forget it easily as we progress through life. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components and using appropriate techniques such as learning styles, attention span, and mindfulness training, we can create products with greater efficiency, effectiveness, and enjoyment for users.

## 2.2 Color Theory
Color is a powerful visual tool used extensively throughout every aspect of visual communication. Despite its importance, color can be difficult to master because there are many different ways to represent colors and apply them to your designs. Colors can serve as highlights, accentuations, and backgrounds, making up the range from light purple to neon yellow, depending on context and purpose. To ensure effective and creative use of color, you should familiarize yourself with some fundamental color theory concepts.

### RGB Model
The RGB model is the most commonly used color representation system. Each color has three primary components — red, green, and blue — which add together to create a spectrum of colors ranging from black to white. These values range between 0 (no intensity) to 255 (maximum intensity). The intensity of any given color can be adjusted by adding or subtracting from these base values. For example, pure red would be represented as (255, 0, 0), while pale orange might be represented as (255, 170, 85).

### Hex Code System
Hex codes provide another way to represent colors beyond the traditional RGB model. They consist of six hexadecimal digits, where each pair represents a primary component (red, green, or blue) and converts directly to decimal values. For example, #FF0000 represents full saturation red, and #BA552D could be interpreted as a dark skin tone brown.

### Contrast
Contrast refers to how well two pieces of text or graphics stand out against their surroundings. The higher the contrast ratio, the clearer the image will look. Good contrast is critical for readability and comprehension, especially for long form content like articles or blog posts. A good rule of thumb is that the difference between the darkest and lightest shade of gray text should be no less than 4.5:1, which meets the recommended minimum standard set by the W3C.

### Saturation
Saturation refers to the purity or vividness of a color. More saturated colors are generally considered “vivid” whereas muted colors offer more neutral tones. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the minimum allowable value for color saturation is 4.5 times the value of the brightness (relative luminance), or 0.039 for an RGB value of (0, 0, 0) and 1 for an RGB value of (255, 255, 255). This means that the darkest possible color (black) should have a saturation value no lower than 1/3, and the brightest possible color (white) should have a saturation value no higher than 2.4.

### Lightness
Lightness refers to the balance between darkness and lightness in a color. Highlights, accents, and backgrounds typically exhibit high perceptual contrast, making them easier to see over solid colored surfaces. Again, according to NIST, acceptable ranges for lightness include 10% (dark) to 90% (light).

### Palette Selection
A palette is a selection of distinct colors intended to communicate specific messages or brand attributes. Palettes should be chosen carefully to avoid confusion and ensure consistency across your project. There are several tools available online for generating color palettes, including Color Brewer, Adobe Kuler, and Coolors. Choose a palette style that works best for your project and stick to it consistently. Make sure to test your colors under different lighting conditions and screen sizes to ensure optimal contrast and legibility. Avoid using excessive combinations of colors unless absolutely necessary.
