# 1.简介
  

Information transfer refers to the process by which data is transmitted between different devices or components in a network. This article will explore information transfer mechanisms such as fading channels, spider webs and water pipes. We'll also cover various protocols used for information transmission, including modulation techniques like amplitude shift keying (ASK), frequency-shift keying (FSK) and digital encoding schemes. Finally, we’ll identify the applications of these technologies within modern communication systems.


In this first part, we will provide an introduction to information transfer and discuss its three main types: analogue, digital and wireless. We will then briefly introduce the main concepts associated with each type of channel. In later articles, we will examine the technical details behind each type of channel using detailed examples from modern communications systems, particularly cellular networks.

The second half of this series will focus on how modulation techniques are applied for digital signal transmissions, highlighting their advantages over other methods. We will illustrate practical aspects of ASK, FSK, and PSK using open source simulation tools like GNU Radio. 

Finally, we will look at practical applications of information transfer across multiple layers of technology within modern communication systems, including transportation, wireless networks, and cloud computing. These real-world scenarios demonstrate why one may need to understand information transfer mechanisms deeply.

# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
## 2.1 Analogue Channels

Analogue channels use electromagnetic radiation signals to carry information through space without disrupting it. They transmit bits and symbols that can be easily interpreted by electronic circuits. There are two basic types of analogue channels - frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM). 

Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) involves dividing the spectrum into discrete frequencies, typically tens or hundreds of kHz wide, where each frequency corresponds to a specific symbol. The receiver selects the appropriate frequency based on the address provided by the transmitter, and demodulates the received signal to extract the transmitted bit or symbol. TDM, on the other hand, involves sending individual signals over time slots, separated by small gaps. Each slot carries exactly one symbol, with the beginning and end times defined by the frame length, so no collisions occur when multiple users try to send data simultaneously.

Modulation techniques used in analogue channels include frequency-shift keying (FSK), amplitude-shift keying (ASK), phase-shift keying (PSK), and quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM). These techniques vary in terms of symmetry, bandwidth efficiency, constellation size and noise performance.


## 2.2 Digital Channels

Digital channels use electrically switched signals to encode binary data onto carrier waves. They operate at high speeds due to reduced interference and power consumption compared to analogue channels. There are four primary types of digital channels: Microwave, Wireless LAN, Satellite, and Optical fiber. 

Microwaves transmit radio signals directly through the air, while Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) utilize microwave links to communicate via wireless signals. Satellite communications rely on the Earth's magnetic field to broadcast data through radar and television signals. Optical fibers transmit data through light pulses, usually as pulses of optical energy rather than electrical signals. The characteristics of each channel depend heavily upon the medium being used, especially the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral content. Some common standards used in digital channels include IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, Zigbee, WiMAX, etc.

Modulation techniques used in digital channels include amplitude-shift keying (ASK), frequency-shift keying (FSK), Gaussian maximum likelihood (GMSK), offset-binary modulation (OBM), and differential manchester encoding (DME). All these techniques involve the generation of complex baseband waveforms containing both carrier and modulated signals. 


## 2.3 Wireless Channels

Wireless channels utilize low-powered short-range radio signals to connect remote locations. They employ variety of techniques such as spread-spectrum,thogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), multi-carrier modulation, and code division multiple access (CDMA). Wireless communication networks can range from local-area networks (LANs) to terrestrial mobile networks, providing unprecedented flexibility and mobility to the user.

Modulation techniques used in wireless channels include spread-spectrum (SS), orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), multi-carrier frequency-hopping (MCFH), and single-carrier frequency-hopping (SCFH). Similar to analogue channels, they require careful selection of modulation parameters depending on the underlying protocol requirements.

# 3. Fading Channels

Fading channels are those in which the signal propagates in free space at varying distances, leading to increased levels of interference caused by attenuation and multipath effects. Common sources of fading in wireless channels include earth propagation loss, atmospheric turbulence, multipath propagation effects, and shadow fading caused by buildings and trees. 

To avoid damage to wireless signals during fading events, researchers have developed techniques called seismic blindspotting and delay spread. Seismic blindspotting employs specialized geophysical sensors to monitor the behavior of objects in the vicinity, and delay spread ensures smooth operation even in presence of disturbances. However, these techniques come with significant overhead costs, limiting their scalability. Therefore, new technologies such as active sensing, intelligent routing, and self-healing algorithms are needed to optimize wireless communication under fading conditions.
