# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning approach that enables an agent to learn from interacting with the environment by taking actions and receiving rewards over time. In robotics, RL has been widely used as one of the primary methods for achieving complex behaviors and goal-oriented tasks such as autonomous navigation, object manipulation, and perception-based decision making. This article surveys several deep reinforcement learning algorithms and applications in robotics, including deep Q-network (DQN), actor-critic method, model-free algorithm based on policy gradients, model-based imitation learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, model-predictive control, exploration-exploitation tradeoff, transfer learning, curiosity-driven exploration, multi-agent reinforcement learning, etc., and discusses their theoretical foundations, advantages and limitations. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive review of related works, especially those in real-world applications such as industrial automation, warehouse management, humanoid robots, and service robots. Finally, we conclude this survey with some future directions and challenges in RL research.

# 2. 背景介绍
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique for solving challenging problems by learning to make decisions or take actions within an uncertain environment through trial and error. It can be applied to a wide range of fields, including artificial intelligence, game playing, robotics, and more. Despite its potential power, there are many practical issues associated with applying RL in various domains, such as high sample complexity, non-stationarity, stochastic dynamics, delayed feedback, sparse reward signals, etc. These challenges have made it difficult to apply RL successfully in practical scenarios where real-world environments must be modeled accurately and efficiently. Therefore, there is a need for effective approaches to address these challenges.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a subset of RL techniques that applies deep neural networks to solve the problem of function approximation in RL. The key idea behind DRL is to use multiple layers of neural networks to represent the value function and policy function. By using deep neural networks, DRL can handle complex tasks with higher levels of abstraction than other traditional RL algorithms, which often require expert knowledge or long experience replay. However, despite their successes in certain domains, DRL still poses significant challenges and needs further development. 

In recent years, many RL algorithms have emerged, ranging from basic Q-learning, SARSA, REINFORCE, PPO, AlphaGo, and DeepMind's AlphaZero, to advanced model-based algorithms like MBPO, HER, CURL, TAMPI, BCQ, and TD3, among others. Each algorithm uses different methods to capture the underlying environment dynamics and achieve better performance in different scenarios. Some of them also include exploration strategies, such as epsilon-greedy policies or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, to encourage exploration and prevent convergence to suboptimal solutions during training. Nonetheless, it remains a challenge to develop scalable and efficient DRL algorithms that can handle large-scale environments and continue to improve their performance even after deployment.

To address these challenges, this article presents a survey of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and applications in robotics. We first provide an overview of the field of robotics and discuss the fundamental concepts involved in reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning. Then, we dive into each algorithm, starting from simpler ones like tabular methods and dynamic programming, moving towards more sophisticated models like deep Q-networks (DQNs), actor-critic methods, and model-based imitation learning. We then present relevant examples, explanations, and comparisons between each algorithm, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss how they work under different conditions and settings. After analyzing all algorithms and their applications, we draw out general lessons learned and outline promising future directions in RL research.
