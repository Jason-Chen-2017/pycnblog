# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a class of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that learn from interaction with the environment to optimize an agent’s behavior in response to its perception and action. In this article, we will discuss two methods of using nonparametric bayesian models as RL agents:
- Gaussian Processes (GPs), which are known as “kernels” in machine learning terminology;
- Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). 

We will start by introducing background concepts such as stochastic dynamics and bayesian inference, before moving on to GP and DNN approaches. We will then proceed towards discussing specific formulations for GP and DNN approaches within Bayesian nonparametrics framework and provide mathematical explanations behind those formulas. Finally, we will conclude our discussion by providing code examples and comparisons between GP and DNN approaches.

## 2.1 Stochastic Dynamics
In reinforcement learning, we assume that there is a stochastic dynamic system generating observations based on actions taken by an agent at each time step $t$. The observed data follows a probability distribution $\mathcal{D}_t$, defined over the state space $\mathcal{S}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ can be continuous or discrete. At each time step, the transition function $p(s_{t+1} \mid s_t,a_t)$ specifies how the system evolves given current state $s_t$ and action $a_t$. This process continues until the episode ends. 


$$\underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{c}s_{1}^{(t)} \\ \vdots \\ s_{T}^{(t)}\end{array}\right]}_{\text{State sequence }} = \underbrace{\left[p(s_{1} \mid s_0,a_0)\right]_{t=1}^T}_{T\text{-step transition probabilities}} \cdot \underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{c}s_0 \\ a_0\\ \vdots\\ s_{T-1}\end{array}\right]}_{\text{Action sequence}} $$

The goal of reinforcement learning is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected reward obtained through interaction with the environment, considering only future rewards but not immediate ones. A policy $\pi_\theta : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ maps each state to a corresponding action, given some parameters $\theta$. Given a fixed policy, the value function $V^\pi_\theta (s)$ gives the expected discounted sum of future returns starting from state $s$ under the policy $\pi_\theta$:



$$ V^\pi_\theta (s) = E_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} [R(\tau)]$$

where $\tau=(s_0,a_0,\ldots,s_H)$ represents a trajectory generated by following the policy $\pi_\theta$ from state $s_0$ with action $a_0$ until it reaches a terminal state, yielding total return $R(\tau)=r_0+\sum_{t=1}^H r_t+\gamma^{H} v^{\pi}(s_{H+1})$, where $H$ denotes the horizon length, $v^{\pi}(s_{H+1})$ denotes the state value associated with the final state $s_{H+1}$ after taking the first $H$ steps of the trajectory under the same policy. 

The maximum entropy inverse RL problem tries to find an optimal policy maximizing the entropy of the resulting distributions over trajectories. Entropy measures the randomness or disorder present in a probability distribution and ranges between zero and one. Intuitively, if all possible outcomes have equal probability, the entropy is maximized, whereas if they are evenly distributed amongst many possibilities, the entropy is minimized. 

## 2.2 Bayesian Inference
Bayesian inference provides a powerful way of understanding and reasoning about uncertain events. We can use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on new information:

Given prior belief $P(h)$ and likelihood $L(d|h)$, the posterior belief is calculated as follows:

$$ P(h | d) = \frac{P(d | h) P(h)}{P(d)} $$

Here, $h$ stands for hypothesis, and $d$ stands for evidence. The term $P(d)$ is called marginal likelihood and is used to normalize the posteriors. 

In practice, we usually consider a large number of hypotheses, and want to choose the most probable hypothesis given the available evidence. One approach is called maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. In MAP estimation, we choose the hypothesis that has highest probability given the evidence. The posterior probability of choosing different hypotheses is proportional to their respective likelihoods multiplied by their priors:

$$ P(h_k | d) \propto L(d | h_k) P(h_k) $$

Now let's see what happens when we apply Bayesian inference to reinforcement learning problems. 

# 3.Bayesian Nonparametrics Approaches in Reinforcement Learning
There are several families of statistical techniques in machine learning inspired by Bayesian inference principles, including support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and neural networks. However, these methods often require specifying complex feature functions, making them unsuitable for high-dimensional observation spaces. Another limitation of standard parametric models is their tendency to overfit to training data and generalize poorly to unseen environments. 

Nonparametric Bayesian methods, also known as “kernel methods”, address these issues by relying on a kernel function instead of explicit features. Instead of directly modeling the joint distribution $p(x,y)$, they model a functional relationship $k(x,y)$ between the inputs. This allows us to estimate the kernel without any parameterization, since it determines the degree of nonlinearity of the decision boundary. Kernel methods do not need to specify a separate basis function for each input dimension, reducing computational complexity and allowing for more flexible modeling of the data. Nonparametric methods also allow for automatic detection of relevant features during training, which makes them robust against noise and outliers. 

Let's now turn to the main topic of this article - GP and DNN approaches within Bayesian nonparametrics framework. We'll begin by explaining why we should use nonparametric approaches and what role nonparametric models play in reinforcement learning. Then we'll look into the details of GP and DNN approaches within Bayesian nonparametrics framework. After that, we'll compare and contrast GP and DNN approaches in terms of sample complexity and hyperparameter tuning, and highlight potential advantages of GP over DNN in certain settings. Finally, we'll give tips and tricks for effective implementation and interpretation of nonparametric models in reinforcement learning.
