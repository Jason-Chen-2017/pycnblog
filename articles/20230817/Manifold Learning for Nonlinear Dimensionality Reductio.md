Manifold learning (ML) is a technique that can be used to analyze and visualize high-dimensional data in low dimensions by transforming it into a low-dimensional space where distances between points are well preserved. Many ML algorithms have been proposed over the years, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), or Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). However, most of these methods do not work well when applied to nonlinear datasets with complex structures, which often appear in many real-world applications. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for new ML techniques that can handle this type of data effectively. In particular, manifold learning has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for analyzing nonlinear data. 

This article introduces the basic ideas behind manifold learning and provides mathematical formulas and code examples on how to implement various manifold learning algorithms. The focus of this article will be on nonparametric approaches like Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE), Spectral Embedding (SE), and Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS). Additionally, we will discuss potential limitations and challenges associated with manifold learning in practice. Finally, we will conclude with some research directions and future prospects.

## 2.1 Definitions and Abbreviations
**Nonlinear dataset:** A set of observations $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$ from a continuous domain $X$. We assume that $X$ is embedded in a higher dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^D$, but the structure of $X$ is unknown, except through its topology and geometry. For example, $X$ could represent a physical system, social network, computer program, etc., all of which may exhibit complex geometries and topologies. Examples include images, videos, medical records, economic data, etc.

**Euclidean space**: Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{D}$. An $D$-dimensional vector space equipped with the usual addition ($+$) and scalar multiplication ($\cdot$) operations.

**Manifold:** A differentiable mapping $\phi: X \rightarrow M$ from the Euclidean space $X$ to another Euclidean space $M$ called a **manifold**. If $\phi$ preserves distances between points in $X$, then we call $M$ a **metric space**, and the distance between any two points $x$ and $y$ in $X$ is given by the length of the unique shortest path connecting them in $M$:

$$d(x, y) = \text{length}(\phi^{-1}(x), \phi^{-1}(y))$$

where $\phi^{-1}$ denotes the inverse image of $\phi$ under the standard coordinate chart of $X$. This means that if $(u, v)$ is a point in $X$ and $(w, z)$ is its image $\phi^{-1}(u)$ and $\phi^{-1}(v)$ respectively, then $(u', v')$ is the corresponding image $(w', z')$ in $M$, and their distance in $M$ is defined by the length of the line segment joining them:

$$d_{\phi}(x, y) = \| u - v \| = \|\phi^{-1}(x) - \phi^{-1}(y)\|_{M}$$

In other words, we measure distances between points in $X$ using coordinates in $M$, and use the fact that $\phi$ preserves distances to compute actual distances. The embedding $\phi: X \rightarrow M$ is often viewed as a structure-preserving map that maps close regions in $X$ onto nearby regions in $M$.

**Embedding dimensionality reduction:** Given a nonlinear dataset $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$, we aim to find a representation of each observation in terms of a lower-dimensional space while retaining relevant features of the original data. Often times, the goal is to preserve the relationships among variables in the original space and express the data in a way that makes sense to humans. By finding a suitable representation, we can gain insights about the underlying structure of the data, discover patterns and correlations, and ultimately make predictions based on these insights. Specifically, we want to reduce the dimensionality of our data so that we can visualize it or perform clustering tasks without losing important information.

## 2.2 Basic Ideas and Approaches
The key idea behind manifold learning is to learn a feature space that captures the intrinsic geometry of the input data. There are several types of manifold learning algorithms, including linear and non-linear methods such as PCA, LDA, and t-SNE, but they typically only capture low-dimensional aspects of the data, whereas manifold learning algorithms can extract more abstract features of the data that are highly non-linear.

### Parametric Methods
Parametric methods define a functional relationship between the input space $X$ and the output space $M$. These functions usually involve some sort of transformation of the inputs that results in a satisfactory level of compression. One popular approach is the isometric mapping algorithm, also known as the thin plate spline model (TPS), which uses an exponential family prior to estimate the smoothness of the mapping function. TPS is a classical choice because it has closed-form solutions that allow us to easily optimize parameters during training. It can also capture complex non-linearities and local geometry in the data. Other parametric methods include Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) and Laplace-Beltrami Eigenmapping (LBME). While these methods provide guarantees on the quality of the learned embeddings, they require assumptions on the form of the functional relationship between $X$ and $M$ which can limit their ability to capture complex non-linear structures in the data.

### Nonparametric Methods
Nonparametric methods do not make any explicit assumption on the functional relationship between the input space and output space. Instead, they rely on a probabilistic model of the data, specifically, kernel density estimation. Kernel density estimation involves computing the probability distribution of every point in the input space according to a kernel function $k$, which measures the similarity between two points. Popular choices of kernels include the Gaussian kernel and the Student's t-kernel. Other nonparametric methods include Local Linear Embeddings (LLE) and Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). They can capture both global and local structure in the data, making them ideal for handling nonlinear datasets.


## 2.3 Algorithm Details and Code Example
Here we give an overview of three commonly used nonparametric manifold learning algorithms: LE, SE, and MDS. Each method defines a metric on the original input space that is related to a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional space. Here we briefly explain each algorithm, describe the theory behind it, and present sample code implementations in Python. We will also demonstrate how to apply each algorithm to a synthetic dataset generated from a 2-dimensional ring distribution and compare the resulting embeddings obtained using different methods.


### Least-squares Embedding (LE)
One of the earliest successful manifold learning techniques was developed by Jain and Tan, and named after the eigenvector decomposition of the laplacian matrix. The laplacian matrix represents the graph Laplacian, i.e., the degree-normalized adjacency matrix with edge weights equal to either 1 or -1 depending on whether the edges connect nodes with opposite orientation. To obtain the embedding, we first calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix. Then, we project the original samples onto the subspace spanned by the top k eigenvectors, where k is chosen heuristically based on the relative variance explained by the projection components. The optimization process can be performed using stochastic gradient descent, and convergence is guaranteed if the initial guess is good enough. The optimized parameters correspond to the coefficients of the optimal solution along the basis vectors of the tangent space at the mean of the input data. This method works best for simple problems and produces visually appealing embeddings, although its performance can degrade severely for complicated shapes.
