Blockchain technology is one of the most significant advancements in technology. It has revolutionized digital financial transactions by providing secure, immutable ledgers that are accessible to all participants involved in these transactions. Although blockchain technology plays a crucial role in the financial industry, it also offers benefits for educational institutions. In this article, we will explore how blockchain technology can be applied to education to enhance student learning outcomes, reduce costs, improve efficiency, and foster collaboration between learners.


# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 Blockchain
A blockchain is a distributed ledger or database that stores transactions in chronological order, making them immutable and tamper-proof. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block’s transaction data, ensuring that changes cannot be made without altering subsequent blocks. A consensus algorithm ensures that each node agrees on which chain is valid and therefore accepted as correct. Additionally, miners compete to validate new blocks, known as mining rewards, promoting decentralization and stability in the network.

## 2.2 Smart Contract
Smart contracts are computer protocols intended to automate transactional processes within an economy or other context. They define the terms and conditions for when the contract can be executed based on predefined criteria such as required signatures or minimum amount transacted. The execution of smart contracts is typically managed through software platforms like Ethereum, EOS, NEO, etc., which enable developers to write and deploy their own custom code while leveraging a range of built-in functionalities such as token exchange, asset transfer, access control, and more.

## 2.3 Cryptography
Cryptography is the science of protecting information and communications through encryption techniques. Modern cryptosystems use mathematical algorithms to convert plaintext messages into ciphertext that can only be decrypted using a secret key or password. Blockchains utilize several advanced encryption schemes such as Hashcash, Proof-of-Work (PoW), Merkle trees, public-key encryption, and others to provide security guarantees.

## 2.4 Consensus Algorithm
The purpose of a consensus algorithm is to ensure that all nodes agree on the validity of the chain and accept it as legitimate. There are various types of consensus algorithms including proof-of-work (POW) and proof-of-stake (POS). POW uses energy-consuming computations to generate new blocks and requires high electricity consumption, while POS relies on staking to obtain voting rights and benefits from higher rewards.

## 2.5 Pseudononymous Identifiers
Pseudonymity refers to avoiding revealing personal information about individuals who voluntarily disclose it. One way to achieve pseudonimity is through the use of cryptographic methods to obscure identities. Examples include Tor, I2P, DNSCrypt, and Scuttlebutt, which encrypt IP addresses and route traffic anonymously over the internet. Another approach involves utilizing smart contracts and privacy-preserving technologies like ZK-SNARKs, ring confidential transactions, and homomorphic encryption to keep identity hidden while allowing interaction with third parties.

## 2.6 Tokenomics
Tokenomics refers to the design of token economic systems. These systems determine the distribution of tokens among stakeholders, establish rules for token creation and circulation, and govern token price fluctuations. An example of a token economics system is Tether, which employs inflationary policies to create stablecoins backed by the US dollar. Other tokenomics models include fixed supply, bonding curves, and auction mechanisms.

## 2.7 Decentralization
Decentralization refers to the process of separating different actors from one another in order to promote scalability, resilience, and freedom from central intermediaries. The importance of decentralization lies in its ability to remove gatekeepers and unfair power dynamics, free market competition, and censorship resistance. Centralized financial services have been proven vulnerable to hacking attacks, whereas decentralized alternatives offer greater transparency and lower levels of risk.

## 2.8 Censorship Resistance
Censorship resistance refers to the ability of a system or network to remain operative even if some users exercise government or organizational oppression. This may occur due to restrictions placed by regulators, state actors, or private interests, but decentralized alternatives like peer-to-peer networks offer great potential for censorship resistance. By reducing the need for intermediaries, decentralized systems offer greater choice and independence for users and service providers alike.

## 3.1 Distributed Ledger Technology
In order to understand how blockchain technology works in education, let's first discuss what makes a distributed ledger technology unique compared to traditional databases. Traditional databases store data in structured tables where each row represents a record, containing multiple columns of data such as name, address, phone number, email, etc. When working with traditional databases, updates to existing records require a full rewrite of the entire table, causing slow performance and inefficient storage. However, with distributed ledger technology, every participant in the network contributes to the same shared ledger, maintaining a consistent copy of all transactions. Changes to the ledger are recorded digitally using cryptographic hashes, eliminating the need for manual verification and improving data integrity. Participants can verify the accuracy of the data at any given point in time, ensuring that no single party can manipulate the data without detection. To maintain immutability, each update must reference the previous version of the ledger, creating a chain of blocks linked together through cryptographic hashing. 

Blockchains operate under a set of rules called consensus algorithms, which determine how new blocks are added to the ledger and which ones are considered valid. Depending on the chosen algorithm, there could be different ways to add new blocks to the network, such as requiring a certain percentage of network participation or adhering to specific protocol parameters. Once validated, blocks become part of the permanent record of all transactions, forming a distributed, tamper-resistant audit trail that is used to track user interactions across the platform. Since each participant maintains a complete copy of the ledger, blockchain technology enables transparent tracking of activities and account balances, leading to improved quality of life for both students and teachers. Moreover, by enabling seamless integration with mobile devices, online banking, and e-commerce applications, blockchain technology provides convenient access to funds for millions of people worldwide, making it a valuable asset for businesses and governments.

## 3.2 Smart Contract Programming
Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that run according to predetermined logic. Developers can create contracts to encode the business logic of a particular application and automate complex processes, such as escrow or loans. When a contract is deployed on the blockchain, it becomes executable and autonomous, automatically executing pre-defined actions whenever triggered by a specified condition. For instance, a contract could be created to execute a loan payment automatically after a certain period of time, or send a reward to the borrower once they close their account. As previously mentioned, smart contracts leverage decentralized infrastructure features, like consensus and pseudonomization, to increase scalability, flexibility, and decentralization of applications. With the rise of blockchain-based finance platforms, financial services companies, and other industries looking to expand their digital footprint, smart contracts are transforming the way organizations interact with each other and with customers. 

To implement smart contracts, developers typically choose programming languages like Solidity or Vyper, which compile down to bytecode that gets uploaded to the blockchain alongside the application code. Transactions are then routed through the network using an API, which facilitates easy communication between the two parts of the program. Once a contract is initiated, the relevant functions are invoked by sending inputs to the contract address, triggering the corresponding code to execute. The output(s) of the function are usually returned back to the invoking entity, often either synchronously or asynchronously. Finally, the contract state is updated accordingly, reflecting the effect of the contractual action on the blockchain.

For example, consider a smart contract designed to facilitate a lending loan. After being approved by an approving authority, the borrower creates a loan request specifying the amount requested, duration, and interest rate. The contract defines the terms and conditions of the loan, including repayment schedule, fees charged, default status, and any other details that should be included in the agreement. Upon receipt of the loan request, the lender submits the loan application to the contract and waits for confirmation before authorizing the loan. Once the loan is authorized, the contract executes the repayment schedule according to agreed upon terms, charging appropriate fees, and transmitting payments to the borrower via the blockchain. If a default occurs, the contract sets off a series of penalties such as interest accrual, late fee deductions, and lost principal recovery. Overall, smart contracts help simplify complex processes and streamline transactions, significantly enhancing customer experience and efficiency in the financial sector.
