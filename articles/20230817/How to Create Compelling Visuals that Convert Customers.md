In this article, we will explore three key areas:

1. Understanding customer behavior
2. Designing compelling visuals
3. Creating interactive stories and ads

Let's dive deep into each area one-by-one! 


## 3.1 Understanding Customer Behavior
The first step towards creating engaging content is understanding what motivates your targeted audience to visit your website or app. The answer may vary depending on your industry but some common behaviors include:

1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Improving your website’s search engine ranking plays an important role in attracting more visitors. This involves optimizing your site’s keywords, meta descriptions, and links.
2. Engagement Metrics: Tracking customer engagement metrics such as page views, clicks, and purchases can help you identify which parts of your website require improvement. You can then prioritize your efforts accordingly.
3. Social Media Marketing: Connecting with other similar brands on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest etc. can greatly increase your visibility and engage your followers. Promoting posts related to your business, products or services through your accounts could also prove helpful.
4. Email Newsletters: Subscribing to email newsletters from relevant brands and companies can draw in new subscribers and bring in new leads. Writing informative and engaging emails with clear calls-to-action encourages your recipients to sign up for your newsletter.


Once you know why your visitors are visiting your website, the next step is to design content that entices them to stay longer. Here are five steps to achieve this goal:

1. Choose your messaging style: Different websites focus on different types of messages, including blogs, tutorials, case studies, reviews, and personalized recommendations. By choosing the right message type, you can effectively capture attention and convince viewers to continue reading or sharing your content.
2. Provide engaging images: Images play a crucial role in engaging consumers. They add texture, interest, and emotion to your content and make it more accessible. Always use high-quality images that highlight your brand personality.
3. Use headlines that catch the reader’s attention: Your headline should immediately grab the reader’s attention and tell them what they need to know before diving deeper into your content. Avoid using overly long or complex headlines as it can deter your readers.
4. Make sure your content is relevant and timely: Keep your content fresh by highlighting current events or trends and linking back to your company’s homepage or landing page. A well-written post that doesn't fall behind the times can spark curiosity among your readers.
5. Add call-to-actions: Offer your readers actions they can take after reading your content. Share your latest offers, call to action buttons or signup forms that encourage them to share your content on social media or subscribe to your newsletter.


Finally, ensure your content provides valuable information and makes sense to your target audience. Remember, your goal isn’t just to sell your product or service; it’s to build trust and loyalty with your audience. If your content fails to do this, it won’t translate into positive outcomes.



## 3.2 Designing Compelling Visuals
Now let’s talk about designing compelling visuals that effectively convey your brand message to your visitors. As mentioned earlier, visual design is an integral part of marketing communication and helps us communicate our ideas and messages clearly to our intended audience. Let’s break down the process of creating compelling visuals into four main components - concept creation, typography, color scheme, and imagery. 



### Concept Creation
To start with, you must come up with an idea of what you want to say or showcase. The best way to approach this is to gather data about your target audience and research their preferences and needs. Once you have a good understanding of your audience, ask yourself – What would make my brand stand out? From there, think of something unique and interesting. This is where the story begins. Think of a problem that affects your target audience and imagine a solution that addresses it. For example, “Before COVID-19, many Americans didn't realize that plastic bottles were toxic and harmful”. Now you have your concept ready.



### Typography
Next, choose a font family that matches your brand and communicates your message accurately. Optimize the size and spacing of your text to ensure readability. Adjust the line height to balance the space between lines and avoid clutter. When writing copy, choose concise language that focuses on providing value rather than sounding bossy. Don’t forget to optimize your layout to enhance your message. Test your typography on various screen sizes and resolutions to ensure its legibility.



### Color Scheme
A strong color scheme can captivate and draw the user’s attention. Choose colors that reflect your brand values, tone, and feelings. Ensure contrast ratios are appropriate and give enough visual hierarchy within your interface. Employ subtle shades and gradients when necessary to add depth and interest. Avoid using too bright or dark colors, which can cause eye strain. Use fonts with sufficient color variety and limit the number of colors used.



### Imagery
Use clear, consistent imagery throughout your design to establish consistency and credibility. Use photographs or illustrations to showcase your product or services. Arrange elements in a cohesive manner and consider adding interactivity for your content. Advertisements usually feature photos or graphics to make the message more impactful. Test your design thoroughly across devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and functionality.


All these steps combine to produce compelling visuals that can leave your visitors engaged, curious, and satisfied with your brand. But remember to test regularly and iterate upon changes based on feedback received from your audience.
