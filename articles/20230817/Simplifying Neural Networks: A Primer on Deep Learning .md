# 1.简介
  

Deep learning has been a hot topic in the past few years, and it is rapidly gaining popularity in many fields including computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and bioinformatics. However, deep learning models can be complex to understand at first glance, especially for beginners who are not familiar with all of its technical details. This article aims to provide an accessible introduction into deep learning terminologies and concepts that will help readers gain a deeper understanding of how neural networks work and improve their skillset in using them effectively. We will also discuss the most popular deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). At the end of this article, we hope that readers find this primer helpful in understanding modern deep learning techniques and applications better than ever before.
# 2.基本概念术语说明
Before diving into the specific deep learning algorithms, let's briefly go over some basic definitions and terminology used in deep learning.
## 2.1 深度学习概述
Deep learning (DL) refers to a class of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are made up of layers of interconnected neurons. The term "deep" refers to the depth of these neural networks, meaning they have multiple hidden layers connected in parallel to each other. DL uses training data to learn underlying patterns and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. It relies heavily on large datasets and automatic feature extraction from raw input data. Popular applications include image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and robotics.
## 2.2 神经网络(Neural Network)
A neural network consists of nodes or units arranged in layers, where connections between nodes form a directed graph-like structure. Each node receives inputs from previous layers, performs linear operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) on them, and passes the output to the next layer. An activation function is then applied to the output of each node to introduce non-linearity and avoid vanishing gradients during backpropagation. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and softmax. In short, a neural network maps inputs to outputs through a series of transformations that are learned automatically from labeled training data. The process of finding optimal weights by adjusting the connection strengths between the nodes is known as backpropagation.
## 2.3 感知机(Perceptron)
The perceptron is one type of single-layer neural network model, which was introduced by Rosenblatt in the 1957 paper “The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for Information Storage and Organization in the Brain”. It is similar to logistic regression in terms of predicting binary outcomes but operates on higher dimensional spaces, making it useful for classification tasks involving more than two classes. The algorithm works by iteratively updating the weight vector along with bias term until convergence. Training is typically done using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method.
## 2.4 激活函数(Activation Function)
An activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the neural network. The purpose of the activation function is to map the weighted sum of inputs to the output value, thereby introducing complex interactions between the input features and facilitating the formation of decision boundaries in high dimensions. Some common activation functions include sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), rectified linear unit (ReLU), and softmax.
## 2.5 反向传播(Backpropagation)
During training, the goal of the neural network is to minimize the error rate on the training set. To do so, we use backpropagation, which involves computing the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to every weight and bias parameter in the network and propagating backwards through the network to update the parameters accordingly. SGD is commonly used for optimizing the network parameters.
## 2.6 卷积神经网络（Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs）
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were originally developed for image recognition tasks. They consist of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, fully connected layers, and activation functions. The main idea behind CNNs is to apply filters to the input images, producing feature maps that contain abstract representations of the visual features present in the input. Filters learn to extract important features from the input and propagate them throughout the network, enabling efficient detection and recognition of patterns. Typical CNN architecture includes several convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers, which reduces the spatial dimensionality of the feature maps, thus reducing the computational cost. Fully connected layers follow after the convolutional and pooling layers, and perform classification or regression tasks on top of the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers. CNNs have become a popular choice for solving complex image recognition problems due to their ability to adapt to variations in appearance and texture within different contexts. Examples of well-known CNN architectures include VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, and Inception.
## 2.7 循环神经网络（Recurrent Neural Networks, RNNs）
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that are particularly suited for sequential data, like timeseries or text. RNNs operate by passing information from one time step to another through hidden states, allowing them to preserve long-term dependencies in the sequence data. The key concept behind RNNs is the cell state, which captures both temporal and spatial dependencies among the input elements. The internal states of the cells are updated continuously through repeated application of the same computation rules, ensuring that the network can capture and remember information from sequences longer than the length of individual training examples. RNNs have proven effective for various tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling.

We now dive into the detailed explanation of the core algorithms employed in deep learning models. Before going into the details, I would like to emphasize that I am not an expert in deep learning theory or mathematics; rather, I aim to provide explanations that cover the necessary background knowledge and intuition required to understand the mathematical concepts involved. My intention is not to be comprehensive nor rigorous either, but rather to present clear descriptions of the fundamental principles and ideas behind the algorithms that people often associate with deep learning.

## 3.1 线性回归(Linear Regression)
Linear regression is a simple yet powerful statistical technique used for predicting numerical values given a set of independent variables. Linear regression assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable (also called target/outcome variable) and the independent variables (also called predictor variables) is linear, i.e., y = b_0 + b_1*x_1 +... + b_n*x_n, where n is the number of predictor variables. The coefficients b_0, b_1,..., b_n represent the intercept and slope of the line respectively. Linear regression is often used for prediction purposes because it provides a quantitative measure of the degree of relationship between the predicted value and the actual outcome. For example, if the goal is to predict the price of a house based on its size, age, location, etc., linear regression can be used to estimate the best fit line that represents the relationship between price and the predictor variables. Linear regression is commonly used for prediction and forecasting purposes.
### 3.1.1 损失函数(Loss Function)
One way to measure the performance of the model is to compute the difference between the predicted values and the true values, and then calculate the mean squared error (MSE). MSE measures the average of the squares of the differences between the predicted values and the true values. However, since the distribution of errors may vary across samples, the MSE alone cannot accurately reflect the accuracy of the model. Therefore, we need to normalize the errors using the standard deviation (SD) of the training data, which gives us an unbiased estimation of the variance of the errors. One common loss function for linear regression is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which computes the absolute value of the errors instead of squaring them. The formula for calculating the MAE is:
$$L_{MAE}(w) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}|y^{(i)} - \hat{y}^{(i)}|$$
where m is the number of training examples, y^(i) is the true label of the i-th example, and $\hat{y}^(i)$ is the predicted label.
Another commonly used loss function for linear regression is the Huber Loss, which is less sensitive to outliers than the L1 norm and the L2 norm. Its formula is:
$$L_{\delta}(w) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{1}{2}(y - \hat{y})^2 & |y - \hat{y}| < \delta \\
    \delta(|y - \hat{y}| - \frac{\delta}{2}) & otherwise
\end{array}\right.$$
where $y$ is the true label, $\hat{y}$ is the predicted label, and $\delta$ is a user-defined threshold.
### 3.1.2 正规方程(Normal Equations)
Linear regression can be solved efficiently using the normal equations, which give the minimum-mean-squared-error solution directly without the need for iteration or optimization procedures. The equation is:
$$X^T X w = X^T Y$$
where X is the design matrix containing the predictor variables, Y is the response vector, and w is the weight vector representing the slope and intercept of the line. Solving the normal equations directly gives the closed-form solution:
$$w = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY$$
However, this approach requires calculating the inverse of the design matrix, which is expensive for large datasets. Alternatively, we can use other linear algebra libraries such as NumPy or PyTorch to solve the system of linear equations.
