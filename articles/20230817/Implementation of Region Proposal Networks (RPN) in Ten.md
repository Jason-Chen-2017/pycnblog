# 1.简介
  

近年来，深度学习技术在图像识别、目标检测等计算机视觉领域占据了越来越重要的地位。其中一种主要的深度学习模型是Region Proposal Network(RPN)。RPN是一个两阶段的神经网络结构，第一阶段生成候选区域（Anchor），第二阶段利用候选区域生成建议框。RPN的提出是为了解决目标检测中两个难点：1）高计算量导致训练困难；2）低召回率造成检测性能不佳。虽然RPN可以帮助提升目标检测的准确率，但其复杂性也给开发者带来了一定挑战。本文将从零开始，一步步实现一个完整的RPN网络，并介绍如何用TensorFlow 2.x进行训练。

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## RPN Introduction
Region Proposal Networks (RPNs) are a type of deep neural network that is used for object detection tasks like finding objects in an image or identifying people's faces and facial keypoints. The basic idea behind RPNs is to generate region proposals using anchor boxes instead of traditional sliding windows approach. Anchor boxes have predefined sizes and aspect ratios which serve as reference points around which the final output layers predict objectness scores and bounding box offsets. By generating multiple candidate regions and scoring each one based on its relevance to the input data, RPNs help reduce computation requirements and improve accuracy by selecting only the most relevant ones for classification and localization.

## Components of RPN
The components of the RPN model are:

1. Feature Extractor: This module extracts features from the input images such as edges, textures, color histograms, etc., and passes it through convolutional layers to produce feature maps with varying resolutions. 

2. Anchors: Anchor boxes are fixed size rectangles that act as reference points for detecting objects at different scales and orientations within the input image. In other words, anchors represent various shapes and sizes of objects that we expect to be present in our training set. Each anchor box has a width and height value specified during training. For example, if we want to train an object detector for small objects, we can use smaller anchor boxes than those used for larger objects. To balance the amount of training examples per anchor box, we also randomly crop the input image and resize them to slightly vary their orientation and scale. During inference, we slide these anchor boxes over the entire input image to generate candidate regions.

3. RPN Head: This part consists of two fully connected layers that take the feature map generated by the previous component and outputs probability distributions for both object and non-object conditions. These probabilities correspond to whether a given anchor box contains any object or not. We call this step Region Proposal Classification (RPN-classification). 

We then apply two more steps to refine these predictions. Firstly, we select top k candidates from the total number of anchor boxes. Secondly, we filter out any duplicates detected within the same proposal by applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm. NMS eliminates duplicate and overlapping proposed regions, leaving us with clean object proposals that are suitable for feeding into the second stage detector.

Finally, we pass all the valid proposals through the second stage detector, i.e., the Fast R-CNN framework or other specialized models trained to identify specific types of objects in the image.

## Input and Output Dimensions
The inputs to the RPN model include an RGB image with dimensions M x N x C where M and N are the height and width of the image respectively, and C represents the number of channels (RGB values in case of an RGB image). The output dimensions depend on several factors like the architecture of the feature extractor, number of filters applied, strides of the convolutional layer, and hyperparameters used during training. However, some common conventions are:

1. rpn_cls_score - A M x N x (num_anchors * 2) tensor representing the score for each anchor box indicating whether they contain an object or not. If there are K anchors per cell, num_anchors = (k^2), where k is the side length of the square root of the number of anchors. Thus, rpn_cls_score[i][j] will give you the score for anchor [l][m], where l and m are indices of the cell containing that anchor. So, len(rpn_cls_score) = H x W x num_anchors, and each element corresponds to the score for an anchor.

2. rpn_bbox_pred - A M x N x (num_anchors * 4) tensor representing the predicted offset for each anchor box that moves it closer to the actual ground truth object. If there are K anchors per cell, num_anchors = (k^2), where k is the side length of the square root of the number of anchors. Hence, len(rpn_bbox_pred) = H x W x num_anchors, and each element gives you the prediction for an anchor box.

3. rois - A variable length list of (num_proposals, 4) tensors representing the coordinates of each proposed region after passing through NMS. The first four elements of each row represent the coordinates of the left, upper, right, and lower boundaries of the proposed region relative to the original image. Moreover, if roi_align=True, we append another column corresponding to the index of the anchor box that was responsible for generating this region proposal.

Note that here "num_proposals" denotes the maximum possible number of proposed regions. It may be less than the total number of anchor boxes depending on the number of NMS iterations performed.

# 3. Core Algorithm and Operations
Now let’s talk about how exactly do we implement Region Proposals Networks? Below are the high level operations involved:

Training phase:

1. Preprocessing Images: We preprocess the input image by scaling it down to a smaller size while maintaining the aspect ratio so that all the objects present are captured correctly by the network. We also perform random crops and resizes to make sure we get a variety of training examples.

2. Generating Anchors: Here, we generate a grid of anchor boxes centered at the feature map pixels. Each anchor box has a predetermined size and aspect ratio defined during training. Depending upon the size of the image and the desired density of anchor boxes, we divide the image into a number of cells and place an anchor box at every pixel location within each cell. Since we are placing k^2 anchor boxes per cell, the total number of anchor boxes we generate is equal to (k^2)(H x W), where H and W are the number of rows and columns in the feature map respectively.

3. Target Generation: After generating the anchor boxes, we need to compute the target label for each anchor box. The target label determines whether the anchor box contains an object or not and what kind of object it is. This information comes from either labeled datasets or previously trained networks.

4. Loss Calculation: Once we have computed the targets for all the anchor boxes, we calculate the loss function between the predicted labels and the true labels using binary cross entropy loss. Additionally, we add smooth L1 loss for computing the difference between predicted offsets and true offsets. Finally, we backpropagate the loss backward through the RPN head to update the weights of the network.

Inference Phase:

1. Apply Feature Extractor: We apply the feature extractor to process the input image to obtain a feature map of shape (M', N', C').

2. Generate Anchors: We generate the k^2 anchors centered at the center of each cell in the feature map.

3. Perform ROI Align: We use the RoIAlign operation to transform each proposed region into a fixed dimensional representation of size 7 × 7 × C.

4. Run RPN Classification: We run the RPN classification head on the processed feature map and obtain the objectiveness score for each anchor box.

5. Select Top Boxes: We keep only the top scoring boxes according to their objectiveness score, discarding the rest.

6. Apply NMS: We apply Non-Maxima Suppression (NMS) algorithm to eliminate overlap and redundancy among the remaining boxes. This reduces the number of proposed regions returned by the RPN and selects only the truly relevant ones.

7. Run ROI Pooling or Projection: We pass each selected region through a specialized network such as Fast R-CNN to obtain class specific bounding boxes and classify them accordingly.
