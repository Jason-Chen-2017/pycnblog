Face recognition is an important technology in computer vision that enables systems to recognize and identify faces from digital images or videos captured by cameras, surveillance cameras, smartphones, etc. With the advent of deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), face recognition has become increasingly effective and efficient. 

However, building a robust and scalable face recognition system requires expertise in computer science, machine learning algorithms, software architecture, and programming skills. In this article, I will guide you through the process of building a simple face recognition system using Python and the OpenCV library, which can be easily adapted for practical use cases.

This tutorial assumes that readers have basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with image processing concepts like pixel values, color spaces, bounding boxes, and facial landmarks. If you need a refresher on these topics, I recommend reading the following resources:


Before we start, it's important to note that there are many existing open source libraries available for performing face detection and recognition tasks, including OpenCV, Dlib, and FaceNet. However, they may not necessarily suit your specific needs, so I hope that this tutorial helps you develop a unique understanding of how face recognition works under the hood. Good luck! 


# 2.基本概念
Before diving into the technical details of building a face recognition system, let's briefly go over some key concepts related to face recognition. These concepts will help us understand what exactly we're trying to accomplish when designing our system.
## 2.1 Facial Landmarks
Facial landmarks are distinct points on the human face that contribute significantly to the accuracy and stability of facial recognition systems. They include the corners of the mouth, eyebrows, eyes, nose, lips, jaw line, and chin. The purpose of these features is to provide information about the structure and position of the face in relation to other parts of the body and environment. 


The common steps used to detect and track facial landmarks include two stages:
1. **Detection:** This stage involves identifying different types of facial structures in the input image, such as the eye brow regions, iris areas, nasion areas, cheekbones, etc. It is often achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
2. **Tracking:** Once the facial landmarks have been detected, their location can be tracked over time across multiple frames of video or still images. This allows the algorithm to associate particular features from one frame of video with those seen earlier in the sequence. Common tracking methods include regression based methods (such as Lucas-Kanade Tracker), correlation filters, and Kalman Filters.  

In addition to its importance for face recognition, facial landmark detection also provides valuable insights into the human appearance and behavior, allowing researchers to build more powerful models of human perception. For example, recent advances in facial expression analysis rely heavily on accurate facial landmark detection, making them much more reliable than previous methods.

## 2.2 Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBP) Descriptors
Local binary pattern (LBP) descriptors represent the distribution of local pixel neighborhood patterns surrounding each point in the feature space. LBP was originally developed for texture classification but has since found applications in various computer vision problems, including object recognition, scene recognition, and shape matching. 

For face recognition purposes, LBP descriptors capture the distribution of pixels around the facial landmarks, similar to HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) descriptors. However, unlike HOGs, LBP is designed specifically for classifying complex scenes containing textures, while preserving spatial contextual relationships between individual pixels. Moreover, LBP can be computed quickly using GPU hardware acceleration, making it ideal for real-time face recognition systems.

To create LBP descriptor vectors for a given image, we first resize it to a fixed size, typically 8x8 or 16x16, depending on the resolution requirements of the application. We then loop over all possible locations within the resized image and compute a weighted sum of surrounding pixels according to the LBP kernel function. Finally, we threshold the resulting histogram to obtain a binary representation of the descriptor vector.

Here's a sample implementation of LBP computation using OpenCV in Python:

``` python
import cv2
from skimage import data, io, img_as_ubyte

gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # convert to grayscale

# Define LBP parameters
radius = 3
n_points = 8 * radius
methods = ['default', 'ror', 'uniform']
method_index = 0

lbp = cv2.createLBPHash(radius=radius, nPoints=n_points, method=methods[method_index])

# Compute LBP descriptors
descriptor = lbp.compute(gray)
``` 

We can visualize the output of the LBP computation using matplotlib:

``` python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.imshow(descriptor.reshape((8, 8)), cmap='binary')
plt.show()
``` 
This should produce a visualization of the LBP descriptor array corresponding to the input image.
