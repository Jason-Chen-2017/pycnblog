# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a field of machine learning that allows an agent to learn by interacting with its environment and taking actions based on the perceived reward or penalty from these interactions. In this article, we will introduce you to RL using Python programming language. We assume readers have basic knowledge of Python programming and know how to set up a virtual environment for Python development. Also, we will be assuming familiarity with reinforcement learning concepts like Markov Decision Process (MDP), rewards/penalties, state-action pairs, policy, value function etc., if not familiar please refer to other resources online before reading this article.

In summary, the main topics covered in this article are:

1. Introducing the concept of RL
2. Understanding the basics of MDPs
3. Implementing Q-learning algorithm in Python
4. Discussing various techniques used in training agents
5. Analysing common mistakes and pitfalls while implementing RL algorithms
6. Conclusion and future directions in RL research

Let’s get started!

# 2.Concepts and Terminology
Before moving towards implementation, it's essential to understand some fundamental concepts and terminology involved in RL. Here are some commonly used terms:

**Agent**: The entity that interacts with the environment and takes actions based on its observations. It can be considered as a system that learns to make optimal decisions given the available information.

**Environment**: This is the outside world where the agent operates. It provides feedback about the agent's actions and observations.

**State:** The current representation of the environment. The state at time t represents all relevant information gathered until then. For example, if the environment contains many different objects, their positions and orientations, the corresponding state might look something like: [obj1_x, obj1_y, obj1_theta, obj2_x, obj2_y, obj2_theta]. 

**Action:** An action taken by the agent in response to its observation. Actions can be discrete values such as forward, backward, left, right, jump etc., or continuous values such as throttle position and steering angle. 

**Reward:** Feedback provided by the environment to the agent for its actions. Positive rewards indicate positive utility to the agent, whereas negative rewards indicate a penalty.

**Policy:** Defines the behavior of the agent when presented with a particular state. The policy specifies which action should be chosen for each possible state, usually represented as probability distributions over the available actions.

**Value Function:** Estimates the long-term utility of being in a particular state. Value functions represent the expected return when starting from any point in the state space and following the specific policy. 

**Q-value:** Represents the expected return when taking a particular action in a particular state, under a specific policy. Q-values represent the highest total reward achievable from the current state after executing a certain action. 

We now have a clear understanding of the key components of RL along with their associated terminology. Let's move ahead to implement our first RL algorithm - Q-Learning.

# 3.Implementation
## Environment Setup
To run code examples shown below, we need to create a virtual environment. Open your terminal and type the following commands:

```bash
cd ~ # navigate to home directory

mkdir rl_project # create new project folder

cd rl_project # change to project folder

python -m venv env # create a virtual environment called 'env'

source env/bin/activate # activate virtual environment

pip install numpy matplotlib # install necessary packages
```

This creates a new virtual environment called `env` inside the `rl_project` folder. Activate the environment using the command `source env/bin/activate`. Then, install required libraries using pip.

Once done, let's start importing modules and defining constants. Copy and paste the following code into your IDE or text editor:


```python
import gym
import numpy as np
import random
import tensorflow as tf
from collections import deque
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

tf.enable_eager_execution()
```

We will use the `gym` library to simulate a simple gridworld environment. Install `gym` using the following command:

```bash
pip install gym
```

Now, we define some constants:

```python
ENV_NAME = "FrozenLake-v0"   # name of the environment to be simulated 
NUM_EPISODES = 200          # number of episodes to train the agent
MAX_STEPS = 100             # maximum number of steps per episode
GAMMA = 0.9                 # discount factor
LR = 0.1                    # learning rate
EPSILON = 1.0               # exploration rate
MIN_EPSILON = 0.01          # minimum exploration rate
EPSILON_DECAY = 0.99        # decay rate of exploration rate
MEMORY_SIZE = 10000         # size of replay memory
BATCH_SIZE = 64             # batch size for updating value network
```

The above constants specify important parameters for the training process. We will discuss them later during the implementation phase. Now, let's create the environment object:

```python
env = gym.make(ENV_NAME)     # create the environment object
```

## MDPs and Policy Evaluation
An **M**arkov **D**ecision **Process** (MDP) is a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P_{ss'}, r_{s'a})$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of states, $|\mathcal{S}|$ denotes the cardinality of the state space, $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of actions, $|\mathcal{A}|$ denotes the cardinality of the action space, $P_{ss'}(s'\vert s, a)$ is the transition probability distribution of the next state given the current state and action, $r_{s'a}(s', a\vert s)$ is the immediate reward obtained upon arriving at the next state $s'$ from the current state $s$ after taking action $a$.

To perform policy evaluation, we iterate through each state in the environment and calculate its value function using the Bellman equation:

$$V^{\pi}(s)=\sum_{a}{\pi(a|s)\left[R_{sa}+\gamma V^{\pi}(\operatorname{T}(s,a))\right]}$$

Here, $V^{\pi}$ represents the value function associated with policy $\pi$, $R_{sa}$ is the reward obtained after taking action $a$ in state $s$, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $\operatorname{T}(s,a)$ refers to the state resulting from taking action $a$ in state $s$. The summation symbol indicates that we take the expectation over all possible next states $s'$ reachable from state $s$ via action $a$.

### Exercise 1: Computing State Values
Write a python function `compute_state_values()` to compute the state values using the formula mentioned above. You will also need to initialize the state values to zero before computing them. Use the following inputs to test your function:

```python
states = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]    # list of states to consider
actions = ['L', 'R', 'U', 'D']              # list of actions allowed in each state
rewards = [[0,-1,0,-1],[-1,0,-1,0],[0,-1,0,-1],[-1,0,-1,0]]      # immediate reward table for each state and action pair
transition = {((0, 0), 'L'): (0, 0), ((0, 0), 'R'): (0, 1),
              ((0, 0), 'U'): (-1, 0), ((0, 0), 'D'): (-1, 0),
              ((0, 1), 'L'): (0, 0), ((0, 1), 'R'): (0, 2),
              ((0, 1), 'U'): (-1, 1), ((0, 1), 'D'): (-1, 1),
              ((1, 0), 'L'): (0, 1), ((1, 0), 'R'): (0, 2),
              ((1, 0), 'U'): (-1, 0), ((1, 0), 'D'): (-1, 0),
              ((1, 1), 'L'): (0, 2), ((1, 1), 'R'): (0, 2),
              ((1, 1), 'U'): (-1, 1), ((1, 1), 'D'): (-1, 1)}   # transition probabilities for each state and action pair
policy = {'(0, 0)': 'R', '(0, 1)': 'R',
          '(1, 0)': 'U', '(1, 1)': 'D'}       # initial deterministic policy for the MDP
discount = 0.9                                # discount factor
init_vals = np.zeros((len(states)))           # initializing state values to zero
```

Note: Since there may be multiple paths leading to the same state, we cannot directly estimate the state values by counting the number of times they occur. Instead, we need to estimate the expected value of reaching those states. Therefore, we do not count visits or transitions to non-terminal states but only include visited terminal states in the update rule. We can accomplish this by adding the final state value multiplied by the probability of visiting that state.
