# 1.简介
  

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular classification algorithm used for both supervised learning and unsupervised learning tasks. In this article we will discuss how to implement the SVM algorithm in Python with the help of scikit-learn library. We will also demonstrate the working of the SVM classifier on an example dataset. 

Support Vector Machines are powerful machine learning algorithms that can be applied for various applications such as image processing, text analysis, bioinformatics, etc. The main purpose of SVM is to create a hyperplane or decision boundary between classes. It does so by finding the best separating hyperplane amongst all possible ones. The separation hyperplane depends upon the support vectors only. Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and provide the direction in which the margin should be maximized.

In this article we will explain how to use the scikit-learn library to perform the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Training
3. Model Evaluation
4. Prediction on New Data

# 2. Background Introduction 
The objective of this article is to describe step-by-step the implementation and application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using Python and scikit-learn library. Before we start, let us know some basic concepts about SVMs.<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>
## 2.1 Basic Concepts About SVM
### What is SVM?
SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. It is a type of binary classification algorithm that uses a hyperplane to separate data into two sets. The goal of the SVM algorithm is to find the best hyperplane that can maximize the margin between the data points belonging to different classes. The hyperplane represents the maximum marginal region where the samples from each class meet. When the new data point arrives at the SVM, it is assigned to one of these regions based on its proximity to the hyperplanes. 

Here’s what makes SVM interesting:<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>
### Types of SVMs
There are three types of SVMs:

1. Linear SVM - This is the most commonly used type of SVM where the decision boundaries are linear. If there are more than two classes then it creates multiple parallel hyperplanes.

2. Nonlinear SVM - This is not often used but if you have non-linearly separable data then it works well. One common approach is to add polynomial terms or radial basis function kernel to the dot product in the cost function of the optimization problem. 

3. Kernel SVM - It transforms the input features using a nonlinear feature mapping technique called the kernel trick and trains a linear model on the resulting features. Common kernels include linear, polynomial, Gaussian RBF (radial basis function), sigmoid, and precomputed matrix products.

We will focus on implementing linear SVM here since it is widely used for a wide range of problems.<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>
# 3. Algorithm & Operations

## 3.1 Data Preparation
Before training our model, we need to prepare the data set. Our data should be normalized and split into training and testing datasets. Normalization involves scaling down the values within a column to fit inside a certain range, like [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. Splitting the data into training and testing sets allows us to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Here is the code snippet for preprocessing the data using Scikit Learn:<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>
```python
from sklearn import preprocessing
import numpy as np

def preprocess(X):
    # scale the data between 0 and 1
    min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
    X = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(X)

    return X
    
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = load_data('path/to/dataset')
X_train = preprocess(X_train)
X_test = preprocess(X_test)
```

## 3.2 Model Training
Now that we have prepared the data, we can train our SVM model. We need to specify the parameters such as kernel, C, gamma, etc., depending on our choice of kernel. After initializing the SVC object, we call the `fit` method to train the model on the training dataset. Here is the code snippet for training the SVM model:<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>
```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

clf = SVC(kernel='rbf', random_state=0)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## 3.3 Model Evaluation
After training the SVM model, we want to evaluate its accuracy on the test dataset. We use the `score` method to calculate the accuracy score. Here is the code snippet for evaluating the SVM model:<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>
```python
accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy*100, "%")
```

## 3.4 Prediction on New Data
Once we have trained the SVM model and evaluated its accuracy on the test dataset, we can make predictions on new data. To do so, we simply call the `predict` method passing the new data to the model. Here is the code snippet for making predictions on new data:<|im_sep|>|<|im_sep|>
```python
new_prediction = clf.predict(new_data)
```

## Conclusion
In this article, we have discussed briefly about SVM algorithm, explained how it works and how to implement it in Python using scikit-learn library. We demonstrated the working of the SVM classifier on an example dataset. Now you understand how to apply the SVM algorithm effectively in your project.
