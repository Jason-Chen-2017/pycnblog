# 1.简介
  

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental natural language processing task that identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, times, etc. In this article, we will discuss how to train and evaluate NER models using deep learning techniques based on conditional random fields (CRF). We will also provide insights into popular NER algorithms, including bidirectional LSTM-CRFs, ELMo-CRFs, BERT-CRFs, and graph neural networks. Finally, we will present several benchmark datasets for measuring the performance of different NER models.

## 2.1 Tagging Sequences
Tagging refers to assigning tags or labels to each element of a sequence, typically a sentence, a document, or a word. The most commonly used type of tagger is a part-of-speech tagger that assigns words in a sentence their corresponding parts of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. Each token can be assigned multiple possible parts of speech depending on its context within the sentence. 

However, tagging named entities requires more sophisticated features than just part-of-speech tags. For example, we need to know whether an occurrence of "Apple" should be labeled as a company name or an actual fruit name. Similarly, if a location like "Los Angeles," which appears as a single token, needs to be labeled differently from individual tokens representing "Los" and "Angeles", it becomes even more complex. Thus, we require a different approach to solving the NER problem.

One way to address these issues is to use statistical models called sequence labelers. These models assign each position in a sequence one or more possible tags by considering both the current word and its surrounding context. A common method for training sequence labelers is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), where the probability of each tag given the preceding context is estimated from a set of annotated examples. However, MLE may not perform well because the number of possible contexts grows exponentially with respect to the length of the input sequence. To solve this issue, researchers have developed various approximations that reduce the size of the space of possible contexts while still capturing important information about the data. Some of the most successful ones are Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which allow us to define constraints over the sequence and calculate probabilities efficiently using dynamic programming. CRFs are often trained faster than other sequence labelers due to their ability to exploit parallelism through shared weights between consecutive time steps.

## 2.2 Types of Tagger
There are many types of sequence labelers available for NER tasks, ranging from simple unigram classifiers to neural networks. Here, we will focus on two widely used algorithms: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM-CRFs) or Elmo-CRFs.

### Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
The first algorithm we'll consider is a HMM, also known as a maximum entropy markov model. An HMM is a generative model that represents the joint distribution of observed variables X_1,..., X_n conditioned on hidden states Y_1,..., Y_n and initial state S. The goal of the model is to find the optimal path P(Y|X) from the initial state S to all other states so that the probability of generating the observed sequence X is maximized. 

Training an HMM involves initializing transition probabilities and observation distributions, then iteratively performing forward and backward passes to compute the marginal probability of observing the sequence, taking into account the prior knowledge of what constitutes the correct output labels. However, calculating the exact probability of every valid sequence would take exponential time and make the computation impractical for long sentences.

Instead, HMMs approximate the joint probability by assuming that there are only finitely many valid sequences and ignoring those outside of the finite set. One approach is to keep track of the most likely paths through the model during training, discarding unlikely ones later when testing. Other approximation techniques include Baum-Welch, Forward-Backward, and Viterbi algorithms.

### Bidirectional LSTM-CRF
Another approach is to use a BiLSTM-CRF architecture that uses bi-directional LSTM layers to encode the sequence and pass it through a fully connected layer before passing it through a linear chain CRF. Unlike regular sequence labelers that treat each position independently, the BiLSTM-CRF treats longer spans of text together, allowing them to capture global dependencies between positions. The CRF allows us to enforce consistency among the predicted tags at each position by propagating the evidence backwards through the model.

The training process involves optimizing the parameters of the LSTM and the CRF until convergence, similar to traditional HMM-based models. The end result is a probabilistic model that predicts the likelihood of the presence of each label given the input sequence. During inference, we can simply decode the highest scoring sequence of labels without worrying about any additional computations or approximations.

### Elmo-CRF
A third approach is to combine pre-trained representations of words with a CRF layer to improve the accuracy of NER predictions. One popular technique is to use ELMo embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of each word in a dense vector representation. However, creating high-quality ELMo embeddings requires significant computational resources and is currently beyond the capability of most research teams. Therefore, researchers have been developing alternative ways of incorporating ELMo embeddings into sequence labeling systems, such as concatenating them with character-level CNN encodings or adding them to the attention mechanism of the BiLSTM-CRF.

Overall, the choice of which type of sequence labeler to use depends largely on the amount of labeled data available, the desired tradeoff between speed and accuracy, and the specific characteristics of the input data. Nonetheless, the latest advances in NLP research have made it feasible to train accurate and efficient models for NER tasks, and picking the right tool for the job remains a challenging yet rewarding challenge for both researchers and developers.
