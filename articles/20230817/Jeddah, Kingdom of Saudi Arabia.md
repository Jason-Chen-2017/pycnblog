In the month of Ramadan in November 2019, thousands of Muslim leaders gathered for a crowd-funding campaign called #TheSaudiMuslimCampaign to rebuild the capital city of Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia after it was overtaken by terrorist attacks. It is one of the most significant military operations in Afghanistan's history and has brought severe humanitarian disasters such as the 7/7 explosion on July 11th 2005 that left hundreds dead, over 5 million refugees internally displaced, and billions in damage to infrastructure and properties. These crisis have not only affected millions but also caused many families to flee their home countries or move back to rural areas where they are often deprived of critical necessities such as food and water. In light of these challenges, we at The Climate Corporation believe that there should be an urgent need to address this issue urgently before further escalating conflicts with neighboring countries. This article will discuss how The Climate Corporation can help build a better future for our planet by supporting and empowering communities across the region to take action towards making Jeddah a safer and more sustainable place to live and work in.

## Background Introduction
Jeddah is located in the northern border province of Kurdistan in modern day Saudi Arabia. It is the largest city in Afghanistan and the capital of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). For centuries, the city has been under siege from various sides including communists, nationalists, armed groups, and paramilitary forces. However, during recent years, several efforts have been made to restore its stability and prosperity. 

On October 3rd, 2011, <NAME>, son of the late Sufi historian Jahiz Mulla, executed a brutal coup d'etat in response to the presence of Communist troops near Jeddah. He ordered the massacre of his family members, as well as several others he deemed unacceptable within his own family circle. Although much public criticism followed, Fatah continued to lead the government until May 2nd, 2013 when he resigned after months of political turmoil. As a result, the Saudi Government had released all levels of police power to contain the violence, except for highway patrols which were placed under guard by local security forces led by King Hassan Ali al-Saud, acting through the Saudi National Police.

Shortly afterwards, Al-Shamm al-Dakari attacked Jeddah and ultimately destroyed two buildings. Following this incident, the rebels declared themselves the "Resistance" and began an offensive against the Saudi government. Despite the intense pressure from both sides, the Saudis managed to restore order, rebuild some buildings, and rescue many people who were forced out of the country due to the fighting. In April 2016, President Bernie Sanders announced plans to build new housing units in Jeddah and grant universal healthcare access to citizens regardless of religion, race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Within three days, however, Saudi Arabia became involved in a series of attacks against various targets, including resistance agents, militant organizations, and human rights activists, leading to widespread protests and demonstrations across the region. Eventually, President Bernie held a sitting presidential election that resulted in the loss of the popular vote.

In September 2018, an Islamic State group led by Bashar al-Assad invaded Jeddah and seized control of the city. They conducted a raid that killed dozens of non-Muslims and claimed the identity of many Muslim prisoners. Since then, the situation has remained tense and unresolved, with many Muslims having lost faith and distrusting the institutions that ruled them. Despite numerous attempts by various parties to bring about change, little progress has been made yet.

It is essential now for us to confront the enormous challenges posed by the climate crisis and provide aid to our planet. We must do so with the utmost care and passion because if we fail to act swiftly, the damage already done cannot be undone and we risk being vulnerable again. One way to ensure that we don't repeat the mistakes of past generations is to support communities across the region to come up with solutions and make a real difference in addressing the issues at hand.

To achieve this goal, we propose building community capacity and enabling economic growth opportunities in Jeddah by:

1. Developing and implementing successful programs to address climate change
2. Encouraging women to join the military and become active soldiers, especially female recruits
3. Establishing institutions that promote social inclusion and reduce prejudice based on sex, ethnicity, religion, or national origin
4. Promoting research into renewable energy technologies and utilizing them to minimize greenhouse gas emissions
5. Offering financial assistance to eligible communities for upgrading buildings and investments in renewable energy sources

## Basic Concepts and Terminology
**Climate Change**: refers to any global warming trend that occurs due to an increase in the temperature of the Earth's surface. It is a problem that affects every sector of our lives including industries, transportation, energy production, and food consumption. Therefore, climate change is causing serious environmental impacts such as sea level rise, air pollution, acid rain, and extreme weather events. Climate change is predicted to occur with increasing frequency and intensity starting from around 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. According to IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, there are four main types of global warming: 

1. **Thermal expansion:** increases the average height and thickness of the Earth's crust, resulting in warmer conditions for existing ice sheets, glaciers, and continents; 
2. **Global mean temperature increase:** increases the average global temperature by around 0.8 to 1 degree Celsius compared to pre-industrial times;
3. **Ocean acidification and freshwater eutrophication:** decrease the ability of plankton and animals to thrive under changing conditions, leading to increased salinity, nutrient depletion, and oxygen scarcity; and 
4. **Land-use changes and forestry practices:** increase carbon emissions by converting forests and natural resources into cities, resulting in an accelerated warming of cities and coastlines.

**Natural Resources**: includes terrestrial ecosystems like forests, grasslands, and wetlands, as well as marine ecosystems like seas, lakes, and rivers. Natural resources are essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems and providing habitats for diverse species. From the point of view of mitigating climate change impacts, natural resources can include reducing or avoiding land-use changes, adopting sustainable management techniques, using alternative energy sources, and growing crops in more productive systems.

**Energy Technologies**: refer to any technology that uses renewable energy sources to generate electricity or heat. Energy technologies can range from simple small scale solar panels to large scale wind farms. The key feature of renewable energy technologies is that they produce energy without relying on fuel conversion processes that release harmful gases into the atmosphere. Reusing unused resources ensures that the world remains connected and functioning efficiently. From the point of view of mitigating climate change impacts, energy technologies can include utilizing renewable sources instead of traditional ones, improving efficiency of current generation technologies, and exploring other ways to generate electricity like hydroelectricity and bioenergy. 

**Communities**: represent the collective bodies of individuals who share common characteristics, interests, cultures, languages, and values. Communities can vary in size from small villages to vast metropolitan cities, but they are characterised by shared beliefs, customs, and traditions. Communities play a vital role in the development and maintenance of social and cultural institutions that are integral to the survival of societies. From the point of view of mitigating climate change impacts, communities can strengthen local institutions and policies that support adaptability, social investment, and innovation.  

**Economics**: is the science of managing resources to obtain goods and services for profit. Economics involves fundamental principles that guide decision-making among different actors including governments, businesses, individuals, and nations. In particular, economics plays a critical role in shaping the trajectory of global economies and helps to develop societies that are resilient to climate change. Climate change affects every industry and every segment of the economy equally. To combat climate change, governments, business leaders, and education workers need to understand the complex interdependencies between energy use, food supply, water flows, waste management, and industry activities.
