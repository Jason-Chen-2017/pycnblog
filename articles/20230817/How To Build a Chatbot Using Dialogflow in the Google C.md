Dialogflow is one of the most popular chatbot building platforms available today with over 20 languages supported and tons of templates for building bots from scratch. In this article we will explore how to create our own chatbot using Dialogflow by following these steps:
1. Setting up a new project in Dialogflow.
2. Building an intent-based chatbot.
3. Adding FAQs and enabling Google Assistant integration.

By the end of this tutorial, you should have successfully built your first chatbot on the Dialogflow platform which can interact with users and provide answers based on their queries. We hope that this guide will be helpful to those who are interested in creating their own chatbots or need help setting them up.

This blog post assumes knowledge of basic concepts such as Python programming language, JSON format data structure, APIs, web development, and cloud computing. 

Let's get started!
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
Before getting into technical details, let’s learn about some basic concepts related to Dialogflow and the terminology used in it.

1. **Project**: A Dialogflow project is a container that holds all the configurations and data associated with the chatbot being created. It consists of several settings, entities, intents, training phrases, and responses. Each project has its own unique ID assigned to it. 

2. **Intent:** An Intent represents what a user wants and includes information such as what kind of request they want to make (e.g., greeting, asking age), what data needs to be collected, and what action(s) the bot should take after processing the query (e.g., providing weather reports). Intents are defined in natural language sentences with clear parameters and actions specified using placeholders. The intent model is trained using examples of both input and output states representing different scenarios and conversations between human and bot.

3. **Entities:** Entities represent specific types of data that need to be extracted from the user query. For example, if the user asks “What time does the train leave?” then there may not be any entity associated with "train". However, if the user says “Book me a ticket to Paris”, then the entity would be "location" as that is the relevant piece of information required to process the query.

4. **Training Phrases** - Training phrases represent sample utterances spoken by the user. They must cover all variations of user input that might occur during normal conversation flow. Example training phrases could include “what time is it now?” or “book me a ticket”.

5. **Responses** - Responses define what the chatbot should respond when given certain inputs from the user. They can either be plain text messages, suggestions for follow-up questions, or links to external websites where more detailed content can be found. Examples of response text could include “The current time is 9am,” or “I can assist you in booking a flight.”

Now that we understand the basic concepts of Dialogflow, let’s move forward to build our first chatbot using Dialogflow. 
# 3. Creating a New Project in Dialogflow
To start building our chatbot using Dialogflow, we first need to set up a new project. Follow these steps to do so:


2. Click on Create Agent button on top left corner to start a new agent creation process. You can give your agent a name and description. Once done, click on CREATE button at the bottom right corner of the page.




3. After clicking on the Create button, you will see the dialogflow home screen. Here, select the Language option from the drop down menu on the top right corner and choose the language in which you want to build your chatbot. You can also add additional agents under the dropdown list if you have multiple projects. 


 

 4. Now you will come across the Welcome Screen of the Dialogflow. This is where you will find important insights about your chatbot, like your agent statistics, recent changes made to the agent, and usage trends. Understand the insights provided here and start understanding the features offered by Dialogflow.


 5. Select the Knowledge Base tab on the left side bar. This section contains various prebuilt templates, FAQs, and other resources for building better conversational experiences. These tools can greatly speed up the designing process and save significant amount of time compared to starting from scratch. So choose wisely!
 
We are now ready to start building our chatbot. Let’s head to step #4 to create an intent-based chatbot.
