As data science becomes increasingly important in today’s world, it is essential for anyone interested in this field to have solid knowledge and skills related to the analysis of large datasets. However, most people are not willing or able to invest time and effort into studying advanced data science techniques such as machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and complex statistical concepts.
To make matters worse, many data scientists lack the patience and determination to work hard towards mastering these techniques. In fact, some even believe that they cannot afford to spend their valuable time on this subject due to the high costs involved in acquiring necessary tools and resources. Despite the challenges, there has been no effective way of teaching data scientists how to improve their skill set through hands-on exercises, interactive tutorials, and courseware. The common conclusion among data scientists is that “it takes more than just theory to become good at data.” Therefore, I would like to propose a novel approach for training and encouraging data scientists to develop their technical and analytical skills by doing. This article will guide you from entry-level to intermediate level by explaining various approaches for developing your data science skills while also highlighting relevant insights and best practices. Additionally, I hope that my proposal can provide practical solutions that save you time and money, and enable you to start working on real-world problems right away without any hassle or frustration. Let's get started! 

# 2. Background Introduction
Data science involves extracting meaningful insights from raw data collected over years, months, or days. It involves using various data processing techniques, including numerical calculations, text mining, image recognition, etc., to transform raw data into useful information. This process involves analyzing large amounts of structured and unstructured data, handling massive volumes of data, and applying statistical methods to identify patterns and trends within the data. As such, becoming a successful data scientist requires great ability in understanding both theoretical foundations and practical applications of data science technologies. To succeed, one must have strong analytical and programming skills along with mathematical literacy and problem-solving abilities. Here are three key roles that play a crucial role in being a better data scientist:

1. Problem Solving Ability: Understanding the underlying principles behind different types of data and solving complex problems requires critical thinking and logical reasoning skills. By identifying patterns and relationships between data sets, researchers can extract valuable insights that can help solve business problems or improve existing processes. Becoming proficient in this area requires continuous practice and mentorship from experienced colleagues.

2. Programming Skills: The field of data science involves dealing with large volumes of data and generating insights from them. The use of programming languages, such as Python, R, Java, SQL, etc., makes up a significant portion of data scientist’s toolkit. Programming allows for efficient processing and manipulation of data, which in turn helps to derive actionable insights. Proficiency in these languages is crucial for building robust data pipelines, creating automated workflows, and leveraging cloud computing platforms. 

3. Mathematical Literacy: Much of modern data science relies heavily on statistics and probability, which require extensive mathematical background and understanding. Knowledge of basic probability distributions, linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations are essential for conducting rigorous analysis of data. Many online courses, books, and educational materials exist to assist data scientists in learning these topics effectively. Ultimately, strong mathematical foundation is what separates the top performers from the ordinary ones.

In summary, becoming a better data scientist involves learning multiple technical skills, including problem-solving, programming, and mathematics, and combining these skills to build reliable and efficient data analysis tools and systems. Building up the required skills can take time but pays off handsomely in the long run.
