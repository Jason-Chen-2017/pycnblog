Black-box optimisation (BBO) is a popular optimization technique for solving problems that do not have any analytical solution or where finding such solutions would be too expensive. It involves the use of probabilistic models and Monte Carlo simulations in order to sample from the possible outcomes of an objective function without having access to its explicit form. The goal is then to find the input configuration(s) that maximise/minimise the objective function, given some constraints on the values of certain inputs. BBO has been used extensively in a wide range of fields including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, energy systems design, transportation planning, ecology research and others. Here, we will give a comprehensive guide to implementing BBO algorithms in Python with code examples. We start by defining the basic concepts involved in BBO like problem definition, decision variables, objectives functions and constraints. Then, we discuss about common black-box optimisation techniques such as Simulated Annealing, Particle Swarm Optimization, Bayesian Optimization etc., and implement them in Python. Finally, we showcase several real world applications of BBO applied in various domains to gain insights into their effectiveness and limitations. Overall, this article provides an accessible resource for anyone interested in implementing BBO techniques and applying it to solve complex problems.

## Problem Definition:
The first step towards implementing black box optimisation is to define the problem statement. In BBO, we are usually trying to minimize or maximize an objective function f(x), which takes in x as input and produces a scalar value output. Let's assume our problem has n decision variables x = {x_i}, i=1,...,n, where each xi can take on one of k possible values. For example, if we are dealing with a binary classification task, we might have two classes labeled as +1 and -1 and want to learn a classifier that can classify new data points according to these labels. We can represent our decision space as X = [x_1,..., x_n]^n, where every row corresponds to a different input configuration x. Similarly, let y denote the corresponding target variable for each input configuration. Thus, our problem is defined by a set of input configurations X and their corresponding targets Y, along with the number of decision variables n and the number of possible values they can take on k.

We may also encounter additional parameters such as noise levels and cost coefficients associated with misclassifying samples. These could affect the performance metric such as accuracy, so it is important to consider how we should weight these factors when evaluating the performance of our model.

Lastly, there may be constraints imposed on the decision variables by the problem definition itself, such as positive values only for certain variables or satisfying specific mathematical relationships between variables. Constraints act as penalties on the objective function when violated, making it harder to optimize than simply minimizing or maximising the unconstrained version.

## Decision Variables:In machine learning and optimization, decision variables refer to the variables whose values are being optimized over. They typically correspond to input features or hyperparameters that influence the outcome of our algorithm. For instance, in logistic regression, the decision variables include the weights theta, while in neural networks, they include the biases b and the activation values z. Essentially, all machine learning algorithms rely heavily on these decision variables, so understanding their role is crucial in understanding BBO algorithms.

## Objective Functions:Objective functions describe what we want to achieve during our optimization process. In traditional optimization, we aim to find the minimum or maximum point of a function within some prescribed bounds. However, in BBO, we don't know anything beforehand, and need to explore the entire search space in hopes of finding the best solution. Therefore, instead of providing a global optimum directly, we provide an approximation of it through sampling. This requires us to specify an objective function that evaluates the quality of our current position in the search space, and returns a score indicating how good it is compared to other positions. In addition, the choice of objective function affects both convergence speed and final results, so choosing one appropriately is critical for achieving better results.

Common objective functions for BBO include mean squared error (MSE), cross entropy loss, KL divergence, rank ordering, log likelihood ratio, cumulative regret, probability of improvement and expected improvement. Each of these functions depends on the nature of our problem at hand, but they share a fundamental pattern: they compare the predicted value versus the actual value, weighted by some penalty term that reflects the uncertainty inherent in making predictions due to limited data or incorrect assumptions. Choosing the appropriate objective function plays a crucial role in determining whether BBO reaches a reasonable result or diverges prematurely. Moreover, depending on the context, different types of constraints might also play a significant role in limiting the search space and improving the overall performance of our algorithm. 

## Constraints:Constraints are conditions placed on the decision variables that must hold true at all times. They limit the region of the search space that the optimizer can explore, ensuring that we stay focused on promising regions and avoid trapping ourselves in local minima or saddle points. Common constraint types include feasibility constraints, bound constraints, integrality constraints, parity constraints, separability constraints, adjacency constraints and symmetry constraints. Depending on the type of problem, some constraints may require special treatment, while others may just be relaxed versions of the original objective function. Additionally, multiple constraints can be combined together to create more complex structures, which can help to improve exploration efficiency and focus on areas of interest.  

## Solution Strategy:Now that we understand the key components of BBO, we can talk about how to approach solving a particular problem. There are many strategies available for tackling BBO problems, ranging from greedy methods like hill climbing and steepest descent to randomized approaches like simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. Our goal is to choose an appropriate strategy that balances exploration and exploitation, effectively exploring regions of the search space that seem promising initially but eventually converge to a global optimum. By combining different optimization techniques and incorporating domain knowledge into our evaluation function, we can often produce highly effective solutions that satisfy various constraints and meet desired accuracy requirements. Nevertheless, selecting the right combination of techniques and tweaking their hyperparameters can still prove challenging, particularly when working with high-dimensional spaces or non-convex optimization problems. To address this challenge, we introduce two additional aspects of BBO called acquisition functions and surrogate models.

## Acquisition Functions:Acquisition functions determine the next location to sample based on the current state of the search process. In practice, acquisition functions are implemented as trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, encouraging the search to exploit promising regions of the search space while avoiding suboptimal ones. Popular acquisition functions include probability of improvement, expected improvement, upper confidence bound (UCB), thompson sampling, and dropout sampling. Ultimately, we need to strike a balance between exploring regions of the search space efficiently and finding the most valuable area of the space quickly. Acquisition functions help ensure that our optimizer explores the regions with high probability of finding the optimal solution, even if it means visiting some locations less frequently. On the other hand, if we get stuck in a suboptimal area, the acquisition function tells us to backtrack and try a different direction, potentially leading to a much better solution overall. When considering multi-objective optimization, we can use tools like pareto-frontier analysis to identify promising regions of the search space, rather than relying solely on single-objective metrics like the objective function.

## Surrogate Models:Surrogate models approximate the objective function, which allows us to estimate the gradient and make predictions on new input configurations. They can significantly reduce computation time and memory usage required for exact optimization procedures, especially in high-dimensional settings. Popular surrogate models include linear regression, gaussian processes, support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and radial basis functions (RBF). The choice of surrogate model also impacts the quality of our predictions, since it captures the underlying relationships in the data better than a simple histogram or density plot. If our surrogate model does not accurately capture the behavior of the true objective function, it can lead to poor performance or instability in our algorithm.

## Simulated Annealing (SA):This method was originally introduced in 1983 by Dr. Jones et al., who were looking for ways to avoid getting stuck in local optima. SA works by simulating a Markov chain that transitions between candidate solutions based on the current temperature T, starting from the initial guess x^0. At each iteration, we accept a candidate solution with higher objective value than the current solution with probability exp(-Δf/T), where Δf is the change in the objective value. Otherwise, we move closer to the current solution with probability exp(-Δs/T), where Δs is the distance moved away from the current solution. Intuitively, we gradually decrease the temperature as we become confident in our current solution, hoping to escape local minima early on and reach the global optimum later. 

Mathematically, suppose we have an initial guess x^0, a cooling schedule γ, and an acceptance rate ρ. We can write the transition probabilities as follows: 

P_{ac}=\exp(-\Delta f/T)=\frac{e^{-(\Delta f+c)/T}}{Z}, P_{re}= \exp(-\Delta s/T)=\frac{e^{-\Delta s/T}}{Z}

where c represents a constant shift to break ties between equal objective values, Z is a normalization factor that ensures that the sum of probabilities across states sums up to 1, and ∆f and ∆s represent the difference in objective values and distances between the proposed and current solutions respectively.

At each iteration, we update the current solution x^(t) to x^{(t+1)} using the following equation:

x^{(t+1)}=\begin{cases} argmax\_{x}\left\{f(x)+\gamma{(T_t-T_{t-1})}\log|\frac{\pi(x|X_{\leq t})}{\pi(x'|X_{\leq t-1})}|+\alpha |\frac{K}{N}|\sum_{i<j}^{N}\ell_{C}(x_i,x_j)|\right\}\\argmin\_{x}\left\{g(x)-\gamma{(T_t-T_{t-1})}\log|\frac{\pi(x|X_{\leq t})}{\pi(x'|X_{\leq t-1})}|-\beta|\frac{K}{N}|\sum_{i<j}^{N}\ell_{C}(x_i,x_j)| \end{cases}

where f and g are the objective functions under consideration, $\pi$ is the proposal distribution, $X_{\leq t}$ is the subset of training points visited so far, C is a convexity constraint, and N is the total number of training points seen so far. The gamma parameter controls the rate of cooling, and alpha and beta control the importance of diversity and robustness, respectively. 

## Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another popular optimization algorithm that belongs to the class of metaheuristics known as population-based optimizers. Unlike standard optimizers like gradient descent and differential evolution, PSO maintains a pool of particles that continuously adjust themselves to search for the best solution among a population of candidate solutions. Each particle consists of an individual's position and velocity vectors, and interacts with its neighbors to move around the search space. In contrast to the global nature of genetic algorithms, PSO focuses on searching the search space locally, allowing it to find good solutions even in cases where the global optimum cannot be found directly. Like SA, PSO can handle complicated search spaces and constraints, but it requires careful initialization and tuning to obtain good results.

The core idea behind PSO is to maintain a swarm of particles that collectively traverse the search space and attempt to find the global optimum. At each iteration, each particle updates its position and velocity vectors based on three rules:

1. Rule 1: Move to Best Neighbourhood: Each particle moves towards the best neighbouring particle in the swarm, ideally moving in a straight line towards the optimum. 

2. Rule 2: Velocity Rescaling: As the particle traverses the search space, its velocity vector needs to rescale to prevent it from running away out of control. The rescaling coefficient α determines how fast the velocity vector decreases in size as it moves towards the optimum. 

3. Rule 3: Local Search: Once a particle finds its optimal neighbouring particle, it proceeds to perform a local search to refine its position until the optimal solution is reached. The size of the local search step is determined by the personal best option of the previous search step.

Mathematically, let S(t) be the swarm at time t and P(i) be the position vector of the i-th particle. The dynamics of the particle movement can be described using the following equations:

Velocity Vector Update: v[i]=(w*v[i]+c1r[1][i]*(pbest[i]-p[i])+c2r[2][i]*(gbest-p[i]))
Position Vector Update: p[i]=p[i]+v[i]

where w, c1, and c2 are constants, r[1], r[2] are random numbers uniformly distributed on [-1,1], pb[i] and pbest are the personal best positions and velocities of the i-th particle respectively, and gbest is the global best position of the swarm.

To select the best neighboring particle, PSO uses a ring topology, meaning that each particle is connected to its closest neighbor and the farthest neighbor. Specifically, if there are m particles in the swarm, the position of particle j can be represented as a function of the indices of its nearest and second-nearest neighbours as follows:

pj=r1*(p[i-m]+p[(i+1)%m])+(1-r1)*((1-rho)*(p[i-m]+p[(i+1)%m])+(rho)*pbest[i]) 

where rho is chosen randomly between 0 and 1, r1 is chosen randomly between 0 and 1, and i is the index of the current particle. By varying the value of rho and r1, PSO can navigate the swarm and find the best and second-best neighbouring particles efficiently. 

## Bayesian Optimization (BO):Bayesian optimization (BO) is a variant of global optimization that combines the advantages of sequential global optimization and probabilistic inference. BO constructs a predictive model of the objective function based on previously observed evaluations, and selects new queries based on the belief over the future performance of those queries. The main advantage of BO over classic global optimization methods is its ability to adapt to changing environments and the possibility of drawing insights from past observations.

BO begins by modeling the relationship between the inputs and outputs using a probabilistic model, which assumes that the next evaluation is dependent on the historical information gathered so far. Starting from a prior distribution over the input space, BO iteratively identifies the most informative regions of the search space based on the empirical performance of the function evaluated on those regions. Based on this information, BO constructs a surrogate model that approximates the true objective function. At each iteration, BO selects the next query point based on the belief over the future performance of those queries, either by querying the unknown objective function directly or by constructing a surrogate model and using its predictions.

One of the primary challenges in BO is handling high-dimensional input spaces and non-convex objective functions. One way to address these issues is to use kernel smoothing techniques, which transform the input space into a low-dimensional feature space using a non-parametric kernel function. This makes it easier to reason about and manipulate the boundaries of the search space and find the global optimum. Another aspect is the selection of the acquisition function, which determines the next query point based on the current belief about the function's behavior. Popular choices include expected improvement, lower confidence bound (LCB), and probability of improvement.

Finally, BO relies heavily on the availability of accurate historical measurements of the objective function, which can be difficult to come by in large engineering and scientific contexts. To mitigate this issue, BO introduces two additional techniques: active learning and batch Bayesian optimization. Active learning refers to the process of identifying useful parts of the input space for further measurement, rather than measuring the whole input space sequentially. Batch Bayesian optimization is a variant of BO that operates on batches of points collected throughout the optimization process. This can dramatically reduce the computational burden and enable efficient exploration of the search space.
