Word embeddings are a popular choice for representing text in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, or named entity recognition. In this article, we will first provide an overview of the word embedding model with some basic concepts and then talk about how it is applied in NLP tasks. We will also discuss limitations of using pre-trained models and address them by introducing the concept of transfer learning and fine tuning. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion on further research directions in this area. Overall, our goal is to provide a comprehensive technical article that provides readers with a solid understanding of word embeddings and its applications in NLP. 

The following sections outline the major points of the article:

1. Background introduction: This section briefly introduces the field of natural language processing (NLP), including what is NLP, why do we need it, and where can you use it? It discusses both techniques used for analyzing and generating natural language, e.g., statistical methods and deep learning. 

2. Basic Concepts and Terminology: This section presents the key terms and concepts needed for understanding word embeddings. Namely, word embeddings are dense representations of words, which capture various semantic and syntactic properties of words. They are learned from large corpora of text data, enabling us to perform powerful NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling without relying on handcrafted features. The core idea behind word embeddings is that similar words tend to have similar representations while dissimilar words have different representations. In this way, they can be used to represent any given sentence in vector space format, making them ideal for input into downstream NLP tasks. 

3. Core Algorithm and Operations: This section goes through the mathematical details of the popular Word2Vec algorithm, one of the most commonly used word embedding algorithms. Specifically, we will explain the main ideas behind the algorithm and describe how it works. Furthermore, we will illustrate how the algorithm learns the embeddings and applies them to downstream NLP tasks. 

4. Code Implementation and Explanation: This section shows how to implement the Word2Vec algorithm in Python programming language and explains the working mechanism of the algorithm step by step. Additionally, we will demonstrate how to apply these embeddings to common NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition. 

5. Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning: This section covers the concept of transfer learning and demonstrates how it can improve the performance of neural network based NLP models. Moreover, we will present examples of how to adapt pre-trained word embeddings for specific tasks by finetuning the model parameters.  

6. Future Research Directions: Finally, we will explore potential future research directions related to word embeddings and share some insights on whether the existing state-of-the-art models still hold their promise or if there are new approaches that may take over. We hope that this article would help to understand more about the current state of word embedding technology and guide developers towards building better tools for handling language. 

# 2.1 Background Introduction
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, enabling machines to derive meaning from natural language inputs. Within NLP, several areas focus on the representation and manipulation of language data, including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic modeling. These applications range from simple information retrieval and classification tasks to complex problems such as machine translation and question answering systems.

In order to enable advanced NLP tasks, AI researchers have developed many techniques such as machine learning, natural language understanding, and computational linguistics. One particularly important technique in NLP is called "word embeddings," which map each word in a vocabulary to a high-dimensional vector space where the similarity between words can be measured. By representing words in this manner, modern NLP systems can learn abstract representations of language that are more robust than traditional bag-of-words approaches and outperform significantly on certain benchmarks for supervised learning tasks.

However, training word embeddings requires significant amounts of data and computing resources, making it challenging for even moderate sized datasets. Therefore, many researches seek to leverage pre-trained word embeddings that were trained on massive corpora of text data, making it easy for researchers to train their own models on top of them. While pre-trained word embeddings offer significant benefits in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, they also come with a set of drawbacks. For instance, they may not reflect the variations or contexts within a domain well enough to handle rare or noisy words effectively, whereas self-trained models can adapt to those situations by taking advantage of additional labeled data or improved initialization strategies.
