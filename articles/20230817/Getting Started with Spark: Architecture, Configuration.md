# 1.简介
  

Apache Spark is a distributed computing framework designed for high-scale data processing and real-time analytics. It provides APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R languages that can be used to process large datasets on clusters of computers or machines, either standalone or as part of other applications. In this article, we will focus on the core concepts, architecture, configuration, usage and some technical details such as execution plans, shuffle operations, caching mechanisms etc. We will also discuss about the integration with different Hadoop distributions like Cloudera CDH, Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP), MapR, Amazon EMR and their differences in terms of performance, features, setup and usage. Finally, we will talk about how to choose the right distribution based on our requirements and preferences. 

In this article, we assume readers are familiar with basic programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, functions and objects, file handling, HTTP requests, RESTful web services, databases, SQL queries etc., and have some knowledge of Linux operating system commands. If you are completely new to Apache Spark, it may take time to understand all these concepts and technologies. However, don’t worry! The concepts covered here should help you get started with Spark easily without any prior experience. At the end of this article, you will be able to run your first Spark application successfully.

This article will not cover advanced topics such as fault tolerance, security, tuning, monitoring, debugging, scaling up/down etc., which require more expertise in distributed systems and Big Data technologies. These topics include but are not limited to topic related to hardware provisioning, deploying Spark on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes etc., leveraging various tools like Hadoop YARN, Mesos, Kafka, Zookeeper etc., handling big data streaming scenarios, working with external databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, MongoDB etc. We recommend reading relevant articles from these sources for further studying.

We hope this article will serve as a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn more about Apache Spark. Let's get started by understanding its key concepts.
# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Distributed Computing Framework
The Apache Spark project was initially released in March 2014. It has gained immense popularity due to its ability to perform parallel computation over large datasets at scale. As an open source project, Apache Spark allows developers to build scalable distributed computing solutions using diverse programming languages including Java, Scala, Python, and R.

A distributed computing framework refers to software that enables tasks to be executed across multiple nodes or machines in a network. There are many different types of frameworks available today. Some popular ones include Hadoop, Apache Hadoop YARN, Apache Mesos, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Google Cloud Dataproc, Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) etc. Each one offers unique advantages depending on the specific use case and requires special skills and knowledge to implement complex algorithms. Apache Spark is often referred to as “the de facto” distributed computing framework. 

Spark uses a cluster manager called Apache Hadoop YARN to manage resources across multiple nodes in a cluster. When an application starts running, it typically consists of several components that work together to achieve a goal. Here is a brief overview of each component:

1. Driver program: This is the main program that runs on the master node. It initializes the Spark context, sets the environment variables, reads input data, applies transformations and actions, and outputs the result. The driver program usually resides on a single machine within the cluster.

2. Executor processes: These are lightweight programs that are launched on worker nodes and execute tasks assigned by the driver program. Executors can be configured dynamically based on the workload and resource availability of the cluster. They continuously monitor the status of the remaining tasks until they reach completion. 

3. Cluster Manager: This is responsible for managing the resources and scheduling jobs between the executors and driver program. Different implementations exist depending on the chosen cluster manager, such as YARN, Mesos, Standalone mode etc.

4. Task Scheduler: This schedules the tasks that need to be performed by the executors. It assigns them to idle executor processes or creates new ones if necessary. Currently, there are two task schedulers implemented in Spark - FIFO scheduler and Coarse Grained Scheduling Pool (CSUP).

5. Shuffle Operations: This step involves moving data around the cluster during data processing. A large amount of intermediate data generated during the course of an analysis needs to be stored somewhere so that subsequent steps can access it efficiently. The default implementation of Spark uses Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as its storage layer. By default, Spark shuffles data using map-reduce-like operations where partitions of data are divided among the executors and sorted before being sent back to the driver program for aggregation.

6. Broadcast Variables: This feature helps to distribute immutable global data to all nodes in the cluster, making it easy to share information between different parts of an application. During data shuffling, broadcast variables are automatically transferred to each executor when needed instead of sending it separately every time. This improves performance significantly because data does not need to be repeatedly serialized and deserialized.

7. Serialization and Deserialization: All data passed between Spark components is serialized and deserialized, ensuring that it is consistent throughout the entire workflow. This includes tasks, stages, and jobs. Users do not interact directly with serialization, but this concept plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of Spark applications.

Overall, Spark provides a highly optimized platform for building distributed computing applications that can handle massive amounts of data quickly and efficiently. Its flexible architecture makes it suitable for diverse use cases such as batch processing, real-time processing, graph processing, and machine learning. Additionally, Spark supports wide range of programming languages including Java, Scala, Python, and R, making it easier for developers to integrate into existing workflows.

## Jobs, Stages, Tasks, and Partitions
In Spark, tasks represent the smallest unit of work that gets processed. When a job is submitted to Spark, it splits itself into logical units called stages. Each stage contains multiple tasks that run concurrently on separate nodes within the cluster. Each partition represents a subset of the data that is processed by a particular task. The number of partitions varies depending on the size of the dataset and the degree of parallelization requested by the user.

Here is an example of what happens behind the scenes while running a simple word count application:

Suppose we have a text file containing the following words: "hello world spark". Assuming that we want to split the file into words and count them individually, then Spark breaks down the overall job into three stages:

1. The first stage takes care of splitting the file into individual lines. Since this is a small file, only one partition is created for the whole file.

2. The second stage takes care of tokenizing each line into words and counting them. Again, since the file is relatively small, only one partition is required for the output of this stage. Thus, two tasks are spawned for this stage. One task works on partition 0 and produces the output for partition 0, whereas another task works on partition 1 and produces the output for partition 1.

3. The third stage simply combines the results from both tasks and prints out the final counts for each word. Again, since the total count of distinct words is very low (< 10^4 in this case), only one partition is created for the output of this stage. Thus, only one task is spawned for this stage. 

After all stages finish executing, we would see the output showing the count for each word ("hello":1, "world":1, "spark":1). This illustrates how Spark handles different aspects of a distributed computing problem, such as breaking down a large problem into smaller pieces, assigning those pieces to different nodes, aggregating the results, and printing them out.
