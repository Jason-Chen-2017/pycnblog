# 2.Computer Vision Overview
Computer vision is the task of understanding and processing visual information in order to extract valuable insights and knowledge from it. It covers a wide range of topics such as image classification, object detection, depth estimation, semantic segmentation, motion analysis, and scene reconstruction. In this section, we will briefly cover some fundamental concepts related to computer vision before moving on to describe each technology area separately. 




## 2.1 Fundamental Concepts
The following are some essential principles and techniques that apply across all areas of computer vision:

1. Transforms: Images can be represented as matrices of pixels where each pixel represents its brightness or color value. However, these matrices can have many dimensions, making them difficult to work with directly. Therefore, computer vision algorithms often transform images by applying mathematical operations called transforms. Examples include resizing, rotating, shifting, and flipping an image. Transforming images helps us focus on important features of the image rather than having to analyze every individual pixel. 

2. CNNs: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one type of deep learning algorithm used for computer vision tasks. They consist of layers of interconnected filters that learn to recognize patterns in the input data. The strength of CNNs comes from their ability to capture complex relationships between features in the input data and can effectively detect objects, boundaries, and even textures within an image. 

3. Activation Maps: Once an image has been transformed using a convolutional layer, it typically passes through several more layers of processing until it reaches its final output. These layers involve calculating various quantities based on the transformed image. One common type of output is an activation map, which shows what parts of the original image were activated during the transformation process. This allows us to identify regions of interest within the image. 

In summary, fundamentals like transforms and CNNs provide the basis for working with images in different ways. Activations maps allow us to see exactly what parts of the image led to certain outputs. Now let's discuss specific technologies such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. 


# 3.Image Classification
Image classification refers to the task of automatically assigning labels or categories to a set of images based on their contents. We want to develop an algorithm that can accurately determine what an image contains without manual labeling or tagging. To accomplish this, we need to train a model on a large dataset of labeled images. There are two main approaches to perform image classification - feature extraction and feature learning. Let’s start by discussing feature extraction. 





# Feature Extraction Methods 
Feature extraction methods involve representing the raw pixels of an image as a fixed-size vector representation known as a feature vector. A variety of feature extraction techniques exist, including hand-crafted features like color histograms and spatial transformations, and learned features like deep neural networks trained on large datasets. Here we will introduce two popular feature extraction techniques, namely Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
