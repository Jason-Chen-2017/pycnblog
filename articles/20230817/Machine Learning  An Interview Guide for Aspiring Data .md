# 2.Introduction To Machine Learning
## 2.1 What Is Machine Learning? 
Machine learning refers to the study of computer programs that can improve automatically through experience and feedback. It involves teaching machines to recognize patterns and trends in data, learn from them, and eventually generalize their behavior to new situations based on prior experience. The goal behind machine learning is to enable computers to perform tasks they would typically require human intervention, such as classification, prediction, and decision making, without being explicitly programmed to do so. 

Some popular examples of machine learning include facial recognition software, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and predictive modeling for stock market prices. These applications rely heavily on machine learning algorithms and technologies, which aim to automate tasks by analyzing large amounts of data.


The core task of machine learning algorithms is to create models that accurately capture underlying relationships between input features and output variables. For example, when training a neural network model using supervised learning, we feed inputs (i.e., images) into the model, and expect it to produce outputs (i.e., class labels). During training, the algorithm adjusts its weights and biases according to the error between predicted and actual values. This process is repeated until convergence occurs, at which point the trained model can be applied to unseen data to make predictions or decisions. 

The fundamental idea behind machine learning is that there are generally two types of problems that need to be addressed:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning

Supervised learning focuses on building models where labeled data exists, meaning we know what the correct answer(es) are beforehand. Examples of supervised learning include regression models, where the output variable is continuous, and classification models, where the output variable takes discrete values such as true or false. Other common supervised learning tasks include clustering, anomaly detection, and forecasting.

On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not depend on labeled data, but rather aims to identify hidden patterns or structure in data. One type of unsupervised learning algorithm called clustering groups similar data points together, while another called density estimation discovers regions of high density in data space. Both of these algorithms are useful for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and finding insights about complex datasets.

Overall, machine learning is a fast-growing subfield of AI that promises to revolutionize our lives and advance our technological capabilities. With increasing demand for data-driven solutions in businesses and societies, it’s essential for enterprises to harness the power of machine learning to unlock invaluable business intelligence, customer insights, and personalization.
