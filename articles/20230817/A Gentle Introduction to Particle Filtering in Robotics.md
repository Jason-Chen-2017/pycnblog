Particle filtering (PF) is a probabilistic technique that can be used for solving nonlinear systems or dynamical models with uncertain inputs or states. The basic idea behind PF is to represent the state of a system as a set of particles representing different possible realizations of it. We then apply some motion model to each particle and update them based on measurements we receive from the system. By iteratively updating these particles and refining their estimate, our filter converges towards an accurate solution. Although originally developed for localization and tracking tasks, PF has also been applied successfully to other applications such as control, mapping, planning, and reinforcement learning. 

In this article, I will provide a gentle introduction into the basics of PF and its application to robotic systems. I will start by describing some basic concepts and terminology, followed by an overview of the core algorithm and how it works. Next, I will explain the math involved in implementing PF using simple examples, before demonstrating how to use it in a simple mobile robot controller design task. Finally, I will conclude with future directions and challenges in applying PF to more complex problems and practical applications. I hope you find my articles informative and useful!

## State space representation

Before discussing the main PF algorithm, let’s first discuss the fundamental concept of state space representation, which plays an essential role in PF. In robotics and control, we often need to reason about the dynamic behavior of a system as a function of its state at any given time. Therefore, we must define what it means for a state to be “dynamic” and establish a way of representing it mathematically. 

Consider a generic system with n-dimensional state space X, where x ∈ R^n denotes the vector containing all the system variables. This could include positions, velocities, accelerations, forces, joint angles, angular velocities, etc., depending on the specific problem being considered. Understanding how the state evolves over time is critical to developing robust and reliable controllers for those systems. For instance, if a mechanism starts to deviate significantly from its intended trajectory, we might want to take actions to prevent damage or ensure safety. Similarly, if we are trying to track a target moving through an unpredictable environment, knowing the current state allows us to make good decisions about how to respond.

To represent the dynamics of the system, we can use differential equations (ODE), which describe the rate of change of each variable with respect to time: dx/dt = f(x, u). However, even ODE's have drawbacks when modeling complex dynamics, including non-linearities and discontinuities. To address these issues, we can use numerical integration techniques such as Euler's method or Runge-Kutta methods. Numerical integration involves approximating the value of the derivative of the state at each time step using the values of the state itself and the input controls. These approximated derivatives are then fed back into the ODE solver to generate updated estimates of the state, which are fed back into the integrator to continue the process. Integrators generally require a relatively small time step size to maintain stability, but they work well enough for most problems.

One challenge encountered when working with high-dimensional state spaces is the computational cost of computing the required derivatives and integrals numerically. To mitigate this issue, researchers have developed techniques like linearization, which reduce the dimensionality of the state space while preserving its physical meaning. Linearization converts the original system dynamics into a set of second order ODEs that are easier to integrate and solve numerically than their full dimensional counterparts. Another approach is to use surrogate models instead of actual simulations, which can speed up computation times significantly.

Once we have defined our state space, we can proceed to develop a mathematical representation of the system dynamics that can be easily integrated and solved numerically. One popular choice is to use the linear Boltzmann equation, which defines the probability distribution of the next state conditioned on the current one and the present input signal. This equation gives rise to a Markov chain that describes the sequence of states and outputs that the system transitions through. As the number of particles increases, the approximation becomes increasingly better because each particle represents a unique random configuration of the system.

## Sampling and resampling  
Now that we have established a representation of the system dynamics, we need to decide how we will obtain samples from the true underlying state distribution. One common strategy is to simulate the system repeatedly starting from different initial conditions until sufficient data has been collected. Another option is to randomly select configurations from the distribution according to their likelihood of occurring. Both strategies result in a collection of samples that represent different realizations of the system state.

However, these sampled distributions may not accurately reflect the actual distribution of the system, especially in cases where there are strong local effects or rare events. Moreover, the choice of sample generation method can affect the convergence properties of the filter, leading to slower convergence rates or oscillatory results. To avoid these issues, we can employ several techniques such as importance sampling, low variance reweighting, and sequential Monte Carlo sampling. Importance sampling involves multiplying the probabilities of selected states by a scalar factor proportional to their importance weight, which ensures that the weighted sum of samples approximates the exact underlying distribution. Low variance reweighting takes advantage of the fact that similar samples tend to be drawn together during simulation and assigns them lower weights, reducing the impact of noise on the resulting statistics. Sequential Monte Carlo sampling uses a series of generative models to sequentially approximate the marginal likelihood of the system under consideration.

Finally, once we have obtained a collection of representative samples, we need to choose which ones to incorporate into our particle filter. Typically, we discard old samples and replace them with newer ones to ensure that we do not overestimate the uncertainty of the system state. Resampling is the process of selecting new particles from the existing population based on their weights, which can help the filter to focus on regions of highest density. There are various algorithms available for performing resampling, ranging from simple uniform resampling to more sophisticated birth-death approaches. Overall, careful selection of parameters and tuning of hyperparameters is crucial to ensuring the best performance of the particle filter.

## Motion model and observation model 
The key element of PF is the motion model, which defines how the system should move from one state to another under certain assumptions about the environment. For example, assuming constant acceleration, the motion model would consist of three terms - position, velocity, and acceleration. Each term can depend either on the previous state or the present input signal. This is essentially a hypothesis about how the system behaves over time, which can be adjusted during runtime based on sensor readings. Once we have defined a motion model, we can proceed to implement it within the PF algorithm using the Bellman equation. This equation says that the expected value of the next state given the current state and action should equal the maximum-likelihood estimate of the optimal state conditioned on both observations and predictions made by the filter. The exact formulation of this equation depends on the type of problem being addressed, but it typically involves minimizing the mean squared error between predicted and observed states. After computing the filter gain matrix K, we can use it to update the belief distribution of the state by taking a weighted average of the predicted and measured states.

The observation model specifies how the system generates observations from the state. It can involve measurement devices such as cameras, rangefinders, LIDARs, etc., or simply using internal sensors such as encoders or gyroscopes. Within the PF algorithm, we assume that the observations are corrupted with some additive noise that follows a known probability distribution. To account for this noise, we introduce an observation covariance matrix R that specifies the error induced by the sensor measurement process. During each iteration of the PF algorithm, we update the estimated state based on the Bayes' rule, which takes into account both the predicted and measured values of the system state. Using these two pieces of information, we can compute the posterior distribution over the hidden state given the measurements, which is further refined using resampling.

Overall, the combination of a good motion model and a suitable observation model enables us to build highly effective filters that can handle a wide range of problems related to robotic systems. 

# 3.Core Algorithm and Details
Now that we have covered the basic theory behind PF and its implementation details, let's go ahead and discuss the specifics of the core algorithm, including the prediction step, correction step, and resampling step. Let’s begin with the prediction step. 

## Prediction Step

In the prediction step, we predict the next state of the system based on the present state and past observations. The prediction formula depends on the motion model chosen. If we chose a simple linear model, we simply use the Bellman equation described earlier. However, if we chose a higher-order model, we need to derive the corresponding transition matrices. Additionally, we need to consider the effect of any control inputs acting on the system. 

After obtaining the predicted state, we use this value to construct a set of new particles by applying the motion model to each of the previous particles and adding Gaussian noise to each one. This helps eliminate any potential collisions that may occur due to overlapping trajectories. Once we have constructed the new set of particles, we normalize their weights so that they sum up to 1.

## Correction Step

After generating the new set of particles, we now need to evaluate the likelihood of observing the system state and compare it with the predicted state generated in the previous step. Here, we again use the same observation model that was specified earlier, along with the previously computed observation covariance matrix. Based on these comparisons, we assign weights to each particle based on whether or not we believe it gave us a valid measurement. Intuitively, we think that the particles that were closer to the correct state had higher weights since they were less likely to be affected by noise or errors introduced by the prediction step. We assign very small weights to invalid particles, effectively removing them from consideration in subsequent iterations. 

We can repeat this correction step multiple times until convergence is achieved. At each iteration, we adjust the weights of the particles based on their difference between the predicted and measured states. We do this by scaling the difference by the inverse of the observation covariance matrix and subtracting the scaled difference from the prior weight of each particle. This encourages the particles to stay close to their predicted states, while discouraging large changes in case of incorrect measurements.

Finally, after the final iteration, we can compute the mean of the particles as our estimate of the true state of the system. 

## Resampling Step

Once we have corrected the weights of the particles, we need to perform resampling to adjust the population size and ensure that they are representative of the true underlying state distribution. This is necessary because the resampling step affects the overall accuracy of the filter, and smaller populations lead to biased results. We can achieve good balance between bias and variance by choosing the appropriate resampling scheme. Common options include multinomial resampling, stratified resampling, or systematic resampling. Multinomial resampling consists of uniformly drawing N samples from the particles, whereas stratified resampling divides the population into equally sized bins based on their weights, and selects particles uniformly from each bin, resulting in a nearly equal contribution from every particle in the population. Systematic resampling selects particles spaced evenly throughout the sorted list of weights, making sure that no two consecutive particles are too far apart.

With the final state estimate, we can test our estimation capabilities using various tests, such as tracking performance, collision detection, and path following. We can also monitor the evolution of the particle distribution over time to see how the filter adapts to changing conditions. Since PF relies heavily on constructing statistical estimators, it requires careful parameter selection and optimization to guarantee good performance.

# 4.Example Application - Mobile Robot Controller Design

To illustrate the power of PF in controlling a mobile robot, let’s consider the classic inverted pendulum swing-up control problem. The goal of this control problem is to place a point mass on a pole without tipping it over by providing torque and gravity compensation. The governing equation for this system is given by: 

m l \ddot{theta} + b l \dot{\theta}^2 + kg sin(\theta) = T - Fcos(\delta), 

where theta is the angle of the pendulum relative to vertical, l is the length of the pendulum, m is the mass of the cart, b is the friction coefficient, kg is the gravitational constant, and T and F are the desired torque and force respectively. The input torque is controlled directly by the user, and delta is the angle deviation between the vertical axis and the line connecting the center of the mass to the pivot point.

Let’s say we have a mobile robot with identical mass and dimensions to the inverted pendulum. We can write down the dynamics of the robot in the standard basis of rotations:
 
Dx = [dX; d\theta], 
where D is the distance traveled by the base and θ is the rotation around the z-axis. We also assume that we have access to the orientation of the pole relative to the body frame, giving us six degrees of freedom (3 position and 3 orientation).

Next, we need to convert this continuous-time system to discrete-time using zero-order hold (ZOH) sampling, where we only get measurements at regular intervals. The timestep Ts should be much smaller than the natural period of oscillation τ to minimize aliasing effects.

Based on these assumptions, we can now encode the dynamics of the robot using a set of linear algebra operations:

1. Forward kinematics: Given the state [X;θ] and the input [T;δ], compute the forward transformation matrix F that maps states to joint positions, which we call q.
2. Jacobian matrix: Compute the jacobian matrix df/dx, which relates changes in state to changes in joint positions. This is equivalent to determining the relationship between base velocity V and end-effector velocity W. 
3. Feedback law: Use the jacobian matrix to determine the torque tau=K(q-qd)(V-Wd). Solve for the optimal feedback gain K using least squares regression.

Using these components, we can implement a PF-based controller that learns to navigate the inverted pendulum by producing feasible trajectories in response to varying external disturbances. First, we initialize the particle filter with a set of randomly distributed particles, represented by their states [X;θ]. We then iterate through many cycles of generating a new set of candidate particles, applying the motion and observation models, evaluating the likelihood of each set of particles, and finally resampling the population.

At each cycle, we run the ZOH prediction step to obtain predicted joint positions qpred=[qp;qpp], where qp is the predicted base position and qpp is the predicted pole angle. We then run the feedback law to compute the torque needed to stabilize the pendulum at its current pose, taking into account the current joint position and velocity q and v. We send this torque to the motor driver, which applies the torques at the corresponding joints and drives the robot forward in the direction of movement.

When we detect a sudden disturbance, such as a large vibration or sudden contact with a hard surface, we reset the entire filter and restart the navigation process, hoping that our learned model can adapt to the new situation. Alternatively, we could treat these situations as failures and trigger a backup plan, such as stopping the robot, turning off the motors, or attempting to return to a safe operating area. By monitoring the performance of our learned model and reacting appropriately, we can improve the robustness and reliability of our mobile robot controller.
