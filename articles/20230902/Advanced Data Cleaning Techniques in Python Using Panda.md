# 1.简介
  

Data is the heart of today's digital world and it plays an important role in various applications such as analytics, machine learning, and big data analysis. Therefore, to make sense out of this data we need to clean it first. In this article, I will be sharing some advanced techniques for cleaning messy datasets using the pandas library in python language. These techniques include handling missing values, outliers, duplicate rows, and identifying errors or typos in textual data fields. 



# 2.数据集描述
To demonstrate how these techniques can be applied, let’s use a sample dataset containing information about different types of vehicles like cars, trucks, bikes, etc., and their features including price, mileage, engine size, color, fuel type, transmission type, and more details. This dataset contains several issues which we will try to address through our cleaning process. Here are the following observations from the dataset:

* There are multiple columns with missing values (like Price)
* Some values may be incorrect due to human error (e.g. typo in Fuel Type column)
* We also have some incorrect entries where the Engine Size is zero
* Finally, there are some duplicated rows due to the same vehicle being sold at different retailers.

We will start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset into a pandas dataframe object. Before moving further, let me explain what each column means so that you get familiarized with them:

* VIN: Unique Vehicle Identification Number
* Make: Manufacturer name
* Model: Model Name
* Year: Manufacture year of the car
* Price: The selling price of the vehicle
* Currency: Currency of the selling price
* Mileage: Total number of kilometers driven by the vehicle
* Engine Size: Capacity of the engine in cubic centimeters
* Color: Main color of the vehicle
* Fuel Type: Type of fuel used by the vehicle (gasoline, diesel, hybrid, electric, etc.)
* Transmission Type: Type of transmission used by the vehicle (manual, automatic, etc.)
* Category: Main category of the vehicle based on its usage (sports utility vehicle, sedan, coupe, hatchback, convertible, etc.)
* Dealer ID: Unique identifier assigned by dealer to identify the dealership location
* Location: Physical Address of the dealership
* Condition: Overall condition of the vehicle
* Warranty Period: Length of time before claiming warranty expires
* Damage Description: Any damage observed during the purchase period

Now let’s load the dataset into a pandas dataframe object.<|im_sep|>|>im_sep|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>null|>
