Trigonometric functions are one of the most important algebraic functions in mathematics due to their wide range of applications. In this article we will discuss trigonometric functions like sin(), cos() and tan(). We also explore exponential and logarithmic functions that come as a natural extension from these trigonometric functions. The first part of this article is on basic knowledge about these topics including definition, properties, representations, and examples. Then we will see how these functions can be applied for more complex problems such as interpolation and numerical integration. Finally, some advanced techniques related to differentiation and integrating them using trigonometric functions will be discussed. 

In mathematical analysis, trigonometric and exponential functions play an essential role in numerous fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, biology, and economics. This is because they have various applications within each field. Therefore, it is very helpful to understand these functions and apply them appropriately wherever required in any given problem-solving scenario.

This article assumes readers are familiar with linear algebra concepts such as vectors and matrices. Some familiarity with calculus may help in understanding some derivations involved in this article but isn't strictly necessary.

## 2.1 Trigonometric Function Introduction
The term "trigonometry" comes from Greek mythology, meaning "to relate with or ascertain relationships involving the circles". It refers to the study of angles and triangles formed by right angles. The main task of trigonometry is to develop methods to determine the positions of points on a circle or sphere relative to two fixed points and other specific points on the perimeter. Trigonometric functions are used extensively in many areas such as astronomy, engineering, physics, chemistry, and medicine. Here's a brief summary of what a trigonometric function is:

A trigonometric function is a mathematical expression composed of sines, cosines, and tangents. These functions map the angle between two rays (or lines) onto a ratio or quotient depending on whether the larger ray is moved along a straight line from its vertex or not. For example, when you divide a semicircle into three equal parts, the corresponding radii form a trigonometric ratios: π/3 = 1 : √3 ≈ 1.73 : 1. If the radius of the outer circle is R and the inner radius is r, then the length of the arc subtended by each tangent at point P is sin(θ)/sin(π/2 - θ), where θ is the angular separation between P and the center of the larger circle. Similarly, if P lies on the opposite side of the diameter, then θ > π/2 and the value becomes cos(θ)/cos(π/2 - θ). Note that the quantity 1/√3 means the golden ratio, which satisfies the triangle inequality property. 

There are several types of trigonometric functions based on their definitions and formulas. Common ones include:

1. Sine: f(x) = sin(x)
   - Represents the sine of an angle x in radians 
   - Domain: (-π/2, π/2]
   - Range: [-1, 1]
2. Cosine: g(x) = cos(x)
    - Represents the cosine of an angle x in radians 
    - Domain: [0, 2π)
    - Range: [1, -1]
3. Tangent: h(x) = tan(x)
    - Represents the tangent of an angle x in radians 
    - Domain: (-π/2, π/2]
    - Range: (-∞, ∞) except for division by zero. 

We will now learn about trigonometric functions and look at their domain, range, properties, and representations using simple examples.
