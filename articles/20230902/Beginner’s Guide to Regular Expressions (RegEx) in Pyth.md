Regular expressions(RegEx) are patterns used for matching and manipulating text strings. RegEx allow programmers to search, find, replace or validate input data based on specific pattern. In this guide, we will be learning the basics of regular expressions using Python programming language.
RegEx is one of those powerful tools that have a vast range of applications across various fields like Data Science, Machine Learning, Database Management Systems, etc. It can also be an essential skill for Software Engineers who work with large sets of unstructured data such as log files, emails, websites, etc. 

In this article, we will discuss about what regular expression is, how it works, and its basic syntax. We will then use Python's built-in re module to learn more advanced concepts like groups, alternatives, and quantifiers. Finally, we will cover some common problems faced by developers when working with RegEx. 


This tutorial assumes that readers have prior knowledge of Python programming language. If you need to refresh your memory, I recommend checking out the official Python tutorials at https://docs.python.org/3/. Also, if you are new to programming, I recommend taking up any introductory course or tutorial on Python programming before diving into regular expressions.

By the end of this tutorial, you will gain fundamental understanding of how to write regular expressions in Python and solve common problems related to regular expressions.


## 2. Basic Concepts
Let's begin our journey by discussing the core concepts behind RegEx:

1. **Pattern**: A sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
2. **Literal Character**: The simplest character match, matches exactly one instance of specified character. For example, 'a' matches only the letter "a".
3. **Metacharacters** : Characters that have special meaning inside a regex pattern. They either behave literally or perform certain actions within the context of a pattern. Common metacharacters include ".", "^", "$", "*", "+", "?", "[", "]", "{", "}", "|", "\\".
4. **Escape Sequence**: Allows us to match non-alphanumeric characters literally. For example, \d matches digits, and \w matches word characters which includes letters, digits, and underscore (_). 

## 3. Algorithm
The algorithm for matching a given string against a regular expression (regex) involves the following steps:

1. An input string S is processed sequentially from left to right. 
2. At each position i, the current character C at position i is matched against the corresponding character P in the regex pattern R.
3. There are five types of matches possible:
    * Match: Both characters C and P match literally. 
    * Mismatch: Either C does not match P or P does not match C.
    * Partial match: C matches part of P, but there is no full match until the next iteration. This may occur due to Quantifier modifiers.  
    * Invalid: There exists no valid match between C and P because they do not correspond to the same type of character.    
    * Escape: There exists an escape character "\\" which allows us to match non-alphanumeric characters literally. 

4. Once all positions in the input string have been processed, the entire process continues recursively until all instances of the regex pattern R have been identified or rejected.   

Now let's see these concepts put into action using examples.

### Example 1 - Finding Words Starting With 'A': 
Given a sentence containing words starting with 'A', let's say 'Apple', 'Apricot', and 'Arctic'. Our objective is to extract these words from the sentence using RegEx. Here's the RegEx pattern that would match them:  
`^A\w* `  

Explanation:
- ^ indicates the start of the line
- A matches the literal character 'A'
- \w* matches zero or more alphanumeric characters (letters, digits, and underscores) after the 'A' character
- Space or tab separates two separate RegEx patterns

Here's the code to implement this RegEx pattern in Python:

```python
import re

sentence = "I love Apple, Apricot, and Arctic ice cream."

pattern = r"^A\w*"

matches = re.findall(pattern, sentence)

print(matches) # Output: ['Apple', 'Apricot']
```

In this code, we first import the re module which provides support for working with RegEx patterns. Then, we create a variable'sentence' containing the input string. Next, we specify the RegEx pattern in the variable 'pattern'. To find all occurrences of the pattern in the string, we call the 'findall()' function provided by the re module. This returns a list of substrings where the pattern was found. Finally, we print the output which contains both 'Apple' and 'Apricot' since they were matched by the RegEx pattern.

Output:

    ['Apple', 'Apricot']
    
### Example 2 - Extracting Email Addresses:
We want to extract email addresses from a given piece of text. Let's assume that we have several email addresses enclosed within angle brackets < >. Here's the RegEx pattern that could help us extract them:  
 `<\S+@\S+\.\S+>`   

Explanation:
- \< matches the literal '<' symbol
- \S+ matches one or more non-space characters (email address should contain something besides spaces)
- \@ matches the literal '@' symbol
- \S+ matches one or more non-space characters
- \. matches the literal '.' symbol
- \S+ matches one or more non-space characters
- \> matches the literal '>' symbol
- Spaces around the symbols indicate that they must appear together to form a complete entity. So, the whole RegEx pattern consists of three parts separated by space.

Here's the code to implement this RegEx pattern in Python:

```python
import re

text = """
Please contact me at john@example.com for further information.
You can reach me at mary.doe@gmail.com for additional queries."""

pattern = r"<\S+@\S+\.\S+>"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(matches) # Output: ['john@example.com','mary.doe@gmail.com']
```

In this code, we again import the re module and create a variable 'text' containing the input string. Then, we specify the RegEx pattern in the variable 'pattern'. As before, we call the 'findall()' function to return a list of substrings where the pattern was found. Finally, we print the output which contains both email addresses found in the text.

Output:

    ['john@example.com','mary.doe@gmail.com']
    
## 4. Advanced Techniques

Now that we have learned the basics of regular expressions and their operation, let's move towards some advanced techniques. These techniques provide greater flexibility in searching and replacing text while maintaining compatibility with other languages and frameworks. Below are some commonly used advanced techniques:


1. **Alternatives:** Sometimes we might want to match multiple different patterns. For example, we might want to match either 'dog' or 'cat'. In such cases, we can use the alternation operator '|'.

Example: Match either 'apple' or 'banana':

```python
import re

sentence = "I prefer apple over banana for my favorite fruit."

pattern = r"(apple|banana)"

matches = re.findall(pattern, sentence)

print(matches) # Output: ['apple', 'banana']
```

In this code, we wrap each alternative pattern inside parentheses '( )'. This tells the engine to look for either of the options listed inside the parentheses. 

2. **Groups:** Often times, we might want to apply certain operations on specific portions of a pattern instead of applying the operation to the entire pattern. Groups allow us to do so. 

For example, consider the below text snippet containing phone numbers:

```
My phone number is +91-123-456789. Call now!
```

If we want to extract only the last 10 digits of the phone number, we can use a group as shown below:

```python
import re

phone_number = "+91-123-456789"

pattern = r"\+?\d{3}-\d{3}\d{4}"

match = re.search(pattern, phone_number)

if match:
    result = match.group()[-10:]
    
    print(result) # Output: 123456789
else:
    print("No match")
```

In this code, we first create a variable 'phone_number' containing the phone number snippet. Then, we specify the RegEx pattern in the variable 'pattern'. The '+?' at the beginning makes the '+' optional. This means that the '-' sign can also come before the country code. The '\d{3}' represents the area code consisting of 3 digits followed by '-', the '\d{3}' after the '-' represents the local code consisting of 3 digits and finally the remaining four digits represent the actual phone number. Note that we cannot directly access individual capturing groups in Python. However, we can retrieve the entire matched substring using the.group() method. Therefore, we pass [-10:] slice to get only the last ten digits of the phone number.
