Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States alone. Several factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, and stroke can lead to sudden cardiac arrest or even death. To improve treatment outcomes for patients with heart failure, a highly accurate and real-time automatic rhythm detection and estimation system that does not require clinical interpretation is needed. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic cardiac rhythm detection and estimation using videos recorded from a wrist-based implant device integrated into the human body. This approach involves detecting heartbeat sounds within the video frames, segmenting them into beats based on their timings, estimating the average beat frequency, instantaneous BPM (beats per minute) values, and predicting future BPM changes based on recent heart rate data collected during normal activity levels. We evaluate our proposed method through experiments using publicly available datasets and demonstrate its accuracy and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

* **Video**: A sequence of still images, sound waves, or both captured by a camera or microphone over time. It may contain audio and visual information together or separately. Videos are widely used in computer vision and multimedia applications due to their ability to capture complex motion and dynamic scenes. 

* **Audio signal**: An analogue or digital representation of a sound wave. It contains amplitude measurements at specific frequencies. For example, when listening to music, we hear different frequencies of sound. The highest frequency being played is called the fundamental frequency. There are also subharmonics and overtones which belong to adjacent harmonic series around the fundamental frequency. All these frequencies produce varying amplitudes depending upon the distance between the source and listener.

* **Beat**: A single occurrence of the heart's contraction cycle in which the ventricles compress and contract to raise blood pressure upwards. Beats typically occur every 60 milliseconds to 1 second, but they do not always correspond to the actual timing of the heart’s pulse. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the temporal properties of the signals generated by the heartbeat to determine its exact timing.

* **Heart rate (HR)**: The number of beats per minute measured by a healthcare professional while exercising regularly. HR ranges from 40 to 200 beats per minute and depends on various factors such as age, gender, fitness level, exercise duration, and vascular conditions like angina pectoris.

* **Framerate (FPS)**: The number of frames displayed per second in a video recording. A higher FPS results in a faster frame refresh rate, making it easier to track and analyze individual frames. Common FPS values include 24, 30, and 60 fps.

* **Frequency domain analysis**: Analysis of audio signals obtained after converting them into the frequency domain. Frequency domain analysis can help identify the dominant frequency component in the signal which corresponds to the heart beat. Other components could be low frequency noise resulting from breathing, skin movement, etc. Frequency domain techniques have been widely applied in medical signal processing, speech recognition, and image/video processing.

* **Machine learning**: The process of training computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms use statistical models to estimate unknown parameters based on labeled input data, and then make predictions or decisions about new inputs. These tools have become essential in fields such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing, bioinformatics, finance, and medicine. 

* **Convolutional neural network (CNN)**: A type of machine learning model developed using convolutional layers that applies filters to input images to extract features. CNNs have achieved impressive performance in many tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

* **Time-frequency masking technique**: Technique used to enhance spectral content in a spectrum or frequency band. Time-frequency masks involve creating spatial and temporal filters that combine spatially correlated frequency bands and temporally local variations. By convolving the original signal with these filters, time-frequency masked spectrograms are created where interference signals and transient events outside of target frequency bands are suppressed.

* **Short-term Fourier transform (STFT)**: Method used to decompose an audio signal into overlapping segments of short-time discrete fourier transforms (STFT). STFT produces multiple frequency spectra for each segment of audio, allowing us to detect different types of periodic signals present in the audio, including the heart beat.

* **Mel-frequency cepstrum (MFC)**: Extracted feature vector containing spectral descriptors extracted from the spectrum of an audio signal using Mel filters. MFC consists of a set of filters designed to separate certain frequencies from others in the spectrum into different bands. These filtered bands are converted back into linear scale to represent the spectral shape of the audio signal.

* **Resampling**: Process of changing the sampling rate of a signal from one value to another. Resampling ensures consistency between sampled signals so that they can be analyzed easily by computer systems. Common resampling rates include 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz.

* **Beats-per-minute (BPM) estimator**: Algorithm that estimates the tempo (bpm) of an audio signal by counting the number of detected beats in each frequency band and calculating their respective ratios. Since heart beats usually occur at predominant frequencies, the algorithm works best when trained on healthy subjects who exhibit a wide range of bpm levels throughout the day. Variation in bpm can indicate cardiac dysfunction or arrhythmias.

* **Training dataset**: Collection of annotated examples used to train a machine learning model to perform a task. The quality of the training dataset affects how well the model performs on unseen test data, ensuring that the model generalizes well to new environments. Public datasets such as UCF-50, PTB-XL, BP4D, and CHAPS provide common benchmarks for heart rate monitoring tasks.
