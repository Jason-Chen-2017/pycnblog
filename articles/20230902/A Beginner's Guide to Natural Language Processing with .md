# 1.简介
  

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the field of computational linguistics that involves the use of computer algorithms to process human language data such as text or speech. In this article, we will demonstrate how to implement basic NLP tasks using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). We'll also showcase some examples from real-world applications in natural language understanding (NLU), named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, machine translation, and topic modeling. 

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a good knowledge of programming concepts including variables, conditional statements, loops, lists, functions, objects, classes, and modules. You must be comfortable writing code in Python.

We assume you are familiar with the basics of probability and statistics, and you have some experience with Python and its built-in libraries like NumPy and Pandas. If not, it would be helpful if you first go through some introductory materials on these topics before proceeding further.

This is a beginner-level guide for those who are new to NLP and want to learn more about how to build powerful NLP systems. However, even intermediate level developers can benefit greatly by learning how to apply NLP techniques for various applications.

In summary, this article provides an overview of fundamental NLP concepts and methods using the Python NLTK library, and demonstrates their practical application in four different areas:

1. Natural language understanding (NLU): Extracting relevant information from unstructured text data such as product reviews or social media posts
2. Named entity recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities such as persons, organizations, locations, etc. in text data
3. Sentiment analysis: Determining the emotional tone of a text based on opinions expressed within it
4. Machine translation: Translating one natural language into another

By the end of the article, you should feel confident in your ability to build effective NLP systems using Python and NLTK.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
## Tokenization
Tokenization means splitting a sentence or document into individual words, phrases, or symbols that make up meaningful units of meaning. For example, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" might be tokenized into the following tokens:
```
[the, quick, brown, fox, jumps, over, the, lazy, dog]
```
The purpose of tokenization is to break down complex sentences or documents into smaller chunks, which makes them easier to work with during downstream processes such as stemming, stopword removal, and vectorization.

## Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization both involve reducing each word to its root form so that they can be grouped together and counted as related words. The main difference between the two lies in the way they handle words with multiple meanings.

For instance, consider the verb "running," which has several possible inflections depending on tense, person, mood, number, gender, case, and voice. To simplify the task of counting these words together, we could convert all verbs to a common base form known as the stem "run."

However, while stemming reduces words to their root form, lemmatization is more sophisticated than just stripping off any affixes. It takes into account morphological information, such as part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and tenses, to accurately identify the lemma.

Lemmatizing the previous example yields:
```
["runner", "jumper"]
```
whereas stemming only gives us `"runs"` and `"jumps"`. Both approaches help create consistent count vectors for terms across our corpus, but there are tradeoffs involved in choosing between them.

## Stop Word Removal
Stopwords refer to common words that do not carry much semantic meaning, such as articles ("a," "an," "the"), conjunctions ("and," "or," "but," "yet"), prepositions ("at," "by," "for," "from," "in," "of," "on," "to," "with"), pronouns ("he," "she," "it," "they," "i," "you," "we"), and other words like numerals and punctuation marks. These stopwords typically get filtered out when performing text analytics, since they don't provide useful insights into the actual content being analyzed.
