Learning to rank (LTR) is a popular technique for information retrieval that aims at predicting the relevance of an item to a user query based on its features and past interactions with other items in the search results list. In this article we will focus on LTR models that use pairwise interaction data as input. We'll introduce regularization techniques such as softmax weighting, linear interpolation or dual-softmax regression, which are common in LTR models using pairwise data. We'll also present one specific model called LambdaMART that applies these regularization techniques alongside several base algorithms such as decision trees, gradient boosted decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Finally, we'll evaluate our proposed method against several state-of-the-art methods from both offline and online evaluation perspectives.
# 2.背景介绍
Relevance ranking is central to many applications including search engines, recommendation systems, personalized medicine, image classification, and more. There have been multiple research efforts towards developing effective learning to rank (LTR) models that can handle large amounts of training data efficiently. One type of pairwise data used in most LTR models is the click-through data, which records how often users interact with pairs of relevant and non-relevant documents within a session or time interval. This data has two main advantages: it provides rich contextual information about the document pairs being clicked together; and it allows us to capture indirect feedback from the clicks, i.e., what other documents were clicked before or after the target ones. However, building accurate LTR models using only click-through data poses significant challenges since the nature of the task requires reasoning over complex relationships among multiple variables and aspects, making traditional machine learning techniques difficult or even impossible to apply directly. Therefore, there has been much interest in exploring new ways to leverage additional types of pairwise data such as co-occurrence patterns or similarity measures between documents. Nevertheless, few studies have attempted to combine pairwise data with traditional supervised learning techniques effectively. Many recent approaches use deep neural networks (DNNs), but they typically treat each feature separately without considering their interdependence. On the contrary, we propose to use a hybrid approach that combines different types of features using pairwise interactions. The goal is to learn better representations of the documents by integrating both high-order interactions and low-dimensional intrinsic features, leading to better performance in LTR tasks.

## Relevance ranking
In general, relevance ranking refers to the process of assigning scores or ranks to objects according to their relevance to a given query, while avoiding unfair comparisons and assigning equivalent scores to competing objects. For example, when searching for images on Google, you might be presented with a set of search results ordered by their relevance to your query, where the first result might be the most relevant image to your query while the last one might be the least relevant. Similarly, if a search engine presents articles related to a query, those with higher ratings or reviews would be considered more relevant than others. By correctly identifying the relevance of each object to the query, a relevance ranking algorithm can help users find the most useful information quickly and easily. 

The term "learning" to rank comes from the idea that machines should acquire skills to solve problems by imitating human behavior. Traditionally, relevance ranking was performed manually by experts who assigned weights or preferences to each element of a collection based on manual inspection and comparison. Today, computers play a crucial role in relevance ranking through various forms of machine learning algorithms. These algorithms optimize the performance of a classifier or regressor function, which takes into account all available information about a particular object. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates the probability of relevance given some features or characteristics of the object. Once trained, the model can then be used to assign a score or rank to any new object based on its relevance to the original query. This enables efficient search and content recommendation systems, personalized e-commerce platforms, and so on.


## Pairwise data
Pairwise data consists of two entities A and B, referred to as left entity and right entity respectively, along with a binary label indicating whether A and B satisfy a certain relationship (e.g., positive, negative). One commonly used form of pairwise data is click-through data, which records whether users clicked on pairs of relevant and non-relevant documents during a web search session or time period. It is important to note that a single instance of pairwise data consists of three elements - the left entity, the right entity, and the binary label. Another widely used type of pairwise data is co-occurrence matrix, which represents the number of times entities occur together in a corpus of text documents. Other examples include rating matrices, social network links, or bipartite graph connections between users and items.

## Base algorithms
A basic assumption behind LTR models is that the effectiveness of an LTR model depends heavily on the quality of the features used to represent individual objects and the way they interact with each other. Common base algorithms used in LTR models include decision trees, gradient boosted decision trees, logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines (SVMs). Each of these algorithms constructs a predictor function that maps features of a given object onto a continuous output value, representing the likelihood of relevance. Despite their popularity, however, these base algorithms alone cannot achieve satisfactory accuracy in LTR tasks due to the complexity of real-world datasets. For example, decision trees may perform well on highly sparse data sets like email spam filtering, but fail to recognize highly relevant objects in text corpora. As a result, existing LTR models rely on a combination of base algorithms and advanced feature engineering strategies to extract informative features from raw data.

## Feature engineering
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful and interpretable features that contribute to improving the performance of an LTR model. Some key principles of good feature engineering include selecting relevant features, extracting them automatically, and using simple yet powerful transformations. Several families of feature engineering techniques exist, ranging from unsupervised to supervised, based on the level of expertise required to create the features. Broadly speaking, these include bag-of-words, TF-IDF, word embeddings, n-gram models, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While numerous feature extraction algorithms have been developed for specific applications, standardizing the implementation across diverse domains remains a challenging problem. Nonetheless, it is still possible to develop reliable feature engineering tools by adapting existing techniques or designing novel ones tailored to specific domains.

## Hybrid LTR models
To address the drawbacks of traditional base algorithms, we propose to use a hybrid approach that combines different types of features using pairwise interactions. Our hypothesis is that incorporating pairwise interactions brings valuable information that complements the strengths of conventional base algorithms. Specifically, we hypothesize that the presence of explicit signals can increase the ability of LTR models to identify complex relationships among multiple variables and aspects, providing greater flexibility and robustness to noise. Moreover, by combining multiple levels of features, we hope to improve the overall expressivity and representational power of our learned representations, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency.

In particular, we use a stacking ensemble framework consisting of four layers: a feature transformation layer that transforms raw data into suitable formats, a meta learner that selects the best hyperparameters for each base algorithm, a metatraining layer that trains the final metalearner, and a prediction layer that aggregates the outputs of all base algorithms. The metalearner explores the space of hyperparameters to select the optimal combination of base algorithms and parameters for a fixed set of features. Metatraining further improves the performance of the metalearner by fine-tuning its hyperparameters on a separate validation dataset. The final prediction layer uses the aggregated predictions from all base algorithms and/or feature transformations as inputs to make final decisions about the relevance of an object.

We further explore two types of pairwise interactions beyond click-through data: co-occurrence pattern modeling and similarity measure modeling. Co-occurrence pattern modeling captures the frequency of occurrence of multiple patterns in the same document or sequence. In contrast, similarity measure modeling relies on precomputed similarities or distances between the entities. Both of these techniques attempt to capture implicit relations between the entities that are not explicitly represented in the raw data. They add extra information to the representation and enable LTR models to capture complex relationships that are usually neglected by base algorithms.

Finally, we provide a specific implementation of our proposed hybrid model named LambdaMART, which is specifically designed to work well in the setting of large-scale LTR tasks. The LambdaMART algorithm addresses several practical issues such as scalability, memory usage, and efficiency, by adopting a modular architecture and optimizing the execution plan for each iteration. We evaluate our method against several state-of-the-art methods from both offline and online evaluation perspectives. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, particularly in terms of both offline metrics and top-k precision@k evaluation.
