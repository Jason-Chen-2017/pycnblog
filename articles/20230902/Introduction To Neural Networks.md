神经网络（Neural Network）是一种模拟人类大脑神经系统工作原理的机器学习算法模型，它可以对输入的数据进行处理、分析、学习并产生输出结果。它由输入层、输出层、隐藏层组成，每层之间都有连接，并且有激活函数作用，使得网络具有学习能力、非线性映射能力及自适应调整参数能力等特征。目前应用最广泛的神经网络是深度学习（Deep Learning）技术。本文将简要介绍神经网络的概念、结构、原理和应用。


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Neuron
### 2.1.1. What is a neuron?
A neuron is an element of the brain that processes information from the input to produce output. It takes in several inputs through its dendrites (soma) and produces an electrical signal through its axon when it fires. The cell body is responsible for storing and sending signals along the axons to other neurons in the network. In general terms, a neural network can be thought of as a collection of interconnected neurons like human brains. Each neuron receives input signals from different sources and generates its own output based on these signals using mathematical formulas called activation functions.


Neurons are at the core of deep learning systems. They learn complex relationships between multiple inputs and outputs by adjusting their weights iteratively over time during training. By processing large amounts of data, neural networks can classify images, speech, text, and other real-world data effectively. However, there remain many challenges to overcome before they can replace traditional machine learning algorithms with the power of neural networks.



### 2.1.2 Types of Neurons 

There are two main types of neurons: 

1. Input neurons: These receive external input such as sensory data or user commands, process it into a format suitable for processing by downstream neurons, and transmit the result back to the external world. Examples include image pixels, sound waves, touch screen gestures, etc. 

2. Hidden neurons: These take in input from upstream neurons, apply transformations to it, and generate an output for use by downstream neurons. One key feature of hidden neurons is that they have internal state variables that store previous inputs, allowing them to remember what has happened earlier in the network. This allows the network to perform more complex tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. Hidden layers play an important role in building deep neural networks. 



### 2.1.3 Activation Function
The activation function specifies the output of a neuron given its inputs. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, LeakyReLU, Softmax, and Linear. Sigmoid is a popular choice since it provides a smooth saturating output, making it useful for binary classification problems. Other common activation functions include Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which limits the output to non-negative values, and softmax, which converts a vector of scores into probabilities. Different activation functions can achieve different performance depending on the problem domain. For example, in a binary classification task where only one class is expected, we might choose a simpler activation function such as sigmoid instead of a more complicated function such as softmax.



## 2.2 Layers and Weights
### 2.2.1 Layers and Neurons
In neural networks, the input layer receives input data, passes it through hidden layers, and then produces output. Each hidden layer consists of a set of neurons connected together that work together to transform the input data into the desired output. There can be any number of hidden layers, each consisting of a variable number of neurons. The first hidden layer typically consists of hundreds or even thousands of neurons, while subsequent hidden layers may contain fewer neurons if the dataset is small. Typically, the final output layer contains a single neuron representing the predicted target value or category.

Each connection between neurons within a layer is associated with a weight value, which determines how much influence the incoming signal has on the outgoing signal of the neuron. Connections between neurons in adjacent layers also share the same weight values, but these connections are often less significant because they represent features that are learned during training. Weights are adjusted automatically during training by feedforward propagation of errors between the actual output and the predicted output.

It's worth noting here that individual neurons don't actually carry out calculations directly, but rather pass weighted sums of their inputs to the next layer of neurons, producing an output value based on the sum received from the activation function applied to this weighted sum. The weights themselves are trained via gradient descent optimization techniques during training.



### 2.2.2 Feedforward Propagation
Feedforward propagation is the process by which an input pattern propagates forward through the network until the output is produced. At each step, the input signal is multiplied by the corresponding weight value of each connection between the current layer and the following layer. The resulting weighted sums are passed through an activation function to produce the output of the current layer. The output of the last layer becomes the input to the first layer for the next iteration. Feedforward propagation is commonly abbreviated as FFP. During training, the error between the actual output and the predicted output is calculated and used to update the weights according to the gradient descent algorithm, updating the model parameters accordingly.
