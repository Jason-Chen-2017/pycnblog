# 1.简介
  

Augmented reality (AR) is the technology that enables users to interact with digital objects and real-world environments in a virtual world through their mobile devices. With AR, we can create amazing applications such as virtual tour guides or augmented manufacturing tools for industries like manufacture, healthcare, transportation, finance, and many more.

In this article, I will show you how to build an augmented reality mobile app from scratch using Android Studio and Unity game engine. You will learn about core concepts of building an AR mobile application and how to implement them step by step.

This article assumes that you have basic knowledge of programming, computer science, and mathematics. It also requires some experience working with AR SDKs, APIs, and libraries. If you are new to these fields, it may be helpful to first read articles related to those topics before proceeding further. 

By the end of this article, you will have built your own augmented reality mobile app and learned what skills are required to develop one and why they matter in today's marketplace.


# 2. Basic Concepts & Terms
Before starting our journey into developing an AR mobile app, let's quickly go over some fundamental terms and ideas that you need to understand:

1. Virtual World: This refers to a representation of the physical world where users can explore or manipulate various elements within the environment without actually being there. In other words, everything around us appears to be inside a virtual world. 

2. User Interface: The UI is the user interface element of any application on a mobile device. Here, we use buttons, sliders, and other interactive controls to give users control over their interactions with the virtual environment.

3. Scene Objects: These are all the objects that make up the virtual environment. They could be images, text, videos, models, sounds, etc. All scene objects reside within the bounds of the display screen.

4. Marker Detection: Marker detection is the process of detecting markers or tags embedded in the physical environment that correspond to different points or areas in the virtual space. For example, if we want to navigate towards a certain location, we would place a marker in front of it, which the camera can then track and determine its position relative to the marker.

5. Tracking: Once we have identified a specific object or area within the virtual environment, we need to keep track of it so that we can move the viewpoint to focus on it. We achieve this by creating anchor points at each relevant point or area within the virtual environment, allowing us to reposition and orient the camera based on movement and orientation of the anchors.

6. Native Library Integration: This involves integrating third-party native libraries into our project, which provide additional functionality not available in standard APIs. Examples include Google Maps integration, Facebook SDK integration, and Twitter SDK integration.

# 3. Core Algorithm & Operations
Now that we have gone over some basic concepts, let's dive deeper into the algorithmic details behind building an AR mobile app.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
To begin, you'll need to download and install the following software packages on your machine:

1. Java JDK 7+
2. Android Studio 2.3+
3. Unity 5.5+
4. Vuforia Developer Account

Once installed, you should be able to run both the Unity Editor and Android Emulator within the same window. Next, sign up for a free developer account on the Vuforia website.

Next, create a new project within the Unity Editor. Under Project Settings -> Player, select "Mobile/Tablet" as the target platform. Then enable the "Virtual Reality Supported" option under the XR Settings tab. Make sure that the target SDK version is set to API level 29 or above. Save your changes.

Finally, open Android Studio and import the Unity generated Gradle files located in <your_project>/gradle/. This allows us to compile and deploy our AR mobile app directly from Android Studio.

## Step 2: Add Required Assets and Libraries
We need to add several assets and external libraries to our project to get started. Let's start by downloading the following components:

1. Vuforia Engine: This contains the core component of Vuforia, which provides functions including image recognition, tracking, and augmentations. Download the latest stable release of the Vuforia Engine from https://developer.vuforia.com/vui/downloads/sdk.

2. VuMark Manager Asset: This is an asset that comes prepackaged with the Vuforia Engine and simplifies the implementation of VuMarks. Simply drag and drop the asset onto your project Hierarchy pane.

3. APK Patcher tool: This utility helps you patch your APK file with additional permissions and features necessary for running in VR mode. You can download it from here: http://www.apkpatcher.com/en/download/apkpatcher-download-free.html. Just follow the installation instructions provided by the tool itself.

4. HoloLens Device Simulator: This plugin gives you a way to test your app on the actual HoloLens hardware while still using the emulator for development. To download, simply visit https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/hololens-device-simulator-122665.

After adding these assets, we need to modify the manifest file to ensure that we have all the necessary permissions and features enabled. Open the AndroidManifest.xml file in Android Studio and add the following lines:

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-feature android:glEsVersion="0x00020000" android:required="true"/>
    
These lines ensure that our app has permission to access the camera and that OpenGL ES 2.0 support is present.

## Step 3: Implement Marker Detection
The next step is to integrate marker detection into our app. We can do this by following these steps:

1. Create a VuMarkManager script: Right click anywhere in your project hierarchy and select "Create > C# Script". Name this script anything you like but make sure to give it the prefix "VuMark", e.g., VuMarkManager. Drag this script onto the GameObject named "Main Camera".

2. Initialize the VuMarkManager: Locate the VuMarkManager script and double-click on it to edit it. On line 5, locate the VuforiaInitializer object and assign it to a public variable called "initializer". 

On Line 9, initialize the VuforiaInitializer instance by calling its Start() method. Also, comment out the default VuforiaBehaviour script attached to the Main Camera. Finally, save your changes.

3. Configure the VuforiaInitializer: Go back to the VuforiaInitializer script and configure it according to the official documentation. Locate the license key field and enter your valid Vuforia developer credentials obtained from the Vuforia website. Specify the size of your marker(s), minimum confidence threshold, whether or not to activate auto-start, and other settings accordingly. Save your changes.

4. Detect Markers: Now that we've initialized and configured the VuforiaInitializer script, we're ready to write code to detect markers. Locate the Update() method and insert the following code snippet below:

```csharp
// Get the current frame from the camera feed
Frame frame;
CameraDevice.Instance.GetCameraImage(out frame);

// Pass the frame to the VuMarkManager instance to detect markers
manager.ProcessFrame(frame);
```

This code calls the ProcessFrame function of the VuMarkManager instance and passes along the current frame captured by the camera feed.

5. Handle Marker Events: When a marker is detected, the VuMarkManager emits an event notifying you that a marker was found. You can subscribe to this event by creating a delegate signature and declaring a callback function in the VuMarkManager class. Below is an example:

```csharp
public delegate void MarkerDetectedEventHandler();
public static event MarkerDetectedEventHandler MarkerDetectedEvent;

private void OnMarkerDetected() {
  // Do something when a marker is detected...
  Debug.Log("Marker detected!");
}
```

You can call this function whenever a marker is detected by setting up a listener for the MarkerDetectedEvent.

## Step 4: Track Anchors
With the help of the VuMarkManager script, we now have a way to detect markers. However, to move the camera to focus on a particular marker, we need to create an Anchor object corresponding to that marker. This is done by calling the CreateAnchorFromHitResult function of the VuforiaInitializer instance. This function takes the hit result returned by Vuforia during marker detection and creates an Anchor object that corresponds to the marker.

However, we don't always know exactly where a marker is placed in the virtual environment. Therefore, we cannot create an exact Anchor at that location. Instead, we must create an Anchor at multiple positions along the axis perpendicular to the plane formed between the marker and the camera lens. These anchor points act as guides for the camera to identify the marker even though it might appear distorted due to perspective.

To create an Anchor at multiple locations, we can modify the CreateAnchorFromHitResult function slightly. We can add another parameter to specify the number of desired anchor points and distribute them evenly throughout the dimensions of the marker bounding box. Here's the updated function:

```csharp
public bool CreateAnchorFromHitResult(RaycastHit hitResult, int numAnchors) {

  Vector3 vMin = hitResult.collider.bounds.min;
  Vector3 vMax = hitResult.collider.bounds.max;

  float xRange = vMax.x - vMin.x;
  float yRange = vMax.y - vMin.y;
  float zRange = vMax.z - vMin.z;

  List<Vector3> anchorPositions = new List<Vector3>();

  for (int i = 0; i < numAnchors; i++) {
    float xPos = ((float)i / numAnchors * xRange) + vMin.x;
    float yPos = vMin.y;
    float zPos = vMin.z;

    Vector3 anchorPosition = new Vector3(xPos, yPos, zPos);
    anchorPositions.Add(anchorPosition);
  }

  return CreateAnchorFromPositions(hitResult.transform, anchorPositions);
}
```

Here, we calculate the min and max values of the marker bounding box, calculate the range of the coordinates across all three axes, and divide that range into the specified number of anchor points. Each anchor point is created by finding a position along the x-axis proportional to its index in the list divided by the total number of anchors and scaling that value appropriately given the overall range. We ignore the y and z coordinates since we assume that the marker lies flat against the ground. We pass the newly created anchor positions to the CreateAnchorFromPositions helper function.

Note that you may need to adjust the number of anchor points depending on the scale of your marker, camera resolution, and the distance between the marker and camera lens. Larger markers may require more anchor points than smaller ones. Additionally, you may need to experiment with different distributions and ranges to find the best balance between accuracy and speed.
