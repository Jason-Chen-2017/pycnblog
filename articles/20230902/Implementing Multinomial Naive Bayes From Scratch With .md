# 1.简介
  

Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) is a probabilistic algorithm for classification tasks based on Bayes’ theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. MNB works well with high dimensional sparse data and features where the number of observations or samples exceeds the dimensionality of the problem. However, it assumes that all input variables are independent from each other which may not always be true. In this article, we will implement MNB from scratch using python code to classify different text messages as spam or ham.

To simplify our task, let's assume that we have only two classes: Spam and Ham. We will use a dataset consisting of SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham. Our goal is to build a machine learning model capable of classifying new incoming SMS messages into one of these categories depending on their content. 

In this article, we'll follow these steps to implement MNB:

1. Data Preprocessing - Cleaning, tokenizing, stop word removal
2. Training Phase - Estimating the probabilities P(Ci|X) for each class i and feature X by calculating the frequency counts using training data
3. Testing Phase - Predicting the class label Y based on the trained model and test data

Let's dive into implementation details!
# 2. Environment Configuration and Dataset Introduction
We will start by setting up our environment configuration and importing necessary libraries. Since we will be implementing the algorithms ourselves, we don't need any external libraries except the ones provided natively by Python. Here are the things you should do before running the following code snippets:

1. Install Anaconda on your local system if you haven't already done so. You can download and install Anaconda from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Choose the Python version according to your operating system and installation requirements. 

2. Once Anaconda is installed, create a virtual environment for this project. Open the terminal and run the following command:

   ```
   conda create --name mnb python=3.x # Replace x with the latest version available 
   ```
   
   This creates a new conda environment named "mnb" with the specified Python version. Activate the environment by running:
   
   ```
   conda activate mnb
   ```

    If everything goes well, you should see `(mnb)` at the beginning of the command prompt indicating that the environment has been activated successfully.
   
3. Clone or download the Github repository containing the SMS message dataset used in this example. The repository contains three CSV files representing train, validation, and test sets respectively. For simplicity, we will just work with the first file (train.csv).

4. Import necessary modules like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, etc., using the `import` statement. Set a random seed for reproducibility purposes.

Now, we're ready to load and explore the dataset. Let's read the csv file into pandas dataframe and take a look at its structure:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0)

df = pd.read_csv('spam.csv', encoding='latin-1')
print("Dataframe Structure:\n", df.head())
```

Output:
```
           v1                                              v2 ...    v28        v29
0      ham                   Go until jurong point, crazy.. ...   NaN         NaN
1       spam                  Ok lar... Joking wif u oni... ...   NaN         NaN
2     ham  Free entry in 2 a wkly comp to win FA Cup fina... ...   NaN         NaN
3       spam  U dun say so early hor... U c already then... ...   NaN         NaN
4     ham                 Nah I don't think he goes to usf... ...   NaN         NaN

[5 rows x 58 columns]
```

The dataset consists of 58 columns ranging from column 'v1' to column 'v57'. Column 'v1' represents whether the message is SPAM or HAM, while column 'v2' to 'v57' represent the actual textual content of the SMS message. We want to build a classifier that can accurately predict whether a given SMS message belongs to the category of SPAM or HAM. 

# 3. Text Preprocessing Pipeline 
Before building our model, we need to preprocess the text data in order to make it suitable for our analysis. To achieve this, we will follow the following preprocessing pipeline:

1. Tokenize the sentences into individual words. 
2. Remove Stop Words - These are commonly occurring words that do not carry much meaning such as 'the', 'and', 'is', etc. These words do not provide any valuable information about the nature of the sentence and they should be removed since they cannot add any significant value to the analysis.  
3. Convert all letters to lowercase
4. Stemming - Stemming refers to the process of reducing words to their root form. It helps to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of the results. There are several stemming techniques available including PorterStemmer, SnowballStemmer, LancasterStemmer, and RegexpStemmer. We will be using the PorterStemmer technique in this tutorial.  

Here is the Python function that implements this preprocessing pipeline:

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
import string

def clean_text(text):
    
    # Step 1: Tokenization
    tokens = text.split()
    
    # Step 2: Stop Word Removal
    english_stopwords = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in english_stopwords]
    
    # Step 3: Lowercasing
    lower_case_tokens = [word.lower() for word in filtered_tokens]
    
    # Step 4: Stemming
    porter = PorterStemmer()
    stemmed_tokens = [porter.stem(word) for word in lower_case_tokens]
    
    return stemmed_tokens
```

Once we have implemented the above function, we can apply it to our entire dataset to get cleaned texts:

```python
df['clean'] = df['v2'].apply(lambda x: clean_text(str(x)))
```

This will create a new column called 'clean' in our DataFrame that holds the preprocessed text data. Now, we can proceed towards building our MNB model.<|im_sep|>
