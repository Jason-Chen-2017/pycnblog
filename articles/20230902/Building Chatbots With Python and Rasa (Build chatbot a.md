# 1.简介
  

Artificial intelligence has been revolutionizing the way businesses interact with consumers over the past several years. In recent years, conversational AI systems have become increasingly popular for many use cases such as customer service support, sales and marketing automation, or simply making a conversation more interactive. 

One of the most popular platforms to build chatbots is Rasa, which offers a framework that simplifies building chatbots by automating tasks like dialogue management, entity recognition, intent classification, etc., enabling developers to focus on creating state-of-the-art chatbots that can handle complex conversations seamlessly.

In this article, we will be learning about how to build chatbots using Python and the Rasa library. We'll learn how to design an appropriate conversation flow, implement NLU techniques and algorithms, and finally deploy our chatbot application into production. At the end, we'll also discuss potential improvements and challenges faced in building chatbots with Rasa. Let's dive right into it!  

Before we start, I would like to thank all the contributors who made this possible:

* Rasa team - For providing a great platform for building chatbots
* Python community - For their incredible work in machine learning and data analysis
* Open source community - For sharing their knowledge and expertise around building chatbots


# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminologies 
## 2.1 Introduction
A chatbot is a computer program that conducts a conversation via text messaging software or speech-to-text conversion devices. It works by understanding what human users are saying through natural language processing (NLP) techniques, analyzing user requests, and generating responses in a specific format that makes sense to the user. There are various types of chatbots, including rule-based bots, dialogflow-based bots, hybrid bots, FAQ-based bots, and conversational agents. Rule-based bots rely solely on predefined rules to make decisions while Dialogflow-based bots utilize neural networks to understand the context of the conversation and generate meaningful responses based on that context. Conversational agents are generally trained to simulate a real person's interactions with customers, allowing them to provide personalized services and experiences. Hybrid bots combine both rule-based and neural network-based models to achieve higher accuracy in determining the correct response. FAQ-based bots answer questions from a list of frequently asked questions stored in a database rather than relying on natural language processing techniques.

To build a chatbot with Rasa, we need to follow these basic steps:

1. Install and set up the required tools
2. Create the training data
3. Define the domain
4. Train the model
5. Test the model 
6. Deploy the bot

Let's now look at each step in detail. 

## 2.2 Prerequisites
We will be using Python programming language along with Rasa library for building our chatbot application. Before starting with the tutorial, please ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

### Required Tools
Here are some required tools you should install before getting started with your project:

1. Python version >= 3.7
2. pipenv package manager - You can install it by running `pip install --user pipenv` command in terminal/command prompt.

Once you have successfully installed these tools, create a new folder wherever you want to store your code and navigate to that directory using terminal or command prompt. Now run the following command:

```
pipenv install
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies listed in Pipfile automatically. After installation completes, activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```
pipenv shell
```

You're now ready to get started with the tutorial. 

## 2.3 Training Data
Training data refers to the sample input utterances provided to the system during the training phase. The purpose of collecting and annotating the training data is to train the underlying machine learning algorithm to recognize patterns within the input data and map them to output data. Each training example contains two parts: an input statement and its corresponding expected response. Annotations are added to describe additional information about the inputs and outputs, such as entities, intents, and slots.

When developing chatbots, we typically collect multiple examples of conversations between humans and chatbots, labeling each turn as either the agent’s utterance or the bot’s response. This data helps us develop a robust pattern of behavior for recognizing user intent and generating accurate responses. Some key points to consider when collecting training data include:

* Quality matters: Ensure that the training data is high-quality. Good quality data ensures better performance when training a chatbot.
* Size matters: Collect enough data to improve the overall performance of the chatbot. Too few samples can lead to underfitting or overfitting of the model.
* Variety matters: Provide different kinds of examples of conversation so the chatbot can catch different aspects of human interaction.

Training data needs to be saved in a file named nlu.md. Here is an example of what the contents of nlu.md could look like:

```md
## intent:greet
- hey
- hello
- hi there
- good morning
- good evening

## intent:goodbye
- cu
- goodbye
- cee you later

## intent:affirm
- yes
- indeed
- correct
- absolutely

## synonym:hello good afternoon|afternoon dear|ohayou
```

The above markdown snippet contains four sections: 

1. ##intent declaration section: These contain one or more examples of user input phrases that trigger a particular intent. Intents represent actions or commands that the chatbot should perform.
2. ##synonym declaration section: These define alternative words or phrases that can be used interchangeably with the original ones. Synonyms help match user input to intents accurately.
3. Entity annotations: These allow the chatbot to extract relevant details from the input statements, such as names, dates, locations, amounts, etc. They can then be passed as part of the request parameters to an API or another service for further processing.
4. User story examples: These provide additional examples of scenarios or conversation flows that illustrate the common ways people communicate with the chatbot. These stories can be used to train the chatbot to identify common scenarios and adapt its behavior accordingly.
