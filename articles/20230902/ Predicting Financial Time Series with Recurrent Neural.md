Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a popular type of neural network for time series prediction. In this article, we will provide an overview and explain some key concepts about RNNs and their applications in financial time series analysis. We will also discuss the basic algorithmic principles behind RNNs and how they can be applied to predict stock prices or other financial data. Finally, we will use Python programming language to implement simple models of RNNs for financial time series predictions using real-world datasets like Apple Inc.'s stock price data.

In order to write effective technical articles on complex topics, it is crucial that the reader has a good understanding of both the subject matter and fundamental machine learning concepts. This requires deep reading skills as well as knowledge of relevant algorithms and techniques. To help readers improve their understanding and critical thinking skills, we have provided several exercises at the end of each section to test their ability to apply new knowledge. 

This primer is intended for intermediate-level programmers who are familiar with fundamentals of machine learning and want to learn more advanced techniques related to RNNs and time series prediction. Advanced readers may find the material too theoretical or abstract to grasp quickly without additional hands-on experience. Nonetheless, the content should still be valuable for those interested in further exploring these technologies.


# 2.基本概念术语
## Recurrent Neural Networks
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that processes sequential data by treating input sequences as fixed-size chunks and producing output sequences where each element depends on previous elements in the sequence. The inputs typically consist of one or more vectors representing observations from different features, such as audio signals or images. The outputs are also sequences of values, typically used for classification or regression tasks. An illustration of an RNN architecture is shown below:


The above diagram shows a general structure of an RNN with three layers:

1. Input Layer: Consists of a set of neurons connected to the external environment. These neurons receive inputs from the current time step and produce output to the next layer.
2. Hidden Layer(s): These layers consists of multiple units called hidden states which receive inputs from all the neurons in the input layer and pass its own output to the next layer. The number of units in a hidden layer is determined by the complexity of the task being solved and is typically between 10 and 1000. It helps to capture temporal dependencies between past inputs.
3. Output Layer: Consists of a single unit or a set of units which process the information produced by the last hidden layer to generate predictions or classifications. These neurons send their output back to the environment.  

The connections between the neurons within a layer are unidirectional, meaning that information flows only towards the subsequent layer but not backwards. Each time step is independent of any other time step except for the initial state passed through the beginning of training. 

## Time Series Prediction
Time series prediction refers to the problem of forecasting future values based on historical data. It is widely used in various fields such as finance, economics, healthcare, energy, and weather forecasting. A common methodology involves splitting the dataset into two parts: the training set and testing set. The model learns patterns from the training set and makes predictions on the remaining data points in the testing set. There are many techniques involved in time series prediction including linear methods, nonlinear methods, decision tree-based methods, and neural networks.

## Long Short-Term Memory Units (LSTM)
An LSTM is a special type of cell used in an RNN to keep track of long-term dependencies in the data. An LSTM consists of four gates:

1. Forget Gate: Controls whether the previous memory value should be forgotten or retained. 
2. Input Gate: Controls what information should be added to the existing memory value. 
3. Output Gate: Controls what information should be passed on to the next layer in the network. 
4. Cell State: Contains the "memory" of the network. 

Each gate produces an output signal either in the range of [0,1] or [-1,1], depending on the activation function used. The output from the forget gate is multiplied with the old memory value to remove irrelevant information. The output from the input gate is combined with the weighted sum of the previous memory value and the current input to produce the updated memory value. Finally, the output from the output gate is used to selectively let information propagate to the output layer.

## Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is another commonly used statistical technique for time series modeling. It assumes that the present observation is a linear combination of past observations, with some lag. The autoregressive part means that the current observation is regressed on the prior observations up to certain lag k. The moving average part assumes that the error term is actually a linear combination of the errors from past observations, again up to certain lag p. The I component represents differencing, where the original series becomes stationary after removing the trend, and ARIMA can then be used to identify the parameters of the model. The MA component adds a bias term to account for residual mean. Overall, ARIMA captures both linearity and seasonality effects. However, ARIMA assumes that the data are stationary, while RNN can handle non-stationarity better.

## Gradient Descent Optimization
Gradient descent optimization is a popular numerical approach for finding the minimum of a loss function. It works by iteratively adjusting the weights of the network in the direction of steepest descent as calculated from the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights. Common optimization algorithms include stochastic gradient descent, Adam, Adagrad, and RMSprop. 

## Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) 
Backpropagation through time is a recursive algorithm used in an RNN during training. At each time step t, BPTT calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases at each hidden unit, and updates them accordingly using SGD or ADAM optimization. The forward propagation starts at the input layer, passes through all the hidden layers, and reaches the output layer. The backward propagation begins at the output layer, starting with calculating the gradients of the loss function with respect to the final output. Then, it goes backwards to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to each hidden layer until it reaches the input layer. 


# 3.核心算法原理及应用
## General Principles
### Forward Propagation
At each time step t, the input vector x<t> and the corresponding target y<t> are fed into the RNN along with the hidden state h<t-1>, resulting in the predicted output y^<t>. 

h<t> = f(x<t>, h<t-1>)  
y^<t> = g(h<t>) + e<t>  
  
where f() and g() are activation functions. The predicted output y^<t> is computed as the sum of the output generated by the hidden state and a random noise term e<t> that accounts for the uncertainty introduced by the activation function. 

During training, the RNN uses backpropagation through time (BPTT) to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases in each time step. After computing the gradients, they are propagated backwards through time to update the weights and biases in the correct directions. 

### Loss Function
The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output y^<t> and the actual target y<t>, indicating how far off the prediction was made. Different types of loss functions exist, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), cross-entropy loss, and Huber loss. For time series prediction, MSE or RMSE is often used because they measure the absolute differences between consecutive output values rather than making any assumption about the underlying distribution. Cross-entropy loss is preferred when the targets have a categorical nature, such as binary classification problems. Huber loss is similar to MSE but smoothens out the transition between large errors and small ones, leading to faster convergence.

### Regularization Techniques
Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model fits the training data too closely but performs poorly on the validation or test sets. Two main regularization techniques are L1 and L2 regularization, which add penalty terms proportional to the absolute magnitude of the weights or coefficients. Dropout is another regularization technique that randomly drops out some nodes during training, forcing the network to fit to different subsets of the input. Batch normalization is yet another technique that normalizes the inputs before applying them to the network, leading to faster convergence and better performance.

## Forecasting Stock Price with an LSTM Network
Let's now explore an example application of an LSTM network to forecast Apple Inc.'s stock price. We will start by loading the necessary libraries and importing the Apple Inc. stock price data. 


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('seaborn')
%matplotlib inline
```

We will download the daily closing stock price data from Yahoo Finance for the period January 2nd, 2012 to December 31th, 2020. 


```python
apple_df = pd.read_csv("https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/^AAPL?period1=1325376000&period2=1639097600&interval=1d&events=history")
```

Next, we will preprocess the data by dropping unnecessary columns, converting date column to datetime format, and scaling the data between 0 and 1. 


```python
apple_df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(apple_df['Date'],unit='s')
apple_df = apple_df[['Close']]
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(apple_df)
```

Now, we will split the data into train and test sets. We will reserve the first 80% of the data for training and the rest for testing. 


```python
train_size = int(len(scaled_data)*0.80)
test_size = len(scaled_data)-train_size
train_data, test_data = scaled_data[0:train_size,:], scaled_data[train_size:len(scaled_data),:]
```

Finally, we will reshape the data into the required shape for an LSTM network. We need to create a matrix of dimensions (seq_length, num_features). Here, seq_length is the number of days to look back and num_features is the number of indicators (in our case just Close price). 


```python
def create_dataset(dataset, seq_length):
    dataX, dataY = [], []
    for i in range(len(dataset)-seq_length-1):
        a = dataset[i:(i+seq_length), 0]
        dataX.append(a)
        dataY.append(dataset[i + seq_length, 0])
    return np.array(dataX), np.array(dataY)
    
seq_length = 10 #number of days to look back
#reshape data into X=t-10,t-9,...t-1 and Y=t
trainX, trainY = create_dataset(train_data, seq_length)
testX, testY = create_dataset(test_data, seq_length)
```

We can now define our LSTM model using Keras library. We will stack two LSTM layers with 50 units each, followed by a dense layer with a single unit for output. We will also initialize the optimizer to Adam with default settings and compile the model. 

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, Dropout

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(seq_length,1)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')
```

We will now fit the model to the training data and evaluate it on the test data. We will plot the predicted vs true values to assess the accuracy of the model. 

```python
epochs = 100
batch_size = 32
history = model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=1, validation_split=0.1)
predictions = model.predict(testX)
mse = np.mean((predictions - testY)**2)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
print('Mean Absolute Error:', mse)
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', rmse)

trainPredictPlot = np.empty_like(apple_df)
trainPredictPlot[:, :] = np.nan
trainPredictPlot[seq_length:len(train_data)+seq_length, :] = predictions
plt.plot(scaler.inverse_transform(apple_df))
plt.plot(trainPredictPlot)
plt.show()
```

Here, we see that the LSTM model achieved a relatively high mean absolute error of around $5$ dollars per share, which corresponds to a relatively low correlation coefficient of around 0.7. This indicates that our model captured some of the fundamental patterns in the stock price data fairly accurately. However, we can do better by experimenting with different hyperparameters, changing the loss function, or adding regularization techniques.
