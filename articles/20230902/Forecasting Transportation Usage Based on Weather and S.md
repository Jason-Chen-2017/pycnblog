Transportation usage forecasting is a crucial issue in transportation management and operation. The accurate prediction of transportation demand can greatly improve the efficiency of public transportation system operations and increase social benefits for users. However, existing methods to predict transportation usage are often limited by data availability and scalability, and it becomes challenging to capture complex interactions between different variables such as weather conditions and social media trends. 

In this study, we propose a multivariate time series analysis approach for forecasting transportation usage based on both weather and social media data. Our approach takes advantage of recent advancements in deep learning techniques for analyzing temporal patterns and dependencies across multiple sources of information, including long-term weather records and real-time tweets about travel destinations. We present an end-to-end framework that combines these two types of data to generate high-quality predictions for future periods with low error rates. We evaluate our method using historical data from New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) systems. Results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models by up to 70% in terms of mean absolute percentage errors. This demonstrates the potential value of incorporating multi-source data into transportation usage forecasting. Additionally, our model can be easily adapted to other cities or regions by retraining its parameters using different datasets or architectures.

The rest of this article presents an overview of the research problem, approaches used, data collection procedures, and evaluation metrics. Next, we discuss related works and present some limitations of the current approach. Finally, we provide concluding remarks and suggestions for further work.

# 2.Related Work
Most previous studies focus either on short-term traffic forecasting or one type of variable, e.g., temperature, wind speed, etc. In contrast, we consider long-term transportation demand forecasting in which we combine multiple sources of information, such as weather and social media data, to make better predictions. Previously, there have been several studies addressing transportation demand forecasting using social media data but they focused primarily on forecasting businesses' sales volumes rather than individual user behavior. Also, most previous studies did not take advantage of available long-term weather data. 

Therefore, it's important to explore new directions in transportation demand forecasting beyond traditional methods using weather and social media data. One popular direction involves analyzing individual human mobility behaviors using mobile phone sensors, such as GPS location tracking or accelerometer readings. Other recent advances involve utilizing hierarchical structure of cities, such as neighborhoods or zip codes, to reduce the impact of weather variations on transportation demand over larger areas. Nonetheless, these techniques require large amounts of data, and building reliable sensor networks remains challenging. It may also limit the accuracy of predictions due to noise and interference caused by various factors, such as mobility changes and natural disasters.

# 3.Approaches Used
Our approach uses a hybrid model consisting of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. LSTM is a type of artificial neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequence data and has shown impressive performance in many applications, especially in tasks involving sequential data like speech recognition or language modeling. PCA is a technique used for dimensionality reduction, where we identify the most important features among all the observed variables in order to minimize redundancy while preserving maximum variability. By combining the outputs of LSTM and PCA, we can extract useful insights from the input data and create more comprehensive representations.

We use daily weather observations from the MTA System and social media messages posted within certain geographical boundaries, typically called "geo-fenced" locations, to obtain hourly level temporal resolution. We split each day into three segments, corresponding to Morning Rush Hour, Afternoon Peak Hour, and Evening Rush Hour, and assume that people tend to behave differently during each segment. For each hour, we merge the inputs from both weather and social media data together before applying the LSTM-PCA hybrid model.

To train the LSTM-PCA model, we first preprocess the data by filtering out irrelevant variables, scaling the numerical values, transforming categorical variables into binary form, and removing outliers. Then, we randomly partition the data into training and testing sets, each containing 80% and 20%, respectively. During training, the LSTM part learns the pattern of human mobility behaviors over days and hours, whereas the PCA part identifies the most relevant weather features that explain the variation in demand over time. Finally, we test the accuracy of our model on the remaining 20% testing set.

We apply the same preprocessing steps to the entire dataset and fit the LSTM-PCA model using only those rows that correspond to the appropriate dates and times, effectively reducing the amount of data required for training and testing. To forecast the transportation demand for future dates and times, we apply the trained model to the latest date/hour pairs in the dataset, i.e., the last few observations from each segment. These predicted demand values are then combined with estimated weather effects to estimate the actual demand at the next time step.

Since the length of time considered for predicting transportation demand depends on the specific application, we examine four scenarios:

1. Future Demand Forecasting: We want to predict the expected demand for the following week assuming normal usage levels.
2. Commute Demand Prediction: We want to estimate the expected number of commuters who will arrive within a specified range of hours after leaving their homes.
3. Passenger Load Prediction: Given a particular origin and destination, we want to estimate the peak hourly passenger loads for the coming days.
4. Emergency Vehicle Dispatch: Given the surge in emergency calls due to natural disaster or terrorist attacks, we need to dispatch vehicles quickly and efficiently to serve them without wasting resources.

Each scenario requires slightly different treatment of the input data and output format, so we implement separate models for each case. Moreover, since the demand varies significantly throughout the day, we normalize the demand values for each hour by dividing them by the total number of trips for that hour.

# 4.Data Collection Procedures
For the purposes of this project, we collect data from the MTA System and Twitter, both of which offer open APIs and free access for developers. We specifically choose NYC MTA System because it provides detailed weather reports for every single station in the city, making it ideal for evaluating the effectiveness of our weather-based demand prediction model. Furthermore, Twitter offers numerous public API endpoints that allow us to retrieve massive amounts of textual data regarding millions of users in real-time.

Given the size of the data involved, we need to carefully select suitable geographical boundaries for collecting and processing data. We decide to focus on certain subway stations within the Manhattan region, which cover different service zones according to population density, land use patterns, and infrastructure connectivity. Within each zone, we gathered data for ten consecutive weeks starting January 1st, 2019 until June 15th, 2019, which includes morning rush hours, afternoon peak hours, evening rush hours, and midnight to early night hours.

During data collection, we made sure to follow best practices for data quality and consistency, including checking the accuracy and completeness of all collected data, documenting any issues encountered along the way, and implementing robust error handling mechanisms. We also ensured that no personal identifying information was shared publicly, ensuring privacy protection for our participants. Overall, we believe that using both weather and social media data allows us to capture complex interactions between different variables and produce more accurate predictions than traditional approaches.

# 5.Evaluation Metrics
To assess the accuracy of our model, we compare its predicted values against ground truth values obtained through manual surveys conducted at regular intervals. Each survey took place six times per week, once during the morning rush hour, twice during the afternoon peak hour, and once during the evening rush hour, except for July 1, when the survey was held during evening rush hour for safety reasons. Since the weather and social media data vary widely in their temporal and spatial characteristics, we separately evaluated the accuracy of our model in each scenario.

To measure the accuracy of our model in predicting future demand, we use Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as our primary metric. MAPE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and true values divided by the sum of the absolute differences between the predicted and true values. Intuitively, MAPE quantifies how well the model fits the observed data. We report the MAPE averaged over all five weekly surveys for future demand forecasting and separately for the other three scenarios.

Additionally, we use Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as a secondary metric. RMSE measures the square root of the squared distance between the predicted and true values. While MAPE focuses on the overall magnitude of the error, RMSE is more sensitive to small deviations. Therefore, we compute the RMSE averaged over all five weekly surveys for future demand forecasting and separately for the other three scenarios.

Finally, we use Precision@k as a third metric to evaluate our model's ability to rank top k results accurately for predicting the demand ranking of top k stations during the morning rush hour. Specifically, given a list of k stations ordered by their predicted demand for that hour, we count the correctness of our model in correctly ordering the first k stations. We repeat this process for the other three scenarios to get precision@k scores for each.

# 6.Limitations
Despite our best efforts to ensure consistent and complete data collection, errors still occur occasionally and must be addressed swiftly. Some of the main challenges include missing or incorrect weather or social media data, invalid or unreliable sensor measurements, unexpected crashes or network failures, and biased or misleading social media content. Depending on the severity of the issues, we may need to rebuild or update our database or retrain our models periodically to account for the changes. Similarly, frequent updates to machine learning algorithms and libraries may cause minor degradations in performance. Nevertheless, our proposed approach appears promising and has the potential to benefit many users around the world.
