# 1.简介
  

Data Science is the new buzzword that is being adopted by businesses and professionals alike due to its revolutionary impact on various industries such as finance, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and many more. However, one of the main challenges faced by data scientists is finding the right books or resources for effective learning. In this article, we have listed down the top 10 data science books you must read before every job application in order to gain a strong understanding of the subject matter. We hope that these books will help you develop your skills, make better-informed decisions when it comes to choosing a career in data science, and improve your chances of getting hired quickly.

# 2.背景介绍What Is Data Science?
In simple words, data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines business intelligence, computer programming, statistics, machine learning, and applied mathematics to extract insights from large datasets. The goal of any data science project is to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data in order to enable decision-making across various fields, including marketing, sales, customer service, operations, and research.

# 3.基本概念术语说明
Let's understand some basic concepts and terms used in data science:

1. Data - This refers to raw facts or observations obtained from various sources such as text files, databases, logs, emails, social media posts, sensors, and physical experiments. It can also be referred to as input or features.

2. Data Mining - The process of analyzing large volumes of structured and unstructured data using various techniques like statistical analysis, clustering, classification, association rule mining, and neural networks. It involves extracting valuable insights from the data through pattern recognition algorithms.

3. Data Wrangling - This involves transforming and preparing raw data into a format suitable for data mining, cleaning up missing values, handling outliers, resolving duplicates, etc.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - This involves the initial investigation of the dataset to understand the underlying structure, find patterns, spot anomalies, and validate assumptions. It involves visualizing the data using graphs, tables, and charts to get a bird’s eye view of the data distribution.

5. Statistical Modeling - This involves developing mathematical models to estimate patterns and relationships between variables based on their correlations, covariances, and other statistical properties. These models are then used to make predictions about future events or outcomes.

6. Machine Learning - This involves training computers to learn without explicitly programmed rules from examples. Instead, they use algorithms and statistical techniques to infer patterns from data and make predictions or classifications automatically.

7. Deep Learning - This involves applying advanced deep neural network architectures to complex high-dimensional data sets with multiple layers of nonlinear processing units. Deep learning has led to breakthroughs in areas such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. 

8. Python Programming Language - This is the most commonly used language for data science projects. Many data analysis libraries and frameworks like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Apache Spark, leverage Python heavily.

9. R Programming Language - Another popular choice among data scientists for its simplicity and ease of use. It provides powerful data manipulation tools like dplyr and ggplot2, which are widely used in data exploration, visualization, and modeling tasks.

10. SQL Programming Language - SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used for managing and querying relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. It is especially useful for working with large datasets because it allows users to select, filter, join, aggregate, and manipulate data efficiently.

# 4.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
To fully understand how each algorithm works, let's look at three key steps involved in data mining:

1. Data Preparation - This includes cleansing and transformation of data to remove irrelevant information, handle missing values, normalize/standardize data, and split the data into test and train subsets.

2. Feature Engineering - This involves identifying important features in the dataset by analyzing the correlation matrix, performing feature selection methods, and engineering custom features.

3. Algorithm Selection and Tuning - Once the relevant features are identified, we need to choose appropriate algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering. Additionally, we may need to tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance. 

For example, Linear Regression uses ordinary least squares (OLS) to fit linear models to dependent and independent variables. Here is the formula:

    y = b + w1*x1 + w2*x2 +... + wp*xp
    
where y is the target variable, x1, x2,..., xp are the predictor variables, b is the intercept term, and wi are the coefficients. For Binary Classification problems, Logistic Regression uses sigmoid function to map predicted probabilities to binary labels. The formula for Logistic Regression is:

    P(y=1|X) = 1/(1+exp(-z))
    z = β0 + β1*X1 +... + βp*Xp
    
where X1, X2,..., Xp are the predictors, β0, β1,..., βp are the coefficients, and exp() is the exponential function. Gradient Descent optimization algorithm is used to minimize the cost function during model fitting.

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised clustering technique that partitions the dataset into k clusters based on similarities between the instances and their attributes. The objective is to minimize the total intra-cluster variance around the centroids while maximizing the similarity between cluster members. The K-Means++ initialization method helps avoid convergence to suboptimal solutions.
