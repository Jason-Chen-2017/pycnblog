# Introduction
Automated video creation has become an integral part of education from schools all over the world. However, most of the traditional video creation techniques still face numerous limitations when applied to STEM curricula or courses for various demographics. These include accessibility issues, unclear content structure, and limited access to specialized content knowledge. On the other hand, recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled many creative applications including image manipulation, computer animation, and virtual reality. 

One approach to automate video creation for differentiated instruction is to use deep neural networks (DNNs), which are capable of analyzing complex visual information and producing realistic videos automatically. One example is StyleGAN, which generates highly detailed and photorealistic images given only a single textual input description. Other examples include CycleGan, which creates cyclic video sequences given paired images, and VQ-GAN, which learns vector quantization loss between generated frames and reference ones. 

The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art automated video creation techniques used for differentiated learning across multiple application domains. We start by reviewing several topics related to this topic, such as video content generation, learning analytics tools, and optimal instruction design strategies. Based on our literature survey, we highlight critical gaps in the current solution space and identify emerging trends in creating appropriate content for various types of learners and contexts. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions and outline open questions to help guide future work in this area. 


# Key points
In summary, the following key points summarize what was discussed above:

1. Automated video creation is becoming more relevant in the context of STEM education due to its ability to create visually appealing, immersive, and accessible learning experiences. Traditional video creation techniques often fail to achieve these goals. Some promising approaches to automate video creation include DNN-based generative models like StyleGAN, CycleGAN, and VQ-GAN.

2. There exist several popular application domains where automated video creation could be leveraged to enhance learning outcomes, including Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM). Current advances in DNN-based content creation offer promising insights for developing effective learning materials tailored to specific needs and interests of learners.

3. Challenges and opportunities exist in the development of automated video creation techniques for differentiated instruction. For instance, some technologies may require greater computational resources than others to process large volumes of data. Additionally, some problems such as lack of annotation or poor quality training datasets pose significant barriers to effectively train AI models. Despite these challenges, there is great promise in applying modern machine learning algorithms and advanced optimization techniques to optimize the output of these systems.
