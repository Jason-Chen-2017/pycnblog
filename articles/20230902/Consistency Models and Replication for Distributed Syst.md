## What is Consistency?
Consistency refers to the process of ensuring that all copies of data are in a consistent state at any given time. Consistency can be achieved through several models such as linearizability, sequential consistency, causal consistency, and eventual consistency. In this article, we will focus on the main two consistency models: **linearizable** and **Causal Consistency**. 

## Linearizability
Linearizability ensures that each transaction reads or writes the same value from memory even if the system is partially concurrently accessed by multiple transactions. It guarantees serializability (i.e., it provides a global ordering over all operations) and thus, makes the database ACID compliant. Linearizability has been shown to be an optimal consistency model under practical conditions, which means that its performance cannot be worse than other alternatives. The read-write conflict problem between two concurrent transactions arises when one transaction attempts to modify some data while another transaction is reading or modifying the same data. If both transactions attempt to commit their changes atomically, then they must agree on what should happen first without causing unbounded blocking or starvation.

### How does Linearizability work?
In order to ensure linearizability, we need to provide a total order of events across different components of the distributed system. For example, if there are multiple databases running simultaneously, we may use a timestamp server to maintain a global clock that orders all operations across all nodes. Each node uses timestamps to sequence its operations and records them along with their respective dependencies in a log. When a client wants to access a resource, it sends a request to one of the replicas that contains the latest copy of the requested object. To enforce serializability, these requests wait until the local replica's clock catches up to the current global timestamp. Once the local clock catches up, the replica responds to the client with the most recent version of the object.

### Implementation using Google Cloud Spanner
To implement linearizability in a cloud environment like Google Cloud Spanner, we use the following approach:

1. Global Timestamps: We maintain a single source of truth called the "global timestamp" that serves as the canonical timeline for all updates within the system. This timestamp is updated whenever a write operation is performed, and is used to coordinate concurrent operations among different replicas.

2. Synchronous Commits: All writes are synchronous, meaning that clients block until the corresponding update is visible to all replicas before returning success to the user.

3. Ordering Guarantees: Writes are ordered based on the global timestamp, meaning that every update is guaranteed to be applied after all previous updates regardless of the order in which they were submitted. 

4. Concurrency Control: Transactions acquire locks on the resources being modified during their execution. These locks prevent conflicting operations from interfering with each other.

The combination of these mechanisms ensures that all replicas eventually reach a consistent state, whether due to network partitioning or failures.

## Causal Consistency
Causal consistency maintains a partial order over operations and enforces consistency only when no counterexample exists. Causal consistency requires that every write operation takes place in a context where all previous operations have taken place. This condition is met implicitly in many systems because they always replicate data consistently across all machines. However, not all replicated databases guarantee causal consistency. Therefore, it becomes necessary to explicitly enforce causal consistency rules when needed.

### How does Causal Consistency work?
Causal consistency works by maintaining a strict partial order over operations, where every pair of operations is assigned either an precedes relation or an overlap relation depending on whether they operate on overlapping regions of data. When a client wants to perform a write operation, it first asks the coordinator to issue a timestamp token that represents the maximum of all tokens seen so far. The coordinator then chooses a leader replica that has the largest timestamp and issues commands to all other replicas to apply any outstanding operations prior to the chosen timestamp. After the leader completes its task, it informs the coordinator about its completion and repeats the process recursively until all affected replicas have caught up to the new timestamp.

### Implementations using Apache Cassandra and MongoDB
Apache Cassandra and MongoDB also support explicit causal consistency modes. In Cassandra, causal consistency is implemented using lightweight transactions that enable clients to specify a custom ordering of operations to be executed within the context of a session. Clients can specify this order using the "serial_consistency_level" parameter. The default level is SERIALIZABLE, which guarantees causal consistency.

MongoDB uses causal consistency by default unless there is a unique index on the relevant fields or there are multi-document transactions involved.
