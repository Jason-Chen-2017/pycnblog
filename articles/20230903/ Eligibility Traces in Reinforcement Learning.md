Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that learns by interacting with an environment and taking actions to maximize the reward signal it receives from its actions. In recent years, RL has achieved tremendous success in solving complex problems like playing video games or robotic tasks. It can be considered as one of the most powerful machine learning paradigms due to its ability to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so. However, there are many challenges associated with RL such as curse of dimensionality and exploration-exploitation tradeoff, which make it difficult for researchers to achieve high performance on challenging tasks. One solution to these challenges is to use eligibility traces, a technique introduced by Bellman in his 1957 paper “Dynamic Programming”. This article will explore the importance of eligibility traces and how they can improve RL algorithms' performance over existing methods. Specifically, we will examine the widely used REINFORCE algorithm, which uses eligibility traces to update policy parameters based on the observed rewards at each time step. We will also discuss some potential limitations of using eligibility traces and suggest ways to address them in future work.

Eligibility traces were first introduced by Bellman in 1957 in his seminal paper "Dynamic programming". The main idea behind eligibility traces is to store information about previous interactions between agent and environment so that this information can be used to update agent's action selection strategy in the next iteration. In essence, eligibility traces allow agents to remember past experiences and leverage this knowledge to take more efficient and diverse actions. 

Early works on reinforcement learning focused mainly on finding the optimal policy that maximizes cumulative discounted returns after observing a fixed number of steps, such as Q-learning and Monte Carlo methods. These approaches are computationally simple but have several drawbacks: 

1. They don't handle variable-length episodes well because they assume fixed length horizon.

2. They suffer from issues related to sample inefficiency when dealing with large state spaces.

3. They ignore temporal correlation among subsequent states and may not capture intrinsic value of states.

These shortcomings motivated researchers to look into alternative methods for updating policy parameters based on individual observations, known as episodic methods. Episodic methods rely on sampling episodes of experience from the environment, where each episode starts with initial observation(s) and ends when an episode termination condition is met. Once sampled, the method updates policy parameters based on all transitions within the episode. Examples include actor-critic networks, model-based RL, and deep reinforcement learning. 

One common approach in both types of methods is to estimate the expected return of a given state-action pair under the current policy, denoted as $Q_t(\theta)$ in actor-critic methods and $v_\pi$ in model-based RL, respectively. The main challenge here is to efficiently compute the gradient of $Q_t(\theta)$ or $v_\pi$ with respect to the policy parameter $\theta$, since the true return cannot be computed until the end of the episode. One popular trick is to approximate the gradient through samples obtained during training, which improves the stability and convergence of the optimization process. Despite their advantages, however, episodic methods still face significant challenges compared to fully online methods such as Q-learning and Monte Carlo methods. For example, they require additional computational resources and typically require multiple passes over the entire dataset before converging to the optimal policy. Moreover, they fail to exploit the intrinsic value of states captured by the environment, making them less effective than model-free methods. To address these limitations, recent works have proposed hybrid methods that combine elements from both episodic and online methods, such as SARSA, TRPO, and PPO. These methods balance theoretical guarantees with practical performance by combining advantages of either class of methods while avoiding their disadvantages.

In summary, eligibility traces and other techniques inspired by dynamic programming have been central to the development of reinforcement learning and contributed significantly towards achieving practical success. However, their impact on modern RL systems remains limited, particularly when faced with new challenges such as scalability, exploration-exploitation tradeoff, and sample complexity. As the field matures, new algorithms and ideas emerge that aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, thereby enabling even the most ambitious RL research projects to make progress in realistic environments.
