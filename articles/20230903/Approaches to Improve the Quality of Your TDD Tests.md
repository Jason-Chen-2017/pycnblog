Test-driven development (TDD) is a software engineering approach that promotes writing automated tests before writing code. This practice has been shown to be an effective way to increase test coverage and improve maintainability over traditional manual testing methods. However, despite its success in improving product quality, there are still some challenges associated with using TDD effectively. One challenge is how to write high-quality TDD tests that actually isolate and cover different components or features of the system under test (SUT). 

In this article, we will explore three approaches for improving the quality of your TDD tests:

1. Ablation Testing: Remove redundant/irrelevant portions of the SUT from the test cases to focus on what matters most and reduce noise. 

2. Mutation Testing: Introduce small changes to the source code that could cause unintended behavior and check if these modifications result in failing tests. 

3. Equivalence Partitioning: Split the input space into smaller subsets, generate separate sets of tests for each subset, and run them separately to ensure correctness without interference between their results. 

We will demonstrate each approach by implementing them in a simple SUT called "Calculator". We hope that this example provides a clearer understanding of why it's important to improve TDD test quality, as well as illustrate the practical application of these techniques in real-world scenarios. 

Before diving into our explorations, let’s quickly review some key concepts related to TDD.

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test-driven development (TDD), also known as Test-first development or Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD), is a software development process that relies upon the repetition of a short cycle of analysis, design, coding, and testing. The basic idea behind TDD is to write automated tests before any non-test code, and then use those tests to guide the implementation of new functionality. This practice aims to produce higher-quality code faster than other software development methods.

## Unit Test
A unit test is a piece of code used to verify a specific aspect or feature of a program. It typically consists of a set of inputs, conditions, and expected outputs. Unit tests should only test one specific component or function at a time and can be automatically executed during the build or continuous integration process.

## Integration Test
An integration test verifies the interaction between several parts of a larger system. These tests typically involve multiple units or modules being combined together to form a complete end-to-end system. Integration tests must account for all possible combinations of inputs and edge cases, and may require special hardware or infrastructure.

## Mock Objects
Mock objects are simulated versions of real objects that provide controlled responses to method calls. They allow developers to isolate themselves from complex dependencies and external systems while testing individual components or classes within the system under test. By mocking out external interfaces, developers can ensure that their code works correctly even when interacting with external services such as databases or web servers.

## Stubs
Stubs are simplified copies of existing components or functions that serve as stand-ins for production implementations. Unlike mock objects, stubs do not have full control over their behavior and return predefined values. They are useful for simulating certain behaviors that cannot occur during normal execution, such as error handling or file access operations.

# 3. Approach #1: Ablation Testing
Ablation testing involves removing irrelevant portions of the system under test (SUT) from the test cases to focus solely on what matters. For instance, suppose we wanted to implement addition functionality in our calculator. Here are two test cases involving adding positive numbers:

```python
def test_add_positive():
    assert Calculator().add(2, 3) == 5
    
def test_add_more_positives():
    assert Calculator().add(7, -5) == 2
```

While both test cases cover positive number additions successfully, they also include checks for negative numbers which might never happen in practice but make the tests brittle because they rely on assumptions about the inputs. To eliminate these assumptions, we can modify the first test case to exclude negative numbers altogether:

```python
def test_add_positive():
    assert Calculator().add(2, 3) == 5
    
    try:
        Calculator().add(-2, 3)
        raise AssertionError("Negative number was added")
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        Calculator().add(2, -3)
        raise AssertionError("Negative number was added")
    except ValueError:
        pass
```

By checking for errors instead of assuming anything about the inputs, this modified test case reduces the chances of false positives due to incorrect assumptions about invalid inputs. In essence, ablation testing focuses on reducing the size and complexity of the test cases rather than relying too heavily on implicit knowledge about the input domain. Additionally, by breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems, we can ensure that our solution does not become excessively complex and fragile.
