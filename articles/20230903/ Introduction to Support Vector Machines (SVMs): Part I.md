Support vector machines (SVMs) is one of the most popular and powerful machine learning algorithms used for classification or regression problems. In this article we will discuss the mathematical foundations behind SVMs by introducing some basic concepts and terms related to SVMs, followed by a detailed explanation of how SVMs work and their optimization algorithm. We also present code implementations in Python language and provide explanations on how they can be used for various applications such as text classification, image recognition and stock market prediction. Finally, we conclude with future directions and challenges for SVMs and list out common issues and solutions.

In this first part of our series, we will focus on the mathematical foundations behind SVMs. We start by reviewing some fundamental concepts in supervised learning that are relevant to understanding SVMs. Then we move onto deriving the optimal separating hyperplane for SVMs using geometry and calculus. Next, we derive the kernel trick that allows us to use non-linear data sets for classification tasks without actually transforming them into higher dimensional spaces. Finally, we explore techniques like soft margin and slack variables to improve the performance of SVMs. 

By the end of this article you should have a strong grasp of the core ideas and principles underlying SVMs and feel comfortable applying these insights to solve real world problems through hands-on coding exercises. Furthermore, you should be able to identify potential areas where further research is needed and make informed decisions about moving forward in your career. 
# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 监督学习
Supervised Learning (SL) refers to a type of Machine Learning technique that involves training models on labeled datasets. The dataset consists of input features X and corresponding output labels y. The goal of an SL model is to learn a mapping function from input space X to output space Y so that it accurately predicts the output given any new input. Supervised learning models can be classified into two types: Classification and Regression.

Classification models try to predict discrete output values while regression models aim at predicting continuous output values. For example, binary classification involves distinguishing between two classes (e.g., positive vs negative), multi-class classification involves assigning multiple labels to a single instance (e.g., handwritten digit recognition), and regression models aim at predicting numerical outputs (e.g., price predictions).

## 2.2 支持向量机（SVM）
SVM stands for Support Vector Machine which is a binary classifier, capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification tasks. SVM constructs a hyperplane in n-dimensional space(where n is the number of features in the dataset) to separate the data into two classes based on maximizing the margins of the support vectors. Margin is defined as the distance between the decision boundary and the closest data point from either side. A large margin gives more importance to the correct classification of the training examples.

The optimal hyperplane is chosen such that the maximum distance between the hyperplane and the nearest training observation points from both the classes is minimal. This hyperplane defines the separation between the two classes, which may not always exist in high dimensions or even under certain conditions depending upon the choice of kernel functions. It is important to note that SVM doesn’t directly produce probability estimates, but only hard classifications (i.e., it assigns each sample to one of the two possible classes). If probabilistic estimates are required, other methods such as logistic regression can be used after training the SVM model.

## 2.3 感知机
Perceptron is another type of supervised learning algorithm that was introduced over 20 years ago. Perceptrons are simple neural networks consisting of just one layer of interconnected nodes called neurons. Each neuron receives inputs from its previous layers and calculates weighted sums based on these inputs. These weights determine the strength of connections between the neurons. The activation value of the neuron is determined based on a threshold function applied on the weighted sum calculated by the neuron. Neurons activate only when the weighted sum surpasses a certain threshold level, indicating that the input signal is significant enough to cause an output. Otherwise, the neuron remains inactive and does not contribute to the final output.

Perceptrons are generally used for binary classification tasks. However, there are variations of perceptrons designed for multi-class classification tasks, including One versus All (OvA) and One versus One (OvO). OvA approach involves training multiple classifiers for different pairs of target classes, whereas OvO approach involves training multiple pairwise classifiers among all possible combinations of target classes.

## 2.4 核技巧
Kernel method is a powerful tool for working with high-dimensional data sets. Instead of projecting the data into a lower dimension space, kernel method works directly with the original feature space to obtain better results. The main idea behind kernel method is to introduce a similarity measure between the instances instead of relying on explicit features. Kernel method achieves this by calculating a dot product between the learned transformation matrix and each instance in the input space. Once the transformed instances are obtained, traditional SVM algorithms can be used to classify the instances according to their membership in the same or different classes.

There are several commonly used kernels such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF) and sigmoid. Depending on the problem at hand, choosing the appropriate kernel function may result in improved accuracy or speedup compared to standard SVM approaches. Also, kernel method can handle mixed data types such as categorical and continuous features.

## 2.5 软间隔支持向量机（Soft-Margin SVM）
When training an SVM model, the samples belonging to the boundary are considered correctly classified. Samples outside the margin area (margin violation region) may violate the constraint imposed by the margin width parameter. Such violators are called misclassified. To avoid making unnecessary mistakes, the authors proposed the concept of soft margin SVM which introduces a penalty term associated with misclassified samples within the margin violation region. This way, the objective function penalizes those misclassified samples and makes the decision boundary less prone to overfitting. Soft-margin SVM has been shown to perform well in many application domains, especially in imbalanced datasets.

## 2.6 拉格朗日对偶问题
The Lagrange duality provides a unified framework for solving constrained convex optimization problems subject to quadratic constraints. Let x denote the primal variable and z the dual variable. The Lagrangian function L(x,z)=f(x)+∑λ_i(∇_if(x)_i^T+h(x)) is derived from the objective function f(x) and the constraint set h(x). Minimization of the Lagrangian function leads to the solution of the primal and dual problems respectively.

Lagrangian duality offers an elegant way to solve non-smooth optimization problems by decoupling the optimization process into subproblems that are easier to solve individually. Specifically, if the problem satisfies KKT condition, then the solution of the primal problem and the dual problem coincide. Therefore, alternatively minimizing the primal and dual objectives until convergence can be used to optimize the constrained convex optimization problem.

The key advantage of Lagrangian duality is that it generalizes existing procedures for optimizing smooth unconstrained convex functions with constraints. Moreover, due to its closed form expression, Lagrangian duality can be efficiently solved for small to moderate sized optimization problems.
