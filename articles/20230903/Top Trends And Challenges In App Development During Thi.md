## Pandemic and mobile app development

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges for everyone involved in building digital products. It forced many companies, organizations and individuals to pivot their businesses and adapt to new ways of working while still staying connected online. The most prominent challenge was the spread of the virus, which triggered global recessions and economic downturns across numerous industries. Many companies and organizations were either temporarily closed or had to adapt their operations to work remotely. However, mobile app development has taken notice due to its unique set of features, reach and potential popularity. Over the past several months, there have been numerous developments around mobile app development. Here are some interesting facts related to mobile app development:

1. Mobile app development is becoming one of the fastest growing markets in terms of revenue and usage volumes. By 2021, mobile app companies like Apple and Google expect to generate $17 trillion in annual revenue.
2. Mobile app development platforms such as Android, iOS, and Windows Mobile have seen tremendous growth over the last few years. They now have millions of active users and billions of downloads per month.
3. Companies across industries are adopting mobile app development as they are able to deliver applications faster than ever before. For example, retailers such as Amazon and BestBuy are using mobile technologies to enhance their stores with innovative offers.
4. There is a significant rise in competition within the mobile app development industry, leading to new startups entering the space and displacing existing players. 
5. Despite being highly complex and requiring multiple skills sets, mobile app development is becoming more accessible with programming languages like Java and Swift.

## History of mobile app development

Mobile app development has always been an exciting but risky endeavor because of its complexity and user experience aspect. Building mobile apps requires knowledge of software engineering, graphic design, marketing, testing, management, and communication skills. These skills have become even more critical in recent times when mobile devices continue to increase in size, resolution, battery life, and power consumption. As a result, there have been many attempts at simplifying app creation processes through tools like Xcode and Visual Studio Code. Within each platform, developers can use various frameworks and libraries to build cross-platform apps that target both iOS and Android systems.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile app development was relatively straightforward compared to today's complex landscape. Developers could choose between Objective-C/Swift or Java programming languages depending on their skill level and preferences. However, since then, development teams have started facing a number of roadblocks and obstacles in developing successful mobile apps. 

1. Job loss due to distance and remote working restrictions

   As people were required to work remotely and therefore not able to access jobs quickly and efficiently, employment opportunities dropped significantly. As a result, many companies struggled to find skilled workers who could help develop their apps effectively.
   
2. Increased costs associated with COVID-19

   Due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, travel restrictions, reduced vaccination rates, and other factors, the cost of developing mobile apps has skyrocketed. Moreover, the pace of technological advancements makes it difficult for small developers to keep up with the pace of change.
   
3. Higher competition from established developers

   Especially among developers who have worked professionally for decades, it becomes harder for younger and less experienced developers to get noticed. This leads to disgruntled employees who leave without receiving compensation. Additionally, established developers may have concerns about how their hard work will translate into revenue if they sell their services to smaller companies.
   
Additionally, while the COVID-19 pandemic has presented numerous challenges to mobile app development, it has also provided opportunities for innovation and breakthroughs. Some key trends that emerged include:

1. Rapidly growing focus on end-to-end product development

   As more developers are relying on mobile app development to create their brand identity, content strategy, and customer acquisition strategies, they need to shift their focus towards creating comprehensive and customizable solutions that address every facet of their business. This puts pressure on developers to deliver high-quality solutions in shorter sprints that can enable them to respond swiftly to changing customer demands. 
   
2. Accessibility driven by open source SDKs

   While mobile app development has moved away from proprietary SDKs, open source options provide a flexible alternative that allows developers to leverage prebuilt code and modules to boost efficiency. This brings forth the possibility of accelerated app development cycles and enhanced developer satisfaction. 
    
Overall, mobile app development has evolved massively over the past several years, making it essential for any organization to invest in the technology and resources necessary to succeed.
