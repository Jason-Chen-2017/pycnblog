在过去的一百多年里，人类历史上发生了几次重大的科技革命，其中最重要的就是由人的大脑与神经细胞所驱动的大规模生物计算能力的发明和推广，被称作“大脑与信息处理”。这一过程中的关键一步就是如何从高维、非结构化的数据中提取有效的特征，然后运用这些特征进行分类、预测等任务。而人工智能正是指利用这种人类智慧的机器学习能力。

二十世纪末至今，人工智能领域已经成为一个具有雄心勃勃的研究领域，许多大牛们正在致力于探索AI的各个方面。近年来，以深度学习（deep learning）为代表的人工智能技术已经获得了巨大的突破性进步，无论是在人类的身体识别、翻译、驾驶、图像识别等诸多领域还是在游戏、虚拟现实等新兴应用领域都有着前所未有的技术水平。然而，对于深度学习技术背后的数学基础知识还很少有系统的整理，导致一些初学者难以理解。因此，为了帮助更多的初学者了解深度学习技术的内涵及其数学基础，笔者将系统的梳理出这些知识点，并给出相关的代码实现。希望通过这样的教程，能够对初学者有所启迪，促使他们能够更加系统的理解深度学习算法的工作原理。


# 2.1 Basic Concepts in AI and Neural Networks
## 2.1.1 What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves building algorithms capable of learning from experience or data without being explicitly programmed. In simpler terms, it means “learning” by itself and it refers to the ability of machines to learn and improve from their experiences, just like humans do. 

The goal of machine learning is to develop software systems that can automatically detect patterns in large datasets and predict future outcomes based on those patterns. This process involves feeding algorithm with training examples that contain inputs and corresponding outputs, allowing the system to identify patterns and relationships between them. Once the model has learned these patterns, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The key aspect here is that the system does not require explicit instructions for how to achieve its objective. Rather, it learns from the data it is provided to make accurate decisions based on what it sees at hand.

In practice, ML algorithms are often trained using supervised or unsupervised techniques, which involve either labeled or unlabeled input-output pairs respectively. Supervised learning involves the use of both input and output data to train an algorithm, while unsupervised learning only relies on input data. Different types of ML models can also be classified into regression, classification, clustering, and recommendation systems. Regression models aim to predict continuous variables such as stock prices, while classification models focus on identifying discrete categories such as spam detection or image recognition. Clustering methods group similar instances together while recommendation systems suggest products or services that may be relevant to users.

## 2.1.2 Types of Data and Models
Data can be categorized into structured and unstructured forms depending on whether it contains numerical values, text, images, videos, etc. Structured data includes tables, spreadsheets, relational databases, and time-series data whereas unstructured data consists of raw texts, audio files, video streams, social media posts, and other non-tabular data formats.

Models can be further categorized into three main types:

1. Probabilistic Models
	These models assume that each instance in the dataset follows a probability distribution. For example, Naïve Bayes assumes that each feature is independent of others given the target variable and applies Bayes' theorem to compute conditional probabilities. Other probabilistic models include decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. 

2. Nonparametric Models
	Nonparametric models do not assume any functional form for the data distribution. They instead represent the data distribution through summary statistics computed over subsets of the data called clusters. Examples of nonparametric models include K-means clustering, density estimation, and hierarchical clustering.

3. Parametric Models
	Parametric models assume some functional form for the data distribution, typically linear models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and polynomial regression. These models have parameters that need to be estimated from the training data before making predictions on new data. Examples of parametric models include Gaussian processes, linear discriminant analysis, and random forests.

Sometimes, there might be multiple competing ideas about how best to approach a problem. For example, a deep learning model could be built using a mixture of probabilistic models, alongside nonparametric models, and finally a parametric model such as a neural network. This type of hybrid approach allows the model to combine strengths of different approaches to create a better overall solution. 


## 2.1.3 Recap and Conclusion
This chapter introduced the fundamental concepts involved in AI and neural networks. We defined machine learning as the capability of developing automated computer programs capable of learning from experience rather than being explicitly programmed, and we discussed various types of data and models. Finally, we summarized important topics in this section and will now move onto more advanced topics in the next few chapters.
