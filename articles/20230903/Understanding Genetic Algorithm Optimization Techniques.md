# 1.简介
  

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are widely used optimization techniques for solving complex problems. In this article, we will explore the basics of GAs by implementing some examples in Python and demonstrate how to use a popular genetic algorithm library called PyGMO. 

GAs are based on the principles of evolutionary computation which involves reproduction, mutation, selection, and survival of the fittest. They operate under the assumption that the solution is an organism with DNA and can be represented as a binary string or chromosomes. The fitness function plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of GAs by evaluating each candidate solution at every iteration. By creating new offspring from parent solutions through crossover and mutating them, they are able to find better solutions than those obtained by other methods such as brute force search. Additionally, multiple generations of solutions are compared to select only the best ones for further breeding and exploration. Finally, GAs have been proven effective in handling many real-world problems such as optimizing the parameters of models, scheduling, and routing. Therefore, understanding the fundamentals behind GAs will help us implement more advanced variants in our applications.

In addition to explaining the basic concepts and operations of GAs, this tutorial also provides code snippets demonstrating how to use the PyGMO library to solve practical problems and improve efficiency in our research projects. We hope that readers gain a deeper understanding of the working mechanism of GAs and their potential advantages over brute force search while also gaining hands-on experience with the implementation of GAs using PyGMO. At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to develop your own GA-based software toolbox and apply it in various fields of science and engineering.


# 2.Prerequisites
Before diving into technical details, let's briefly go over the necessary background knowledge required to understand this tutorial:

* Basic programming skills such as variables, loops, conditionals, data structures, functions, etc.
* Knowledge of linear algebra, probability theory, and statistics would be helpful but not essential. 
* Familiarity with optimization techniques and solvers such as gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, quasi-Newton methods, trust region methods, simulated annealing, etc., would be beneficial but not strictly required.
* An understanding of object-oriented programming paradigms such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction would be advantageous but not necessary.

With these preliminaries out of the way, let's get started!

# 3.Concepts & Terminology
## 3.1 Population, Individuals, Chromosomes, and Fitness Functions
The fundamental concept in GAs is the population. It represents a collection of individuals that are interconnected through their genetic information. Each individual has a set of chromosomes representing its genotype, which can take any value within a specified range. The fitness function evaluates the performance of an individual based on its chromosome values. For example, suppose we want to optimize the parameters of a machine learning model. The fitness function could measure the accuracy of the model on a test dataset based on its weights and biases.

To evolve the population iteratively, the following steps are performed sequentially:

1. Selection - Select a subset of individuals from the current population based on their fitness scores. This ensures that the most fit individuals make up the next generation.
2. Crossover - Reproduce selected parents through recombination between their chromosomes. This allows the new offspring to inherit both good features from their parents.
3. Mutation - Introduce random changes in the offspring’s chromosomes to introduce diversity and avoid local minima.
4. Survival of the Fittest - The remaining individuals who do not participate in the reproduction process are replaced by non-fit individuals that scored higher during the previous generation. These individuals provide additional variations and prevent premature convergence towards a suboptimal solution.

This cycle continues until either a stopping criterion is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Each individual in the population is defined by three key components:

### 3.1.1 Genome
A sequence of nucleotides or genes that encode the genetic information of the individual. Each gene takes one of two possible states or values, typically expressed as either 0 or 1.

### 3.1.2 Phenotype
The physical manifestation of an individual after it is decoded from its genome. It consists of the functional characteristics of the individual that determine its fitness relative to other individuals in the population. For instance, if we are trying to optimize the parameters of a machine learning model, then the phenotype would include the weight and bias values assigned to each neuron in the model.

### 3.1.3 Fitness Value
A scalar value indicating the quality of the individual’s representation of the problem domain. Higher fitness values indicate greater ability to solve the problem. Typically, the fitness value is computed based on a cost or error metric measured on a validation dataset. A lower fitness value indicates that the individual performs better than a randomly initialized solution. If there are multiple objectives, we can define a multi-objective fitness function.

The overall goal of evolutionary computation is to maximize the fitness of all individuals in the population over time. Once converged, the optimal solution(s) may exist within the population regardless of whether they were explored during the course of evolution.

## 3.2 Types of Operators and Parameters
There are several types of operators and parameters involved in GAs including:

### 3.2.1 Crossover Operator
Crossover operator combines the genetic material from two parent individuals to create one or more child individuals. During crossover, specific segments of genetic material from the chromosomes of the parents are combined together to form the basis for the offspring. Some commonly used crossover operators include single point crossover, two point crossover, uniform crossover, and order crossover. Single point crossover involves selecting a single point along the chromosome, copying the genetic material from one parent’s chromosome to the offspring except where it overlaps with the copied segment from the other parent, and then repeating the same procedure for the second parent’s genetic material. Two point crossover involves selecting two points along the chromosome, splitting the chromosome at those points, and combining the genetic sections using a combination rule such as average or weighted sum. Uniform crossover selects a random section of the chromosome from each parent and copies the corresponding portion of the chromsome from the fitter parent to the offspring. Order crossover shuffles the order of genetic material across the entire chromosome.

### 3.2.2 Mutation Operator
Mutation operator adds random variation to the genetic material of an individual. One common method is adding Gaussian noise to the chromosomes, resulting in small changes that slightly change the underlying structure or internal state of the chromosome. Other mutations involve swapping adjacent genes within a chromosome, deleting a portion of the chromosome, inserting a random new gene into the chromosome, or changing the sign of the bits in the chromosome. To maintain consistency with the rest of the population, mutations often occur with low frequency compared to crossovers, although different approaches favor different tradeoffs.

### 3.2.3 Selection Strategy
Selection strategy determines how individuals are chosen for reproduction in subsequent generations. Common strategies include tournament selection, roulette wheel selection, probabilistic selection, and ranking selection. Tournament selection involves choosing k individuals at random, then choosing the best-scoring individual among them as the winner. Roulette wheel selection involves spreading the fitness values evenly throughout a sector or ring around the circumference of a circle, then selecting a random spot on the circle. Probabilistic selection assigns probabilities to each individual based on its fitness value, then selects an individual according to its assigned probability. Ranking selection involves assigning a rank score to each individual based on its fitness value, then selecting the top performing individuals for reproduction. All of these strategies involve deterministic selection procedures that choose parents and offspring without considering their interaction.

### 3.2.4 Recombination Scheme
Recombination scheme determines the degree of mixing of genetic material from parental chromosomes when two or more individuals mate. Common schemes include one-point, two-point, arithmetic, and geometric mean recombination. One-point recombination involves selecting a single cutting site, copying the genetic material from one parent’s chromosome to the offspring except where it overlaps with the copied segment from the other parent, and then repeating the same procedure for the second parent’s genetic material. Two-point recombination involves selecting two cutting sites, splitting the chromosome at those points, and combining the genetic sections using a combination rule such as average or weighted sum. Arithmetic and geometric mean recombination combine the genetic information from both parents by taking their arithmetic or geometric means, respectively, and expressing the result as the offspring’s genetic information.

### 3.2.5 Elitist Archive
Elitist archive maintains the best solutions found so far in the population. Newly born children are added to the archive unless they perform poorly. Old members of the population gradually become less significant due to mutations and loss of fitness. Once the elite archive becomes too small or decays, the replacement strategy replaces some old members with newborns from the population to fill the void.

### 3.2.6 Initial Population
Initial population refers to the group of individuals that start out in the population before any evolutionary activity begins. It defines the size of the population, their initial position in the search space, and the chance of getting stuck in a local minimum. Depending on the problem being optimized, different initialization strategies can lead to better results.

## 3.3 Algorithms
There are several standard algorithms available for GAs, including NSGA-II, SPEA2, MOEA/D, etc. Each algorithm uses a unique set of operators and parameters depending on the nature of the optimization problem being solved. Here are some general guidelines on selecting an appropriate algorithm:

For simple optimization problems with few decision variables and constraints: Use NSGA-II. It works well for continuous optimization problems with smooth fitness surfaces and efficient feasible solutions.

For constrained optimization problems with moderate numbers of decision variables and constraints: Use CMA-ES or PSO followed by NSGA-II for final refinement. CMA-ES tends to work better for highly non-convex problems with expensive objective functions. PSO can be useful for identifying promising regions of the search space, improving the likelihood of finding good solutions, and reducing runtime. NSGA-II refines the pareto front generated by CMA-ES or PSO by eliminating dominated solutions, ensuring uniqueness, and dealing with constraint violations.

For noisy optimization problems with large numbers of decision variables and constraints: Use SMPSO or IPOP-CMA-ES followed by NSGA-II for final refinement. Both methods attempt to handle noisy and sparse fitness landscapes by introducing global exploration and encouraging diversity. SMPSO improves upon PSO by applying the self-adaptive momentum update technique, allowing it to adapt to the local curvature of the fitness landscape. IPOP-CMA-ES extends CMA-ES to incorporate interactive strategies that allow for adaptive control of the exploration rate and variance. NSGA-II refines the pareto front generated by SMPSO or IPOP-CMA-ES by fixing violating constraints, removing duplicates, and dealing with duplicate offspring.

Finally, note that the choice of algorithm depends on the computational resources available and the complexity of the optimization problem. Furthermore, experimentation is often required to identify the best settings for the parameters of the algorithm.
