Transfer learning (TL) is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task can be leveraged to perform well on another related but different task by transferring knowledge from the first model’s learned representations to the second model. TL has become an essential component of modern deep learning systems that use large amounts of data and compute power. It enables transferability across tasks with different data distributions or input modalities. However, it remains challenging to apply in low-resource settings where there are limited training examples available. In this paper, we explore how TL works specifically when applied to NLP tasks for low-resource languages such as Swahili, Somali, and Amharic. We also discuss potential challenges and benefits of applying TL to these languages, and suggest ways to address them. Finally, we provide empirical evidence showing that TL provides significant improvements over fine-tuning on small datasets compared to traditional techniques. 

In summary, our work suggests that while TL may not always improve performance on low-resource languages, its effectiveness in practice depends on both the quality of labeled data available and the ability of the pre-trained models to capture relevant features. Additionally, some language-specific issues such as morphological complexity and lexical density make it harder than others to leverage pre-trained models effectively. Overall, our research indicates that Tl could still have substantial impact on low-resource languages, and more research is needed to identify effective strategies for their application.

We introduce here a study into how transfer learning (TL) works particularly when applied to natural language processing (NLP) tasks for low-resource languages. While recent advances in NLP have led to many societal impacts, these advancements often rely heavily on abundance of training data, which is rarely accessible in real-world scenarios. As a result, it becomes increasingly important to develop methods for leveraging pre-trained models in low-resource environments. 

For example, in low-resource environments like those encountered in rural areas around the world, access to high-quality text corpora is typically limited due to cost or cultural barriers. This makes it difficult for most models to learn robust language understanding capabilities without being retrained using extensive annotated data sets. The need to apply TL techniques to deal with the scarcity of training data calls for a new approach to NLP in low-resource environments. 

Another challenge faced by practitioners working in low-resource environments is dealing with language-specific problems such as variations in morphology and lexical density. These differences make it difficult to exploit pre-trained models directly, leading to the development of domain-specific architectures, including custom feature extraction mechanisms. Applying existing pre-trained models to low-resource languages would require careful consideration of these specific challenges.

Our goal is to provide an overview of what transfer learning is and why it is useful for NLP in low-resource environments. Moreover, we survey several approaches to apply TL techniques to low-resource languages, including architecture designs, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics. Specifically, we propose a series of experiments to assess the efficacy of TL algorithms for NLP tasks in low-resource languages, based on a combination of theoretical analysis, empirical evaluations, and open questions.

Transfer learning (TL) has been widely used in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) applications, especially in cases where a large amount of labeled data is unavailable or impractical to acquire. A major advantage of TL is the fact that it allows us to benefit from prior knowledge gained from solving one problem, and transfer that skill to solve another similar problem. There exist various frameworks for implementing TL, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN), meta-learning, and domain adaptation. Despite their importance, little attention has been paid to whether or not TL can be successfully applied to low-resource languages. 

Therefore, we begin by reviewing literature on TL in NLP, highlighting the key challenges associated with applying it to low-resource languages. Then, we present a brief history of research on transfer learning for low-resource languages, exploring current trends and future directions. Next, we define commonly used terms and concepts in NLP, including representation learning, transfer learning, zero-shot learning, and few-shot learning. We then describe core algorithmic details of popular transfer learning techniques such as fine-tuning, distillation, and cross-lingual learning. Our review should provide context for our subsequent discussion on how transfer learning applies to NLP tasks in low-resource environments.  

In general, transfer learning is characterized by two main components:

1. Pre-training: A model is pretrained on a large scale dataset using standard supervised learning techniques, i.e., backpropagation through time (BPTT). 
2. Fine-tuning: Once the pre-trained model is trained and validated, it is finetuned on a smaller task-specific dataset using only the last layer(s) of the network. During fine-tuning, the weights of all layers except the last layer(s) are frozen and only the weights of the last layer(s) are updated to minimize loss on the target task. 

The intuition behind fine-tuning is that if a pre-trained model is already able to recognize certain patterns in language, then it shouldn't be necessary to train the entire network from scratch just to get good performance on a specific task. Instead, the last layer(s) can simply be adjusted to fit the new task's output. Other variants include distillation and cross-lingual learning, which combine multiple pre-trained models to create better predictions at inference time. The choice between each variant ultimately depends on factors such as the size of the pre-trained models, the computational resources available, and the desired level of performance.

Before discussing the specific challenges and benefits of transfer learning, we will first summarize the progress made in transfer learning over the past years and identify some promising avenues for future research.
