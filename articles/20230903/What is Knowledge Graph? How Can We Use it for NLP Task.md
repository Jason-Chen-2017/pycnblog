# 1.简介
  

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has accelerated the development of natural language processing (NLP). With AI becoming more and more capable, we can build applications that are able to understand human language effectively by utilizing large-scale knowledge bases such as knowledge graphs or ontologies. In this article, I will explain what a knowledge graph is and how it can be used for natural language processing tasks. 

# 2. Knowledge Graph Introduction
A knowledge graph (KG) is a type of structured data model that represents entities and their relationships. It consists of nodes representing things like people, places, organizations, events, etc., and edges connecting these nodes with additional information about their relationships. These edges represent facts and assumptions that hold between two nodes. By organizing all relevant data into a KG, we can use advanced algorithms to extract insights from text, making NLP easier than ever before. Some examples of knowledge graphs include Google's knowledge graph, DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCyc, YAGO, and WordNet. 

To create a knowledge graph, we need to collect and curate data. This involves manually creating triples where each triple contains an entity, predicate, and object. For example, if we want to add the fact that "Mary lived at George House", our triples would look something like:
```
(Mary, livesAt, George House)
```
In a real-world scenario, we would have hundreds or even thousands of triples. However, manual creation of these triples can be time-consuming and expensive, especially for complex domains such as medical research. Therefore, we usually utilize pre-existing resources such as open datasets or semantic web standards to generate our KGs. Here are some popular sources of knowledge graphs for NLP tasks:

1. **Ontology/Schema:** Ontologies are formalized schemas that define classes and properties of entities. They are often created using standard modeling languages such as RDF and OWL. For instance, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains several ontology repositories including Schema.org, which defines common structures for describing web pages and other online content. 

2. **Textual Datasets:** Textual datasets contain raw unstructured text such as news articles, social media posts, user reviews, etc. These datasets can be ingested using techniques such as keyword search or topic modelling to automatically identify relationships between different concepts mentioned within them. Examples of popular textual datasets for NLP include BBC News Dataset, Reddit Comment Corpus, Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset, and Movie Review Dataset. 

3. **Database Tables:** Database tables are another way to obtain structured data. They typically consist of columns containing attributes and rows containing instances of those attributes. Knowledge extraction systems can then infer new relationships based on correlations between attributes and entities represented in the table. A popular dataset source for database tables is Freebase, which provides a wide range of domain-specific knowledge expressed in the form of typed relations between entities. 

4. **Linked Data:** Linked data refers to various linked resources, such as HTML documents, images, videos, databases, APIs, and other files that provide context for one another. Similarly to traditional websites, these linked resources connect together via hyperlinks. Knowledge extraction systems can also leverage linkages between resources to identify hidden relationships across domains. An example of a popular repository of linked data for NLP tasks is DBPedia, which stores structured information about entities such as movies, musicians, television shows, etc.  

Overall, building a knowledge graph requires expertise in machine learning, statistical analysis, and knowledge representation. It takes significant effort to curate and maintain the graph over time, but once constructed, its value should be clear. Additionally, there are many third-party services available that can help you explore existing knowledge graphs and integrate them into your application. In conclusion, the explosion of big data and NLP has led to the emergence of powerful natural language processing tools that require massive amounts of knowledge. Knowledge graphs offer an efficient solution to store and access this vast amount of information while enabling us to perform sophisticated analytics on it.
