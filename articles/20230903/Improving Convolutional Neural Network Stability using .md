Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been shown to be very powerful in image classification tasks. However, the success of CNNs has also attracted attention from other areas such as reinforcement learning (RL), where they are often used for complex environments with a large action space. The problem is that training CNNs can become unstable due to the vanishing gradient or the exploding gradients problems which can be particularly critical when dealing with these types of complex environments with many variables and actions. In this article we will explore two techniques called Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Synaptic Intelligence, that help to stabilize the training process by reducing the chances of vanishing/exploding gradients. We will explain how these techniques work and demonstrate their effectiveness on the popular ImageNet dataset through experiments with different models. Finally, we will discuss the potential advantages and limitations of both techniques and suggest directions for future research.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to be highly effective in image recognition tasks. They consist of layers of neurons arranged in multiple convolutional and pooling operations, leading to an accurate and robust representation of visual information. Despite being proven to be successful in numerous applications, they still face some challenges: one common issue with them is the instability during training due to the presence of vanishing or exploding gradients, which makes it difficult to converge effectively. This means that small changes in the weights cause the output values to change significantly, leading to poor convergence. Additionally, since CNNs use shared parameters across all filters, updating only one filter can potentially affect the performance of other filters.

Therefore, several methods have been proposed to address these issues, including regularization techniques like L2 regularization, dropout, etc., which improve generalization but do not guarantee stability. There is also the concept of transfer learning, where pre-trained CNNs are fine-tuned on new datasets to adapt to the specific characteristics of each task. However, none of these solutions guarantee complete recovery of the original weights if they were corrupted during training.

To overcome this limitation, recent works propose to leverage the cooperation between the weight matrix and its derivatives to perform better updates during training. Two prominent examples of such techniques are synaptic intelligence and elastic weight consolidation (EWC).

## Introduction to EWC
Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) was introduced by Lin et al. in 2017, and is a regularization technique that encourages the model to reuse previously learned patterns instead of starting from scratch every time. It does so by adding an extra term to the loss function that penalizes the differences between current and past weights, according to how much they changed recently. By doing so, it tries to preserve the importance of older knowledge while giving more weight to newer ones, resulting in improved generalization capabilities. Here's how it works:

1. At the beginning of training, a separate copy of the full weight matrix $\Theta$ is stored.
2. During training, the gradients are computed normally, with respect to the most up-to-date parameters $\theta$.
3. After each update step, the difference between the current parameters $\theta$ and the previous version is computed ($\Delta \theta = \theta - \hat{\theta}$), along with a penalty term $f(\delta)$ that depends on the difference $(\frac{||\Delta \theta_{t}||}{T})^{2}$, where T is the number of steps taken before recomputing the loss.
4. The final loss is modified accordingly by adding the term $\lambda f(\delta)^\top (\Delta \theta_{t})$, where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between the penalty term and the standard cross-entropy loss.
5. The updated parameters $\theta'$ are obtained by subtracting the product of $\lambda$ and $f(\delta)^\top$ from the corresponding elements of $\Theta$ and $\theta$.

This procedure guarantees that old connections tend to stay close to their initial values, whereas new connections start fresh and learn independently from each other. Overall, EWC helps to reduce the impact of vanishing gradients and accelerate the training process, making it suitable for complex deep networks with many parameters and long training times.

## Introduction to Synaptic Intelligence
Synaptic Intelligence (SI) is another method for improving the training stability of neural networks. Its main idea is to monitor the activity levels of individual neurons throughout training and dynamically adjust the strength of their synapses based on this activity level. Specifically, SI keeps track of the mean activation per neuron at different points in time during training, and uses this information to modify the relative strength of the incoming synapses to each neuron. More precisely, given a target activation level $A_t$ for a particular neuron $i$ at time $t$, SI computes the current activation level $a_t$ of the neuron at time $t$ using a moving average filter of size $k$, i.e.:

$$ a_t = \frac{(A_t + k \cdot a_{t-1} + (k-1)\cdot a_{t-2}+\cdots )}{k+1} $$

where $k$ is a hyperparameter that determines the window size. Once the current activation level is available, SI modifies the strength of the incoming synapse weights by multiplying them with the factor $w_t / a_t$, where $w_t$ represents the raw synapse weight value. The modified weights then drive the postsynaptic neuron to fire with greater rate than otherwise possible.

The key insight behind SI is that individual neurons behave differently depending on their input signal and environmental conditions. For example, neurons may respond slowly to certain inputs or experiences less excitatory conductance when performing certain behaviors compared to others. To take into account these variations, SI dynamically adapts the overall strength of each synapse to optimize the overall response speed of the network. Overall, SI allows us to train deeper and wider networks without worrying about exploding or vanishing gradients.

In summary, both EWC and SI contribute towards addressing the problem of stochasticity caused by vanishing or exploding gradients by modifying the dynamics of the weight updates during training. Both methods attempt to capture important aspects of past experience, thus enabling the model to recover from corruptions more efficiently than usual approaches. Nevertheless, they introduce additional terms to the optimization objective, which might increase the complexity and make the training process harder to interpret. Therefore, careful evaluation and comparison of both methods is needed to choose the best approach for a given application.
