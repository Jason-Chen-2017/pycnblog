Data governance is the process of managing a company's data assets to ensure their accurate usage, retention, security, compliance, accessibility, and management over time. Data governance frameworks have become increasingly essential in organizations that deal with large volumes of sensitive or valuable information. In this article, we will explore some popular data governance frameworks and tools for you to understand what they are and how they can help your organization improve its data governance practices. 

# 2.核心概念、术语及缩写词释义
- **Data:** Refers to facts, numbers, or other information stored electronically within an organisational system, often in digital format. It includes both structured and unstructured data such as text files, spreadsheets, emails, images, videos, audio clips etc. 
- **Information:** Any subject matter that has value to someone who needs to make sense of it through observation, understanding, interpretation, and communication. Information is widely used throughout all industries and fields including business, law, medicine, science, and technology. The term "information" also refers to the ideas, thoughts, concepts, or judgments conveyed by humans through written language or spoken words. 
- **Organisation:** An entity consisting of people, processes, policies, and technologies designed to provide benefits to stakeholders. Organisations typically work together to achieve a common objective, whether it be economic growth, social welfare, environmental protection, or national defense. 
- **Data ownership:** A legal concept whereby certain individuals, companies, or institutions own the right to use, sell, or disclose a particular piece of data. This typically involves assigning property rights (e.g., copyright) and creating accounting records keeping track of the individual or group that owns the data. 
- **Metadata:** A set of data about data, describing properties, characteristics, or features of data objects. Examples include keywords, descriptions, timestamps, file sizes, content types, and geographic locations. Metadata provides critical contextual information needed for efficient data processing, access control, discovery, search, analysis, and reporting.
- **Retention policy:** Defines the conditions under which data should be retained after being created, accessed, modified, deleted, or transferred. Retention periods vary depending on different scenarios such as regulatory requirements, business requirements, and user preferences. Different solutions exist to manage retentions based on specific rules and parameters, from automated systems to manual review and approval.
- **GDPR:** Regulation enacted by the European Union to address privacy concerns raised by the GDPR Act 2016. The GDPR sets out new data protection laws for EU citizens’ personal data stored online and defines various safeguards for users’ data sharing and secure storage. 
- **SOC 2 Type 2:** A standardised methodology for establishing controls to protect organizations against cyber threats. SOC 2 covers internal controls, external controls, and personnel screening. Types 1 and 3 exist as well but are less relevant to data governance.
- **NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5:** Federal government mandated guidelines covering several areas of IT security such as identification, authentication, authorization, auditing, and configuration management. 
- **Privacy by design:** A software development approach that aims to ensure privacy by default while ensuring that users always have full control over the data collected and shared by an app or service. Privacy by design focuses on strong technical and procedural measures to create platforms and applications that respect user privacy. 
- **Compliance program:** Consists of a series of procedures, standards, guidelines, and best practices designed to comply with various legal requirements and industry specifications related to data handling and use. Compliance programs offer organizations clear paths to meet stringent data protection requirements and maintain ethical behavior. 


# 3.数据治理流程
The typical data governance flow consists of four main steps:

1. Planning & Assessment: Understanding the current state of the data, identifying risks and opportunities, setting goals and objectives for data governance, developing a data governance plan, and conducting regular reviews of the data.
2. Identification: Ensuring that data owners are identified accurately and responsibilities assigned appropriately, ensuring that appropriate documentation is provided, and considering possible impacts upon business operations. 
3. Establishing Controls: Developing controls to monitor and control data usage, access, transfer, deletion, and disposal activities. These controls may involve monitoring data at multiple points during the lifecycle, implementing governance standards and guidelines, training staff members, and communicating with relevant parties regarding data security issues. 
4. Continuous Improvement: Continuously evaluating data governance performance, identifying potential improvements, and adjusting controls accordingly. Regular updates, reports, and evaluations contribute to improving data governance effectiveness across the organization. 

These basic principles apply to most data governance frameworks regardless of their implementation details. As mentioned earlier, there are many open source and commercial solutions available that support different aspects of data governance. We will highlight several examples below to illustrate how these frameworks enable businesses to improve their data governance practices:
