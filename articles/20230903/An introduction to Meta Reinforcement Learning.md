Reinforcement learning (RL) is a class of machine learning algorithms that learn from interacting with an agent and optimizing the interaction to achieve maximum rewards or minimize penalties in a given environment. It has been widely used for many applications including robotics, gaming, and autonomous driving. However, RL suffers from two critical drawbacks: high sample complexity and limited generalization ability due to its sequential nature. To address these issues, meta-learning approaches have emerged recently as a promising solution. In this article, we will discuss what meta-reinforcement learning is and how it addresses both challenges. 

Meta-learning involves training an agent to learn how to solve tasks efficiently using a variety of different environments and tasks within those environments. The goal of meta-learning is to develop a model of the underlying task structure and transfer knowledge across different environments and tasks. This enables the agent to adapt quickly and effectively to new environments without requiring significant human intervention or domain expertise. By solving complex tasks that require exploration, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning, meta-learning can provide greater generalization performance than traditional deep neural networks and reinforcement learning agents.

In summary, meta-reinforcement learning offers several advantages over traditional methods such as deep neural networks and reinforcement learning. Firstly, it allows for more efficient learning by reducing the amount of data required for each specific problem. Secondly, it provides better generalization performance because it learns to handle variations in the problem space through transfer learning. Finally, it can handle problems that are too difficult or too similar to the ones it was trained on, making it capable of accommodating a wide range of tasks and environments. Overall, meta-reinforcement learning represents a valuable advancement in artificial intelligence research. 


# 2.基本概念术语说明
Let’s now define some key concepts and terms that we need to understand before diving deeper into the details of meta-reinforcement learning. We assume readers are familiar with basic reinforcement learning terminology such as states, actions, policies, reward functions, and so on. If not, please refer to other introductory articles on RL.

## Meta-Learning
Meta-learning is a process where an AI system is trained to learn how to solve various tasks by leveraging prior experience, i.e., experience acquired while solving one type of task but transferred to solve another related task. Meta-learning leverages large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data by building a model of the underlying task structure and automatically adapting to new environments and tasks without requiring extensive manual intervention or domain expertise. Metalearning uses supervised learning techniques to train a policy that takes input observations from multiple environments and outputs action recommendations based on the learned task structure.


## Meta-Agent/Task
A meta-agent refers to an AI system that utilizes meta-learning to learn how to solve multiple tasks simultaneously. Each individual meta-agent may contain multiple sub-agents, which may be simple reinforcement learning agents or more complex models like neural networks. A meta-task defines the set of tasks that a meta-agent needs to solve, along with their associated environments and datasets. 

## Task Structure
The task structure defines the sequence of tasks that a meta-agent must perform to complete the overall objective. For example, a hierarchical task structure might involve first navigating to a top level goal and then completing intermediate subtasks that contribute towards the final goal. A flat task structure consists of a linear sequence of tasks performed sequentially. The choice between flat and hierarchical structures depends on the goals and constraints of the application.

## Transfer Learning
Transfer learning refers to transferring the skills learned in one task to another related task. Meta-learning helps to reduce the number of samples needed by adapting to new environments and tasks without requiring retraining the entire model from scratch. Transfer learning assumes that the relevant features, if any, remain constant across the source and target domains.

## Batch vs Online Learning
Batch learning refers to the use of full datasets during training, while online learning updates the weights incrementally after processing a single observation at a time. The choice between batch and online learning depends on the computational resources available and the latency requirements of the application.

There are several types of meta-learning algorithms, including independent multi-task learning (IMT), collaborative learning, and transfer learning. Here, let's focus on IMT, also known as catastrophic forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a model becomes so good at solving a particular task that it forgets all previous experiences and struggles to recover even though there is still plenty of useful information left in the task dataset. Although current deep learning approaches can usually learn well enough from few examples, they become fragile under catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, meta-learning algorithms have been proposed to tackle catastrophic forgetting by developing a shared understanding of the task structure and sharing knowledge across environments and tasks. IMT attempts to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by regularizing the parameters of the model across different tasks to avoid overfitting. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Pretrain a common embedding layer for all tasks based on fixed initializations.
2. Train individual submodels for each task by minimizing the mean squared error loss between the predicted and actual task embeddings computed using the common embedding layer. These submodels share the same weight vectors up to the last layer.
3. Update the parameters of the common embedding layer by computing the weighted average of the submodel weight vectors obtained in step 2 according to the similarity score between the task embeddings obtained from steps 1 and 2. The weights used for averaging are determined by taking into account the accuracy of predictions made by the corresponding submodels in step 2.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until convergence or a certain stopping criterion is met. At the end of training, the common embedding layer should capture meaningful patterns in the task representations that are robust against catastrophic forgetting.

To implement IMT, we need to divide the training dataset into training and validation sets for each task, where the former contains a mixture of examples from all tasks except the test task, while the latter only includes examples from the test task. During training, we alternate between updating the parameters of the common embedding layer and fine-tuning the weights of the individual submodels to optimize the validation loss. Once converged, we can evaluate the performance of the meta-learner on the test task by aggregating the predictions made by the individual submodels. 

Curiosity-driven exploration (CDER) is another popular meta-learning approach that learns to explore the task space more efficiently by using intrinsic motivation. CDER encourages the agent to explore regions of the state space that seem worthwhile and intrinsically motivates it to discover and exploit novel solutions that yield high rewards. The idea behind CDER is to estimate the uncertainty of the agent’s estimates of future returns and use it to guide the search for novel ideas and strategies. Specifically, CDER adds a curiosity module to the agent architecture that predicts a scalar signal representing the likelihood of the next state being desirable. The curiosity module acts as a bonus reward to encourage exploration in areas of the state space where the agent finds high variance in the expected return. Then, the agent explores locally to find states with high probability of receiving high rewards and eventually exploits these findings to improve the long-term performance. CDER is particularly effective in tasks with high dimensions and sparse reward signals.

Here's a brief overview of CDER:

1. Initialize a network Q(s;θq) with randomly initialized weights θq. This network maps states s to a scalar signal r(s). Rather than directly predicting the scalar value of the signal r(s), the network produces a probability distribution over possible values of r(s) by applying a softmax function.
2. Initialize a replay buffer D = {D[i] : i=1,...,n} where n is the size of the buffer and D[i] = {(s,a,r(s)+β(s')−r(s),s'), a random transition sampled from the behavior policy πb}, where β(s′) is the intrinsic reward function that measures the desirability of exploring the state s′. The importance sampling ratio ρt(i) defined below specifies the degree to which D[i]'s contribution to the gradient update contributes to the overall loss.
3. Start an episode E and execute action a_t according to the behavior policy πb. Collect transitions (s_t, a_t, r_t+1, s_t+1) and store them in the replay buffer D. Compute the cumulative discounted reward G_t = ∑_{k=0}^∞γ^kr_tk for k=0 to N-1, where γ is the discount factor and N is the time horizon.
4. Sample batches of transitions (B, B+α, A, R) from D using prioritized experience replay. Set α = 1/(N+1) and B = 0 initially. Define the priority p(j) as max{min(p_max, p(j)), ε} where j is the index of a transition in the buffer, p(j) is the absolute TD error, p_max is a pre-defined upper bound on the absolute TD errors, and ε is a small positive term used to ensure nonzero probabilities. For each batch, compute the target values y_j = r_j + γQ'(s_j+1,argmax_aQ(s_j+1,a)) using a target network Q'(s;θ'). Multiply the importance sampling ratios ρt(j) to the TD errors δ(j) obtained from prioritized replay. Compute the weights wj = (N*p(j))**(-τ) for each transition in the batch. Normalize the weights so that Σwj = 1.
5. Update the critic network Q(s,a;θ) by minimizing the weighted mean square error L = (Σwjδ(j)^2)/N, where θ is the parameter vector of the critic network, wj is the weight assigned to each transition, and τ is a hyperparameter specifying the degree of weight shrinkage. Use stochastic gradient descent with momentum to update the critic network weights.
6. Generate a new candidate action a' ~ πc(.|s',θπ) for state s'. Append (s',a',G_t+r_t+1) to the replay buffer D. Predict the intrinsic reward r'_t for the new transition using the curiosity module. Add the difference between r(s')+β(s'+1)−r(s') to the target value y_t instead of just adding r_t+1. Store the updated transition ((s_t,a_t,y_t),(s',a',r_t+1+r'_t)).
7. Repeat steps 5-6 for K epochs. Evaluate the performance of the meta-learner on the test task by aggregating the predictions made by the individual submodels.

In conclusion, meta-reinforcement learning provides a powerful framework for addressing the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and achieving higher levels of generalization performance compared to traditional methods.
