## 概述
概率论和统计学是数据科学的基础，也是所有领域的基础知识。不了解这些理论，就无法做到精通分析和处理数据的工作。本文将带你走进数据科学领域，让你真正掌握这两门大学问。你可以用机器学习、模式识别、图像处理、数据分析等工具解决实际问题；也可以构建可靠、准确的模型，帮助企业解决业务问题。

## 数据科学生命周期
数据科学生命周期（Data Science Lifecycle）由许多阶段组成，如问题定义、数据获取、数据理解、数据预处理、特征工程、建模、实施、监控及反馈、迭代更新等。在每个阶段，都需要用到一些基本的统计方法，例如线性回归、逻辑回归、聚类分析、方差分析、信息论、蒙特卡洛方法等。这些统计方法可以用于建模预测数据中的趋势、关联关系、异常值、变化规律等。除了统计学方法，数据科学还涉及到很多其他的计算机科学技能，包括数据存储、编程语言、软件工具、云计算平台等。



# 2.Probability and Statistics for Data Science
## 2.1 Basic Concepts
### Set Theory
A set is a collection of objects that are unordered, distinct and may have no fixed order. Sets can be finite or infinite in size. A set contains elements or members which are denoted by an arbitrary symbol such as $A$, $X$ or $\Omega$. The empty set is represented by the null set or $\emptyset$. We use the symbols "∈" and "∉" to indicate membership in sets, i.e., "$x \in X$" means that $x$ belongs to the set $X$. 

### Events and Random Variables
An event is a subset of outcomes from a sample space. It represents a specific occurrence during an experiment. For example, rolling two dice may yield either 4 or 5 as their sum. If we want to define an event related to this scenario where the total sum equals 6, then it would be written as $\{6\}$ (or $E = \{6\}$). In probability theory, events form the basis of statistical inference, with random variables providing a powerful tool for modeling real-world phenomena.

A **random variable** takes on one of several possible values on a given outcome space, each with some associated probability. For example, let's say we flip a coin three times. Each time we observe heads or tails, this observation corresponds to one of four possible outcomes ("HHH", "HTT", "THH", and "TTT"), with equal probabilities of 25%. We could represent these outcomes using a function, called the probability mass function (PMF), $f(x)$, which maps each outcome to its corresponding probability. For instance, if $X$ represents the random variable corresponding to the number of heads observed after three flips, then the PMF might look like:

$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & x \neq 0 \\ 
0.25 & x = 0 \\ 
0.25 & x = 1 \\ 
0.25 & x = 2 \\ 
0.25 & x = 3 \\ 
\end{cases}
$$ 

In general, the value of a random variable depends only on the particular outcome obtained during a certain experiment. Therefore, we can use mathematical notation to write $P(X = k)$ as shorthand for the probability of obtaining exactly $k$ heads when flipping a coin three times.
