Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest topics in modern technology with many applications across multiple industries including finance, healthcare, energy, manufacturing, transportation and logistics. With rapid advancements in machine learning algorithms, AI has become a revolutionary concept that will transform our lives forever. However, with its complex nature, it is not easy for anyone to understand how these algorithms work behind the scene without an understanding of their inner workings. The complexity of AI lies within the mathematical equations used by the algorithm and its interaction with other parts of the system, which makes it difficult to visualize or explain its behavior.
In this article, we will explore the hidden complexity behind artificial intelligence through the lens of mathematical analysis and visualization techniques. We will discuss about the core concepts involved in building AI systems, such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms. Furthermore, we will demonstrate several interactive visualizations using popular data science libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly. These visualizations will help us understand how these algorithms learn, reason, and make decisions under various scenarios.
Overall, our goal is to raise awareness on the fundamental principles of AI and enable developers and researchers to better understand the technical challenges faced by the field and take effective actions towards creating more robust and reliable AI solutions.

## Introduction
In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, unlike natural intelligence that exists in organisms. It involves developing intelligent machines capable of performing tasks usually requiring human level cognitive skills. One branch of AI known as machine learning uses statistical methods to develop models from example inputs and outputs to generalize those patterns to new, never seen before examples. This technique enables machines to identify and analyze relevant information from large datasets, effectively enabling them to perform tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, translation, recommendation engines, and decision making. Another type of AI called deep learning employs neural network architectures inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain, allowing machines to recognize patterns in large, complex datasets, with the potential to improve upon traditional machine learning algorithms. 

While some may refer to both types of AI as "artificial intelligence," they are often distinguished based on their approach, focusing either on analyzing raw input data or implementing neural networks to process massive amounts of data. In this post, we will focus on exploring the underlying mathematics and logical processes that make up artificial intelligence algorithms, specifically reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, and deep learning. Understanding these principles can provide insight into how these algorithms learn, reason, and make decisions, allowing us to design more robust and reliable AI solutions.

## Mathematical Analysis
### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by trial and error based on reward signals provided by the environment. RL relies heavily on dynamic programming and modeling, along with temporal difference learning, to ensure that agents receive appropriate feedback and adjust their policies accordingly. To accomplish this task, RL algorithms use two main components: an agent and an environment. An agent takes action in response to observations made by the environment and receives rewards in return. The aim of training an agent to optimize its long-term outcomes over time is called optimization problem, also commonly referred to as "reward maximization". While some RL algorithms have been proven to be highly successful at certain problems, others are still in development. Some notable advances include Q-learning, policy gradient, and actor-critic algorithms.

In reinforcement learning, there are two important mathematical formulations used to model the agent's behavior. First, the state space represents the possible states of the environment at any given point in time, while the action space contains all possible actions the agent can take. Second, the transition function describes the probability distribution of going from one state to another after taking an action. Third, the reward function provides a measure of the agent's performance and affects the value of future rewards.

### Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms devised to mimic the process of natural selection. GAs work by selecting parents from a population of candidate individuals and breeding offspring by combining them according to specific rules defined by a fitness function. In essence, GAs search for optimal solutions by iteratively improving the fitnesses of existing candidates through random mutations and crossover operations. Unlike traditional supervised learning methods like linear regression, GAs do not require labeled data, making them ideal for solving complex optimization problems.

GAs rely on three key components: a gene pool, a reproduction method, and a fitness function. A gene pool is essentially a collection of possible candidate solutions to the problem being solved. The reproduction method determines how to combine parent genes to create offspring. Fitness functions assign numerical values to each solution, determining its quality relative to other solutions. These metrics influence the probabilities assigned to different parent-offspring pairs during reproduction, resulting in the creation of promising improvements to the current best solution.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. DL algorithms utilize adaptive filters that are learned through backpropagation to extract features from input data. These features are then fed into intermediate processing layers, allowing DL algorithms to solve complex tasks like object detection, face recognition, language translation, and speech recognition. By stacking multiple processing layers together, DL algorithms can build sophisticated models that capture complex relationships between input and output variables. Despite significant progress since its introduction, DL remains a challenging area of study due to its high computational requirements and limited scalability to large datasets.
