Microservices architecture has emerged as a popular architectural pattern in recent years for building large-scale cloud applications. Its main goal is to break down an application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, tested, deployed independently, and scaled up or out as needed without affecting the rest of the system. Containerization technologies such as Docker have made it easier than ever to deploy microservices on different platforms and environments with ease, making them attractive choices for cloud-based solutions. 

However, while containers are enabling microservice architectures, they also pose new challenges such as service discovery, configuration management, and dynamic scaling. In this article, we will explore these issues in detail and propose a set of best practices to help you design, build, and operate your next microservices-based cloud application efficiently and effectively. We'll look at various aspects like service orchestration frameworks, monitoring tools, load balancing strategies, and security measures. Finally, we'll talk about upcoming trends in container-based microservices architectures and how to prepare yourself for future evolution of the technology.

To make our articles even more impactful and effective, we'll use real world examples from major companies such as Netflix, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and eBay to illustrate the concepts and techniques discussed above.

2.基本概念术语说明
Before discussing microservices and containers, let's first understand some basic terminologies and definitions used in this article. These terms include: 

 * **Service:** A software module that implements specific functionality or capability. In a microservices architecture, each service runs its own process inside a container and communicates with other services through APIs.
 
 * **Container:** An isolated environment that includes the code and all dependencies required to run an application. It provides a lightweight virtual machine with resource allocation limits to ensure isolation between applications running on the same server.

 * **Orchestrator:** A framework that manages multiple containers across multiple hosts and coordinates their deployment, maintenance, and communication. There are many open source options available, including Kubernetes, DC/OS, Apache Mesos, etc. Some common features of container orchestrators include automatic scheduling, service discovery, health checking, load balancing, auto-scaling, and rollback mechanisms. 

 * **Load Balancer:** Software program that distributes network traffic among multiple servers or containers within a cluster. It enables highly scalable and fault-tolerant systems by distributing incoming requests across multiple instances behind a single endpoint. Common load balancer types include Layer 4 (TCP) load balancers, Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancers, and content delivery networks (CDNs).

 * **Service Discovery:** Service registration and discovery mechanism used by clients to find the location of a particular service instance. It helps to decouple client calls from concrete IP addresses and enables transparent scalability and failover capabilities. Popular service discovery mechanisms include DNS-SD (Bonjour), Consul, etcd, ZooKeeper, etc.

 * **Configuration Management:** Systematic approach to define, maintain, and distribute configuration settings across a distributed system. It ensures consistency, reliability, and compliance by ensuring that configurations are consistent across multiple services and environments. Configuration management tools include Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack.

 * **Monitoring Tools:** Set of tools designed to collect and analyze metrics and logs from infrastructure components such as servers, databases, and services to detect and troubleshoot performance problems. They provide detailed insights into application behavior, availability, and usage patterns. Popular monitoring tools include Prometheus, Graphite, Grafana, Nagios, Elastic Stack, Splunk, and Solarwinds.

 * **Security Measures:** Guidelines and procedures followed to protect information assets from unauthorized access, abuse, intrusion, and data loss. They range from simple password policies to complex encryption algorithms and firewall rules. Security measures play a crucial role in securing microservices-based cloud applications and must be implemented correctly to prevent hackers, criminals, and external threats from accessing sensitive information.
