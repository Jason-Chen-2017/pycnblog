背景
Artificial intelligence (AI) has always been a popular topic in the modern world. It was even thought that AI could one day dominate all aspects of human existence and lead to mankind’s true freedom from suffering, achieving enlightenment, and transcending death. But is it truly possible for AI to achieve these goals? In this article, we will go over some key points about Artificial Intelligence and examine how it can be used in our daily lives by providing concrete examples and real-world applications.

In recent years, AI technologies have become more advanced than ever. The number of artificial intelligence systems being developed continues to grow exponentially every year. This new era of AI begins with the development of machines such as self-driving cars and virtual assistants, which are capable of making decisions and taking actions without being explicitly programmed to do so. These intelligent machines offer us many benefits, including enabling us to perform complex tasks efficiently and reliably, alleviating most of our manual labor, improving safety, and reducing costs. However, there remains much to learn and develop in order to unlock its full potential. 

To make progress on building an AI system that meets the expectations of today’s society, scientists need to understand the fundamentals behind AI and apply them to solve challenging problems or automate routine tasks. For instance, researchers are developing techniques for creating natural language interfaces using machine learning algorithms, while medical professionals are trying to diagnose diseases through automated analysis of images taken by x-rays. Meanwhile, businesses are relying heavily on AI technology for optimizing operations, predicting demand trends, and managing supply chain logistics. Overall, we see a dramatic growth in the field of AI driven by both industry giants and startups alike, but also a significant challenge of balancing the needs of different fields within the same organization to build a robust and effective AI ecosystem.

# 2.基础概念术语说明
Before diving into the technical details of Artificial Intelligence, let's clarify some fundamental concepts and terms that you should know beforehand.

2.1 Machine Learning
	Machine Learning refers to a subset of AI where computer programs can automatically improve performance based on experience and data instead of being explicitly programmed. It involves training a model on a dataset of input and output pairs, then feeding this model new data to produce accurate predictions or outputs. There are various types of machine learning models, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. In general, machine learning models work best when they receive enough training data and their features accurately represent reality.

2.2 Supervised Learning
	Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning technique where labeled data is provided to train the algorithm. During training, the algorithm learns to map inputs to correct outputs. The goal of supervised learning is to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs. Examples include regression, classification, and clustering. 

2.3 Unsupervised Learning
	Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning technique where only input data is available. Without any labels, the algorithm groups similar data points together and identifies patterns or relationships among them. It uses mathematical approaches like principal component analysis (PCA), K-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering to identify hidden structures in the data.

2.4 Reinforcement Learning
	Reinforcement Learning is another type of machine learning technique where an agent interacts with an environment to learn optimal actions and maximize rewards. The agent takes actions in response to observations and receives feedback in return, indicating whether its action caused a positive reward or negative penalty. A common application of reinforcement learning is playing games such as Go or Atari.

2.5 Deep Learning
	Deep Learning is a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. The algorithm works by stacking multiple layers of neurons and using backpropagation to update weights during training. Neural networks are commonly used in deep learning because they can automatically extract relevant features from raw input data and learn complex patterns and relationships across multiple dimensions.

2.6 Artificial Neuron 
	An Artificial Neuron is a basic unit of neural network architecture consisting of three main components: Input, Activation Function, and Output. The activation function determines the strength of connection between neighboring nodes and activates the neuron if the sum of inputs is greater than a certain threshold value. The output of each neuron is passed on to other connected neurons, eventually resulting in the final prediction or decision made by the entire network.

2.7 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
	A Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) is a type of ANN where information flows in only one direction – forward. Each layer consists of a set of neurons, along with connections between them called edges or weights. The inputs enter the first layer, pass through the intermediary layers until the output layer is reached, and finally provide the final result. FFNNs are widely used in image recognition, speech processing, and natural language processing applications due to their ability to process large amounts of complex data.

2.8 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized form of FFNNs mainly designed for image recognition tasks. CNNs use filters to detect specific patterns or shapes in the input image, which makes them highly efficient at identifying objects and recognizing visual features. They consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

2.9 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are special type of ANNs designed to handle sequential data. RNNs contain loops that allow information to persist between iterations, allowing the network to capture temporal dependencies and reason about longer sequences. An example of a sequence data problem is speech recognition, where the input contains multiple frames of audio samples representing the words spoken.
