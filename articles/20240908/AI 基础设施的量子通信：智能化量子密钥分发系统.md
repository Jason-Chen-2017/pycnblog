### Blog Post: AI Infrastructure for Quantum Communication: Intelligent Quantum Key Distribution System

#### Introduction

In the era of rapid technological advancement, the integration of AI into various infrastructure sectors has become crucial. Quantum communication, with its promise of unparalleled security, is no exception. One of the key components of quantum communication is the Intelligent Quantum Key Distribution (IQKD) system, which leverages AI to enhance the security and efficiency of quantum key distribution (QKD). This blog post will explore some of the most frequently asked interview questions and algorithm programming problems related to this field, providing in-depth explanations and code examples where necessary.

#### Interview Questions and Algorithm Programming Problems

##### 1. What is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and how does it differ from classical cryptography?

**Answer:** Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a method of secure communication that uses quantum mechanics to establish a shared secret key between two parties, Alice and Bob. Unlike classical cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of certain mathematical problems, QKD is theoretically unbreakable under current technological limitations due to the principles of quantum mechanics, such as quantum superposition and entanglement.

**Explanation:** QKD ensures the security of communication by detecting any eavesdropping attempts. If an eavesdropper tries to intercept the quantum states, the information about the interception will be detected by the communicating parties.

**Code Example:**

```python
# Python code to simulate the process of QKD
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer

# Quantum states preparation
alice_circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)
alice_circuit.h(0)
alice_circuit.barrier()

bob_circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)
bob_circuit.h(0)
bob_circuit.barrier()

# Quantum channel transmission (assumed here)
# In practice, this would involve quantum teleportation or other quantum channel protocols
alice_send = QuantumCircuit(1)
alice_send.cx(0, 1)

bob_receive = QuantumCircuit(1)
bob_receive.barrier()

# Quantum state measurement
alice_measure = QuantumCircuit(1)
alice_measure.h(0)
alice_measure.measure_all()

bob_measure = QuantumCircuit(1)
bob_measure.h(0)
bob_measure.measure_all()

# Execution
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
results_alice = execute(alice_circuit, simulator).result()
results_bob = execute(bob_circuit, simulator).result()

# Extract key
alice_key = results_alice.get_counts()
bob_key = results_bob.get_counts()

# Check if keys match
print("Keys match:", alice_key == bob_key)
```

##### 2. Explain the concept of entanglement in quantum communication.
