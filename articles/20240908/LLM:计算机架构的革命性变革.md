**Question:** What are the main components of a computer architecture and how do they interact with each other?

**Answer:** The main components of a computer architecture include:

- **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** The core component responsible for executing instructions.
- **Memory:** It stores both instructions and data that the CPU needs to process.
- **Input/Output (I/O) Devices:** They allow the computer to interact with the external world, such as keyboards, monitors, and storage devices.
- **Bus System:** It provides a communication pathway for data transfer between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

**Interaction:** These components interact with each other through the bus system. The CPU retrieves instructions and data from memory, processes them, and then sends the results to the appropriate I/O device. I/O devices can also store and retrieve data from memory.

**Example:**

```c
// Pseudo-code for CPU interacting with memory
CPU {
    Instruction instruction;
    Memory memory;

    void execute() {
        instruction = memory.fetch();
        data = memory.load(instruction.address);
        result = process(data);
        memory.store(result, instruction.address);
    }
}
```

### 2. What are the main types of computer architectures?

**Question:** List and describe the main types of computer architectures.

// Pseudo-code for a 5-stage pipeline
Pipeline {
    InstructionFetch fetch;
    InstructionDecode decode;
    InstructionExecute execute;
    MemoryAccess memory;
    WriteBack write_back;

    void processInstruction(Instruction instruction) {
        fetch.fetch(instruction);
        decode.decode(fetch);
        execute.execute(decode);
        memory.access(execute);
        write_back.writeBack(memory);
    }
}
```

### 4. What is the difference between RISC and CISC architectures?

**How it works:**

- **Address Translation:** The CPU generates virtual addresses, which are translated to physical addresses by the memory management unit (MMU).
- **Page Replacement:** If the physical memory is full, the operating system selects a page to be evicted from memory and stored in secondary storage.

**Example:**

```c
// Pseudo-code for virtual memory
VirtualMemory {
    PageTable page_table;

    int translate(int virtual_address) {
        physical_address = page_table[virtual_address];
        return readFromPhysicalMemory(physical_address);
    }
}
```

### 7. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous I/O?

**Question:** Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous I/O operations in computer architecture.

**Answer:** Synchronous and asynchronous I/O operations differ in how they handle data transfer between the CPU and I/O devices.

- **Synchronous I/O:** The CPU waits for the I/O operation to complete before proceeding with other tasks. This can cause the CPU to idle, reducing its utilization.
- **Asynchronous I/O:** The CPU can continue executing other tasks while waiting for the I/O operation to complete. This improves CPU utilization and overall system performance.

**Example:**

```c
// Pseudo-code for synchronous I/O
CPU {
    void execute() {
        data = performSynchronousIO();
        process(data);
    }
}

// Pseudo-code for asynchronous I/O
CPU {
    void execute() {
        startAsynchronousIO();
        process(data); // Can continue processing other tasks
    }
}
```

### 8. What is the role of a memory management unit (MMU) in computer architecture?

- **Memory Protection:** The MMU ensures that each process has access only to its allocated memory space, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Paging and Segmentation:** The MMU supports techniques like paging and segmentation for efficient memory management.

**Example:**

```c
// Pseudo-code for MMU
MMU {
    PageTable page_table;

    int translate(int virtual_address) {
        physical_address = page_table[virtual_address];
        return readFromPhysicalMemory(physical_address);
    }
}
```

- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple cores can execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving throughput.
- **Increased CPU Utilization:** With multiple cores, the CPU can keep more tasks busy, reducing idle time.
- **Improved Responsiveness:** In a multi-core processor, the operating system can assign different tasks to different cores, reducing the waiting time for a task to be executed.

**Example:**

```c
// Pseudo-code for a multi-core processor
Processor {
    Core core1;
    Core core2;

    void execute() {
        core1.execute(task1);
        core2.execute(task2);
    }
}
```

### 10. What is out-of-order execution and how does it improve performance?

- **Reduced Idle Time:** By executing instructions out-of-order, the CPU can keep its execution units busy, reducing idle time.

**Example:**

```c
// Pseudo-code for out-of-order execution
CPU {
    InstructionQueue queue;

    void execute() {
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            instruction = queue.dequeue();
            if (instruction.dependencyResolved()) {
                execute(instruction);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**How it improves performance:**

- **Reduced Pipeline Stalls:** By predicting branch outcomes, the CPU can continue executing instructions, reducing pipeline stalls caused by branch mispredictions.
- **Improved Instruction Throughput:** Branch prediction allows the CPU to execute more instructions per cycle, improving overall throughput.

**Example:**

```c
// Pseudo-code for branch prediction
CPU {
    BranchPredictor predictor;

    void execute() {
        instruction = fetch();
        if (predictor.predictBranch(instruction)) {
            executeNextInstructions();
        } else {
            handleBranchMisprediction();
        }
    }
}
```

### 26. What is the role of a cache coherency protocol in computer architecture?

**Question:** Explain the role of a cache coherency protocol in computer architecture and how it ensures data consistency across multiple processors or cores.

**Answer:** A cache coherency protocol is a set of rules and mechanisms that ensure data consistency in a multi-processor or multi-core system. In such systems, multiple processors or cores may have their own caches, which can lead to data inconsistencies if not managed properly.

**Role of Cache Coherency Protocol:**

- **Data Consistency:** The cache coherency protocol ensures that the data stored in different caches across multiple processors or cores remains consistent.
- **Synchronization:** It synchronizes the data updates in caches to maintain a coherent view of memory across the system.

**How it ensures data consistency:**

- **Cache States:** The protocol defines different cache states (e.g., shared, exclusive, modified) to manage the data consistency.
- **Invalidation and Update:** The protocol uses invalidation and update mechanisms to ensure that the data in caches is updated or invalidated when necessary.

**Example:**

```c
// Pseudo-code for cache coherency protocol
CacheCoherencyProtocol protocol {
    Cache[] caches;

    void updateCacheState(Cache cache, CacheState state) {
        cache.state = state;
    }

    void invalidateCache(Cache cache) {
        cache.invalidate();
    }
}
```
