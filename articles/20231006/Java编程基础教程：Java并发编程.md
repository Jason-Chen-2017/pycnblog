# 1.背景介绍


Java Concurrent Programming (JCP) is a concurrent computing framework in Java which provides support for executing multiple threads and tasks concurrently within the same program or across different programs running on the same machine or distributed among multiple machines connected over a network. This enables developers to write scalable applications with ease by allowing them to use multi-core processors, integrate complex operations into smaller parts of the application that can run asynchronously, share resources effectively, handle errors gracefully, etc. 

The main focus of this article will be on implementing multithreaded programming using Thread API in Java and its features like synchronization, wait(), notify() methods, locks, atomic variables, thread pools, executors, etc. We will also explore various concurrency design patterns like producer-consumer pattern, reader-writer lock, ReentrantLock, CyclicBarrier, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, Future, CompletableFuture, StampedLock, Phaser, and more. In addition, we will talk about related concepts such as deadlock, livelock, context switching, thread priorities, thread scheduling algorithms, memory model, memory barriers, monitors, blocking queues, thread locals, interference issues, mutable objects shared between threads, and common pitfalls when handling threads.

By completing this article you will gain an understanding of how to develop robust and efficient multithreaded software systems in Java and its advanced capabilities for dealing with concurrency challenges encountered in modern real world applications.

We assume that readers have some basic knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Multiprocessing, and Distributed Systems. Familiarity with computer architecture and operating system concepts would be beneficial but not mandatory. The examples used in this article are written in Java version 17.

This article is targeted towards intermediate level developers who want to improve their skills in writing high-performance multithreaded code using Java SE platform. It should help them understand the core mechanisms involved in Java concurrency and enable them to build practical solutions for problems they encounter in real-world scenarios.

## 2.1 Multithreading and Concurrency

Multithreading and concurrency are two separate but closely related concepts. Multithreading refers to the ability of a single process to execute multiple threads simultaneously while still sharing the same address space and other resources. Each thread executes independently until it completes its task. On the other hand, concurrency refers to the ability of multiple processes or threads to execute concurrently without sharing any resource. A typical example of concurrent processing involves multiple threads executing concurrently in response to user input, server requests, I/O events, etc., without affecting each other's execution. When discussing multithreading and concurrency, it is essential to clarify these terminologies so that readers do not get confused.

To better illustrate the difference between multithreading and concurrency, consider the following analogy: Imagine that there is a baker whose wares are being produced at a busy kitchen counter. All the workers working at the kitchen counter are baking individual dishes, meaning that they are all performing independent tasks. However, since only one worker at a time can work on a piece of cake, the entire group cannot continue until the current order has been completed. If a worker needs to pause his job for a few minutes because he just finished preparing the next batch of dough or flour, another worker can start his own job before the first worker finishes. By doing this, multiple threads can perform simultaneous tasks even though the hardware resources required for each task are limited. Thus, multithreading allows multiple threads to share the same resources, whereas concurrency allows different threads to access different resources simultaneously.

In summary, multithreading refers to the ability of a single process to execute multiple threads while maintaining the integrity of the process' state, including its memory space, file handles, open sockets, etc. Meanwhile, concurrency refers to the ability of multiple processes or threads to execute concurrently without causing race conditions or other synchronization issues. These two ideas are unrelated but often confused together leading to incorrect conclusions. Therefore, it is important to clearly define both terms and understand their relationships.

## 2.2 Execution Model

Execution Model describes how threads interact with the rest of the system, specifically with the operating system kernel. There are several models available, depending on the details of the OS implementation and requirements of the application. Some popular models include Single Threaded Execution (STE), User/Kernel Threads, Multiple Processors with Shared Memory (MPSM), Asymmetric Shared Memory (ASM), and Hybrid Models. Below is a brief description of each model:

 - Single Threaded Execution (STE): This model assigns a single thread to the CPU and uses the thread's call stack to manage function calls and return values. The advantage of STE is simplicity and predictability. However, if a thread blocks waiting for something (e.g., IO operation, mutex), the whole process becomes blocked and no other threads can proceed. In practice, most applications fall under this category due to the overhead caused by switching contexts between threads frequently.

 - User/Kernel Threads: In UKThreads, a set of threads runs alongside the kernel. While the user-space threads can communicate with the kernel via syscalls (system calls), kernel threads exist solely within the kernel and cannot directly influence user-level threads. They provide services to other user-level threads, such as creating new threads, managing system resources, and handling exceptions. The advantage of UKThreads is that the operating system takes care of interrupt handling, threading, and synchronizing processes. However, the additional layer introduced by the kernel may impact performance. 

 - Multiple Processors with Shared Memory (MPSM): MPSM assumes that every processor in the system has direct access to a shared memory area. This means that data and instructions can be efficiently shared between processors, improving cache locality and reducing communication costs. A scheduler is responsible for allocating threads to processors based on priority or load. An example of MPSMs is Symmetric Shared Memory (SSM), where a large amount of RAM is partitioned between multiple CPUs.

 - Asymmetric Shared Memory (ASM): In ASM, each processor has its own private memory region, making them isolated from each other. Communication between processors must go through a message passing interface, which introduces latency and reduces throughput compared to MPSM. Examples of ASMs include NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) and Grid computing, where many computers are linked together to form a cluster.

 - Hybrid Models: Hybrid models combine several execution models above to achieve higher levels of parallelism and performance. For example, HTCondor is a hybrid model combining MPMD and SSM models to distribute jobs efficiently across clusters of nodes. Pthreads library is widely used to implement multithreaded applications in Linux environments.

Based on the type and size of the application, the choice of execution model determines whether the use of threads is suitable or optimal. Although there are many variations and tradeoffs associated with each model, choosing the correct model depends on factors such as application complexity, system resources availability, expected workload, and deadline constraints. 

One thing worth mentioning here is that Java does not impose any restrictions on the choice of execution model. Developers can freely choose the best execution model for their particular problem, taking into account the specific characteristics of the underlying system, scale, and performance requirements. Similarly, JVM implementations vary in the manner in which they implement thread scheduling and dispatch, enabling them to optimize performance according to the chosen model.

## 2.3 Synchronization

Synchronization is a mechanism to control access to shared resources by multiple threads. Different synchronization primitives are provided in Java, ranging from simple locks, semaphores, monitors, and others. Locks and Monitors are fundamental synchronization constructs in Java and offer different advantages, such as fairness, priority inheritance, and reentrancy. Below is a brief overview of synchronization primitives:

 - Locks: A lock is essentially a binary semaphore with two states, locked and unlocked. When a thread wants to acquire a lock, it enters a critical section. At this point, the lock owner releases the lock and hands off control to other threads. To release the lock, the owning thread must hold it exclusively, i.e., until it explicitly releases it. Otherwise, other threads cannot enter the critical section. Unfair locks occur when threads may starve if acquired in non-sequential order, resulting in poor performance in some situations.

 - Semaphores: A semaphore maintains a count value and operates on two operations, signal and wait. When a thread signals a semaphore, it increments its count and releases waiting threads if necessary. When a thread waits on a semaphore, it decrements its count and blocks if the count is zero. This ensures that only a fixed number of threads can proceed concurrently, preventing excessive contention and starvation.

 - Monitors: A monitor is a special object that allows multiple threads to synchronize their actions. Any method or block inside a synchronized block can be thought of as protected by the monitor. Before entering the block, the thread enters the monitor, claiming ownership of the object. When the thread leaves the block, it releases the monitor. Other threads trying to enter the synchronized block must wait in line, until the owner of the monitor releases it. Monitors allow for exclusive access to shared resources, ensuring that only one thread acts upon the object at any given moment. Monitors can be fair or non-fair, meaning that the thread holding the monitor always proceeds before others. In case of contention, non-fair monitors ensure that the highest priority threads make progress. Additionally, monitors can provide mutual exclusion, allowing multiple threads to operate safely on shared data structures. Finally, monitors allow for internal and external synchronization, allowing threads to wait for notification from other threads or to initiate interaction with external components.
 
 Based on the requirements of the application, the appropriate synchronization primitive(s) need to be selected. Most applications require some form of synchronization to avoid race conditions and guarantee consistency, particularly in multi-threaded environments. Many synchronization primitives can lead to deadlocks, livelocks, and performance bottlenecks, so careful selection of primitives is crucial to achieving good performance. 

## 2.4 Deadlocks, Livelocks, and Context Switching

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked forever, unable to proceed due to circular dependency between resources requested by each other. Livelocks happen when two or more threads continuously change the status of a variable without any meaningful change in the actual computation performed. Contention occurs when multiple threads try to access shared resources in an uncontrolled way, leading to increased access times and reduced efficiency. Context switching is the act of switching from one thread to another and requires expensive inter-process communication, which leads to slowdown and delays. To avoid these issues, proper synchronization techniques need to be implemented. Below is a brief overview of relevant concepts:

  - Deadlocks: Deadlocks typically occur when two or more processes are blocked, waiting for each other to release resources. One possible scenario is shown below:

    1. Process P1 holds lock L1
    2. Process P2 tries to acquire lock L2 but is blocked by P1
    3. Process P1 tries to acquire lock L2 but is blocked by P2
    4. Deadlock!

    In this situation, neither process can proceed further because none of them free up the lock held by the other process. A solution to detect and resolve deadlocks is known as cycle detection algorithm.

  - Livelocks: A livelock happens when a thread keeps changing its status without actually performing any useful computation. This results in continual switches between idle and active states, which adds unnecessary overhead and wastes computational power. A solution to identify and mitigate livelocks includes monitoring and adjusting parameters such as threshold values, timers, and backoff policies.

  - Contention: Contention occurs when multiple threads try to access shared resources in an uncontrolled way, leading to increased access times and reduced efficiency. Common sources of contention include:

   * Mutual Exclusion (Mutex): Mutexes are synchronization primitives that protect a shared resource from being accessed simultaneously by multiple threads. In Java, a synchronized statement is a shorthand for acquiring a mutex lock before entering the block and releasing the lock after leaving the block. Without proper synchronization, a thread that fails to obtain the lock may enter the block repeatedly, leading to contention.
   
   * Locks: Locks are similar toMUTEXES, but have additional properties such as timeouts and conditions. When a thread wants to access a locked resource, it can either succeed or fail immediately, without blocking. If it fails, it can retry later or give up altogether. Timeouts ensure that threads that appear stuck don't block indefinitely. Conditions provide a convenient abstraction for coordinating interactions among threads.
   
   * Wait/Notify: Wait/notify mechanism provides a lightweight alternative to explicit synchronization by allowing threads to wait for a certain condition to become true before resuming execution. Threads can either block indefinitely or be interrupted by a timeout. Wait/notify is commonly used in event-driven applications, where threads need to coordinate activities in a non-preemptive fashion.
   
   * Barrier synchronization: Barrier synchronization relies on a central entity called a barrier to enforce ordering among multiple threads. Once all threads reach the barrier, they proceed together, enforcing mutual exclusion. Barrier synchronization can significantly reduce contention in applications that rely heavily on locks, especially those involving recursive locking.
  
  - Context switching: Context switching is the act of switching from one thread to another and requires expensive inter-process communication, which leads to slowdown and delays. To minimize context switching, modern operating systems use various techniques, such as thread affinity, migration, and caching. Additionally, developer tools such as profiling and tracing can help identify hotspots and potential causes of context switching.
