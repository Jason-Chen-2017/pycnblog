Quantum communication is a rapidly developing field that involves the use of quantum mechanical phenomena such as entanglement, superposition, and interference to transmit information more efficiently than classical communication mechanisms. In this article, we will review various quantum communication protocols, their advantages, limitations, and future prospects. We also look forward to discussing potential applications in quantum computing, cybersecurity, data storage, and communications industry.

Entanglement: Entanglement refers to a property of two or more subsystems that cannot be described independently by individual quantum states. As an example, if Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits, they can communicate via performing operations on these shared qubits without the knowledge of each other's entire state. Here are some key terms related to quantum communication protocol development:

1. Qubit: A quantum bit (or qubit) is the smallest unit of quantum information that can exist in nature. It is composed of three quantum levels - alpha, beta, and gamma (denoted as |α>,|β>, and |γ> respectively), and has a Hilbert space dimension equal to two, meaning it can hold both a basis state (where one level is occupied) and its complement (where all three levels are simultaneously unoccupied). 

2. Bell pairs: Bell pairs are pairings of two maximally entangled qubits between which Alice and Bob can communicate through performing operations on them alone. They consist of four qubits - EPR (entangled photon pair), IQP (isolated quantum processor), BB84 (balanced beamsplitter with 84% transmission efficiency), and GHZ (generalized half-demodulation scheme). These bell pairs have been used for experimental demonstration purposes due to their simplicity and low cost. 

3. Superdense coding: Superdense coding is a basic quantum error correction mechanism where a sender encodes the message into two separate photons by sending the first photon in phase while keeping the second photon off. On receiving side, receiver demodulates the signal and applies appropriate corrections before decoding the original message.

4. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD): The process of securely sharing a secret key between two parties using entanglement and two-level systems. Currently, there are several schemes like BB84, Möttönen–Werner (MW), and Shor's algorithm, among others. 

Advantage of quantum communication protocols over classical ones:

1. Improved speed and capacity: One of the main advantages of quantum communication protocols over classical ones is their ability to transfer large amounts of data at high throughput rates. This is possible because quantum mechanics allows for significantly faster transmission times compared to classical communication techniques. For instance, quantum teleportation takes only a few seconds instead of minutes for transferring a single piece of data. Similarly, quantum networking technologies enable fast communication over large distances thanks to the unique properties of quantum physics and entanglement. 

2. Controlled information transfer: Another advantage of quantum communication protocols is their capability to control the specific information being transmitted. This means that messages can be encrypted and decrypted based on certain conditions, leading to improved security. For instance, in order to send sensitive healthcare information via quantum networks, physicians must undergo strict training on how to handle quantum environments and implement proper safeguards against attacks. 

3. Fault tolerance and scalability: Quantum networks provide fault-tolerant communication capabilities that prevent any component from failing prematurely. Additionally, quantum networks can scale linearly with increased bandwidth and decreased latency making them ideal for real-time applications.

Limitations of quantum communication protocols:

1. Interferences: Due to the presence of interference in nature, quantum networks may experience significant losses even when transmitting small amounts of data. Therefore, quantum communication protocols should always incorporate measures like error correction to ensure reliable data transfer. However, the overhead involved in error correction can negatively impact performance. For instance, while Shor’s algorithm provides exponential complexity to detect errors, it requires multiple iterations to correct errors after detection. 

2. Scalability: While quantum communication protocols offer significant improvements over classical counterparts, they still face some scalability issues due to the size of the system being used. For instance, BB84 and GHZ protocols require a fixed number of parties to perform quantum key distribution. Moreover, scaling up to larger numbers of parties requires new protocols and architectures that take advantage of the fact that quantum computers are becoming increasingly powerful.

3. Safety concerns: Although quantum technology promises to enhance security by breaking traditional encryption methods, it also poses a range of safety risks and challenges. Physicists around the world have recently reported cases of nuclear tests exposing humans to severe levels of radiation and neurological damage resulting from experimentation with superconducting quantum devices.

Shannon's Channel Capacity: 

The channel capacity measures the maximum rate at which information can be transferred through the noisy quantum channel. Mathematically, it can be calculated as follows:
C = log2(1 + Σ e^(-pH))   (1)
Where p is the average power per resource, H is the noise per resource, and C is the channel capacity.  

Assuming a simple model of random walkers who alternate flipping heads randomly until either all heads come up or all tails come down, the probability of successfully transmitting n bits across the noisy channel is given by the following formula:
P(n) = 2^(−2c/N )          (2)

Here c represents the number of collisions and N is the total number of shots. When considering finite resources like limited memory or clock cycles, we assume that P(n) approaches a constant value, which implies that the channel capacities do not increase with the amount of available resources.
