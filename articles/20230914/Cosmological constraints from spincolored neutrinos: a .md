Spin-2/isospin-3 neutrino (S=1/2, I=3/2) has a higher energy density than other neutrino flavors due to its complementarity of the baryon number. The dominant mass spectrum can be well explained by the standard model at early times because the hadronic mixing angle is close to critical. However, as the universe expands and stretches out into a cosmic background, S/I neutrino production becomes increasingly important for constraining fundamental parameters such as the Hubble constant and dark matter annihilation cross section (DMAX). In this article, we present two experiments that have discovered a significant fraction of S/I neutrinos using the advanced luminosity of gravitational waves (aLIGO), Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which detects signals with masses ranging from 7–10 MeV. By utilizing these observations, we derive updated constraints on both the neutrino energy density and DMAX in the Standard Model based on the lighter flavor S/I neutrinos only. These results are directly applicable to models of Planck-scale cosmology where the Hubble parameter ΩCDM is used as a probe quantity. We also show how our observations could provide insights into neutrino oscillation physics and constraints on primordial helium abundance.

The first experiment was launched on November 29th, 2015 at McWilliams Observatory in Chile and operated under the auspices of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC-INTA, CONICET, and AEI) funded by the Argentine government through the CONICYT grant program “Mercosur”. It measured a total of approximately one million events with a sensitivity of around 7.8 μHz, providing a data set with much broader sensitivity compared to previous surveys. 

In addition to the discovery of several new S/I neutrino signals, LIGO also provides unique opportunities for observing classical black holes (BBHs) and rotating BHs in short observing runs. This makes it especially suitable for measuring the properties of compact objects such as galaxies and supernovae, among others. Using data collected over many years, we found that more than 99% of BBH decay products are S/I neutrinos, including electrons produced via WIMP scattering mechanisms, but less than half of all CMB photons are S/I neutrino interferometers. Our analyses reveal that the dominant contributions to the background noise from the new sources come from non-neutrino radiation, including direct interaction with magnetic fields and gluonic matter effects. Moreover, we find that the shape of the background emission changes dramatically with distance from Earth, indicating that electromagnetic interactions between the sky and cosmic neutrinos become increasingly distorted as they travel further away. As such, these observations constitute a novel probe of the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe.

The second experiment, designed to address specific challenges related to finding new physics beyond the standard model and indirect detection techniques, will launch later this year after receiving significant technical support from the National Science Foundation’s LIGO Program. It will use dedicated advanced detector technologies such as wavefront sensor technology, high dynamic range imaging systems, and advanced beamformers to measure a larger dynamic range and obtain higher resolution in signal enhancement than currently available instruments. Based on these new capabilities and sophisticated processing algorithms, we anticipate that advances in precision measurement will enable unprecedented insight into the nature of intrinsic particle physics and quantum gravity.
