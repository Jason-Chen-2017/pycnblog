Conversational agents are increasingly becoming a popular form of AI-powered chatbots that provide virtual assistants or intermediaries between users and services in various fields such as customer service, e-commerce, travel booking, etc. However, it is critical for conversational agents to be accurate and reliable because they can have a significant impact on user experience, business operations, and revenue generation. Inaccurate bots can cause frustration, errors, misunderstandings, which can adversely affect user satisfaction and loyalty. It is essential to understand why bots might not achieve their full potential and explore potential solutions to make them more effective. 

In this blog post, we will discuss some common reasons behind the low accuracy of conversational agents and propose several potential solutions to address these issues. We will start by reviewing the basics of NLP (natural language processing) and its importance in building conversational agents. Then, we will move on to discussing how natural language understanding and reasoning techniques play an important role in making conversational agents more intelligent. Finally, we will discuss the limitations of current machine learning algorithms used in building conversational agents and identify ways to overcome those challenges.


# 2. Basic Concepts & Terminology
## Natural Language Processing(NLP)
Natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) research that focuses on enabling machines to understand human languages. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to derive insights from large amounts of unstructured text data, allowing them to perform tasks like automatic summarization, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, entity recognition, document classification, speech recognition, and so on. 

The primary components of natural language processing include: 

1. Lexicon: A lexicon is a set of words with their corresponding meanings and attributes. Word sense disambiguation is also handled using lexicons. 

2. Syntax and morphology: Syntax rules define the relationships among words in sentences, while morphology refers to the way individual words combine into phrases, clauses, and even larger units called syntactic trees. 

3. Sentiment Analysis: This involves analyzing the emotions expressed in texts and predicting whether the overall tone is positive, negative, or neutral. 

4. Part-of-speech tagging: This task assigns part-of-speech tags to each word in a sentence based on its function within the sentence. For example, nouns describe people, verbs describe actions, adjectives modify nouns, and adverbs modify other parts of the sentence. 

5. Named Entity Recognition: This task identifies named entities, such as organizations, persons, locations, dates, times, and quantities, in text documents. 

6. Dependency Parsing: This task maps out the dependencies between tokens in a sentence, indicating the relationship between different parts of a sentence. 

7. Machine Translation: This technique enables computer programs to translate text from one language to another. 

8. Text Generation: Text generation models learn to generate new text based on prior input. These models can produce novel output given a specific prompt or context. 

9. Summarization: Summarization involves condensing long articles or videos down to shorter versions that capture key ideas. 

10. Dialogue Management: Dialogue management systems handle interactions between multiple agents who may use different spoken languages and communicate through conversational interfaces. 

11. Information Retrieval: This task involves searching databases or web pages for relevant information based on keywords entered by the user. 

## Representations and Embeddings
A representation is a way to encode structured or unstructured data in a numeric format that can be understood by the neural network algorithm. One of the most commonly used representations in natural language processing is the bag-of-words model. This model represents a sequence of words as a vector of integers where each integer corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary. The value at each index in the vector represents the frequency of occurrence of the word at that position in the sequence.

However, this simple approach has several drawbacks when dealing with natural language. First, the order of words matters and thus the directionality of the words in a sentence must be considered. Second, many words have multiple meanings and contexts and therefore need to be represented differently depending on the context. Third, there can be redundancy and irrelevant information present in the data that needs to be removed before proceeding further. To tackle these problems, we can use embeddings instead of representing each word as a single number. An embedding is a dense vector of real numbers that represent a concept or word in a high dimensional space. Each dimension of the vector corresponds to a particular feature or aspect of the word being embedded.

Embeddings come in two flavors: continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW) and skip-gram. CBOW is typically used for language modeling where the aim is to predict the probability distribution of the next word in a sequence given the previous words. Skip-gram is typically used for language inference where the aim is to determine the probability distribution of the target word given the surrounding words. Both approaches use neural networks to train the weights of the embedding layer that map inputs to outputs in the high-dimensional space.

To compute similarity between vectors, we can use cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors while Euclidean distance measures the magnitude of the difference between two points. When comparing two similar concepts or words, the dot product between their respective embeddings gives a higher score compared to their Euclidean distances.
