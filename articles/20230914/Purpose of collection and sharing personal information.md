Collection and sharing personal information are essential to human activities such as online shopping, social media interaction, e-commerce transactions, research, educational institutions, marketing, advertising and many more. In the age of Big Data and cloud computing, it has become increasingly important for organizations to collect, store, use, manage, and share personal information effectively. This article provides a technical perspective on the purpose of collecting and sharing personal information, the basic concepts behind data privacy laws, regulations, and standards in different countries, the algorithms used by modern technologies for data anonymization, obfuscation, and pseudonymisation, as well as practical examples from real-world applications. Finally, we explore the future potential impact and challenges associated with this critical task of protecting sensitive personal information from unauthorized access, processing, or misuse.
Introduction
The current era of Big Data and cloud computing requires companies to continuously monitor, analyze, and understand their customers' behavior, preferences, and needs. Personal information plays a vital role in these processes, which is often collected through various sources such as customer feedback surveys, website logs, mobile app usage data, social media posts, emails, call records, financial transaction histories, etc. Collected data is then analyzed using advanced analytics tools to extract insights that can help improve business operations, revenue streams, and marketplace opportunities. However, the responsibility of maintaining personal information security lies squarely with the user who has made the decision to disclose it. Therefore, proper protection measures must be implemented to safeguard users’ personal information from being stolen, misused, or compromised by third parties. To achieve effective personal information management, organizations need to clearly define what constitutes “personal” information, establish appropriate procedures and protocols to gather, store, process, secure, and disseminate it, and ensure compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Personal Information Management (PIM) refers to the processes involved in managing individuals' personal information, including the capture, storage, processing, securing, sharing, and communication of personal information between entities within or outside an organization. The core objective of PIM is to prevent unauthorized access, improper handling, and abuse of personal information, while ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, availability, and reliability. It involves several key components, including understanding the nature, value, and purpose of personal information; designing policies, procedures, and guidelines for collecting, storing, and processing personal information; implementing mechanisms to identify and remove identifying information; setting up secure environments to handle and protect personal information; monitoring the activity and risk factors related to personal information, and taking necessary actions to address any concerns raised. Once established, proper governance, education, awareness, training, and oversight will ultimately enable organizations to provide enhanced levels of personal information protection, ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory requirements. Overall, the rightful ownership of personal information cannot be overlooked when it comes to protecting consumers' rights and interests and driving innovation in businesses.

Personal Information: Any piece of information that relates directly or indirectly to an identifiable individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be assumed without additional context or knowledge. Examples include name, date of birth, email address, phone number, IP address, account numbers, passwords, health information, credit card details, driver's license information, physical addresses, bank account information, geographic location, employment history, criminal record, medical history, biometric information, and genetic information. A person can choose to provide some or all of this information voluntarily during registration or profile creation, or automatically via tracking devices installed on their device(s). This information can also be derived from other types of non-personal information, such as demographics, behaviors, interactions, and purchasing history, but is not considered personal unless linked or associated with an identifiable individual. 

Privacy Laws and Regulations: Law and regulation covering privacy issues, including those related to the collection, storage, processing, sharing, transfer, and deletion of personal information. Privacy laws vary significantly across jurisdictions due to differences in cultural norms, historical precedents, and technological developments. These laws typically specify how personal information should be collected, stored, processed, shared, transferred, and deleted, and may have implications for both individuals and organisations. Regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and Omnibus Public Telecommunications Act (OPTA) set out specific provisions for organizations to consider when handling personal information.

Data Anonymization and Obfuscation: Methods to transform sensitive data into irreversible form, making it difficult or impossible to accurately identify an individual based solely on the transformed data. Techniques such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness, and differential privacy aim to preserve enough identifying information to allow for accurate analysis of similar data sets, yet destroy or reduce significance where needed. Similar techniques exist for combining multiple datasets together to create aggregated views, improving overall accuracy.

Pseudonymisation: Methods to convert identifying data into meaningless identifiers, thus preserving the utility of the original dataset while removing any association between the anonymous data and the corresponding identities. For example, instead of disclosing a person's actual phone number, pseudonyms could be assigned, such as "User 1," "Person 2," or even just "ABC." Other methods such as hashing and encryption also apply pseudonymisation, but they are generally less visible to humans and tend to result in increased computational costs.

Biometrics: Technology enabling identification of people using unique physical characteristics, such as facial recognition and fingerprint scanning. Biometric data can be combined with other forms of personal information to enhance data accuracy and leverage innovative analytics.

Anonymization: Process of converting personal information into generic placeholders, thereby reducing its intrinsic value and making it difficult or impossible to identify an individual with certainty based on the anonymized data alone. Similarities between data points may still be detectable by certain statistical methods, although random patterns can make it difficult to determine whether two separate samples came from the same population or were simply randomly sampled.
