Ontology-based data integration (OBDI) is the process of linking two or more datasets by considering their common and shared attributes defined in a formal ontology. In this article, we will discuss the working principles and implementation details of OBDI for building up an integrated dataset using linked open data from multiple sources.

Ontologies are abstract descriptions that provide semantic meaning to entities and concepts across disciplines such as biology, medicine, geography, economics, engineering, etc., and enable machines to understand, reason with, and manipulate these concepts in ways that humans cannot do easily. The use of ontologies has transformed the way we communicate and share knowledge.

Linked open data (LOD) is a type of open data that refers to data published on the web and identified by unique IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers). It provides machine-readable access to information across different systems and organizations, enabling users to query and integrate relevant information without having to know the underlying system structures or formats.

To combine the power of LOD with the expressiveness and ease of use offered by ontologies, researchers have proposed combining them into a new concept called “ontology-based data integration”. This approach allows us to identify meaningful connections between data sets based on relationships and links determined through analysis of domain-specific ontologies, which capture common patterns and abstractions used in real-world scenarios. By creating a common language that represents our world, linked open data can be combined with complex relationships and inferences provided by ontologies to create richer, more comprehensive and accurate datasets than ever before. 

In addition to technical challenges related to combining LOD and ontologies, there are also ethical issues involved in leveraging large amounts of unstructured data. Ethical decisions must be made on how much information needs to be extracted, whether it should be stored locally or in the cloud, and under what conditions third parties can access the resulting data. With the right approach, the potential benefits of LOD and ontology-based data integration can lead to significant societal benefits.

The traditional method of integrating data consists of manually merging, aligning, and cleaning data sets. However, this process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and often relies on expertise in each individual data set's format and structure. Moreover, manual approaches may result in loss of valuable contextual information and knowledge gained over time.

Therefore, many researchers and practitioners have started looking at automated methods for data integration. One popular approach involves matching records across different data sets based on similarities among their attributes, i.e., entity resolution. Other techniques involve identifying overlaps and differences between two datasets, and then combining the results into a single unified data source. Nevertheless, both techniques still require human intervention for handling ambiguities and conflicts.

One alternative to these approaches is to exploit ontologies, which offer a common language for describing and modeling real-world phenomena. Such languages allow us to link similar entities across different data sets, thus leading to better data integration. Furthermore, ontologies encode human knowledge about the domains they apply to, making them useful for understanding the nature of the data and establishing reasonable expectations for data quality.

## 3.1 概念
Ontology-based data integration is a technique that leverages the expressive power of ontologies to match and merge data from multiple sources based on their relationship established through their respective ontologies. Here, we assume that there are n data sources S = {S1,..., Sn}, where Si denotes a named graph Gi consisting of a set of triples Tgi ∈ Ti, representing the entities and their properties in the i-th data source. We further define two sets of ontologies Oi = ONOi and Ok = ONOk, corresponding to the ontologies used in Si and Sk respectively.

We aim to build an integrated dataset G that combines all graphs of the data sources while maintaining consistency with respect to any constraints imposed by the union of the constraints associated with its constituent graphs. Specifically, we need to satisfy three key requirements:

1. Consistency: All data sources in G should maintain consistency with respect to their original data models and schemas. For example, if we want to merge two address fields together based on the standardization rules specified in their respective ontologies, it is essential that those rules are consistent with one another. Otherwise, the merged field may violate the schema constraint and cause errors during processing downstream. 

2. Completeness: G should contain every possible entity mentioned in the input data, even if no triples containing that entity exist in some data sources. For instance, if we want to merge patient demographics from various data sources, including medical records, prescription records, and insurance claims, but none of these sources contains detailed information about patients’ social security numbers, we would like to include such patients' information in our final dataset.  

3. Redundancy: If an entity appears in multiple data sources, it should only appear once in G, otherwise redundant information may arise. Similarly, if an attribute value occurs multiple times within a given triple, it should also occur only once after merging. 

Based on these requirements, we propose the following algorithm:

1. Preprocessing: First, we preprocess each graph Gi using some preprocessing steps depending on the nature of the data, e.g., mapping identifiers to consistent labels using controlled vocabularies or converting date strings to numerical values. After that, we obtain Tpgi, the preprocessed version of Tgi obtained using Gi and Oi.

2. Entity Resolution: To ensure consistency between data sources, we first perform entity resolution on each graph Tpgi. This step maps entities to canonical representations, resolving variations in spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and synonyms according to their respective definitions in Oi. Next, we collect all distinct entities appearing in Tpgi and group them into clusters Ck = Cl1, Cl2,..., Cln, where Li denotes the set of tuples {Ti | ti ∈ Tpgi}. Each cluster Ci corresponds to a subset of entities that belong to the same subject in the i-th data source. Once we have collected all clusters, we check for violations of redundancy and completeness requirements. Finally, we assign each entity a unique identifier based on its position in the sequence of occurrences. Note that this step does not affect the overall shape or size of the clusters, so it can happen concurrently with clustering below.

3. Clustering: Now that all entities in Tpgi have been assigned unique IDs, we move on to grouping the tuples by subject and object labels. For each pair of labels l1, l2, we compute the similarity score s(l1, l2), which indicates the degree of compatibility between subjects and objects labeled with l1 and l2. Different scores can be used depending on the specific application area. For example, for biomedical applications, we might consider the Jaccard coefficient, whereas for shopping recommendations, we might consider cosine distance. Based on this score, we form edges between pairs of vertices whose label similarity exceeds a predefined threshold t. These edges represent candidate matches between subjects and objects found in different data sources.

   More precisely, let Vij denote the vertex corresponding to the j-th occurrence of the tuple Ti in the i-th data source. Let A be the set of all pairs of labels ((l1, l2) | Vij has labels l1 and Vi+j has labels l2). Then, we sort A in decreasing order of similarity score s(l1, l2), and connect adjacent vertices v1, v2 in V if their labels l1 and l2 satisfy the condition s(l1, l2) > γt, where γ is a parameter controlling the tradeoff between precision and recall. This ensures that only highly similar candidates are connected. Note that this step affects the shape and size of the clusters significantly, so it should be done after entity resolution above.

4. Matching and Merging: Finally, we select a small number of representative tuples from each cluster Ci and attempt to find a path P connecting them via their neighbors. If such a path exists, we add it to our final output G. Paths can be selected in several ways, e.g., by selecting the shortest path with the highest similarity score, or by performing random walks starting from a randomly chosen seed node along paths with high similarity scores. Once we have constructed all valid paths P, we merge the tuples along the path to construct a single record that incorporates all available information about the subject and object. As described earlier, we make sure that the resulting record satisfies any additional constraints imposed by the data model and schema constraints of the input data sources.
