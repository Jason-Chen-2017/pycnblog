# 1.简介
  

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively applied to multi-agent systems (MASs), but there are still many challenges in the field of MAS RL research and development, including algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, etc. This article compares five popular RL algorithms for multi-agent system tasks: A3C, PPO, QMIX, VDN, and GQMix. In this comparison analysis, we will discuss how these algorithms differ from each other, as well as their strengths and weaknesses in solving MAS tasks. 

# 2.Background Introduction 
Multi-agent systems (MASs) involve multiple agents acting cooperatively in a common environment and pursuing their individual goals towards a shared goal. One popular application area is robotics, where an autonomous vehicle or mobile manipulator with sensors can collaborate with different human operators in a shared workspace. In order to achieve a coordinated decision making process, the agents need to interact with each other continuously and communicate with each other over time. Despite the importance of multi-agent systems, it is not clear which specific algorithm would be optimal for achieving good performance under various situations. Therefore, developing effective and efficient algorithms that can work efficiently with large-scale multi-agent systems is essential for successful real-world applications.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most powerful techniques for training intelligent agents that can learn complex behaviors through trial-and-error interactions with environments. It provides a way for agent to map out its actions' consequences on the environment and optimize its policy based on the learned information. With this technique, several reinforcement learning algorithms have been developed for single-agent problems such as games like Atari or Go; however, they cannot directly apply them to the problem of multi-agent systems due to the complexity and high dimensionality of the action space. Hence, there exists a need for developing multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. 

In recent years, several multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms have been proposed, including A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic), PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), QMIX (Quadratic Mixture of Imbalanced Rewards), VDN (Value Decomposition Networks), and GQMix (Gated-Quantile Network for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning). Each algorithm solves a particular type of task by taking into account different aspects of the multi-agent interaction and communication processes. However, little attention has been paid to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of these algorithms with respect to each other. Based on our knowledge base and experience, we want to analyze these algorithms thoroughly and come up with a comprehensive overview of their respective advantages and limitations.

# 3.Terminology and Conceptual Background
Before diving into the technical details of each algorithm, let us first introduce some basic terminologies used in MAS RL literature. 

1. Action Space: The set of all possible actions available to an agent at any given time. For example, in the case of controlling a quadcopter in a shared workspace, the action space could include velocities of all four motors along with positions of its control surfaces.

2. Observation Space: The set of all possible observations received by an agent during its interaction with the environment. For example, in the case of observing the camera feed from a remote operator's perspective, the observation space could include color images, depth maps, and sensor readings like position, velocity, and attitude data.

3. Policy: The mapping function between the current state of the environment and the probabilities of selecting certain actions according to the agent’s preferences. For instance, if an agent wants to navigate a quadcopter from point A to point B, the policy might dictate the probability distribution over all possible motor speeds required for the agent to travel from A to B within a predefined time constraint.

4. Value Function: The measure of how valuable an agent perceives the future rewards it may obtain by acting in a given state. It predicts what the expected long-term reward would be after executing a given action in a given state. Value functions help agents make better decisions by estimating the value of future rewards rather than relying only on immediate rewards obtained upon completion of actions.

The following table summarizes the main concepts involved in MAS RL and relevant mathematical formulations. We refer the reader to Kapturowski et al. [KAPT] for more detailed explanations and proofs.

# 4.Comparison Analysis
In this section, we will briefly review each algorithm mentioned above and provide an overview of their key differences and similarities. Then, we will present the results of a thorough experimental evaluation of these algorithms in terms of robustness, stability, and convergence properties. 


## A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic)
### Overview
Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) was introduced by Mnih et al. [MNHL] in 2016 as a deep reinforcement learning method that combines actor-critic networks and asynchronous parallel processing techniques. It uses advantage estimates instead of raw returns to estimate the quality of action sequences produced by the agent, which makes it particularly suitable for tasks involving complex multistep interactions among multiple agents. To address the vanishing gradient problem associated with vanilla neural network models, A3C uses a recurrent model architecture known as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) units instead of traditional hidden layers, enabling the model to retain memory across episodes. 

A3C employs separate workers to collect samples asynchronously in parallel, reducing the correlation between updates and improving sample efficiency. These workers interact with the environment to produce rollouts and then push gradients back to the global critic network for parameter updating. By doing so, the centralized critic enables faster and more stable optimization than distributed synchronous methods such as PPO. 

The final output layer of the critic network computes the estimated return values for each state-action pair in the input trajectory. When training the actor network, A3C adjusts the agent’s policy parameters to maximize the predicted advantage for each visited state. 

### Differences from Other Algorithms
1. Workers: Instead of working synchronously, A3C splits the workload between multiple workers that pull samples from the replay buffer concurrently and train the local actors and critic networks. As a result, it allows the model to leverage parallelization and significantly reduce the computation time. 

2. Shared Global Critic: A3C shares a global critic network among all worker actors. Although this approach introduces additional variance in predictions, it reduces the amount of redundant calculations and improves overall convergence. Additionally, since the critic is trained using experience sampled from all workers, it ensures that the critic converges to the best possible estimates regardless of the number of workers used. 

3. No Partial Trajectories: Since all trajectories must end at terminal states or reach a maximum length, A3C discards incomplete trajectories and does not perform any bootstrapping beyond the last observed state. This simplifies the implementation and avoids potential biases caused by partial returns.

4. Data Sharing: Because all workers share the same replay buffer, they experience the same dataset and synchronize their exploration rate during training. This facilitates better exploration and generally improves the stability of the algorithm. 

### Robustness and Stability Properties
1. Convergence: A3C guarantees convergence to the optimal solution under typical conditions, especially when combined with appropriate hyperparameters and architectural choices. However, convergence depends heavily on the choice of exploration strategy and batch size. In general, increasing the entropy term τ encourages exploration and should improve the performance of A3C for higher dimensions and longer episode lengths. 

2. Residual Hysteresis: A3C often oscillates around the optimal solution during training. This is because the loss function used by the critic to evaluate the quality of action sequences produces noisy estimates and requires regularization via curiosity-driven exploration. While curiosity affects the exploration phase of the training, it also increases the variance of the policy gradients and contributes to the oscillations. Curious-learn [CURL] and intrinsic motivation [INTRINSIC] can alleviate these effects and promote improved stability.

### Limitations
However, A3C faces significant limitations when dealing with highly stochastic environments, sparse rewards, or multi-modal action distributions. First, the exploration noise produced by the actor during training can be detrimental to the policy optimization process, leading to suboptimal solutions. Second, even though A3C improves the exploration capabilities compared to conventional methods like random search, it still suffers from slow convergence rates and occasionally fails to find meaningful policies. Third, A3C assumes a shared global critic, which limits its ability to capture dynamics that vary across individuals. Finally, although A3C works well for relatively simple tasks and multi-agent settings, it struggles with more complex scenarios and compositional representations of events.

## PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
### Overview
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) was introduced by Schulman et al. [SCHW] in 2017 as a family of off-policy actor-critic algorithms that uses trust region policy optimization to avoid the drawbacks of standard policy gradient methods. The core idea behind PPO is to approximate the optimal policy locally using a surrogate objective function and then iteratively refine the policy globally until convergence. Its key feature is that it uses the clipped likelihood ratio trick to prevent premature convergence to suboptimal policies and ensure consistent improvement throughout training. 

Similar to A3C, PPO splits the workload between multiple workers that contribute to the global policy using synchronous sampling. Unlike A3C, PPO maintains separate actor and critic networks and trains them simultaneously using a cross-entropy loss to encourage better trade-offs between policy improvement and value estimation errors. The optimizer uses proximal gradient descent to solve the optimization problem and enforces constraints to avoid oscillations and unwanted correlations. PPO uses adaptive clipping thresholds to prevent the new policy from moving too far away from the old policy during update, ensuring consistent improvement throughout training. 

### Differences from Other Algorithms
1. Surrogate Objective: PPO approximates the optimal policy using a surrogate objective function whose target is closely related to the true objective function. In contrast to A3C’s advantage estimator, PPO uses the TRPO algorithm to compute the KL divergence between the old and new policies. This penalizes changes in the policy without explicitly computing the relative entropy of the change. 

2. Adaptive Clipping: PPO controls the change in policy parameters using a momentum term and adaptive clipping thresholds that adapt to the uncertainty in the objective function. The deterministic nature of the policy leads to strong exploitation whenever possible and uses adaptive clipping to enforce smoothness and maintain exploration during training. 

3. Separate Networks: PPO separates the actor and critic networks to enable direct training of both components separately. This further reduces the correlation between updates and improves the overall stability and performance of the algorithm. 

4. On-Policy vs Off-Policy: PPO uses a combination of on-policy and off-policy data to guide policy updates, allowing for greater flexibility and resilience to instabilities arising from off-policy sampling. In practice, this means that PPO can combine on-policy and off-policy data with low overhead and minimal interference with the training procedure. 

### Robustness and Stability Properties
1. Generalization: PPO relies solely on the surrogate objective function to define the policy, which allows it to achieve excellent generalization performance. However, this comes at the cost of reduced sample efficiency and potential instability due to the implicit dependence on the initial condition. Thus, PPO should only be considered for advanced research and transfer learning settings. 

2. Correlation: PPO trades off bias for variance and benefits greatly from careful initialization of the policy weights and exploration strategies. However, it can become susceptible to issues such as correlated samples and suboptimal policies when handling non-i.i.d. datasets. Moreover, the default learning rate schedule can lead to instable optimization during early stages of training, requiring manual tuning to guarantee convergence.  

### Limitations
Although PPO offers several advantages over A3C, it also poses some unique challenges. First, despite its promises, PPO remains challenging to scale to larger and more complex problems due to its dependence on trust regions and mini-batch updates. Second, PPO requires specialized libraries and hardware architectures for effective parallelization, which can limit its practical deployment in production systems. Finally, PPO requires careful initialization and tweaking of hyperparameters to achieve desirable performance levels, which can be tricky and time-consuming. Overall, PPO is an interesting alternative that can potentially enhance the scalability of RL algorithms, but it remains challenging to deploy in real-world scenarios.
