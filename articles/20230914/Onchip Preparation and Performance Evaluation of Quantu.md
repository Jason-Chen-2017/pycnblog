# 2. Background & Concepts
## 2.1 Quantum Memory Intro
In recent years, quantum computers have seen a tremendous surge in popularity due to their ability to simulate complex systems much faster than any traditional supercomputers. One interesting application domain of quantum computers is quantum memory, i.e., quantum computers capable of storing quantum states persistently without loss. Before discussing the specific architecture and characteristics of quantum memory, let's first understand the basics of quantum mechanics and the quantum computational model.

### 2.1.1 Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics is a mathematical theory that describes nature at the atomistic level, i.e., small and weak interactions between individual particles. It offers a rigorous description of nature through the concept of a wave function (also called a ket), which represents the probability amplitude of finding one particle in a particular state. Mathematically speaking, a quantum system consists of many qubits (quantum bits) or more generally quantum numbers (qubits). A qubit has two possible values, either |0⟩ or |1⟩, corresponding to two different basis vectors. Any operation performed on a single qubit produces a linear combination of these basis vectors, known as a quantum state vector, representing all the possibilities of the system’s behavior. Together, multiple qubits form a quantum register, and the overall state is represented by the tensor product of the constituent subspaces, known as a density matrix, giving rise to many interesting physical phenomena. 

A quantum computer uses quantum logic gates, which act on a quantum register to transform its initial state into a desired output state. As opposed to classical digital circuits, quantum logic gates operate on entire registers rather than just individual wires or transistors. Therefore, they allow quantum computers to manipulate and store quantum states efficiently. 
### 2.1.2 Quantum Computational Model
The quantum computational model is a probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. It assumes that there exists a universal set of abstract rules that define how quantum systems behave, regardless of their starting conditions. The quantum computational model allows us to encode arbitrary computations onto logical circuits constructed out of quantum gates. The circuit itself cannot physically implement the computation directly; instead, it acts as a recipe for generating quantum processes and noise that produce the expected outcome. Based on this model, the task of a quantum computer involves encoding a problem into a quantum circuit and optimizing its execution so that it minimizes the effects of noise and errors.

In practice, modern quantum computers use a hybrid algorithm consisting of classical and quantum processors working together to solve problems. Classical processors perform tasks like data preprocessing, error correction, optimization and search, whereas quantum processors run quantum algorithms. By combining these two types of hardware, quantum computers can solve increasingly complex problems using less power and resources than traditional computers.
## 2.2 Conventional vs Quantum Memories
Conventional memories are analog memories used in digital computers to hold binary data. They consist of cells arranged in rows and columns, and can be programmed to retain patterns or data for later retrieval. There are several types of conventional memories such as DRAMs, SRAMs, etc. Each cell typically contains some amount of charge (electricity/magnetic fields) which can be read or written only once. When you want to store new data, existing data must be overwritten, resulting in random access delays and reduced write bandwidth.

Conversely, quantum memories differ from conventional ones in several ways. First, they do not rely on electrical signals to store and retrieve data. Second, their storage mechanisms are fundamentally different. Instead of relying on transistors or semiconductors, quantum memories use quantum dots, interconnected electron spins, and bosons to create entangled quantum states. Entanglement means that a quantum state is formed when two or more quantum objects interact in such a way that they cannot be separated again without disturbing the original objects. Quantum memories can maintain quantum states without disrupting previous data stored in the device, making them ideal for applications such as quantum simulations, cryptography, and machine learning.

One key advantage of quantum memories over conventional ones lies in their increased speed and scalability. Since quantum states can be prepared quickly and accessed in parallel, they enable high-performance computing applications that require fast, low-latency access to massive amounts of data. Furthermore, quantum memories offer unique benefits in terms of fault tolerance, privacy, and security since they can remain available even if individual components fail or degrade. However, deploying quantum memories requires careful planning and attention to detail, as it involves trade-offs between performance, power usage, cost, and complexity.
