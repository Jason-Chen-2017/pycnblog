## 2.1 什么是金钱？
“Money” is defined as any form of value, including physical goods such as gold, silver, and copper, and financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, securities, and currency. In simple terms, money refers to the amount of wealth or material goods owned by someone who makes regular expenditures for them. Therefore, the study of money aims to understand the factors that influence its price and transactions, and eventually lead to decision-making processes that maximize personal profitability and minimize losses. According to World Bank statistical data, in 2017, global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was valued at $1.9trn., accounting for approximately 28% of worldwide GDP. To put things into perspective, one person today has an approximate $12trillion net worth in the United States alone, far higher than the combined wealth of every single person alive on Earth.

However, as mentioned earlier, money is not always in our pockets or purses. We spend a lot of money online and yet often find ourselves feeling that it's too late for some purchases or even just thinking about those investments we have made. Some individuals might be tempted to linger on outdated debts or poor investments that don't bring much value anymore. This can ultimately result in a negative impact on their financial wellbeing and create chaos within their lives. As a result, effective financial management becomes critical for anyone who wants to avoid falling victim to misfortune.

## 2.2 为什么会出现“欲望购物”现象？
To fully understand why we tend to get addicted to shopping online, let's consider the following example: A person visits a store online and searches for clothing items that he/she likes. Their search ends up yielding multiple options, including expensive designer brands that are not particularly appealing to him/her. After trying different shops and subcategories, the person finds something interesting and decides to purchase it. However, upon closer inspection, the item seems to lack quality and isn't exactly what he/she had hoped for. Instead, she feels guilty for wasting time, effort, and money by buying inferior products. She then spends hours looking for alternative items until her frustration leads her to seek support from friends, family, or counselor. Eventually, she realizes that the stigma attached to these services could be contributing to her overall distress level. Overall, the desire to shop online has led to significant health risks, leading to a larger portion of the population to experience unhealthy behaviors and stigmatization.

This phenomenon - known as "the thirst for shopping" - has been observed across numerous cultures, ranging from Asia to Europe, and is commonly associated with both low-income countries where access to high-quality products is limited and regions with highly developed markets and technological advancement. Despite the potential harmful effects of shopping online, research shows that people are willing to do so regardless because they believe it offers comfort and convenience. It's essential to recognize that the key to minimizing these risks is awareness and education, which includes understanding the importance of quality and cost, using credit cards responsibly, and taking precautions against addiction. At the same time, it's crucial to remain sensitive to social media influences and filter out content that might cause harm to yourself or others. If possible, try to adopt positive attitudes toward shopping and choose products carefully based on your own tastes and preferences.
