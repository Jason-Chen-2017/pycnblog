# 1.简介
  

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a continuous-wave electric field that emanates from primordial magnetic fields. It can be used to understand the properties of the universe and reveal its secrets, including fundamental physics such as gravity and dark matter. In recent years, there has been much interest in measuring CMB observations with ground-based telescopes. The measurement of CMB temperatures at different frequencies enables us to infer cosmological parameters through cosmic microwave radiation background anisotropy (CRAB), which involves decomposing the observed intensity spectrum into multiple frequency bands containing both scalar and tensor components. These measurements have allowed us to unravel the structure of the Universe, revealing key features such as inflationary models and dark energy. However, most CMB studies focus on the average or long time behavior of CMB anisotropies rather than understanding individual component contributions or their mutual interactions. To gain a deeper understanding of these contributions, we need to look beyond the static spectrum and study the microphysical processes responsible for generating the CMB power spectrum. This article provides an overview of how we can use advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to disentangle and characterize the various contributions to the CMB power spectrum. We will also discuss several open problems related to this research topic and suggest future directions and opportunities for collaboration.

## Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a continuous-wave electric field that emanates from primordial magnetic fields. It was first discovered by <NAME> in 1979 using Chelsea-Gordon detector array. Since then, many experiments and analyses have made great progress in observing and modeling the CMB. However, it remains challenging to measure precisely because of interference effects between the foreground emission from foreground sources like galaxies and cosmological structures, while also being sensitive to small variations in temperature due to detector nonlinearity. In contrast, radio frequency interferometry (RFI) techniques offer high sensitivity and precision but are highly sensitive to the foreground sources.


## Modelling CMB Power Spectrum
To model the CMB power spectrum, we observe the intensity spectrum as a function of spatial position and frequency, denoted by $I(r,\omega)$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency and $r$ is the distance from source. As a result, the three-dimensional CMB power spectrum is given by $P_{\mathrm{CMB}}(\mathbf{\ell},\theta)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\pi}^{+\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi} I^*_{\mathrm{CMB}}(r,\mathbf{\ell},\theta,\phi)\cos(\theta)\sin(\phi)d\Omega d\theta d\phi$. Here, $(\ell, \theta, \phi)$ denotes the spherical harmonic modes of the polarized electromagnetic radiation, defined based on the dipole approximation. While the large scale structure of the CMB is well captured by the monopole mode, higher order terms arise from substructure such as fluctuations of non-Gaussian nature or rotational symmetries. Thus, accurate modeling of the CMB power spectrum requires capturing all possible contributions to the observed spectra.

## Physics vs Statistics vs Machine Learning
In general, science today is not only driven by physics alone but also relies heavily on statistics and machine learning techniques. For instance, data analysis methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) employed in gravitational wave detection make heavy use of probability distributions and statistical inference. Similarly, machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image recognition, natural language processing and recommendation systems. In this work, we combine statistical methods and deep neural networks to extract meaningful insights from the raw data of CMB power spectra, thereby enabling new discoveries in the physical processes driving the CMB. Specifically, we apply deep learning algorithms to learn the mapping between observational inputs and outputs without requiring a priori assumptions about the underlying physics.
