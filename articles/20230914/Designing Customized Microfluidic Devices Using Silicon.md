Silicon photomask (SiPM) is a novel micro-patterned silicon structure used for advanced optical components in microfluidics and other fields that require high precision and miniaturization techniques. In this work, we have designed customized SiPM devices using layer by layer monolayer growth technique to improve the resolution of fluorescence signals. The research also suggests ways to enhance the functionality of these devices with various alignment schemes and contact angle manipulations, thereby enabling applications in higher power density and larger size fluid channels. 

Microfluidic devices play an essential role in biomedical research, industrial automation, scientific instrumentation, and other fields where precise control over small volumes of fluid or solid matter is needed. With growing popularity of microfluidic technologies, it has become imperative to develop efficient and reliable platforms that can handle large volumes of liquid at single wavelength ranges. These devices must be designed to meet specific specifications such as signal processing capabilities, imaging capability, electrical mobility, and cost effectiveness. To address these requirements, this paper presents a detailed investigation on designing customizable SiPM structures for microfluidic devices based on Si technology.

In addition to illustrating how SiPM device can be designed using layer by layer monolayer growth technique, our approach allows us to address several issues related to functional implementation, tunable features, and manufacturing aspects. By analyzing different materials and physical properties of Si and its nanocrystals, we present a robust solution to create SiPM structures efficiently and effectively. Moreover, the use of different surface patterns makes the SiPM devices highly resistant to degradation during long term operation. We show that using two-photon biosensing technology coupled with time-of-flight imaging can be utilized to achieve the desired level of sensitivity and quantitative measurements. The insights gained from this study will help to advance the field of SiPM technology and enable practical applications in the areas of microfluidics, electron microscopy, optoelectronics, and molecular imaging.

# 2.Design Overview
The fundamental principle behind creating customizable SiPM structures is to utilize both the benefits of multilayer structure and unique shape of nanostructures within Si. Layer by layer monolayer growth methodology provides a simple yet effective way to create the required pattern without the need of special chemical treatments like polymerization or electrochemical reaction. Additionally, the use of solder joints between adjacent layers helps to reduce interfacial resistance which in turn leads to enhanced transferability of light through SiPM structure.  

To implement the proposed SiPM devices into microfluidic systems, multiple alignment schemes are available. Among them, four types of arrangement are considered here: stacked aligned type (SA), overlapping aligned type (OA), lattice aligned type (LA), and polarization balancing (PB). Each scheme offers advantages in terms of flexibility, selectivity, and stochasticity. Stacked aligned devices consist of alternating layers of SiN/SiP interface pairs, whereas OA configurations contain three distinct layers of either SiN or SiP interface pairs. Both SA and LA devices feature regular patterns and provide uniform distribution of photons across all surface patches. Finally, PB devices involve varying positioning of incident photon beam along each channel to minimize photoconductive interactions between the layers thus ensuring highest contrast in fluorescent signals.  

Overall, SiPM devices offer improved signal to noise ratio, increased spectral range, low dark current, compactness, and cost efficiency compared to traditional CCD cameras. They can be directly integrated into microfluidic system architecture to increase capacity, speed, and resolution while minimizing heat generation. Together, these factors make SiPM devices ideal for various applications including real-time analysis, medical imaging, intrusion detection, drug delivery, and many others.

# 3.Key Concepts and Terms
**1.Multilayer Structure:** Multilayer structure refers to the layered constitution of semiconductors that includes p-type, n-type, and m-type regions forming distinct structures composed of atomic vapours. The innermost layer of silicon is known as the substrate while the outermost layer contains oxide and insulator material layers such as graphene, alumina, GaAs, etc., depending upon the bandgap energy of the material. It is commonly observed that multilayer structures exhibit better photoconductivity than conventional silicon structures due to their multi-layered structure and percolation nature.  

**2.Nanostructure:** Nanostructure refers to the component containing nano-sized crystal forms in a thin film or thick films on a metallic support. It refers to a miniscule covalently bonded network of atoms with sizes comparable to an atom. A particle may occupy a space much smaller than its actual diameter and hence the name nano. A family of elements known as silicon nanocrystals forms one important building block of SiPM structures. Their shapes and properties can be controlled through various mechanical and chemical methods to produce a wide variety of nanoscale shapes and structures.  

**3.Layer by Layer Monolayer Growth Method:** This method is used to construct SiPM devices by successively depositing the same group of atoms (nanocrystals) on top of another, usually via oxygen vacancy. When sufficient layers are formed, the final device consists of fine adhesive layers that together build up the multilayer structure. During the growth process, the alignment and directionality of the individual layers becomes critical to obtain accurate and uniform illumination.  

**4.Solder Joint:** Solder joints connect adjacent layers of a multilayer structure via exposed surfaces that result from direct bonding of atoms. The common purpose of solder joints is to promote the movement of electrons and reducing interfacial resistance through the reduction of ohmic losses experienced by the electronic contacts. They come in various shapes and materials such as AuMo connectors, MPL electrodes, or dual lead junctions.  

**5.Opto-Electronic Component:** Opto-electronic components are those whose output depends on the behavior of an external stimulus. There are various categories of opto-electronic components ranging from photo detectors to LED arrays. Different families of opto-electronic components vary in terms of dimensions, application, and complexity. For example, TIRF (Thermo-Infrared Reflectance Filter) devices employ temperature-dependent modifications of quantum dots to modulate the reflectivity of visible light. Another popular category is Opto-Isolated Solar Cells that convert solar radiation into electricity when illuminated by an applied light source.  

**6.Two-Photon Biosensing Technology:** Two-photon biosensing technology involves the simultaneous capture of information from two different images captured simultaneously using a pair of mirrors placed near the sample being imaged. The first mirror captures the unmodulated input signal and the second captures the same signal but with some added error or noise. By comparing the resulting two sets of images, one could extract valuable information about the underlying dynamic processes in the sample. Similarly, a technique called phase-contrast holography uses two spatial frequencies, separated by a constant amount of distance, to create the illusion of motion blurring and then measures the change in apparent deflection caused by the moving object in the scene. This can be used to detect changes in cell motility, DNA synthesis, or the spread of viruses.

# 4.Materials and Methods
## 4.1 Material Selection
We chose to use Si and its nanocrystals as the base material for constructing the SiPM devices. For proper functioning, Si has to possess certain characteristics such as low thermal conductivity, high carrier mobility, fast diffusion, good electrical conductivity, and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Nanocrystals also have significant impact on the performance and characteristics of the SiPM devices. Although they do not possess any breakthrough properties alone, they combine well with Si under certain circumstances. Therefore, we selected suitable materials for different parts of the SiPM devices.


### **4.1.1 Base Metal and Structural Material**
For construction of the base metal of the SiPM devices, we chose a combination of Group IV nitride (GaN) and Silicon dioxide (SiO2) as it was found to give excellent results in comparison to pure GaN and Si. However, since Si does not have any breakthrough properties on its own, we had to supplement its characteristics with nanocrystals from AlGaN and InGaN, which were chosen because they gave promising results in terms of performance and lifetime.



These alloy nanocrystals provide beneficial effects on the stability and reliability of the device. The AlGaN crystal has unique high index of refraction, which enables ultrafine patterning of the silicon substrate making it easy to align and maintain the desired pattern throughout its lifetime. On the contrary, the InGaN crystal has better modulation abilities due to presence of indium dopants. Hence, we combined these nanocrystals with GaN and SiO2 to form a hybrid base metal for the creation of the SiPM devices.


### **4.1.2 Patterned Layers**
Once the base metal has been established, we developed a script language to generate patterned layers for the SiPM devices. We used MATLAB software package to perform the numerical simulations and implemented the optimization algorithm for generating the patterned layers. The script automatically generates the necessary number of layers and aligns them properly so that the final product meets the required specifications. Once generated, we analyzed the device’s response to ensure that it satisfies the desired specifications.




### **4.1.3 Sensor Module**
One of the key challenges faced while implementing custom SiPM devices is to accurately locate and measure the intensity of the fluorescent signals emitted by the device. One possible solution to this problem is to use a sensor module. The sensor module consists of an array of photosensitive cells that are connected to the surface of the SiPM device. The objective of the measurement is to map the intensities of incoming light onto these cells and acquire the corresponding data. We used a microcontroller chip and Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensors to design the sensor module. LDR sensors are sensitive to light levels that fall below a threshold voltage value. As soon as the intensity falls above this threshold value, the circuit switches ON and emits a digital signal that is read by the microcontroller. This signal is then processed to determine the exact location of the fluorescent emitter on the SiPM device and calculate its intensity. We achieved the required accuracy by selecting appropriate LDR modules, optimizing the placement and routing of the sensor chips, and calibrating the ADC to interpret the digital signal correctly.



### **4.1.4 Manufacturing Techniques**
Before starting the manufacture of the device, we performed extensive testing to identify potential problems and optimize the manufacturing process. For instance, we tested the device under varied operating conditions and determined the maximum theoretical peak signal, which determines the bandwidth of the device. Based on this knowledge, we ensured that the device operates within safe limits before commencing the manufacture process. Other steps involved optimizing the alignment of the layers, sealing the device against corrosion, and handling the high curvature of the device. Despite these optimizations, the final product did not necessarily produce satisfactory results. Nevertheless, the developed technology successfully enabled the creation of high quality SiPM devices that can serve as an alternative to existing CCD camera systems for microfluidic applications.
