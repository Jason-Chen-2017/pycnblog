# 1.简介
  

K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique for grouping similar data points together into clusters based on their feature values. The goal of the clustering process is to identify groups in the data that are homogeneous (i.e., with many members in common) and different from each other. 

In this article we will apply the K-means clustering algorithm on an example dataset using Python programming language. We will use the scikit-learn library for implementing K-means clustering and explore its features in detail. 

We will start by importing all necessary libraries and loading our sample dataset. Then we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), which includes looking at the distribution of the data points in the two dimensions and checking if there is any missing or incorrect data. Once we have done EDA, we can proceed to applying the K-means algorithm on the entire dataset and visualize the results. Finally, we will analyze the performance metrics such as within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and between-cluster sum of squares (BCSS). This information helps us understand how well the model has grouped the data points and identifies areas where it may need improvement. 

Overall, we hope this tutorial provides useful insights on how to use K-means clustering algorithm and how to interpret its output plots. By following this tutorial, you should be able to apply K-means clustering algorithm on your own datasets and gain valuable insights for making better business decisions.

## 2.1. Data Points
Data point refers to a single observation or instance in a dataset. Each data point contains one or more attributes or features that describe the context or nature of the observation. In the case of the example dataset used here, we have four attributes - age, income, education level, and occupation. These attributes define the personality traits of the individual. For simplicity, let’s assume that these attributes represent qualitative variables. 

For example, consider the following data point:
Age = 30, Income = $75k, Education Level = Bachelors, Occupation = Sales Executive.

This data point represents an individual who is 30 years old, makes $75k per year, has bachelor's degree in sales, and works as a sales executive. These characteristics make them suitable for being grouped together under a cluster.

## 2.2. Clusters
Cluster refers to a group of related data points that exhibit similar patterns or behaviors. In K-means clustering, we try to find groups in the data where each group consists of similar data points based on their attribute values. When we run the clustering algorithm, the number of clusters/groups is determined beforehand. 

After performing the clustering operation, we assign each data point to one of the identified clusters based on the similarity of their attribute values. The resulting partition of the data space into clusters is called a cluster assignment or clustering result.

For example, suppose we want to group the people described above based on their occupation. Based on the behavior shown in the figure below, we can see that there seem to be three distinct groups of people in the data:

1. People who work in marketing department ($\text{Occupation} \in [Marketing]$).
2. People who work in finance department ($\text{Occupation} \in [Finance]$).
3. People who don't work in either marketing nor finance departments ($\text{Occupation} \notin [Marketing], \text{Finance}$).


Each color represents a separate cluster and indicates the range of people in that category. Note that the data points belonging to each group do not necessarily overlap perfectly. However, they cover most of the area and capture some important trends in the data.

The idea behind K-means clustering is to iteratively adjust the centroids of the clusters until convergence is achieved. At each iteration, we update the position of the centroid to minimize the intra-cluster sum of squared errors (SSE) and maximize the inter-cluster sum of squared distances (BSS). 

The SSE measures the overall dissimilarity of the data points assigned to each cluster. The smaller the SSE value, the better the fit of the data to the cluster structure. On the other hand, the BSS measures the separation distance between the clusters. The larger the BSS value, the fewer overlapping clusters we get. A good clustering algorithm aims to balance both SSE and BSS while ensuring that each data point belongs to exactly one cluster only.

## 2.3. K-Means Algorithm
The basic steps of K-Means clustering algorithm include:

1. Initialize the initial centroids randomly according to given dataset.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, calculate new centroid for each cluster. Repeat step 2 until convergence is reached. 
3. Assign each data point to closest cluster center, label each data point accordingly. Return the final cluster assignments.


To summarize the key concepts discussed so far, we can say that the input to K-Means clustering is a set of data points containing several attributes, where each data point describes the characterisitics of an entity or object. To solve the problem, the algorithm assigns data points to different clusters based on their similarity in terms of those attributes. 

Then, once we have formed the clusters, we can inspect them to extract meaningful insights about the underlying relationships between the entities. We can also measure the accuracy of the model using various performance metrics such as WCSS and BCSS, which give us insight into how well the model performs on predicting outcomes based on the learned pattern.
