With the fast development of electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years, it has become a popular transportation mode that can meet various transportation demands with great convenience and flexibility. However, how to load these EVs is still an issue that needs more attention from researchers and engineers. In this article, we will focus on the design and control methods for loading EVs by moving the directional wind turbine (DWT), which is one of the most common ways of loading large EV fleets. 

The main goal of this study is to develop efficient and effective algorithms for loading EVs by DWT. To achieve this goal, the following three major steps are proposed:

The analyses and simulations provided in this study could help guide developers and engineers to build new and better solutions for future EV loads. This work provides valuable insights into the fundamental principles and practices involved in designing and controlling EVs loaded by DWT, making it a good foundation for other research areas within the EV industry. 


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminologies
## Definition

**Directional wind turbines (DWTs)** are high-performance wind power generators located along the axis of an array of PV panels or wind farms. These devices produce significant amounts of power at low wind speeds, enabling them to be used as a power source for small-scale electric vehicles (EVs). DWTs can convert the rotating magnetic fields generated by the wind into electricity by means of electromagnetic coils installed near the blades. Each blade generates torque in the form of magnetic levitation that acts like an airbag. As they spin faster than conventional wind turbines, DWTs provide greater efficiency and lower losses compared to synchronous motors. In addition, their relative simplicity makes them easy to install and maintain. Although not currently used extensively due to safety concerns, DWTs may become a viable alternative to conventional turbines if more reliable power generation technology becomes available.

**Power control** refers to the process of adjusting the output of a device to match its desired operating state. It includes several subprocesses such as setting the voltage level, selecting the appropriate current configuration, regulating the frequency, and managing the reactive power. Power control plays an essential role in many electronic devices including computers, power converters, and smart meters. There exist different approaches to power control such as pulse-width modulation (PWM), variable gain (VG), on-off control, PID control, and neural networks. Based on the selected approach, various mathematical models have been developed to estimate the optimal values of actuators, such as PWM duty cycles or stator voltages, depending on the requirements of specific applications. 


**Adaptive dynamic controllers (ADCs)** are a class of feedback control systems that use signal processing techniques to adaptively modify the input signals so that the output follows a predefined response curve or characteristic. The basic idea behind ADCs is to optimize the performance of the controlled system without knowing the underlying behavior of the system ahead of time. ADCS can effectively reduce the disturbance caused by unpredictable events or changes in environmental conditions. One type of ADC known as proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller is commonly used in motor drives and DC-DC converters to ensure precise operation under varying operating conditions.  


**Electric vehicle (EV)** refers to any automobile designed and manufactured for transportation purposes rather than residential or industrial uses. Popular examples of EVs include buses, trucks, and cars. EVs typically comprise two components: the chassis, which consists of multiple electronics and structures; and the battery pack, which stores and distributes power to various modules inside the vehicle. 


**Energy storage** is defined as the transfer of stored energy between an electric grid and other forms of renewable energy, such as solar cells or geothermal heaters, over long periods of time while maintaining safe levels of temperature and humidity. A range of energy storage technologies exist, including lithium-ion batteries, fuel cell stacks, and water cooled battery pods. While traditional energy storage systems store and distribute electricity directly from the generator to the load, modern energy storage systems integrate renewable energy conversion technologies to supplement traditional energy storage capacity. For example, hydrogen gas cells could be used to charge and discharge batteries, allowing for a cheaper alternative to traditional fossil fuels. 


# 3. Algorithm and Operations
## Step 1: Analysis of Potential Energy Sources
To load large EV fleets by DWT, it is important to understand the potential energy sources available in the wind farm field. Typical energy sources include direct current (DC) wind power, solar radiation, hydropower plants, and wave power. To determine the feasibility of using DWT to load EV fleets, it is necessary to identify which sources are suitable for generating electricity required for the EVs. Assuming that the DWT is fed by direct current (DC) wind power, we would need to find out how much direct current (DC) wind power each panel produces per unit area and the size and location of the DWT installation. We also need to calculate the total energy production capacity of the DWT before installing it in the wind farm field. Finally, we should estimate the minimum and maximum annual production limits of the DWT based on the local weather patterns and terrain features. Below is a detailed analysis of the potential energy sources available in the wind farm field: 

### Direct Current (DC) Wind Power Production Capacity Per Unit Area

The direct current (DC) wind power is produced through the action of alternating current (AC) mains. Typically, AC mains consist of relatively large arrays of lines running at high frequencies around the country that are subjected to harsh winds. During windy seasons, these lines cause stronger eddies, resulting in higher pressures on the wind turbine blades, leading to increased fluctuations in wind speed. Thus, when generating electricity using DC wind power, it is crucial to take into account the interactions between the flow of wind and the DWT's movement. Therefore, during off-season times, where the wind velocity is relatively constant, the DWT might generate excessive power that exceeds the total energy production capacity of the DWT. On the other hand, during peak hours when severe weather conditions occur, the DWT can become damaged and cannot produce enough power. 

### Solar Radiation Energy Source

Solar radiation is another powerful energy source for generating electricity. Most of the solar radiation comes from the sun, but some smaller regions of the earth experience intermittent thunderstorms that can provide additional power. The largest solar PV project in the US was completed in 2005 and started producing power from the sun annually until 2013. Compared to wind power, solar radiation offers less variation in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity, which makes it ideal for generating electricity on an individual basis. Moreover, the installation of solar panels onto the roofs of buildings allows solar power to penetrate deep groundwater wells and irrigate crops, providing an economic opportunity for communities affected by natural disasters. Solar radiation also has a very low cost per kilowatt hour, making it economically viable for many communities. Therefore, solar radiation can serve as a complementary source for DWT-powered EVs.  

### Hydropower Plant Energy Source

Hydropower is an alternative source of energy that can be used for generating electricity. Hydroelectric projects require drilling machines and equipment specialized in extracting hydraulic fluids from streams or rivers. Once the fluid is extracted, it is then processed and converted into electricity by tapping power poles attached to the top of the turbine's rotor. Since pumping hydraulic fluids can be expensive, significant investment needs to be made to construct efficient hydroelectric projects. Furthermore, although hydroelectric energy does provide electricity, it requires longer cycle times, which limit the lifetime of the DWT. Overall, hydropower plants offer limited economic benefits compared to other energy sources. Nevertheless, since the majority of hydropower lies above sea level, it potentially creates a barrier to accessing clean and abundant energy resources. 

### Wave Power Energy Source

Wave power relies on the interaction between waves and ocean currents. Waves carry energy vertically, causing the pressure difference across the turbine's blades to increase. When combined with high levels of air masses below the surface, the resultant forces create a larger amount of lift, creating instabilities that can damage the rotor blades. Additionally, wave power has a shorter shelf life compared to other types of energy sources because of the limited lifetime of a single turbine. Therefore, it is important to carefully choose the locations and construction materials for DWT installations. Wave power can play a minor role in shaping the energy mix for small scale electric vehicles, especially in areas where renewable energy sources are scarce. 

Overall, it is important to analyze the potential energy sources available in the wind farm field to select the best suited energy source for loading large EV fleets by DWT. Based on our findings, we recommend the use of solar radiation, followed by wind power, as a way to generate electricity for the purpose of loading EVs. 

## Step 2: Design of a Power Control Strategy

Once we know the potential energy sources available in the wind farm field, we need to design a suitable power control strategy. Unlike conventional power plants that operate continuously, an EV only operates periodically. Therefore, it is important to define the timing intervals and corresponding actions needed to properly manage the power consumption of the DWT. Common strategies for managing DWT power consumption include step function control, pulse width modulation (PWM), and on-off control. 

Step function control involves switching ON the DWT whenever the wind speed falls within certain thresholds, such as after a specified number of seconds or once the wind speed exceeds a certain value. This approach maintains a static output level that meets the predetermined criteria regardless of the incoming wind speed. Pulse width modulation (PWM) adds a control loop that adjusts the percentage of active power according to the incoming wind speed, dynamically adjusting the output level to remain within acceptable bounds. On-off control switches the DWT ON or OFF based on the incoming wind speed exceeding or dropping below certain thresholds. Overall, the choice of power control strategy depends on the desired effectiveness of the algorithm and the ability to handle sudden variations in wind speed. 

Based on our observations, it seems reasonable to start with implementing a simple step function control strategy, monitoring the output level of the DWT throughout the day and fine-tuning the threshold values to optimize the output level for the given seasonality and ambient conditions.  

## Step 3: Optimization of System Model Parameters and Numerical Controller Implementation Using Simulation Tools

After defining the overall system architecture and designing the power control strategy, we move on to perform parameter estimation and validation tests to validate the accuracy of the obtained results. With proper parameter estimation and validation, we can proceed to simulate the DWT system dynamics and implement a numerical controller using software tools. Below is a brief description of the key steps involved in performing parameter estimation and validation testing:

1. Parameter estimation: This involves obtaining estimates of the physical and operational characteristics of the system, such as wind speed, turbine pitch angle, turbulence intensity, etc., based on historical data collected from measurements or simulations performed elsewhere.
2. Validation testing: After obtaining estimated parameter values, we need to test the validity of the model predictions by comparing them to actual measured or simulated values. This helps us establish the accuracy of the prediction and enables us to make improvements to the modeling approach or parameters if necessary. 
3. Simulations: Once the system dynamics are accurately modeled, we can run simulations to predict the system behavior under different scenarios and compare the predicted outcomes to the actual observed data. If the predictions deviate significantly from reality, we can revise the system model or try alternate approaches to solving the problem. 

Next, we introduce the details of the implementation of the numerical controller using MATLAB®Simulink™ software package. We assume that we have already set up the DWT system structure, including all the relevant components such as the mechanical connections, shaft assembly, electrical connections, and control mechanism. Then, we need to connect the inputs and outputs of the system to obtain the required input/output variables. Next, we must specify the relationships between the input variables and the output variables using math equations and functions. Depending on the nature of the task, we can use built-in blocks or customize our own custom blocks to represent complex functionalities. We can also use closed-loop or open-loop controls to regulate the power consumption of the DWT. Open-loop control mechanisms simply allow the wind speed sensor to measure the true wind speed and feed it to the control mechanism. In contrast, closed-loop control mechanisms require feedback loops to keep track of the real-time dynamics of the system and use this information to correct the predicted output to match the true output.
