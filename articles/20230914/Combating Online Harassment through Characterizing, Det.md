Online harassment is one of the most common forms of cyberbullying or online abuse that happens on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. It affects millions of people every day with unintended consequences such as negative emotional reactions, loss of trust, disruption to productivity, financial losses, and other adverse outcomes. In recent years, it has become a serious problem for many organizations including public safety, government agencies, and businesses who rely heavily on social media to provide essential services like customer support, information sharing, and engagement. The goal of this survey paper is to explore how we can combat online harassment effectively through characterization, detection, and mitigation techniques. This will be done by understanding current technologies used by various platforms and identifying effective solutions to combat misinformation online.

In order to accomplish these goals, the following steps have been taken:

1. Understanding the importance of online harmful content
2. Analyze different types of online harassment attacks 
3. Characterize the attributes of misinformation and develop an approach for detecting them
4. Evaluate available tools and methods for mitigating misinformation online
5. Develop strategies for implementing automated anti-misinformation mechanisms using machine learning algorithms

This survey paper aims to gain a deep understanding of the challenges faced by companies and governments when it comes to preventing, detecting, and mitigating online harassment through characterization, detection, and mitigation techniques. Moreover, it provides actionable recommendations for better defending against online harassment at both individual and organizational levels. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明

Before delving into the technical details, let’s first understand some important terms and concepts related to online harassment which are commonly encountered in the industry. 

## Types of Cyber Bullying

There are several types of cyber bullying:

1. Impersonation Attack - When an attacker uses their name and portrait picture to mimic another person, usually from a stereotypical group of users, and spread false claims about them.
2. Humiliation Attacks - These attacks involve making someone feel humiliated or shame, possibly targeting vulnerabilities or weaknesses they may not be aware of, creating tension between victims and perpetrators, or promoting harmful attitudes towards certain groups of individuals. 
3. Personal Aggression - These include physical, verbal, and mental attacks directed at others. They range from slight offensive comments to demanding statements involving a lot of damage to relationships, financial situation, or health status. 
4. Doxxing Attack - This attack involves exposing sensitive personal information about targets, typically their real names, addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, job titles, education level, employer information, relatives, and sexual life. 
5. Physical Contact - This includes any physical contact between target and victim, whether it be touching, groping, squeezing, penetrating, biting, grinding, scratching, or hitting.

## Attributes of Misinformation

Misinformation is defined as anything that intentionally deceives or confuses people without changing its truthfulness. There are four main categories of misinformation: 

1. False Information - This refers to deliberately confusing people with false news stories, rumors, and information which may contain intentional errors, omissions, or redundancies. 
2. Fake News - This refers to articles, videos, images, or text messages published with the intent to deceive readers. They often contain exaggerated or manipulated statistics, hyperbole, lies, or unverified sources. 
3. Harmful Content - This includes websites or web pages designed to cause psychological distress, fear, or stress, such as scam pages, phishing sites, fake dating websites, and violent content. 
4. Spam - This includes bulk email spam, botnets, fake sign-up forms, and other irrelevant advertising materials. 

## Different Tools & Methods for Mitigating Misinformation Online

Various tools and methods exist to mitigate online harassment through detection and prevention measures. Below are some popular ones: 

1. Filtering System – One of the most popular methods of filtering out harmful content is through filter bubbles. These allow users to curate lists of blocks that automatically hide harmful content, reducing the risk of being exposed to it. Some platforms offer built-in filters to remove promotional messaging, but there are always ways for end-users to bypass this feature.
2. Content Moderation – This process involves monitoring user-generated content and flagging it for review if it contains harmful language, links to external content, or otherwise violates platform policies. Depending on the severity of the violation, it may trigger a ban or a warning. Additionally, platforms may also use third-party moderators to further screen content and ensure it meets company guidelines before publishing.
3. Automated Anti-Harassment Mechanisms – Many platforms now implement algorithms to detect and block harmful content based on predefined criteria, such as profanity, hate speech, URLs, IP address tracking, and behavior patterns. While these systems do help reduce the potential impact of online harassment, they cannot guarantee complete protection because they require continuous updates and training to adapt to ever-evolving threats. 

# 3. Core Algorithms and Operations

Now that we know what online harassment is, let's go ahead and analyze its core characteristics and operations. We'll start by analyzing the specific factors that contribute to the growth of this form of cyberattacks. Then, we'll move onto exploring several approaches for detecting and mitigating misinformation online. Finally, we'll discuss the implications of these techniques and recommend strategies for addressing the issue at both individual and organizational levels.
