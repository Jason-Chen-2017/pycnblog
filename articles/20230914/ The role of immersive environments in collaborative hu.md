虚拟现实（VR）和增强现实（AR）已经成为众多领域热门的技术名词。但是，如何将它们应用于人机协作系统（HCI），尤其是在面对复杂、高维空间数据时，仍然是一个难题。本文试图从人的视角出发，阐述增强现实在协同互动环境中的角色及其影响因素。
## 研究背景
VR/AR技术的兴起，使得人们可以体验到真实世界的虚拟版本，并获得信息和理解能力上的提升。随着数字技术的飞速发展，人们越来越依赖计算机处理任务，而受限于人的视觉和听觉感官，使用VR/AR技术不仅能够增强沟通互动过程中的沟通效率，还可以帮助人们更好地解决实际问题。因此，随着VR/AR技术的普及，HCI研究者越来越关注如何利用VR/AR技术改善用户的协同效率。通过虚拟现实或增强现实模拟人类进行协同工作，可以有效提升产品的可用性和舒适度，改善用户满意度。但是，如何把VR/AR技术应用于HCI中，又是一个新的课题。

目前，国内外许多知名的HCI领域的研究人员都对VR/AR技术在人机协作领域的应用提出了不同的看法。基于我国国情特点和用户群体的需求，作者认为共同研究VR/AR技术在HCI领域的应用非常必要。例如，研究VR/AR技术在HMI建设、虚拟现实学习、远程服务场景等方面的作用，既需要具备跨界知识的广度，也需要深入技术的深度。另外，不断紧密结合的人机交互、人机学习、虚拟现实技术等新兴技术，还有助于丰富当前HCI研究的内容。因此，基于作者所阐述的相关理论，本文试图系统、全面地理解VR/AR技术在人机协作环境中的角色及其影响因素。

## VR/AR设备：
Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are the two most popular technology trends that have emerged over the past decade or so. These technologies allow users to virtually explore a virtual environment, which may include real objects, characters, and surrounding environmental factors. AR is similar but allows for additional graphical effects and interactive features like movement, color changes, and interactions with physical objects. Both technologies can enhance communication and collaboration between people by simulating their presence within a virtual world, thus improving productivity and satisfaction levels for both parties. Despite these benefits, it’s not yet well understood how they could be effectively integrated into HCI design. In this paper, we aim at understanding the roles of VR/AR devices in collaborative human–computer interaction design through an extensive literature review.


Virtual Reality (VR): Virtual reality refers to the simulation of a fully functional environment using computer graphics, allowing users to experience different aspects of a virtual world through the eyes and hands of realistic actors. It involves creating a digital representation of the real world using various input devices such as gaze tracking cameras and controllers. Research has shown that virtual reality can significantly improve user engagement and cognitive performance, resulting in better decision making and problem solving abilities [1]. 


Augmented Reality (AR): Augmented reality combines traditional computer graphics rendering techniques with a special type of sensor, known as markers, which enables users to interact with real-world objects inside the simulated environment [2]. Markers are tiny holograms attached to objects in the real world, allowing users to visualize information about the object by projecting images from the marker onto the real-world view. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with complex data sets or high-dimensional spaces where visual perception becomes challenging [3]. 

However, while AR provides a powerful tool for enhancing communication and collaboration, there are several limitations associated with its use: limited field of view, occlusion issues, lagging responses due to processing time, and lack of interactivity during natural conversation [4]. To address these challenges, researchers have been exploring novel forms of HCI design that leverage AR to support tasks such as shared workspace navigation and collaboration on large-scale datasets [5] and content creation [6]. However, no comprehensive work has focused on integrating VR/AR into existing HCI frameworks or proposing new ways to improve user experiences across multiple modalities. Therefore, in this article, we seek to understand the potential applications of VR/AR technology in modern collaborative HCI by reviewing the current literature around the topic.

Human Computer Interaction (HCI): Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) studies the design of interfaces between humans and computers, including software products and hardware devices. HCI concepts are used to create efficient and effective tools that assist individuals and groups to accomplish various tasks [7], leading to improved productivity, efficiency, and quality of life [8]. As mentioned earlier, one of the key advantages of VR/AR technology lies in enabling social simulations, providing a valuable way to enhance teamwork and communication [9]. Yet, little work has investigated the possibilities and impacts of utilizing VR/AR in HCI design. For example, what are the roles of head-mounted displays (HMDs), motion capture systems, gaze-based interaction techniques, etc., in supporting collaboration? What are the implications for usability, accessibility, and inclusiveness in designing for multimodal interfaces? How can we apply existing research and methods to integrate VR/AR technology into the broader context of HCI design? Thus, in order to identify the principles behind the success and failure of VR/AR in HCI, we need to understand the fundamental mechanisms driving their usage, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their viability in addressing key problems in our everyday lives and business operations.

## Collaboration vs Collaborative Design:
Collaboration and Collaborative Design are terms that often come up in the HCI community. While they refer to different things, some consider them synonymous. Others point out that “collaboration” might involve multiple organizations working together towards a common goal, whereas “collaborative design” means designing activities with other stakeholders, such as customers, users, vendors, developers, and suppliers. Although both terms cover different topics and contexts, they still provide important insights into the nature of collaboration and the process involved in producing solutions. We will use both terms interchangeably throughout this paper, as they serve similar purposes.

## Interaction Techniques:
In this section, we introduce four main types of interaction techniques commonly found in VR/AR systems, including touch, tactile, voice, and haptics. These techniques enable users to interact with the virtual environment and manipulate objects in a variety of ways. Touch inputs involve detecting hand movements via fingers or palms of the device. Tactile inputs include vibrations emitted by the device or objects within it. Voice commands allow users to control the system using natural language sentences. Lastly, haptic feedback gives users immediate visual feedback on actions performed within the virtual space. In addition, each technique typically also includes affordances, meaning the range of actionable items available to users. This helps users navigate the interface efficiently and intuitively, regardless of their age, gender, cultural background, or level of expertise.
