：Privacy is one of the most important concerns for machine learning systems today. Despite the efforts to preserve privacy in various ways such as differential privacy and encryption, it remains a critical concern for developers and researchers who are working on developing trustworthy and reliable ML systems that serve sensitive data. In this work-in-progress paper, we present an auditing framework for assessing the privacy risks associated with machine learning models using contrastive learning technique. The core idea behind this approach is to use synthetic data generated by simple augmentations applied to real data points to learn a similarity function between them which can then be used to measure the level of privacy risk associated with each model's predictions. Our proposed methodology leverages the rich set of existing techniques for generating synthetic data, including GANs, VAEs, and transformers, alongside state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNN). To evaluate our methodology, we conducted experiments on three datasets, namely CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FashionMNIST, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify different types of privacy risks and provide actionable insights for improving system security. 

In summary, the key contributions of this work include:

 - A new methodology for auditing the privacy risks of machine learning systems based on contrastive learning
 - An empirical evaluation showing that contrastive learning can accurately identify multiple forms of privacy vulnerabilities in DNNs across multiple datasets
 - A discussion on potential directions for future research into privacy-preserving machine learning systems
The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a general background on machine learning and contrastive learning. Then, section 3 introduces some relevant concepts and terminologies. Next, section 4 presents the algorithmic details and implementation steps of our approach using Python code examples. We also discuss how the results were evaluated and presented in terms of accuracy and fairness. Finally, sections 5 and 6 contain related works and challenges and some open questions for further research. Overall, this is a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art privacy auditing techniques available for machine learning systems and provides concrete recommendations for future research. This work has been accepted for publication at IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC) in July 2022. 
## Introduction
Machine learning (ML) has become increasingly popular in recent years, becoming essential in many aspects of modern life. However, unlike traditional software applications, ML systems often handle sensitive user data that need to be protected from unauthorized access and modification. As a result, there have been significant efforts devoted to ensuring the privacy of ML systems, ranging from protecting users' personal information through secure data storage mechanisms to mitigating the impact of adversarial attacks via defensive strategies. Nevertheless, the importance of maintaining the integrity and security of ML systems requires rigorous testing procedures to ensure their reliability, trustworthiness, and fairness under different attack scenarios.

One particular challenge for privacy-preserving machine learning systems is detecting and quantifying any potential privacy violations during runtime. Despite the efforts made by both industry and academia, the task of identifying and understanding these vulnerabilities still remains challenging. One way to address this problem is to employ contrastive learning algorithms, which aim to learn a representation of input data that captures the similarities among individual samples while discriminating against outliers or anomalies. These representations could potentially help us identify potential privacy breaches by comparing the distributions of predicted values obtained from two different models trained on the same dataset but with differentially private vs non-private preprocessing methods. 

In this work-in-progress paper, we propose a novel methodology for auditing the privacy risks of machine learning systems based on contrastive learning. The core idea behind this approach is to generate synthetic data generated by simple augmentations applied to real data points to learn a similarity function between them which can then be used to measure the level of privacy risk associated with each model's predictions. Our proposed methodology leverages the rich set of existing techniques for generating synthetic data, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformers, alongside state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNN). To evaluate our methodology, we conducted experiments on three publicly accessible datasets, namely CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FashionMNIST, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify different types of privacy risks and provide actionable insights for improving system security.

In summary, the main contribution of this work is to introduce a novel methodology for auditing the privacy risks of machine learning systems based on contrastive learning. We demonstrate that this approach can accurately identify different types of privacy vulnerabilities in DNNs across multiple datasets, making it an effective tool for securing the privacy of sensitive data stored within ML systems.
