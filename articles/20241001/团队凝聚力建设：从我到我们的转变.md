### Background Introduction

#### 1.1 Definition and Importance of Team Cohesion

Team cohesion refers to the degree of mutual trust, cooperation, and support among team members. It is not only crucial for the efficiency and performance of a team but also for the stability and sustainable development of a team. High team cohesion implies that team members can understand, support, and help each other, thereby enhancing the overall competitiveness of the team.

In today's highly competitive business environment, companies are increasingly focusing on team cohesion. A team with high cohesion is more likely to respond effectively to changes, make quick decisions, and execute tasks efficiently. Conversely, a team with low cohesion may experience internal conflicts, communication breakdowns, and low efficiency.

#### 1.2 The Relationship Between the IT Industry and Team Cohesion

The IT industry heavily relies on teamwork. In developing complex projects and solving technical challenges, close collaboration and effective communication among team members are vital. However, the rapid development of the IT industry, technological innovation, and fierce competition also bring challenges to team cohesion.

Firstly, the rapid development of the IT industry requires team members to continuously learn new knowledge and master new technologies. This can widen the gap between team members' technical levels and abilities, increasing internal competition and conflicts.

Secondly, the tight schedules and strict deadlines of IT projects often lead to high work pressure for team members, causing anxiety, fatigue, and emotional disturbances, which can affect team cohesion.

Lastly, the fierce competition in the IT industry creates a sense of insecurity among team members, as they may worry about their skills and positions being threatened, thereby impacting the cooperative atmosphere within the team.

#### 1.3 Research Objectives and Significance

This paper aims to explore the application and practice of team cohesion in the IT industry, analyze the factors influencing team cohesion, and provide useful references for IT companies and team managers. The specific research objectives are as follows:

1. Analyze the concept and importance of team cohesion;
2. Discuss the application and practice of team cohesion in the IT industry;
3. Analyze the factors influencing team cohesion;
