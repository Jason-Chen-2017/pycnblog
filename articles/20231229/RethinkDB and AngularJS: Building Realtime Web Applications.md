## 4.具体代码实例和详细解释说明

### 4.1 RethinkDB

In this section, we will provide a detailed code example of how to use RethinkDB to build a real-time web application.

```javascript
const rethinkdb = require('rethinkdb');

const connect = async () => {
  await rethinkdb.connect({ host: 'localhost', port: 28015 });
};

const insert = async () => {
  const result = await rethinkdb.table('users').insert({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 });
  console.log(result);
};

const get = async () => {
  const result = await rethinkdb.table('users').get('john-doe');
  console.log(result);
};

connect();
insert();
get();
```

In this code example, we first import the RethinkDB library and connect to the RethinkDB database. We then insert a new user into the `users` table, and get the user with the name `john-doe`.

### 4.2 AngularJS

In this section, we will provide a detailed code example of how to use AngularJS to build a real-time web application.

```javascript
const app = angular.module('myApp', []);

app.controller('myController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  $scope.name = 'John Doe';
  $scope.age = 30;
}]);
```

In this code example, we first create an AngularJS module called `myApp`, and a controller called `myController`. We then define two properties, `name` and `age`, and set their values to `'John Doe'` and `30`, respectively.

## 6.附录常见问题与解答

### 6.1 RethinkDB

#### 6.1.1 问题：RethinkDB 如何处理大量数据？

**解答：**RethinkDB 使用 Reactive Streams 技术处理大量数据，这种技术允许 RethinkDB 以非阻塞的方式处理数据。此外，RethinkDB 还支持分布式计算，这意味着它可以在多个服务器上运行，以处理更大的数据集。

#### 6.1.2 问题：RethinkDB 如何保证数据的一致性？

**解答：**RethinkDB 使用事务来保证数据的一致性。事务是一组操作，这些操作要么全部成功，要么全部失败。这意味着，如果一个操作失败，RethinkDB 将回滚到事务开始之前的状态，以确保数据的一致性。

### 6.2 AngularJS

#### 6.2.1 问题：AngularJS 如何处理大量数据？

**解答：**AngularJS 使用两种方法处理大量数据：一种是使用服务器端渲染（SSR），这种方法将数据在服务器端渲染到页面上，这样可以减少客户端的负载；另一种是使用虚拟 DOM 技术，这种方法将只更新实际发生变化的 DOM 元素，从而减少不必要的重绘和重排。

#### 6.2.2 问题：AngularJS 如何保证数据的一致性？

**解答：**AngularJS 使用双向数据绑定来保证数据的一致性。双向数据绑定是一种机制，它允许 AngularJS 自动更新数据和视图，以确保数据和视图之间的一致性。此外，AngularJS 还使用依赖注入来管理依赖关系，这样可以确保数据的一致性。
