FoundationDB is a distributed, in-memory NoSQL database that is designed for high performance and scalability. It is used by many large companies, such as Apple, Airbnb, and Dropbox, for their mobile apps. In this article, we will discuss the basics of FoundationDB and how it can be used to build resilient and scalable mobile apps.

## 1.1 What is FoundationDB?
FoundationDB is an in-memory NoSQL database that is designed for high performance and scalability. It is a distributed database, which means that it can be run on multiple servers and can scale out to handle large amounts of data. FoundationDB is used by many large companies, such as Apple, Airbnb, and Dropbox, for their mobile apps.

## 1.2 Why use FoundationDB?
There are several reasons why you might want to use FoundationDB for your mobile app:

- **High performance**: FoundationDB is designed to be a high-performance database. It can handle large amounts of data and can scale out to handle even more data.

- **Scalability**: FoundationDB is a distributed database, which means that it can be run on multiple servers and can scale out to handle large amounts of data.

- **Resilience**: FoundationDB is designed to be resilient. It can handle failures and can recover from them without losing data.

- **Ease of use**: FoundationDB is easy to use. It has a simple API and can be used with many different programming languages.

## 1.3 How does FoundationDB work?
FoundationDB is a distributed, in-memory NoSQL database. It is designed to be high performance and scalable. It works by using a combination of techniques, such as sharding and replication, to distribute data across multiple servers.

### 1.3.1 Sharding
Sharding is a technique that is used to distribute data across multiple servers. It works by splitting the data into smaller pieces, called shards, and then distributing those shards across multiple servers. This allows FoundationDB to handle large amounts of data and to scale out to handle even more data.

### 1.3.2 Replication
Replication is a technique that is used to make FoundationDB resilient. It works by creating multiple copies of the data and then storing those copies on multiple servers. This allows FoundationDB to handle failures and to recover from them without losing data.

## 1.4 How to get started with FoundationDB
To get started with FoundationDB, you will need to download and install the FoundationDB server and the FoundationDB client. You can download the FoundationDB server and the FoundationDB client from the FoundationDB website.

Once you have downloaded and installed the FoundationDB server and the FoundationDB client, you can start using FoundationDB. To do this, you will need to create a new FoundationDB database and then connect to it using the FoundationDB client.

### 1.4.1 Create a new FoundationDB database
To create a new FoundationDB database, you will need to use the FoundationDB command-line interface (CLI). The FoundationDB CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create, manage, and interact with FoundationDB databases.

To create a new FoundationDB database, you will need to use the following command:

```
foundationdb create-database -n mydatabase
```

This command will create a new FoundationDB database with the name "mydatabase".

### 1.4.2 Connect to a FoundationDB database
To connect to a FoundationDB database, you will need to use the FoundationDB client. The FoundationDB client is a library that allows you to connect to and interact with FoundationDB databases.

To connect to a FoundationDB database, you will need to use the following code:

```python
from foundationdb import Client

client = Client.connect("mydatabase")
```

This code will connect to the FoundationDB database with the name "mydatabase".

## 1.5 Conclusion
In this article, we have discussed the basics of FoundationDB and how it can be used to build resilient and scalable mobile apps. We have also shown you how to get started with FoundationDB. If you are looking for a high-performance, scalable, and resilient NoSQL database for your mobile app, then FoundationDB is a great option.
