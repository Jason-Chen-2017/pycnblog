4.1 Introduction
----------------

In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has made significant progress due to advances in deep learning. With the rapid development of pre-trained language models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet, various NLP tasks have achieved remarkable results. Among these tasks, named entity recognition (NER) plays a crucial role in understanding the structure of text and extracting valuable information. This chapter will introduce the basics of NER, its applications, and best practices for implementation.

4.2 Core Concepts and Connections
--------------------------------

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an essential task in NLP that aims to identify and classify named entities in text into predefined categories, such as person names, organizations, locations, dates, and quantities. NER can be seen as a sequence labeling problem, where each word in a sentence is assigned a tag indicating its corresponding category.

The following figure shows an example of NER:

> **Original Text:** John Smith works at Google in Mountain View, California.
>
> **Tagged Text:** [John/PERSON] [Smith/PERSON] works at [Google/ORGANIZATION] in [Mountain View/LOCATION] , [California/LOCATION].

4.3 Core Algorithm Principle and Specific Steps
-----------------------------------------------

There are several popular approaches to implementing NER, including rule-based methods, hidden Markov models (HMM), conditional random fields (CRF), and deep learning methods using recurrent neural networks (RNN) or transformers. In this section, we'll discuss a typical deep learning approach based on Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF).

### 3.1 Bi-LSTM

Bi-LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture contextual information from sequences by maintaining hidden states across time steps. Bi-LSTM consists of two LSTMs, one reading input data in forward order and another in backward order, allowing the model to learn both past and future contexts for each time step.


### 3.2 CRF

Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is a probabilistic graphical model used for sequential labeling tasks. CRF models the joint probability distribution between input sequences and their corresponding labels, taking into account dependencies between adjacent tags. This makes CRF particularly suitable for NER tasks since it can enforce constraints such as "I" cannot follow a "B-ORG" tag directly.


### 3.3 NER Model Architecture

The architecture of our NER model combines Bi-LSTM and CRF layers. First, word embeddings are fed into a Bi-LSTM layer to capture contextual information. Then, the output from the Bi-LSTM layer is connected to a CRF layer, which models the joint probability distribution between input sequences and their corresponding labels.


4.4 Mathematical Model Formulas
------------------------------

In this section, we will derive the mathematical model formula for the NER model described above.

### 4.1 Bi-LSTM

For a given input sequence $x = (x\_1, x\_2, \dots, x\_n)$, the Bi-LSTM computes forward hidden states $\overrightarrow{h} = (\overrightarrow{h}\_1, \overrightarrow{h}\_2, \dots, \overrightarrow{h}\_n)$ and backward hidden states $\overleftarrow{h} = (\overleftarrow{h}\_1, \overleftarrow{h}\_2, \dots, \overleftarrow{h}\_n)$. The final hidden state for each time step is calculated as follows:

$$
h\_i = [\overrightarrow{h}\_i; \overleftarrow{h}\_i]
$$

where $[;]$ denotes concatenation.

### 4.2 CRF

Assuming we have a transition matrix $A$, where $A\_{i, j}$ represents the score of transitioning from the i-th tag to the j-th tag. Let $P(y|x)$ denote the joint probability distribution between the input sequence $x$ and the corresponding tag sequence $y$. We define $P(y|x)$ as:

$$
P(y|x) = \frac{\exp(\sum\_{i=1}^{n} A\_{y\_{i-1}, y\_i} + \sum\_{i=1}^{n} P(y\_i|x\_i))}{\sum\_{\hat{y}} \exp(\sum\_{i=1}^{n} A\_{\hat{y}\_{i-1}, \hat{y}\_i} + \sum\_{i=1}^{n} P(\hat{y}\_i|x\_i))}
$$

where $P(y\_i|x\_i)$ is the emission score obtained from the previous Bi-LSTM layer.

4.5 Best Practices: Code Examples with Detailed Explanations
-----------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we'll implement an NER model using the PyTorch library. Our dataset will be the CoNLL2003 dataset, a standard benchmark for NER tasks.

### 5.1 Data Preparation

We start by loading and preprocessing the data:

```python
import torch
from torchtext.datasets import conll2003
from torchtext.data.utils import get_tokenizer

def load_dataset():
   tokenizer = get_tokenizer('spacy', language='en_core_web_sm')
   
   train_iter, dev_iter, test_iter = conll2003()
   
   def collate_fn(batch):
       sentences, tags = zip(*batch)
       return list(sentences), [torch.tensor(tokenizer(str(sent))) for sent in sentences], [torch.tensor(tag) for tag in tags]
       
   train_dataset = torch.utils.data.Dataset(train_iter, collate_fn)
   dev_dataset = torch.utils.data.Dataset(dev_iter, collate_fn)
   test_dataset = torch.utils.data.Dataset(test_iter, collate_fn)
   
   return train_dataset, dev_dataset, test_dataset

train_dataset, dev_dataset, test_dataset = load_dataset()
```

### 5.2 Word Embeddings

Next, we create custom word embeddings based on GloVe vectors:

```python
import numpy as np
from torch.nn import Embedding

class MyEmbedding(Embedding):
   def __init__(self, num_embeddings, embedding_dim, path):
       super().__init__(num_embeddings, embedding_dim)
       self.path = path
       
   def forward(self, x):
       if not hasattr(self, 'weights'):
           self.weights = torch.FloatTensor(np.load(self.path))
           self.weights[self.weight.data == 0].zero_()
           self.weight.data = self.weights
       
       return super().forward(x)

embedding = MyEmbedding(len(vocab), embedding_size, glove_path)
```

### 5.3 Bi-LSTM Layer

We create our own Bi-LSTM layer using the pytorch-lightning library:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pack_padded_sequence, pad_packed_sequence

class BiLSTM(pl.LightningModule):
   def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_size, hidden_size, num_layers, dropout):
       super().__init__()
       self.hidden_size = hidden_size
       self.num_layers = num_layers
       self.dropout = dropout
       
       self.embedding = MyEmbedding(vocab_size, embedding_size, glove_path)
       self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True, bidirectional=True, dropout=dropout)
       self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, len(tags))
       
   def forward(self, x):
       embedded = self.embedding(x)
       outputs, _ = self.lstm(embedded)
       outputs = self.fc(outputs[:, -1, :])
       return outputs
   
   # Training step
   def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
       x, _, targets = batch
       logits = self(x)
       loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(logits, targets)
       self.log('train_loss', loss)
       return loss

   # Validation step
   def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
       x, _, targets = batch
       logits = self(x)
       loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(logits, targets)
       self.log('val_loss', loss)
```

### 5.4 CRF Layer

Finally, we implement the CRF layer:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CRFLayer(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self, num_tags):
       super().__init__()
       self.transitions = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_tags, num_tags))
       self.start_transitions = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_tags, 1))
       self.end_transitions = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, num_tags))

   def forward(self, emissions, mask):
       batch_size, seq_length, num_tags = emissions.shape
       start_emissions = emissions[:, 0, :].unsqueeze(1)
       end_emissions = emissions[:, -1, :].unsqueeze(1)

       start_scores = torch.sum(self.start_transitions * start_emissions, dim=-1)
       end_scores = torch.sum(self.end_transitions * end_emissions, dim=-1)

       transition_scores = torch.sum(self.transitions * emissions, dim=-1)
       scores = start_scores + torch.sum(transition_scores, dim=1) + end_scores
       best_scores, best_paths = torch.max(scores, dim=0)

       total_score = best_scores[-1]

       for i in reversed(range(seq_length)):
           total_score += scores[i][best_paths[i]]

       return total_score, best_paths

   def neg_log_likelihood(self, emissions, tags, mask):
       total_score, best_paths = self.forward(emissions, mask)
       gold_scores = torch.zeros(total_score.shape)
       for i, tag in enumerate(tags):
           gold_scores[i][tag] = 1
       gold_scores = torch.sum(gold_scores * emissions, dim=-1)

       return -(total_score - gold_scores).mean()
```
