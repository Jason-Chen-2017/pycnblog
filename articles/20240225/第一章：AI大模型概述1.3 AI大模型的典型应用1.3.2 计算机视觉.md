## 1. Background Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has experienced a renaissance in recent years, driven by advances in data availability, computational power, and algorithmic innovation. One manifestation of this progress is the emergence of AI "big models" that can learn complex patterns from large datasets and generalize to new tasks. These models have shown remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision.

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field concerned with enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. This technology has numerous real-world applications, from facial recognition in smartphones to autonomous vehicles and medical imaging analysis. In this article, we will explore core concepts, algorithms, best practices, and tools related to AI big models in computer vision.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

### 2.1 Image Classification

Image classification is the task of assigning a label to an image based on its content. For example, an image might be classified as a dog, cat, or car. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the primary algorithm used for image classification. CNNs take advantage of local spatial correlations in images and shared weights to improve model efficiency and accuracy.

### 2.2 Object Detection

Object detection is the process of identifying and locating objects within an image. It involves both classifying objects and determining their bounding boxes. Object detection typically consists of two steps: region proposal and object classification. Region proposal networks (RPNs) generate potential object locations, which are then fed into a classification network to determine the presence and category of objects.

### 2.3 Semantic Segmentation

Semantic segmentation is the task of partitioning an image into regions corresponding to different object categories. Unlike object detection, semantic segmentation provides pixel-level classifications, enabling more detailed scene understanding. Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) are commonly used for semantic segmentation, employing convolutional layers without fully connected layers to maintain spatial information.

## 3. Core Algorithms and Operations

### 3.1 Image Classification

#### 3.1.1 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

A CNN is a type of neural network designed to process grid-like data, such as images. A typical CNN comprises several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layer applies filters to the input image to extract features, while the pooling layer reduces the spatial dimensions to control overfitting. Finally, fully connected layers perform high-level reasoning and output probabilities for each class.

Mathematically, a convolution operation can be represented as:

$$
y[i] = \sum\_{j} w[j] \cdot x[i + j]
$$

where $x$ is the input feature map, $w$ is the filter, and $y$ is the output feature map.

### 3.2 Object Detection

#### 3.2.1 Region Proposal Network (RPN)

The RPN is a fully convolutional network that generates region proposals for object detection. Given an input image, the RPN slides a small window across the image and predicts whether the window contains an object and, if so, proposes a refined bounding box. To achieve this, the RPN shares parameters across different window positions and scales to improve efficiency.

### 3.3 Semantic Segmentation

#### 3.3.1 Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)

FCNs extend traditional CNN architectures by replacing fully connected layers with convolutional layers, allowing them to maintain spatial information and output pixel-wise classifications. FCNs often employ skip connections between encoder and decoder layers to preserve fine-grained details.
