## 2. 核心概念与关系

### 2.1. Elasticsearch架构

Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real-time. It is generally used as the underlying engine/technology that powers applications that have complex search features and requirements.

#### 2.1.1. Cluster

A cluster consists of one or more nodes that have been configured to work together. You can use clusters to centralize all of your organization's data and make it easily accessible to your users. A cluster is identified by a unique name which is set in the config file using the `cluster.name` setting.

#### 2.1.2. Node

A node is a single server that is part of a cluster. Each node is assigned a unique name. The node name is used to identify the node within the cluster. By default, the node name is generated automatically, but you can also specify a custom name.

#### 2.1.3. Index

An index is a collection of documents that have somewhat similar characteristics. For example, you might have an index for customer records, another index for product records, and yet another index for order records. An index can be thought of as a database in traditional RDBMS systems.

#### 2.1.4. Document

A document is a basic unit of information in Elasticsearch. It is similar to a row in a relational database or a record in a non-relational database. Documents are stored in indices and they are scharded across multiple nodes in a cluster.

#### 2.1.5. Type

Types are deprecated in newer versions of Elasticsearch. In previous versions, types were used to separate documents within an index according to their type. For example, you might have an index for customer records and use types to differentiate between individual customers and businesses.

#### 2.1.6. Shard

Shards allow you to horizontally partition your data and distribute it across multiple nodes. This makes it possible to scale out your search application and improve performance. Every index in Elasticsearch is automatically divided into shards.

#### 2.1.7. Replica

Replicas are copies of shards that provide redundancy and improve search performance. Replicas are not required, but they are recommended for production environments. When you create an index, you can specify how many replicas you want to have for each shard.

### 2.2. Elasticsearch Query DSL

Elasticsearch Query DSL is a powerful and flexible query language that allows you to define complex queries using a JSON-based syntax. It supports a wide range of query types, including full-text search, filtering, sorting, and aggregation.

#### 2.2.1. Full-Text Search

Full-text search allows you to search for words or phrases within the text of a document. Elasticsearch uses an inverted index to enable fast full-text searches.

#### 2.2.2. Filtering

Filtering allows you to select a subset of documents based on specific criteria, such as date ranges, geographic locations, or numeric values. Filters are typically faster than queries because they do not perform full-text analysis.

#### 2.2.3. Sorting

Sorting allows you to order documents based on specific fields, such as date, price, or popularity. You can also sort on calculated fields, such as the average rating of a product.

#### 2.2.4. Aggregation

Aggregation allows you to group documents based on specific fields and calculate statistics, such as the average value, sum, or count. You can also use aggregations to generate histograms, pie charts, and other visualizations.

## 3. 核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学模型公式详细讲解

### 3.1. Inverted Index

An inverted index is a data structure that maps words to documents. It is used to enable fast full-text searches in Elasticsearch. When you index a document, Elasticsearch extracts the words from the text and adds them to the inverted index. Each word is associated with a list of documents that contain that word.

#### 3.1.1. Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens. Elasticsearch uses several tokenizers, including the standard tokenizer, the whitespace tokenizer, and the pattern tokenizer. The standard tokenizer splits text on whitespace and punctuation, while the whitespace tokenizer splits text only on whitespace. The pattern tokenizer allows you to specify a regular expression to split text.

#### 3.1.2. Stop Words

Stop words are common words that are usually removed from the inverted index to reduce its size and improve search performance. Examples of stop words include "the," "a," and "an." Elasticsearch includes a built-in list of stop words, but you can also add custom stop words.

#### 3.1.3. Stemming

Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root form. For example, the words "running," "runs," and "ran" would all be reduced to the root form "run." Elasticsearch includes several stemmers, including the English stemmer, the snowball stemmer, and the KStem stemmer.

#### 3.1.4. Synonyms

Synonyms are words that have similar meanings. Elasticsearch allows you to define synonyms using a synonym token filter. When you index a document, Elasticsearch replaces the original words with their synonyms.

### 3.2. Scoring

Scoring is the process of ranking documents based on their relevance to a search query. Elasticsearch uses a formula called the Practical Scoring Function (TF/IDF) to calculate scores.

#### 3.2.1. Term Frequency (TF)

Term frequency is the number of times a term appears in a document. Terms that appear more frequently in a document are given higher scores.

#### 3.2.2. Document Frequency (DF)

Document frequency is the number of documents in which a term appears. Terms that appear in fewer documents are given higher scores.

#### 3.2.3. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)

Inverse document frequency is the inverse of the document frequency. Terms that appear in fewer documents are given higher IDF scores.

#### 3.2.4. Length Normalization

Length normalization is the process of adjusting scores based on the length of a document. Longer documents are given lower scores to prevent them from dominating search results.

#### 3.2.5. Field-Level Scoring

Field-level scoring allows you to assign different weights to different fields. For example, you might want to give more weight to the title field than the body field in a search query.

### 3.3. Sharding and Replication

Sharding and replication are two techniques that are used to scale out Elasticsearch clusters.

#### 3.3.1. Sharding

Sharding allows you to divide your data into smaller pieces called shards. Each shard is a fully functional and independent index that can be hosted on a separate node. Sharding enables you to distribute your data across multiple nodes, which improves search performance and scalability.

#### 3.3.2. Replication

Replication allows you to create copies of shards called replicas. Replicas provide redundancy and improve search performance. When you create an index, you can specify how many replicas you want to have for each shard.

#### 3.3.3. Primary and Replica Shards

Each shard has a primary role and one or more replica roles. Primary shards handle write operations, while replica shards handle read operations. Replica shards are optional, but they are recommended for production environments.

#### 3.3.4. Allocation and Routing

Allocation and routing are two processes that are used to distribute shards across nodes in a cluster. Allocation is the process of assigning shards to nodes, while routing is the process of determining which node should handle a particular request.

```
4. Check the status of the Elasticsearch service:
```lua
sudo systemctl status elasticsearch
```
5. Enable the Elasticsearch service to start automatically at boot time:
```sql
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
```

#### 4.1.2. Configuring Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch uses a configuration file called `elasticsearch.yml`. The file is located in the `config` directory of the Elasticsearch installation.

Here are some common configuration options:

* `cluster.name`: The name of the cluster.
* `node.name`: The name of the node.
* `path.data`: The path to the data directory.
* `path.logs`: The path to the logs directory.
* `network.host`: The network interface to bind to.
* `http.port`: The HTTP port to listen on.
* `discovery.seed_hosts`: A list of seed hosts to use for discovery.
* `cluster.initial_master_nodes`: A list of master nodes to use for initializing the cluster.

### 4.2. Creating an Index

To create an index in Elasticsearch, you can use the `PUT` API. Here's an example:
```json
PUT /my-index
{
  "settings": {
   "number_of_shards": 3,
   "number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}
```
This creates an index called `my-index` with three primary shards and two replica shards.

### 4.3. Indexing Documents

To index a document in Elasticsearch, you can use the `INDEX` API. Here's an example:
```json
POST /my-index/_doc
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "content": "This is a sample document."
}
```
This indexes a document with a title of "Hello World" and a content of "This is a sample document."

### 4.4. Searching Documents

To search documents in Elasticsearch, you can use the `SEARCH` API. Here's an example:
```json
GET /my-index/_search
{
  "query": {
   "match": {
     "title": "hello"
   }
  }
}
```
This searches for documents with a title containing the word "hello".

### 4.5. Aggregations

Aggregations allow you to group documents based on specific fields and calculate statistics. Here's an example:
```json
GET /my-index/_search
{
  "aggs": {
   "by_author": {
     "terms": {
       "field": "author"
     },
     "aggs": {
       "avg_price": {
         "avg": {
           "field": "price"
         }
       }
     }
   }
  }
}
```
This groups documents by the `author` field and calculates the average price for each author.
