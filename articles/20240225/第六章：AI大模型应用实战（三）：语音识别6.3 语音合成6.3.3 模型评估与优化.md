6.3.1 Background introduction
----------------------------

Speech synthesis has a long history dating back to the early days of computers. Early systems used rule-based methods that relied on expert knowledge to generate speech sounds based on phonetic rules. In the late 1990s, statistical parametric synthesis emerged as an alternative approach, which used machine learning techniques to model the relationship between text and acoustic features. More recently, deep learning approaches have gained popularity due to their superior performance in modeling complex relationships.

6.3.2 Core concepts and connections
--------------------------------

### 6.3.2.1 Text analysis and normalization

Text analysis involves preprocessing the input text to ensure it's in a suitable format for synthesis. Normalization includes removing punctuation marks, converting characters to lowercase, and expanding abbreviations or acronyms. The goal is to convert raw text into a standardized form that can be easily processed by the TTS system.

### 6.3.2.2 Prosody and intonation

Prosody refers to the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech, which convey meaning and emotion beyond the literal words. Intonation patterns can indicate sentence type (e.g., declarative, interrogative) and emphasis. Modeling prosody accurately is essential for natural-sounding speech synthesis.

### 6.3.2.3 Speech units and concatenation

Speech units are basic building blocks for constructing synthetic speech. They can range from individual phonemes to whole words or phrases. Concatenative synthesis combines these units to produce coherent speech. High-quality TTS systems require a large inventory of carefully recorded speech units to ensure smooth transitions and natural sounding output.

### 6.3.2.4 Deep learning approaches

Deep learning has revolutionized speech synthesis by providing more accurate models of the complex relationships between text and acoustic features. Popular architectures include recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformer-based models. These models can learn directly from raw waveforms or spectrogram representations, eliminating the need for traditional signal processing stages.

6.3.3 Core algorithm principles and specific operation steps, along with mathematical models
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section outlines three main approaches to TTS: statistical parametric synthesis, unit selection synthesis, and deep neural network synthesis.

### 6.3.3.1 Statistical parametric synthesis

Statistical parametric synthesis uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) or related techniques to model the probability distribution of acoustic features given input text. The most common acoustic features include fundamental frequency (F0), energy, and spectral coefficients. The output is generated by sampling from this distribution and applying a vocoder to convert the resulting feature vectors into audible sound.

Let $X = {x\_1, x\_2, ..., x\_n}$ represent a sequence of context-dependent spectral coefficients, where $n$ is the number of frames in the utterance. Similarly, let $Y = {y\_1, y\_2, ..., y\_m}$ represent a sequence of F0 values, where $m$ is the number of frames. We can define a joint probability function $P(X, Y | W)$ as follows:

$$
P(X, Y | W) = \prod\_{i=1}^n P(x\_i | x\_{i-1}, y\_{i-1}, w\_i) \cdot P(y\_i | y\_{i-1}, w\_i)
$$

Here, $W = {w\_1, w\_2, ..., w\_k}$ represents a sequence of contextual features derived from the input text. Each $w\_i$ corresponds to a single phone or word, depending on the granularity of the model.

### 6.3.3.2 Unit selection synthesis

Unit selection synthesis involves selecting appropriate speech units from a large database based on target acoustic and linguistic features. This method ensures high-quality speech output but requires substantial storage space and computational resources.

The primary challenge in unit selection synthesis is finding optimal concatenation points that minimize perceptual artifacts such as discontinuities in pitch, energy, and spectral envelope. Dynamic programming algorithms like the Viterbi algorithm can be employed to find the best sequence of units given a set of cost functions.

### 6.3.3.3 Deep neural network synthesis

Deep neural network synthesis uses deep learning models to predict acoustic features directly from input text. These models can be trained end-to-end, enabling efficient optimization and generalization across various domains. Common architectures include Tacotron 2, WaveNet, and WaveGlow.

Tacotron 2 is an example of a popular deep learning-based TTS architecture that consists of an encoder-decoder structure with attention mechanisms. The encoder processes the input text and generates a sequence of hidden states, while the decoder generates a sequence of spectrogram frames conditioned on the encoded representation. Attention mechanisms help align the input text with the generated spectrogram frames, allowing for robust modeling of long sequences.

### 6.3.4.1 Building a simple unit selection synthesizer using Festvox

Festvox is a powerful open-source toolkit for building text-to-speech systems based on unit selection synthesis. It includes tools for recording and labeling speech data, as well as algorithms for concatenating units and generating synthetic speech.

To build a simple unit selection synthesizer using Festvox, follow these steps:

1. Record a corpus of speech data consisting of multiple sentences spoken by a single speaker.
2. Label the speech data with phones, stress marks, and other relevant information.
3. Use the `make_units` script to extract speech units from the labeled data.
4. Use the `cluster_units` script to cluster similar units together based on acoustic features.
5. Use the `unit_selection` script to search for optimal unit sequences given a set of target acoustic and linguistic features.
6. Generate synthetic speech by concatenating the selected units and applying a vocoder.

For more details on using Festvox, refer to its official documentation and tutorials.

### 6.3.4.2 Implementing a deep learning-based TTS model using TensorFlow

TensorFlow provides a flexible platform for building deep learning-based TTS systems. Here's an outline of how to implement a simple Tacotron 2 model using TensorFlow:

1. Preprocess the input text by converting it into token embeddings.
2. Define the encoder network, which typically consists of convolutional layers followed by bidirectional recurrent layers.
3. Define the decoder network, which typically consists of unidirectional recurrent layers with attention mechanisms.
4. Connect the encoder and decoder networks through a linear projection layer and a softmax activation function.
5. Train the model using a dataset of paired text and audio samples.
6. Evaluate the model on held-out test data and optimize hyperparameters as needed.
7. Generate synthetic speech by passing new text inputs through the trained model and converting the resulting spectrogram frames into waveforms using a vocoder.

Refer to TensorFlow's official documentation and tutorials for more details on implementing deep learning-based TTS models.
