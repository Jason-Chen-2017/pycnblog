## 1.什么是Apache License?
Apache Software Foundation (ASF) 是Apache许可证的正式拥有者之一，它为了推动开源软件的发展而创立。Apache许可证是一个著名的开放源代码授权协议，由软件开发商和用户共同签署。目前Apache许可证有5种版本，它们各自适用于不同的软件领域。Apache许可证为开放源代码、免费提供软件、参与社区建设、维护等提供了许可证条款，帮助用户在法律框架内合法地使用、修改、共享和分发该软件。
## 2.为什么要使用Apache License？
开源软件的使用者一般都希望其能够持续获得更新支持或者至少具备良好的可用性和稳定性。而Apache许可证则为此提供了一种保证。通过对源码进行自由共享，让其他开发者可以利用这些代码，并快速修复bug或添加新功能，从而使得开源软件更加健康、成长和成功。同时，Apache许可证还为软件作者提供了一个贡献者协议，鼓励他们贡献自己的力量，提升开源软件的质量。
## 3.Apache License的版本及其关系
Apache Software Foundation (ASF) 在设计 Apache License 时就注意到了不同开发者的需求和诉求，因此制定了五个版本的许可证，分别对应着五种类型的开源软件。每个版本的许可证都会规定相关条款，根据这些条款所允许的范围，作者可以自由地选择符合自己要求的版权方式和发布的方式。由于许可证并不是一成不变的，所以不同版本的许可证之间也存在一些差异，例如，版本2.0比之前的版本多出了几个条件。虽然Apache许可证版本之间的差异较大，但如果遵守最新的Apache许可证版本即可，因为它确保了开源软件的完整性、可维护性和社区参与度。
# 2.Apache License v2.0
## 1.概览
Apache License Version 2.0是最新版本的Apache许可证，也是最受欢迎的开源软件许可证。它具有以下几点优势：

1. 它被认可为自由软件基金会（Free Software Foundation）的官方许可证，并且得到了广泛的认可。
2. 它兼容于BSD和MIT许可证，因此可以在开源和闭源软件许可证之间切换。
3. 它对商业使用友好，允许任何人免费使用、修改和分发该软件，无论个人还是商业用途。
4. 它包括了很多额外的条款和条件，可以使开源软件的授权更加精细化，更易于理解。
5. 它的名称（Apache License）表示该许可证旨在保护开源软件，而不是任何特定软件。

#### x) "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
### b) Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
### c) Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
### d) Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
#### i) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
#### ii) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
#### iii) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
#### iv) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the DerivativeWorks, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
#### v) You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
### e) Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
### f) Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
### g) Disclaimer of Warranty.

### i) Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
## 3.附录常见问题与解答
### Q：我可以把我的项目用Apache License吗？
A：Apache License是一个开放源代码许可协议。你可以把你的项目用Apache License发布到Github上、码云或其他类似的代码托管平台上。如果你已经在使用GitHub、码云，只需要按照相应平台的指示设置LICENSE文件，然后上传你的项目源码即可，这些平台将自动识别并展示Apache License。

GitHub的指示地址为：[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)。

码云的指示地址为：[http://git.mydoc.io/?t=267654](http://git.mydoc.io/?t=267654)。

当然，你也可以把你的项目作为单独的项目托管在Apache服务器上，这样就可以使用Apache License。
