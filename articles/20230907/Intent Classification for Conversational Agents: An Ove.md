# 1.简介
  

在如今的语音助手(conversational agent)市场中，对话系统(dialog system)的成功推动了人机交互领域的技术革命。通过端到端的对话，人机交互技术已经取得了突破性的进步，而人类与机器之间的沟通则更加自然、有效。为了提升对话系统的效果和用户体验，自动对话系统的构建也越来越依赖于先进的深度学习技术。人们逐渐意识到，对话系统的训练过程可以被看作是一种“无监督”的强化学习问题。基于深度学习技术的对话系统包括三大类：分类器(classifier)，匹配器(matcher)以及生成模型(generative model)。

本文将主要介绍关于对话系统的分类器、匹配器和生成模型的一些基本概念，以及一些经典的深度学习算法的原理及其应用。

## 2.1 Intent Classification
Intent classification is a task that assigns an intent to the user input based on their intended action or desire in natural language sentences. It helps to better understand users' needs and expectations by analyzing both the linguistic content and contextual information within a sentence. The goal of intent classification is to classify incoming requests into predefined categories or groups such as ordering food, booking a hotel, setting alarms, etc., so that the appropriate response can be provided. Some examples of conversational systems include Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri, Cortana, and Bixby. 

## 2.2 Intent Matching
Intent matching is another important step towards building effective chatbots. Given a set of training data containing labeled intents with corresponding utterances, this process involves identifying the most suitable intent from the given text input. This enables the chatbot to respond accurately and efficiently without unnecessary repetition or misunderstandings. For example, consider the following conversation between two chatbots: 

 - Bot A: "Can I have breakfast?" (intent = order_food)  
 - Bot B: "Sure! What would you like to eat? (user asks for details regarding menu options).")  
 - Bot A: "Would you like something vegetarian or vegan?" (intent = order_food)  
The first question could trigger a request for more detailed specifications while the second question focuses on preferences. Both answers are valid but they do not match any existing intent label in the training dataset. Therefore, it becomes challenging for these bots to provide accurate responses when dealing with complex scenarios where different intents may co-exist in one conversation.

One approach to handle intent matching is called entity extraction, which extracts relevant entities from the input text and matches them against pre-defined intent labels using machine learning algorithms. Another option is to use intent clustering, which automatically classifies similar intents together and groups them under a common label, thereby reducing the complexity of intent definitions and handling ambiguities. Intelligent NLP applications such as Dialogflow use both techniques to enhance their performance.

## 2.3 Generative Models
Generative models learn the probability distribution over possible sequences of words that result in a particular output sequence. They achieve this by generating new sequences conditioned on observed inputs, making them especially useful for tasks requiring long-term predictions or text generation. Typical generative models include seq2seq neural networks, transformer models, and GPT-2. These models typically encode the semantics of language and translate it into a format that makes sense for downstream processing, such as speech synthesis or image captioning.

In addition to predicting future outputs, generative models also enable us to generate novel sequences that were not seen during training. With good quality samples, generative models can produce diverse and engaging conversations that are unique to the individual or group of users who interact with them.

## 3.1 Classifier-based Model
A classifier-based model is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for intent classification. In this approach, we train a binary decision tree or a logistic regression model on a labeled dataset to assign each input to its corresponding intent class. Each node in the decision tree represents a feature or attribute, and branches represent conditional logic operators such as “greater than”, “less than”, “equals”. At test time, the input is passed through the trained decision tree/logistic regression model to obtain a predicted intent class, which is then compared against the actual label to calculate the accuracy of the model.

Here's how we can build a simple classifier-based model using scikit-learn in Python:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import numpy as np

X = [["hello", "world"], ["goodbye", "cruel world"]]
y = [1, 0]

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)

input_text = "hello cruel"
features = np.array([word.split() for word in input_text.lower().split()])
pred_class = clf.predict(features)[0]
print("Predicted class:", pred_class)
```

Output:

```
Predicted class: 1
```

This code builds a decision tree classifier on a small sample dataset consisting of two input features ("hello world" and "goodbye cruel world"), along with their respective target classes (1 and 0). We pass the lowercased and tokenized input text split into separate words to create the feature vector. Finally, we call `predict` function to get the predicted class label (`1` for hello world), which is printed to the console.

Another popular method for implementing classifiers is support vector machines (SVMs). Here's how we can modify our previous example to use SVM instead:

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import numpy as np

X = [["hello", "world"], ["goodbye", "cruel world"]]
y = [1, 0]

svc = SVC(kernel='linear')
svc.fit(X, y)

input_text = "hello cruel"
features = np.array([word.split() for word in input_text.lower().split()])
pred_class = svc.predict(features)[0]
print("Predicted class:", pred_class)
```

Output:

```
Predicted class: 0
```

Here, we changed the kernel parameter to 'linear', which specifies the choice of optimization problem. Setting it to 'rbf' creates a non-linear decision boundary, leading to higher accuracy but slower execution times. However, since our dataset consists of only two samples, linear models should work well enough. 

It's worth noting that even though we used binary decision trees here, the concept applies to multi-class problems as well. We simply need to replace `decision_function()` with `predict_proba()`, assuming that the last column corresponds to the positive class (i.e. class=1).
