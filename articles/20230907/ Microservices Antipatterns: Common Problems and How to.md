# 1.简介
  

Microservice architecture is one of the most popular architectural patterns for building large scale enterprise applications. However, as with any other architectural pattern, it also has its own set of anti-patterns that can lead to various issues while developing microservices based systems. In this article, we will discuss some common anti-patterns and their symptoms in microservices system development, along with effective solutions and best practices to avoid these problems. 

This document focuses on identifying the existing microservices anti-patterns, defining them clearly and providing a detailed analysis of their root causes and implications. We hope by understanding these patterns and how they affect our microservices systems, we can develop more robust and reliable software that is easier to maintain over time.

# 2.背景介绍
Microservice architecture has emerged as an industry standard design approach to building scalable and complex software systems. A microservice-based application consists of multiple small, independent services that communicate with each other using lightweight protocols such as HTTP or gRPC. These services are highly decoupled from each other and can be deployed independently across different environments without causing disruptions. This allows developers to work on specific components of the system without worrying about interfering with others.

However, despite its advantages, microservices have also faced several challenges during the development process. Asynchronous communication between services creates new issues like eventual consistency, which means that data may not always be consistent at all times. Long running transactions require careful consideration of timeouts, retries, and compensation mechanisms to ensure that changes are applied reliably. Overloading a single service with too many requests can cause performance issues, especially when coupled with a slow database query. Together, these factors make microservices architectures challenging to manage, debug, and evolve.

To mitigate these issues, several techniques have been proposed to enforce good separation of concerns within a microservices architecture. Some of the key techniques include horizontal scaling, circuit breaking, and message queueing. However, none of these techniques are perfect and there are still many potential pitfalls lurking around the edges of a microservices environment.

In order to prevent these issues and establish better coding standards, frameworks, and toolchains, companies need to invest in training, documentation, and quality assurance teams. By adhering to strict guidelines and promoting best practice principles, organizations can create high-quality microservices systems that can handle vast amounts of traffic and provide continuous value to customers. Therefore, microservices technology has become increasingly important and essential for modern cloud computing infrastructure.

# 3.核心概念术语说明
## 服务（Service）
A service refers to a collection of code that performs a particular task or provides a certain feature. Services typically communicate with each other through well defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Each service runs in its own container or virtual machine and only knows about the services it needs to interact with via those APIs. Services can range from simple CRUD operations to complex business logic calculations.

## API Gateway
An API gateway is responsible for receiving incoming client requests and routing them to the appropriate backend services. It aggregates responses from the backend services and returns them to the clients in a uniform format. An API gateway can improve the overall performance of your microservices architecture by caching frequently used responses, offloading authentication and authorization tasks, and enforcing rate limiting policies.

## 数据一致性（Eventual Consistency）
Eventual consistency means that replicas of data will eventually converge but it may take some time depending on network latency and node failures. This makes it difficult to guarantee strong consistency guarantees because the replica of data may change before the transaction is committed. Eventual consistency works well for write-heavy scenarios where availability is preferred over consistency. For read-heavy scenarios, eventual consistency can result in inconsistent results being returned due to replication lag.

## 分布式事务（Distributed Transactions）
A distributed transaction refers to a series of atomic actions performed by two or more different database managers participating simultaneously in a coordinated manner. In contrast to local transactions, which occur inside a single server or database manager, distributed transactions involve multiple servers and databases involved in performing the same action. Distributed transactions allow for higher levels of concurrency and improved throughput compared to traditional locking schemes.

## 服务熔断（Circuit Breaker Pattern）
The circuit breaker pattern suggests that instead of attempting to execute a failing operation repeatedly, you should stop sending requests to a failing resource and return an error message immediately. You can then use a back-off strategy to gradually increase the number of attempts made until the original request succeeds again. Circuit breakers help prevent cascading failure and increase fault tolerance in distributed systems.

## 请求重试（Retry Pattern）
When a request fails due to a temporary error, retrying the request can often resolve the issue. If the problem persists, however, adding additional delay or complexity to the request can also help. Additionally, if you are making parallel requests to the same endpoint, it's possible that not every request will succeed, so you might want to combine the successful responses into a single response object.

## 服务间通讯（RPC Communication）
Remote procedure call (RPC) communication involves transmitting messages between microservices over TCP/IP networks. RPC uses remote method invocation (RMI), which enables a caller to invoke a method on a remote object located in another address space. RMI requires serializing arguments and results, creating overhead both in terms of CPU usage and bandwidth consumption. Alternatively, RESTful web services can simplify interaction between microservices and eliminate the overhead associated with RPC.

## 服务注册与发现（Service Registry and Discovery）
A service registry keeps track of all available instances of a given service and dynamically updates this information whenever a service instance joins or leaves the cluster. Service discovery allows clients to locate the IP addresses and ports of required services, reducing manual configuration errors and improving system reliability. There are several open source service registries and discovery tools available today, including Netflix Eureka, Hashicorp Consul, Apache Zookeeper, etc.

## 服务网格（Service Mesh）
A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication. It offers features such as load balancing, observability, routing, and security, without requiring any changes to application code. Service meshes work by intercepting network communication between microservices and routing requests to the appropriate destination. They act as a reverse proxy and enhance communication between services by implementing cross-cutting concerns like monitoring, tracing, and access control.

## 消息队列（Message Queue）
A message queue is a buffer that stores messages that are transmitted asynchronously between different microservices. Message queues enable loose coupling between microservices and offer flexibility in processing requirements. Queues commonly implement pull or push paradigms, allowing different consumers to consume messages sequentially or in parallel. Popular message brokers include RabbitMQ, Kafka, Active MQ, AWS SQS, Azure Service Bus, etc.

# 4.主要反模式分析及解决方案

## 第1类：单体应用
Monolithic application refers to an application that contains all the necessary functionality in a single package. It is designed to run in a single VM and handles all the functionalities of the system. When the application grows larger, it becomes harder to manage and maintain the codebase. Single monoliths also suffer from performance limitations due to increased memory usage, long cold starts, and frequent garbage collections.

### 定义
One big advantage of monolithic applications is simplicity of deployment and maintenance. All functionality is packed together in a single package that can easily be deployed onto a server. However, this can quickly become a challenge as the size of the application increases. Large monolithic apps also tend to be tightly coupled, making it hard to apply agile development processes or add new features rapidly.

### 解决方案
To reduce the complexity of managing and maintaining a monolithic app, it is recommended to split it up into smaller services that can be managed individually. By doing so, developers can focus on developing individual modules, easing management and debugging efforts. Services can be hosted separately and communicate with each other using a messaging protocol like AMQP or HTTP. This way, you can deploy each service independently, enabling you to optimize performance and scale horizontally as needed.

Additionally, microservices architectures provide many benefits beyond just splitting a monolithic app. They encourage loose coupling between services, giving you more flexibility in terms of changing requirements. You can also choose to use technologies like containers or serverless functions to further isolate services, simplifying management and cost optimization. Lastly, you can adopt a DevOps culture and automate your release process using CI/CD pipelines. Overall, migrating towards a microservices architecture can significantly reduce complexity, speed up deployments, and improve developer productivity.

## 第2类：共享数据库
Shared database refers to a situation where multiple microservices share the same database schema. This leads to unpredictable behavior and data corruption, leading to instability and downtime in the entire system. Even though shared databases are convenient for prototyping and quick startups, they introduce significant risks and maintenance costs.

### 定义
Sharing a single database between multiple microservices introduces risk of data inconsistency and race conditions. Whenever a user writes data to the database directly, he expects that data to stay consistent throughout the system. However, when multiple actors modify the same records concurrently, conflicts arise and can damage the integrity of the data. Additionally, sharing a database can become expensive as the number of microservices grows, leading to excessive resource utilization and slow queries.

### 解决方案
It is crucial to carefully consider how to divide the system’s responsibilities between microservices and decide whether to use separate databases per microservice or rely on shared databases. Here are some recommendations on how to approach this decision:

1. Use separate databases: Microservices that belong to the same logical group, such as related modules or products, should be assigned to a separate database. This reduces the likelihood of collisions and improves data isolation.
2. Use shared databases: If microservices do not belong to the same logical group, they can share a single database. In this case, it’s important to follow best practices for database design, such as normalization and indexing. Also, proper use of transactions and versioning control can minimize race conditions and unintended consequences.

Lastly, pay attention to security measures implemented by your database, such as firewall rules and encryption methods. Regularly monitor database activity, analyze logs, and identify any suspicious activities or attacks.

## 第3类：异步通信
Asynchronous communication refers to a situation where microservices exchange messages asynchronously rather than synchronously, meaning that the sender doesn't wait for the receiver to respond before continuing execution. This can cause unexpected behaviors and inconsistencies in the system.

### 定义
Synchronous communication assumes that the sender waits for a response from the receiver before continuing execution. Under asynchronous communication, a sender sends a message and doesn’t expect a response. Instead, the sender continues executing without waiting for a reply, allowing the recipient to perform some other task while waiting. Asynchronous communication tends to be faster and less prone to failure, but it can also be more complicated to implement and troubleshoot.

### 解决方案
In order to achieve the highest level of consistency and correctness in your microservices system, you should use asynchronous communication as much as possible. One way to do this is to use message queues to store messages sent between microservices. Messages placed in the queue can later be retrieved and processed by any interested microservice. Message queuing ensures that messages are delivered reliably, even in the face of failures and outages. Furthermore, you can leverage message correlation IDs to trace messages across services and support end-to-end visibility and audit trails.

Other strategies you can employ to improve asynchronous communication include leveraging messaging patterns like publish/subscribe, request/response, and command/query. Publish/subscribe allows subscribers to receive copies of messages published by publishers. Request/response allows clients to send requests to services and await a response, thus allowing for simpler integration and reduced coupling. Finally, command/query separates commands from queries and provides a clear distinction between inputs and outputs of your system.

## 第4类：长事务
Long-running transactions refer to situations where a transaction lasts longer than a predefined timeout period, forcing the client to either abort the transaction or wait for a response. Long transactions impact system performance, stability, and usability, leading to frustration among users and causing delays and inconvenience.

### 定义
Long-running transactions are typically caused by programming mistakes or poorly optimized queries, resulting in locks or blocking. While they can happen sporadically, under normal circumstances, long transactions can cause serious performance issues. Users who experience delays or hangs can give up waiting, leading to lost revenue and customer satisfaction loss.

### 解决方案
To avoid long transactions, you can use techniques like optimistic synchronization and asynchronous processing. Optimistic synchronization allows the client to assume that the transaction completes successfully and avoids blocking or deadlocks by checking the status of resources after acquiring locks. Asynchronous processing breaks down long transactions into smaller chunks and processes them independently, allowing the client to continue working while waiting for the response.

Besides reducing the duration of long transactions, you can also consider implementing timeouts and fallback strategies. Timeouts can be triggered by the client if a transaction takes too long to complete, effectively terminating the connection. Fallback strategies can be configured by the client to automatically retry failed transactions or revert to earlier versions of data.

Additionally, you should regularly review your microservices architecture and update it according to best practices, such as minimizing dependencies between microservices, ensuring fault tolerance, and minimizing cross-microservice communication. Experimentation and learning by doing are critical parts of software engineering, and addressing microservices anti-patterns early can save significant time and effort in the future.
