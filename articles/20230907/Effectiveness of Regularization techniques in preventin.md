Overfitting is the problem that occurs when a machine learning model becomes too complex and starts to memorize specific training examples instead of generalizing well on new data. This can happen due to having too many features or too few samples for the given complexity level of the model. 

Regularization is an optimization technique used to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function of the model during training. It forces the weights of the model to be smaller, which means it cannot fit all the noise in the training dataset perfectly but will still learn the underlying patterns effectively. Different types of regularization techniques exist such as Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and Dropout. In this blog post we will explore different regularization techniques and their effectiveness in preventing overfitting in deep neural networks (DNNs). We also provide code implementation and step-by-step explanations for each algorithm.

The DNN architecture consists of several layers with different number of neurons and activation functions. The goal is to minimize the cost function that measures how closely the predicted output matches the actual labels. During the training process, the network adjusts its parameters to minimize the cost. However, if the model becomes too complex and starts to memorize specific training examples rather than generalizing well, then it might end up overfitting to the training set. To avoid overfitting, we need to use regularization techniques that penalize large weights. Regularization techniques can help decrease the complexity of the model, allowing it to generalize better to unseen data. These techniques include Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and Dropout.


In summary, regularization techniques are important tools for reducing the risk of overfitting in DNNs while ensuring they generalize well to unseen data. Using these methods can improve the accuracy and efficiency of our models at the same time. Therefore, effective application of regularization techniques can lead to improved performance, faster training times, and reduced memory usage. By using regularization techniques, we can build more accurate and reliable machine learning models that can make real-world predictions.


# 2. Concepts & Terms
## 2.1 Regularization Techniques
### 2.1.1 Introduction
Regularization refers to adding a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting. Penalty terms discourage the model from being too complex and allow it to focus on fitting the training data accurately. There are several common regularization techniques:
* **Lasso regression**: Adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients in order to shrink some of them to zero. The method encourages sparsity in the learned weights so that only a small subset of them contribute significantly to the prediction.
* **Ridge regression**: Adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, which promotes smoothness of the learned function.
* **Elastic net**: Combines both Lasso and Ridge regression by taking a weighted sum of both penalty terms.
* **Dropout**: Randomly drops out some neurons during training, forcing the model to learn more robust representations of the input data without relying heavily on any single feature.

These techniques can be applied to linear models and neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Additionally, there are other variations of regularization techniques, such as max norm constraint, and group lasso regularization, which are less commonly used.

### 2.1.2 Understanding Regularization Loss Function
The key idea behind regularization is to add a penalty term to the objective function that determines how much weight should be assigned to each parameter of the model. A natural choice for this penalty term is the L2-norm of the weight vector $\theta$, i.e., $||\theta||_2$. If we want to minimize this regularized loss function, we could take the derivative with respect to each component of $\theta$ and equate it to zero to obtain a stationary point. However, this approach may not always work since some components may depend on others and we would need to eliminate dependencies before solving for a stationary point.

To address this issue, we can modify the gradient descent update rule to add the penalty term $\lambda ||\theta||_2^2$ to the original cost function, where $\lambda$ is the hyperparameter controlling the strength of the penalty term. As $\lambda \rightarrow 0$, the regularization term dominates the original cost and makes the overall objective function steeper, leading to better generalization ability. Conversely, as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, the regularization term becomes irrelevant and the solution approaches the true minimizer. This is known as the tradeoff between the two objectives - the error on the training set and the error on the test set.

We can see that the regularization term adds a penalty term to the cost function that encourages the weights to be sparse. Sparsity leads to better interpretability of the learned function because it highlights which features are most relevant to the outcome variable. Moreover, this kind of regularization helps avoid overfitting by disregarding weak predictors and focusing on strong ones. On the other hand, it has a significant impact on the speed of convergence because it reduces the amount of variance in the weights and thus accelerates the rate of learning progress.

### 2.1.3 Regularization Methods for Neural Networks
#### 2.1.3.1 Lasso Regression
The Lasso regression method is based on the L1-norm of the weight vector and aims to find a sparse set of non-zero coefficients in the learned function. Mathematically, the Lasso regression loss function is defined as follows:

$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n L(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}) + \lambda ||\theta||_1,$$

where $h_{\theta}$ is the hypothesis function that maps input values x into outputs, $\theta$ is the vector of weights, n is the sample size, $L$ is the loss function that measures the difference between the predicted and observed values y, and $\lambda$ is a regularization hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between fitting the training data well and maintaining a sparse solution. The Lasso regression method involves setting a threshold value below which the absolute value of the coefficient is considered zero, effectively discarding the corresponding feature. Since the Lasso penalty encourages sparsity, we expect fewer features to have non-zero weights, resulting in a compressed representation of the model.

#### 2.1.3.2 Ridge Regression
The ridge regression method is similar to Lasso regression but uses the L2-norm of the weight vector instead. Its loss function is defined as:

$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n L(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}) + \lambda ||\theta||_2^2.$$

Like the Lasso method, the ridge regression method applies a penalty term to the cost function to shrink the magnitude of the weights towards zero. However, unlike the Lasso method, the penalty term is quadratic, so larger weights are shrunk more aggressively than smaller weights. This means that the ridge regression method puts greater emphasis on smoothing out the learned function than on compressing the model. Despite its advantageous properties, the ridge regression method tends to underperform compared to the Lasso method.

#### 2.1.3.3 Elastic Net
The elastic net method combines the effects of the Lasso and ridge regression methods by combining the L1- and L2-norm penalties. It takes a combination of both penalty terms, controlled by the hyperparameter $\alpha$, as follows:

$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n L(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}) + (\alpha/2)(||\theta||_1+\beta(||\theta||_2)^2)$$

Here, $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter that balances the relative importance of the L1 and L2 penalties, and $\beta$ is another hyperparameter that controls the degree of smoothing versus the shrinkage. The elastic net method offers a balance between simplicity and robustness, suitable for handling datasets with moderate to high levels of missing values and heteroscedasticity.

#### 2.1.3.4 Dropout
The dropout method randomly drops out some neurons during training to force the model to learn more robust representations of the input data without relying heavily on any single feature. At each iteration of training, each neuron is either kept active with probability p or dropped out with probability 1−p. After dropping out some neurons, the remaining inputs are multiplied by a mask that assigns each inactive neuron a fixed value. This way, the model learns more abstract features that are more likely to be useful regardless of the presence of individual features. While this approach works well for CNNs and RNNs, it does not apply directly to traditional feedforward neural networks, which suffer from vanishing gradients caused by the activation function. Consequently, other regularization techniques like L2 and L1 normalization are typically used to mitigate the issue of vanishing gradients.

#### 2.1.3.5 Other Variants of Regularization Techniques
Other variants of regularization techniques such as max norm constraint and group lasso regularization can also be employed in conjunction with standard regularization techniques to further control the complexity of the learned function. Max norm constraint limits the length of the weight vectors, preventing them from growing too large, which can be beneficial for stability and numerical instability. Group lasso regularization imposes a penalty on the squared norm of the groups of weights associated with the same feature, which can encourage sparsity within related subsets of the weights.
