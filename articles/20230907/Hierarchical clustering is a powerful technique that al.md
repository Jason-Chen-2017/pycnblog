hierarchical clustering (HC) is a widely used data mining method for grouping objects or instances in such a way as to minimize within-cluster variance and maximize between-cluster similarity. HC belongs to a class of cluster analysis algorithms where each object or instance is assigned to its own cluster initially. Then, pairs of clusters are merged using some linkage criterion, such as maximum distance between members or minimum number of dissimilar elements, depending on the specific algorithm being used. The process continues recursively until there is only one large cluster containing all objects. In general, HC has been shown to be effective at discovering complex patterns among multidimensional data sets, but it may not perform well if the relationships among objects do not conform to an underlying hierarchy. For example, when dealing with biological systems, different species or strains should form separate groups even though they share common features due to their genetic makeup. On the other hand, HC may fail to identify multiple coherent clusters if they overlap heavily, making them difficult to interpret. Thus, more sophisticated methods are required for dealing with overlapping clusters, such as mixture modeling, which takes into account the degree of membership of each object to multiple clusters.

agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) is a type of HC that starts with each object or instance in its own cluster. Pairs of clusters are then merged iteratively using a linkage criterion such as single, complete, average, or centroid linkage. AHC produces a dendrogram showing how the original set of observations was clustered. By cutting the dendrogram at various levels, the resulting clusters can be interpreted differently according to the desired level of granularity. 

In order to determine the optimal number of clusters, we usually use either elbow method or gap statistic. However, these techniques require the existence of pre-defined number of clusters or well-specified parameters. Alternatively, we could also use information criterion such as Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which assigns a penalty proportional to the likelihood of observing the given data set under a specified model and its hyperparameters. BIC selects the value of k that minimizes the penalty. Although BIC is often considered more reliable than elbow method and gap statistic, it requires knowledge about the distribution of data points beforehand, which can be challenging for high-dimensional data. Therefore, a combination of both approaches could potentially result in better performance.

To address the issue of overlapping clusters in HC, AHC provides several strategies for combining clusters, including single-linkage clustering, complete-linkage clustering, and centroid-linkage clustering. Single-linkage clustering merges two clusters only if the pair of clusters have the smallest distance between any two members. Complete-linkage clustering merges two clusters only if the pair of clusters have the largest distance between any two members. Centroid-linkage clustering uses the center point of each cluster as the representative point of the new cluster, effectively producing compact clusters centered around each observation. Other types of linkage criteria include weighted and median linkage, which assign weights or medians to individual variables instead of distances.

Despite its effectiveness, AHC has limitations compared to traditional HC, particularly when dealing with highly overlapping clusters or noise. Firstly, AHC does not guarantee a globally optimal solution, since the choice of merging rules can significantly affect the final partition. Secondly, although AHC handles overlapping clusters gracefully by allowing certain mergers, some members will still belong to multiple clusters after the algorithm terminates. Thirdly, AHC assumes that the relationship between objects is monotonic, i.e., increasing values of one variable necessarily imply higher values of another variable. However, many real world datasets exhibit non-monotonic relationships, such as heights versus incomes or net worth versus stock prices. In addition, AHC treats all missing values equally, without considering the possibility of different imputation procedures for different variables. To overcome these challenges, more advanced algorithms are required, such as mixtures of probabilistic models or latent class models.
