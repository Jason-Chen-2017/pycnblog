# 1.简介
  

随着量子计算技术的快速发展，研究人员们发现用数字电路模拟量子系统带来的巨大便利。但同时也有越来越多的人对这种模拟方法存在疑问、困惑，特别是对于初级用户而言，如何从零到一地掌握其精髓，又或者理解与控制这样一种近乎神秘的物理现象之间的关联关系。

作为一个经验丰富的量子信息科学家，我会试图通过自己的经验和见解，帮助那些刚刚入门的新手学习掌握基于QuTiP库进行量子计算机模拟的方法，并能够将这些知识与纳米学位课程结合起来。本文就是希望用通俗易懂的语言阐述这种模拟方法的核心概念，提供给初级用户一个较好的入门教程。

# 2.1 Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1.1 Quantum Gates
Quantum computing is all about manipulating quantum states, which are described by complex vectors in a high-dimensional Hilbert space known as the qubit. These states can be manipulated using operators called gates or quantum logic elements. There are two types of quantum gates:

1. Unitary Gates - these operate on a single qubit and have a fixed effect on its state. They are represented by matrices that transform the input state into an output state according to some rules.
2. Non-unitary Gates - these act on multiple qubits at once and may not necessarily preserve their overall phase. Some examples include entanglement swaps and quantum teleportation.

The basic unitary gate set used for quantum circuits consists of three kinds of gates:

1. Pauli Gates - these represent simple transformations such as rotation around the X, Y, and Z axes.
2. Clifford Gates - these represent compound operations that can be achieved by applying sequences of single-qubit Pauli gates. They provide a convenient tool for implementing more complex algorithms.
3. Standard Gates - they are typically built from elementary rotations, but also involve additional degrees of freedom such as beamsplitters and crosskicks.

## 2.1.2 Quantum Circuit Model
A quantum circuit model is a way of representing a computation process using quantum gates and registers. It consists of several layers of quantum gates applied to different subsets of qubits. The goal of any circuit model is to produce an output state that is highly probable for certain inputs.

To simulate this computational process, we use numerical methods to calculate the action of each gate on the system’s quantum state. This involves finding the matrix representation of the gate and then multiplying it with the current state vector. In general, calculating the exact quantum state is impossible because the dimensionality of the Hilbert space is exponential with the number of qubits. Therefore, approximate methods must be used instead.

In QuTiP, we can define a quantum circuit using the Qobj class. We begin by creating a Qobj object for our input state, which will serve as the initial state of our simulation. Then we add one or more gate objects to create a quantum circuit that represents the desired computation process. Finally, we call the mesolve function to run the simulation.

We can visualize the results of the simulation by plotting them graphically. For example, if we want to plot the amplitude of the |0> state against time during a Bell state entanglement protocol, we can do the following:

```python
import numpy as np
from qutip import *

def bell_state(N):
    psi = tensor([basis(2), basis(2)]) / np.sqrt(2)

    # Entangle first half of the qubits
    for i in range(N//2):
        psi = ket2dm(psi) * (tensor([sigmaz(), sigmax()]) + tensor([sigmay(), sigmax()])) * ket2dm(psi)
        
    return psi
    
N = 4
psi0 = bell_state(N).full()[:,0]

tlist = np.linspace(0, 1e-7, num=1000)
H = [tensor([sigmaz()] * N)]
rho0 = ket2dm(Qobj(psi0)).full().T[0]
result = mesolve(H, rho0, tlist)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(tlist, result.expect[0])
ax.set_xlabel('Time')
ax.set_ylabel('<Z>')
plt.show()
```

This code produces a plot showing how the probability of measuring the |0> state evolves over time during the evolution of a Bell state between four qubits. Note that we convert the full density matrix back to the pure state before plotting, since only the diagonal entries give us information about the probability of measuring the individual states.
