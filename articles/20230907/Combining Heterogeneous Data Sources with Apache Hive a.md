# 1.简介
  

Apache Hive is a popular data warehouse system that enables users to execute complex queries on large datasets stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It allows users to query structured and semi-structured data from different sources using SQL language. Apache Impala is an alternative SQL engine that can also be used for querying Hadoop clusters without requiring any code changes. However, it does not support reading data from heterogeneous sources like MySQL or PostgreSQL databases.

In this article we will discuss how we can combine heterogeneous data sources like MySQL and PostgreSQL with Apache Hive and Impala to achieve better results in our analysis tasks. We will use examples of fetching data from multiple sources such as CSV files and XML files stored in the distributed file system HDFS, extract relevant information, transform them into desired format using MapReduce jobs, load the transformed data back into the database table, and then perform various types of aggregations and calculations on the newly loaded data set. Finally, we will compare performance between the two engines - Hive and Impala - when compared to traditional single source querying techniques. 

By following along with this example tutorial, you should get a good understanding of combining heterogeneous data sources with Apache Hive and Impala and learn how to optimize performance and choose appropriate tools depending on your specific requirements. 

This blog post assumes some familiarity with Apache Hive and Impala concepts, including tables, partitions, views, storage formats, etc., as well as basic knowledge about Hadoop ecosystem and MapReduce programming model. 

# 2.基本概念和术语
Before proceeding further let us first define some key terms and concepts:

1. **Hadoop**: The open-source framework for storing and processing big data sets that provides low latency access to massive amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data through its distributed computing abilities. 

2. **HDFS**: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file system designed to scale up to very large data sets by distributing data across multiple nodes in a cluster. It provides high availability by replicating each block of data on multiple nodes throughout the cluster. HDFS uses block transfers to ensure efficient transfer of data between nodes.

3. **Hive**: Apache Hive is a data warehouse software that runs on top of Hadoop that provides an SQL interface for performing complex queries on large datasets. It stores metadata about the structure of the dataset in a separate schema called “tables” and manages data based on these schemas. Hive uses optimized algorithms to handle complex queries and offers extensive support for creating indexes, partitioning, and caching.

4. **Impala**: Apache Impala is another SQL engine built on top of Hadoop that provides fast, interactive queries over large datasets stored in HDFS. It supports standard SQL syntax and works seamlessly with HDFS while providing enhanced performance features like automatic optimization, pipelining, and vectorization. Impala does not provide direct integration with external data sources like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Instead, it relies upon custom ETL scripts written in Java or Python to move data from non-HDFS sources to HDFS before running queries.

5. **Pig**: Pig is a high-level platform that simplifies writing data processing scripts for Hadoop. It provides several built-in functions for working with both structured and semi-structured data. In contrast to Hive and Impala, which are dedicated platforms, Pig was originally developed as part of Hadoop. However, since its release, it has been deprecated in favor of HiveQL.

6. **SQL**: Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized language used for managing relational databases. Its most common usage is to retrieve and manipulate data from a database server using declarative statements rather than procedural programs. There are many implementations of SQL, including Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.

7. **MapReduce**: A programming model for parallel processing of large datasets that operates over HDFS. It consists of two parts - Map phase where intermediate data is generated and reduced phase where final output is computed. This architecture helps break down the computation task into smaller pieces and distribute them among available resources efficiently.

8. **Table**: A collection of related rows and columns organized under a name that contains metadata about the structure of the data. Each table must have at least one column and may contain additional ones.

9. **Partition**: A logical subdivision of a table’s rows based on a certain criteria, typically by date or other value(s). Partitions allow faster retrieval of data by enabling range scans instead of full table scans.

10. **View**: A virtual representation of a table's contents created by defining a SELECT statement that references one or more existing tables. Views offer convenient ways to present complex data structures and hide complexity from end-users.

11. **Storage Format**: Storage formats refer to the physical layout of data on disk and represent the way data is encoded so that it can be easily read and understood by downstream applications. Common storage formats include textual (CSV), binary (Avro), compressed (snappy), etc.

Now that we have defined all the necessary terms and concepts, let us proceed to understand how we can integrate heterogeneous data sources within Apache Hive and Impala.
