Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of any software application. They provide efficient access to data, support various operations such as insertion, deletion, search, sorting, and other useful functions on that data. This article will discuss some common data structures in computer science along with their implementation using programming languages like Python. We will also cover important algorithms used in these data structures and how they work internally. Finally, we will analyze performance characteristics of these algorithms for different input sizes, including worst-case, best-case, average case scenarios. 

This is an advanced level technology article meant for experienced developers who have experience working with complex data structures and algorithms. It assumes a basic knowledge of Python programming language. Familiarity with mathematical concepts is recommended but not essential.

To summarize, this article will guide readers through the basics of data structures and algorithms by providing examples of common data structures and algorithms, examining their properties and internal logic, discussing their time and space complexity, and analyzing their performance for specific input sizes. In conclusion, readers should understand the underlying principles behind effective data structure design, improve their problem-solving skills, and better manage resources when processing large amounts of data. 


# 2.数据结构的基本概念及术语
In computer science, a data structure is a collection of data values, called elements or nodes, together with rules for organizing, accessing, and modifying them. The two most common types of data structures are arrays and linked lists. These data structures are widely used throughout computing, from operating systems to databases.

An array (also known as vector) stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Each element can be accessed directly via its index, starting at zero. Arrays are commonly used to store homogeneous collections of items that need to be quickly accessed by index. For example, an integer array can be used to represent a list of integers. Array indexing is generally faster than linked list traversal because it allows constant-time lookups without having to traverse the entire list. However, arrays require that all elements be stored contiguously in memory, which may not always be feasible for large datasets.

A linked list is a dynamic linear collection of data values, where each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are commonly used for implementing more flexible data structures, especially those with variable sized elements or heterogeneous data. A good example is a stack or queue, where you want to add or remove elements from both ends of the list, respectively. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require that all elements be stored contiguously in memory, so they offer greater flexibility in terms of storage allocation.

There are many additional data structures, some less familiar to programmers. Some well-known ones include hash tables, trees, graphs, and sets. These structures differ in terms of their organization, access pattern, and purpose. Hash tables map keys to values based on a hash function, similar to dictionaries in Python. Trees are typically used for representing hierarchical data, while graphs are used for modeling relationships between objects. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, useful for performing set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

Common terminology associated with data structures includes size, capacity, length, rank, height, and depth. These terms describe the number of elements, maximum number of elements that can fit into a container, current number of elements within a container, position relative to other elements, height above or below the root, and distance from the root to a leaf node.

## 3.1 Array(数组)
Arrays are one of the simplest data structures. An array has a fixed size and each element in the array is accessible by an index. Here's a simple code snippet for creating an array:

```python
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

We can easily retrieve individual elements of the array using their indices:

```python
print(my_array[0])   # Output: 1
print(my_array[1])   # Output: 2
```

To insert new elements into an existing array, we can use the append() method:

```python
my_array.append(6)   
print(my_array)       # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

To delete an element from the array, we can use either the pop() method to remove the last element, or specify the index of the element to remove:

```python
last_element = my_array.pop()   
print(last_element)              # Output: 6
first_three_elements = my_array[:3]
new_array = first_three_elements + [7, 8, 9]
print(new_array)                 # Output: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9]
```

Arrays are easy to implement and operate efficiently, but there are some drawbacks. One issue is that if we need to resize the array during runtime, we would need to create a copy of the original array and copy over the elements to the new resized array. This operation takes O(n) time, where n is the size of the array. Another issue is that arrays don't allow for dynamically resizing themselves as the size changes. Therefore, depending on the requirements of our applications, we might consider using alternative data structures, such as linked lists or dynamic arrays.

The time complexity of various operations on an array depends on several factors such as the location of the element being searched/inserted, whether the array is sorted or unsorted, etc. Let's take a closer look at each operation individually:

1. Index Lookup: Retrieval of an element from an array takes constant time O(1), regardless of the size of the array.

2. Insertion: Adding a new element to the end of an array takes constant time O(1). However, inserting an element at a given index requires shifting all subsequent elements towards the right. If we assume that the array is initially empty, then the time complexity of insertion is O(n), where n is the index of the new element.

3. Deletion: Removing an element from the end of an array takes constant time O(1). However, removing an element at a given index requires shifting all preceding elements towards the left. If we assume that the array is initially full, then the time complexity of removal is O(n), where n is the index of the removed element.

4. Searching: To find the position of an element in an array, we start searching from the beginning of the array until we find the desired element. Since every element occupies a certain amount of memory, we can determine the minimum possible value of n such that arr[n] > x, i.e., if arr[n] <= x for all k < n, then x does not exist in the array. Thus, we perform binary search recursively until the middle point n lies outside the range of valid indexes. The algorithm performs logarithmic number of comparisons and halves the search interval on each iteration, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n). If the array is sorted, we can simply perform a binary search on the sorted portion of the array, which reduces the time complexity to O(log n).
