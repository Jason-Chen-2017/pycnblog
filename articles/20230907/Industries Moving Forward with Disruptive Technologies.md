## Overview of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)
Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are devices that allow communication between the brain and the computer. They are becoming increasingly popular since they can communicate more naturally than other interfaces, such as keyboards and mice. BCIs enable near-human-level performance in certain tasks requiring extensive mental abilities, such as motor control, spatial awareness, memory recall, problem-solving skills, and cognitive functions. BCI research has led to the development of numerous technologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and neurofeedback. Here is a brief overview of some of the most commonly used BCI technologies:  

### Electroencephalography (EEG)  
  EEG is a non-invasive technique that captures electrical activity in the brain. It works by sending electrical signals through the scalp, which travel down the spinal cord to the brain. During EEG recording, participants are asked to perform specific tasks while their EEG signals are continuously captured and analyzed. Researchers then use signal processing techniques to identify and decode the brainwaves. Current state-of-the-art EEG technology is the Muse EEG headset, which allows for wireless collection of EEG data at a low cost. Other popular EEG systems include Brain Computer Interface boards, which connect to a PC and transmit EEG data via Bluetooth or USB.
  
### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)  
 FMRIN refers to magnetic resonance imaging obtained during task execution. It records the magnetic properties of different tissue cells as they are exposed to stimuli, including blood flow, nerve conduction, muscle contraction, cell migration, and visual perception. To study brain function under natural conditions, researchers train subjects to perform various tasks while fMRI scans are collected. fMRI has been widely used in psychology, neuroscience, and clinical medicine for various neuroimaging studies, including resting-state functional connectivity mapping, dynamic causal modelling, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia diagnosis.

### Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
 MEG refers to a non-invasive neurobiometric technique that measures the magnetic fields created by the magnetometers located throughout the body. MEG signals are sensitive to small changes in magnetic fields caused by brain activity, thus enabling physiological measurements of brain waves, blood flow, and electrical activity. Scientists use MEG to investigate neural correlates of various diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. The MEG helmet is a device that attaches directly to the skull and captures magnetic fields emitted by the brain. Currently, researchers are working on developing MEG-based intracranial EEG (iEEG) systems that measure brain activities using iEEG recordings rather than relying solely on EEG recordings.
 
### Neurofeedback
 Neurofeedback refers to the application of feedback from the brain to the body. It involves monitoring brain signals and transmitting instructions to the body to improve performance. Scientists use neurofeedback systems to treat addiction, epilepsy, stroke, and pain disorders. Neurofeedback systems are powered by implantation of sensors in the body, such as electromyography (EMG) monitors, force plates, and electrodes placed over the affected area of the body. Neurofeedback is currently applied to treating headaches, migraine, Parkinson’s disease, and depression.
