# 1.简介
  

Python语言是一个非常优秀的编程语言，它提供了许多强大的功能模块，例如网络编程、数据库访问、图像处理等，但是同时也带来了一些坏处，例如健壮性差、效率低下、调试困难等。然而，在Python中存在着一个隐晦的问题，就是它的错误处理机制。由于历史原因（Python从1.x版本开始就引入了一个新语法`try...except`，所以很多初学者认为这个异常处理机制是最佳实践），当我们习惯用这种方式处理错误时，往往会忽视一些潜在的问题。比如，如果函数A调用了函数B，而B发生了错误，那么只要我们不捕获这个错误，整个程序就会崩溃，导致不可预知的后果。因此，我们应该在写Python程序时，始终牢记错误处理的重要性，并深刻理解“完美是不存在的”这一理念。
本文将详细阐述关于`try...except`语句的一些错误使用技巧和应对措施。

# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## Try Statement
The `try` statement in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions that occur during program execution. The syntax of a `try` block looks like this:

```python
try:
    # some code here
except ExceptionType:
    # code to be executed if an exception occurs
```

In the above example, any exception raised inside the `try` block will be caught by the corresponding except block. If such an exception occurs, it will execute the code within the corresponding except block. If no error occurs, then nothing happens in the except block.

If we do not specify the specific type of exception (ExceptionType) after the word except keyword, then all types of exceptions will be handled by the same block. For example:

```python
try:
    # some code here
except:
    # code to be executed if any exception occurs
```

Here, any kind of exception can happen anywhere within the `try` block, but only its details will be printed on console or logged for debugging purposes. This approach is generally frowned upon as it hides important information about the cause of the error. It is always better to explicitly mention the exact exception(s) that need to be handled under each particular except block. 

Another issue with using the `try...except` mechanism is that it masks certain errors entirely. A simple example would be dividing by zero - without proper handling of this case, a division by zero error could lead to a complete crash of the program. Therefore, it is essential to thoroughly test your code to ensure that you have properly handled every possible exception that might occur, even those that may seemingly go unnoticed due to poor coding practices.

## Raising Exceptions
Exceptions are raised when something goes wrong while executing a program. In Python, we use the raise keyword followed by an instance of the built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses. Here is an example:

```python
raise ValueError("Error message")
```

This raises a ValueError with the specified error message. We can also create our own custom exceptions by subclassing the Exception class and defining a constructor to pass additional data. For example:

```python
class MyCustomException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def __str__(self):
        return repr(self.value)
        
raise MyCustomException('Something went wrong')
```

In this example, we define a new exception called `MyCustomException`, which takes a string argument when created. When this exception is raised, it prints out the string representation of the object passed as the parameter to the constructor.
