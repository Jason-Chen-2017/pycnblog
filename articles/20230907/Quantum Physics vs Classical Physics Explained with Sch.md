Quantum mechanics and quantum computing have been two important concepts in physics over the past several years. Despite the significant advances made by quantum computers, they still lack a clear understanding of their basic principles and applications. This article aims to help readers understand how classical and quantum physical systems differ from each other and the differences between various physical theories and models. We will start by looking at some key differences between the two fields before going into details about quantum mechanics, superconductivity, and quantum computation. 

We will begin by defining what is meant by "quantum" or "classical." Both are fundamental ways of thinking about the natural world, but they differ significantly in terms of scale, structure, and functioning. The following section describes these differences as well as examples illustrating both aspects of the field.


# 2. Basic Concepts and Terminology
## 2.1 Classical Mechanics
Classical mechanics refers to the most common way of describing the motion and interaction of physical objects such as atoms and molecules. It involves Newton's laws of motion which describe how forces affect objects and resulting movement of those objects under different conditions like gravity, friction, and electromagnetic force. These movements can be accurately predicted mathematically using mathematical formulas based on conservation of energy and momentum. In simple words, classical mechanics involves predicting the behavior of bodies without considering any interference caused by quantum effects that may occur during experiments such as quantum computing. 

### Types of Motion
There are three types of motions in classical mechanics: 

1. Conservative – Conservative means that if an object moves under certain conditions it remains in the same position even after a small change in external force. For example, if we move a block vertically upwards without applying any force on it, then no net vertical acceleration will remain throughout its journey. If the block has mass M, its center of mass stays fixed while its height changes due to gravitational force acting on the object. Therefore, the object remains in equilibrium position after it reaches this point. Other examples include sliding down stairs, rolling down a ramp, and swimming through water without wind resistance.
2. Dissipative - A dissipative motion occurs when an object experiences sudden disturbance or deformation that causes it to vibrate or stop moving. Examples of such motions include shaking hands, hitting something with a ball, and clapping your hands together. Dissipative motions can cause unintended consequences and harm human health. To avoid them, careful planning and management must be implemented to ensure safe operations.
3. Non-conservative – Non-conservative means that an object does not return back to its original state once it leaves a given region or system. For example, if you drop a rock without specifying a target place where it should fall, it will continue falling until it either hits another object or drops out of the boundary. These motions involve randomness, fluctuations, and non-linearities in the equations that govern the motion of the object. They cannot be explained by traditional linear equations. Mathematical modeling techniques used for classical mechanics also tend to capture only qualitative features rather than quantitative ones. Non-conservative motion makes sense only in very special cases like piles of ice, weather, and geophysical phenomena.

### Example: Ball Balancing
Here's an illustration of ball balancing in classical mechanics:


In this scenario, there are two balls on a horizontal table. One ball rests on the bottom edge of the table with a weight W1, and the other ball is placed above the first one with a smaller mass m2. Initially, both balls are pointing towards the right direction (x-axis). When an initial impact happens, the larger ball begins to roll towards the left side of the table. After striking the ground, the second ball starts to spin counterclockwise. This continues until both balls balance on their sides. 

The reason behind why the balls balance is because they maintain constant relative speed to each other. Let’s consider the relative velocity v2=v1+w^2/(m1+m2), where w is the angular frequency and v1 and v2 represent the velocities of the two balls respectively. Since the total kinetic energy E=(1/2)*m(v)^2, including the kinetic energy of the two balls is zero, hence ∑E=0. Hence, both balls move along their respective x axes at equal and opposite directions leading to a perfectly balanced outcome.
