# 1.简介
  

Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been a popular approach in the field of artificial intelligence for solving complex tasks like robotics and autonomous driving. However, traditional RL algorithms often suffer from sample inefficiency and high computational cost due to large state space. In this paper, we will discuss an online RL algorithm called POMCP (Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning), which is able to handle large state spaces while maintaining low sample complexity by exploiting partial observability property of the environment. The proposed method can also provide insights into how humans learn new skills by mimicking the behavior of adaptive agents trained on real-world data using prior knowledge about the world and a set of sensors that allow them to perceive only part of the environment. We hope our article provides an overview of recent advances in online RL with POMDPs techniques as well as guidance towards future research directions.

## Partial Observability Property（PO）
In artificial intelligence, PO refers to the observation available to the agent at any given time, which means that it cannot infer or directly observe all the hidden information present in the environment other than what is observable. It defines the key difference between fully observed and partially observed environments. A fully observed environment involves complete knowledge of the dynamics, states and observations of every possible scenario, whereas a partially observed environment contains incomplete or noisy information about the unobservable state variables. PO enables us to avoid creating infinite number of states, thereby reducing the computational costs associated with AI systems.

## Partially Observable Markov Decision Process （POMDP）
A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is defined as a tuple M = <S,A,T,O,R,γ> where S is the set of states, A is the set of actions, T(s'|s,a) is the transition function, O(s') is the observation distribution, R(s,a) is the reward function, γ ∈ [0,1] is the discount factor. An agent interacts with the environment by taking actions in each state s and observing its corresponding observation o. Actions are deterministic, i.e., they map a state to a fixed outcome but not necessarily one-to-one mapping as in classical MDPs. The goal of POMDP is to find the optimal policy π* = argmax_π ∈ P(π) Q^pi(s,a), where Q^pi(s,a) represents the expected return obtained by following policy pi in state s and action a. To do so, POMDP requires reasoning over incomplete or noisy observations, allowing us to exploit human abilities and cognitive processes such as deductive reasoning, analogy, and causal inference.

## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a widely used heuristic algorithm in the field of AI for searching through the game tree generated by the game’s moves and outcomes. MCTS works by running simulations based on policies randomly selected from the set of possible policies until convergence is achieved. Each simulation starts from the root node and selects successors and rewards according to rollout policy until reaching terminal state. At each node, MCTS evaluates several metrics, including total score, visits count, average value of children nodes, and prior probability of selecting a particular child. The highest scoring move is chosen as the best next move. This technique guarantees near-optimal solutions within exponential time and scalable to larger state spaces.

## Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (POMCP)
Partially observable Monte-Carlo planning (POMCP) is an extension of MCTS to work with partially observable Markov decision processes. POMCP considers both the history up to current step and the current observation, enabling it to make decisions without being confined to the original state space. The underlying principle behind POMCP is Bayesian inference using neural networks to estimate the belief distributions over the states at different times. POMCP thus estimates the probabilities of different configurations of states given the observations made at different times, enabling it to take better action choices based on uncertainty rather than purely greedy exploration. 

## Adaptive Agent
Adaptive agent is a machine learning model whose behavior is learned from experience instead of being explicitly programmed. Traditionally, adaptive agents have seen limited success in industrial applications because their capabilities are too limited compared to general intelligent machines. With the advancement of deep reinforcement learning methods, however, these limitations may soon be overcome thanks to the ability to learn from expert demonstrations. The core idea of adaptive agent is to imitate the behavior of human experts using prior knowledge about the problem domain and a set of sensors that allow them to perceive only part of the environment. By comparing the performance of adaptively trained agents to those trained on real data, we can understand how humans learn new skills.
