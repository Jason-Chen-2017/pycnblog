# 2.Background Introduction

Data science has grown exponentially over the last decade due to two primary factors:

1. Big data – The volume and variety of data generated by organizations continues to increase day by day. This data requires specialized software to analyze, visualize, and make sense of it. In recent years, several cloud-based platforms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform offer fully managed services to store, process, and analyze large volumes of data.

2. AI/ML advancements - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies have revolutionized many industries from finance to healthcare. They enable machines to recognize patterns and predict outcomes based on massive amounts of data. To become proficient in this field, you need to understand its fundamentals, core algorithms, and practical applications. A common misconception is that data science involves only scientific computing or statistical modeling. It doesn't stop there; building real-world products or services requires integrating insights from data, artificial intelligence, and user experience design.

Accordingly, becoming a data scientist requires not just technical expertise but also business acumen, communication, and problem-solving skills. Without them, the role becomes less fulfilling and rewarding. By practicing critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, data scientists can create value for businesses while fostering a culture of teamwork and collaboration. So what should data scientists do? How can they improve their skillsets so they can succeed in today's data-driven world?

# 3.Concepts and Terms
Before diving into specific techniques and methods for improving your data science skillset, let us quickly cover some basic concepts and terms used in data analytics. These include:

1. Data – Information collected from different sources and processed to obtain meaningful insights.

2. Variable – An attribute of a data point that may change over time. For example, age, gender, income, etc.

3. Attribute – A variable that is measured or observed for each unit of observation. For example, height, weight, salary, etc.

4. Dataset – A collection of related data points usually organized in tabular form. Each row represents an individual entity, while columns represent attributes about that entity.

5. Feature – An attribute that can potentially influence an outcome or behavior. It is usually described using qualitative terms like “good”, “bad”, “average” instead of numerical values like 1, 0, or 0.7 respectively.

6. Label – The output variable that determines whether an entity belongs to a particular class or category. For instance, spam detection, fraud detection, sentiment analysis, etc.

7. Target variable – A variable that you want to predict or classify. It is often represented as Y in the dataset.

8. Missing values – Data points that are missing essential information or are corrupted in any way.

9. Outliers – Observations that differ significantly from other observations in terms of scale, distribution, or shape.

10. Density estimation – Using mathematical functions to estimate probability density function (PDF), which is commonly known as kernel density estimation (KDE). KDE helps to identify regions where data points are densely packed, thus identifying potential outliers.

11. Standardization – Transforming variables to have zero mean and unit variance to ensure consistency across all features and reduce interference from irrelevant variables.

12. Scaling – Rescaling the data set so that all features are on the same scale, without distorting differences in scale. Common scaling techniques include min-max normalization and standardization.

13. Normalization – Converting input values into a fixed range between 0 and 1, or alternatively into a standard score.

14. Cross-validation – Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets, and then repeatedly training the model on different subsets of the data to evaluate its accuracy and generalization ability.

15. Hyperparameter tuning – Adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of neurons in a neural network, epsilon value for support vector machines, etc., to optimize model performance and avoid overfitting or underfitting.

16. Precision and Recall metrics – Measures of how well the algorithm can correctly classify positive and negative samples during evaluation.

17. ROC curve – Plots the relationship between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) at various thresholds. TPR measures the proportion of actual positives identified correctly, while FPR measures the proportion of fake negatives accepted as positives.

18. Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric – Quantifies the overall quality of a binary classifier by measuring its ability to distinguish between positive and negative examples.

19. Confusion matrix – A table showing the predicted labels vs. actual labels for a classification task.

20. Regression models – Models that predict continuous outcomes based on independent variables.

21. Classification models – Models that predict categorical outcomes based on independent variables.

22. Ensemble learning – Combining multiple base learners to produce improved predictions.

23. Gradient descent optimization technique – Optimization method used to minimize cost or error in machine learning models.

24. Epochs and batch size – Parameters that control how frequently the gradient descent optimizer updates the weights in a neural network.

25. Loss function – A measure of how accurate the prediction is made by the model. It defines the difference between predicted and actual outputs.

26. Evaluation metrics – Metrics used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.

27. Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function – An extension of the ordinary least squares (OLS) loss function, MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily.

28. Logistic regression – A type of regression model used for binary classification tasks.

29. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) – A type of supervised learning algorithm that uses non-linear decision boundaries to segregate data into classes.

30. Decision Trees (DTs) – A type of supervised learning algorithm that recursively splits the feature space into smaller regions based on the outcome of a splitting criterion.

31. Random Forest (RF) – An ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to reduce variance and improve accuracy.

32. Gradient Boosting (GB) – An ensemble learning technique that iteratively trains weak learners to combine their predictions to produce a final result.

33. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – An unsupervised learning technique that projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space while retaining important structure and relationships among variables.

34. Neural Networks (NNs) – An artificial neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes that process inputs and generate outputs.
