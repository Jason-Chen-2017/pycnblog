4.Abstract
The Transformer model has achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, the fundamental ideas behind the model remain poorly understood. This paper develops an in-depth understanding of the key ideas underlying the Transformer architecture, including its core building block, attention mechanisms, and multi-head attention, as well as their limitations and potential biases. We also propose several modifications to improve the performance of the model, such as layer normalization and positionwise feedforward networks, which we argue can both benefit training and inference. We evaluate our findings through experiments on machine translation and question answering tasks, showing that these improvements significantly outperform standard models. Finally, we discuss how these insights into the behavior of the Transformer may be used to advance more effective neural architectures for natural language processing tasks, and to better understand the role of attention mechanisms in deep learning systems.

5.Introduction
In this article, I will present a detailed analysis of the basic principles behind the attention mechanism in the Transformer model, explaining why it works, how it applies to neural network models, what are some of its drawbacks and bias, and finally present ways to improve the performance of the model using different techniques like positional encoding and layer normalization. Furthermore, I will apply my analysis to two classic natural language processing tasks - Machine Translation and Question Answering - to showcase the benefits of improved attention mechanisms. Overall, my hope is to create a comprehensive yet accessible summary of the current understanding of attention mechanisms in modern deep learning systems, with practical applications in natural language processing and related fields.

6.Related Work
There have been many papers in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) about attention mechanisms. In general terms, attention mechanisms allow a system to focus on specific parts of input data, based on some context or prior knowledge. Some examples include Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Sequence-to-Sequence Models (Seq2Seq) etc. The attention mechanism is widely used in the field of NLP because it enables end-to-end models to learn global dependencies between different sub-sequences in the input sentence without explicit supervision from linguistically annotated labels. 

One of the most influential papers in the field was Bahdanau et al., who introduced the concept of "Neural Machine Translation" which involved attending to both the source sentence and target sentence at each time step during decoding. Over the years, numerous variants of attention mechanisms have emerged, but they all share one crucial property: They always involve selecting relevant information from input sequences in order to produce output predictions.

7.Background Introduction
Transformers are neural networks designed specifically for natural language processing tasks. They consist of multiple encoder layers and decoder layers connected in sequence. Each layer consists of a multi-head self-attention module followed by a fully connected feed-forward network (FFN). Self-attention allows the model to pay attention to different parts of the input sequence at different times, enabling it to make use of long-term dependencies. The FFN helps the model capture complex relationships between individual elements in the input sequence, which makes them ideal for capturing high level semantic features.

Attention mechanisms operate differently depending on whether they are applied before or after convoluted layers like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Let’s consider an example where we want to classify images. CNNs usually perform feature extraction, while RNNs typically employ temporal modeling. If we apply an attention mechanism directly after the CNN layers, it could selectively attend to certain areas of the image at different stages of classification. On the other hand, if we apply an attention mechanism directly after the RNN layers, it could give weightage to entire sequences of frames in an video clip instead of just the last frame of the clip. Therefore, it is essential to carefully design attention mechanisms so that they work efficiently across various types of inputs. 

8.Concepts and Terms
Attention Mechanism: A mechanism that enables a system to focus on specific parts of input data, based on some context or prior knowledge. It involves computing a weighted representation of the input based on a query vector and then aggregating those representations to form a final output. The weights assigned by the attention mechanism indicate the importance of corresponding input components when generating the output. There are three main operations performed by attention mechanisms:

1. Scaled Dot-Product Attention: An attention function computed over dot products between keys and queries, scaled by sqrt(dimensionality of keys). For each query, the corresponding set of keys and values are generated. These sets are then passed through a softmax activation function to compute attention probabilities. Finally, the attention vectors are calculated as a weighted sum of the values given by the attention probabilities.

2. Multi-Head Attention: Multiple parallel attention mechanisms can be run in parallel, each focusing on a different part of the input data. These heads are concatenated and fed through a linear transformation to obtain a joint representation of the input. This improves the representational power of the model and reduces interference due to limited attention resources.

3. Attention Gradient: During training, the gradients of the loss function w.r.t. the parameters of the attention mechanism should flow back to the inputs that were selected by the attention mechanism itself. To prevent gradient vanishing or explosion, we introduce a mask to ensure that only valid positions receive non-zero gradients. Additionally, we experimented with different strategies for initializing the parameters of the attention mechanism, such as kaiming uniform and xavier normal initialization.

4. Input Embeddings: Input embeddings map the original input tokens to dense fixed length vectors that can be processed by the rest of the model. Each embedding vector represents a word in a vocabulary along with its associated properties like its contextual meaning, syntax, pronunciation, etc. Word embeddings are learned from pre-trained word representations like GloVe or FastText.

5. Query Vector: The query vector is used to selectively focus on a particular subset of the input data. It specifies which region of the input to concentrate on during the attention process. Initially, the query vector is initialized randomly, but it can be learned via attention mechanisms.

6. Value Vector: The value vector captures important features of the input at every position in the sequence. It is produced by applying a linear transformation to the output of the previous layer in the transformer stack. In simple cases, the value vector is equal to the hidden state of the LSTM cell at that position.

7. Key Vector: The key vector identifies distinct patterns within the input sequence that correspond to the query vector. It is obtained by performing another linear transformation on the output of the previous layer in the transformer stack. In simple cases, the key vector is equal to the memory cell of the LSTM cell at that position.

8. Output Vector: The output vector generated by the attention mechanism combines the information captured by the value vector and the attention scores to generate the final output prediction. It is computed by multiplying the value vector with the attention scores and taking the element-wise sum. Alternatively, we can concatenate the value vector and attention score vectors and pass them through a linear transformation followed by a tanh activation function.

9. Padding Mask: A binary mask indicating which positions in the input sequence are padding values. It ensures that no information from padded positions leaks into the attention mechanism.

10. Lookahead Mask: A binary mask indicating the future positions in the input sequence that cannot attend to any earlier positions. It discourages the model from looking forward too far and encourages it to take short-range dependencies into account.

11. Softmax Function: Given a set of input values, the softmax function computes a probability distribution over these values, making sure that they add up to 1. The maximum probability is chosen as the predicted output label.

12. Dropout Regularization: Dropout regularization is a technique to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out some fraction of neurons during training. During evaluation, dropout is removed to estimate the expected value of the outputs of the model.

13. Positional Encodings: Positional encodings provide information about the relative position of words in the sequence. They act as additional inputs to the model that help identify the structure of the input sequence. One common type of positional encoding is adding sine waves of varying frequencies and amplitudes that gradually increase with the distance of the words in the sequence.
