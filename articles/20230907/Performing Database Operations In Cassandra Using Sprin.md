Apache Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL database management system that provides scalability and high availability. It features horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple nodes in a cluster of servers, automatic replication with fast failover abilities, strong consistency for reads and writes, and support for advanced data analytics like indexing, querying, and aggregations using Apache Hadoop MapReduce or Apache Spark.

In this article, we will see how to perform various types of database operations such as inserting, updating, retrieving, deleting records from Cassandra using the Spring Data Cassandra framework provided by Spring Boot. We will also see how to use the Java driver provided by the framework to execute these operations programmatically without writing any SQL queries. Finally, we will discuss about some common errors faced while performing these operations and their solutions.

Before starting with our article, let’s understand what are the core concepts involved in operating Cassandra and its different components:

1. Cluster: A group of nodes running cassandra server instances which work together to provide storage service to clients.
2. Node: Each node runs a instance of cassandra process alongside with its own JVM instance. There can be one or more nodes per machine depending on the memory capacity required by application.
3. Keyspace: A logical container of tables within Cassandra where you can store your data. A keyspace is similar to a database in relational databases but it doesn't have a predefined schema. You can create a new keyspace each time you want to add new table(s) or modify existing ones.
4. Column family (table): An ordered set of rows indexed by a partition key. Each row contains columns of data identified by a column name/value pair. The primary key of a column family consists of two parts - partition key and clustering key (optional).
5. Partition key: This identifies the unique partition within a column family. Rows with same value for partition key would reside on the same partition. If no clustering keys are specified then the natural order of rows is used to sort the data within partitions. But if clustering keys are present then the values of clustering keys are used to determine the order of rows within partitions.
6. Clustering key: This defines the ordering of rows within a partition based on the corresponding value of the clustering key. If not specified, then the natural order of rows is used to sort the data within partitions. Note that multiple clustering keys can be defined for complex sorting requirements.
7. Row: A collection of columns belonging to a single partition and having the same partition key.
8. Column: A named binary value, associated with a timestamp, a type, and other metadata, stored in a cell.
9. Consistency level: The consistency level determines how many copies of the data must exist before a read or write operation returns successful response to the client. For example, when you set the consistency level to QUORUM, the read or write request is only successful once a majority of replicas in the cluster have stored the updated data. When working with Cassandra, there are four consistency levels available - ANY, ONE, TWO, THREE, QUORUM, ALL, LOCAL_QUORUM, EACH_QUORUM, SERIAL, LOCAL_SERIAL,LOCAL_ONE. By default, the session level consistnecy level is set to QUORUM.


To install Cassandra locally, please follow the instructions given below: 

https://cassandra.apache.org/download/

The downloaded file should contain a `bin` directory containing several scripts useful for managing Cassandra. To start a local Cassandra instance, navigate to the bin directory and run the following command:

```bash
./cassandra -f
```

This will bring up a Cassandra instance listening on the default port 9042. Once started successfully, you can access the CQL shell via localhost at port 9042.

```bash
cqlsh
```

Next, let's get started with implementing database operations using Spring Boot and Java Driver.
