Support vector machines (SVM) is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms in practical applications today. It is widely used for classification and regression tasks in a wide range of fields such as text and image recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. In this article we will be discussing how SVM works using the mathematical formulation called "kernel trick". We will also explore some interesting theoretical aspects of kernelized SVM which have not been discussed much yet. Finally, we will discuss potential benefits and challenges associated with kernelization. Overall, by the end of the article you should gain an understanding of how kernelized SVM works and its advantages over standard SVM.

Before we move into the detailed explanation of how to use kernels for support vector machines, let's first understand some basic concepts related to it. Let's take the following two examples: 

Example A: 
Suppose we have two classes of points on a plane that are linearly separable. One class is shown below in red and the other class is shown in blue. 




We can find a hyperplane that divides these two classes with a line orthogonal to the boundary between them. The equation of the hyperplane can be written as $w^Tx+b=0$, where $x$ denotes the input features of the data point, $w$ represents the normal vector of the hyperplane, and $b$ is the bias term. If we choose $w$ perpendicular to the direction from any point inside the blue region to any point outside the blue region, then all those points would lie on the decision boundary. Hence, if there exists a non-zero solution to this equation, then we can classify new data points based on their position relative to this hyperplane. For example, if $y(x)$ represents the predicted output for a given input feature $x$, then $y(x)=sgn(w^Tx+b)$ would be a binary classifier when applied to our dataset.

Example B: Consider a two-dimensional dataset with two classes of points shown below in red and blue respectively. 




There does not exist a straight line that can separate both classes because they overlap each other. However, if we apply the same methodology as before but instead of considering the raw input features $x$, consider the dot product $\phi(x)^T\phi(x)$, where $\phi(\cdot)$ is a basis function that maps the original input space to a higher dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. By choosing different basis functions, we can make the problem more complex without having to worry about finding a perfect separation hyperplane. 

In practice, the choice of the basis functions depends on several factors including the type of problem being solved and the nature of the data itself. For example, in the case of text classification, people often use n-grams as basis functions since they capture important local features of words and phrases. On the other hand, in the case of image recognition, people may use edge detectors, gradients, or color histograms as basis functions depending on the specific visual characteristics of images. 

The key idea behind using basis functions is to transform the original high-dimensional input space into a lower-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. This process allows us to solve problems that were previously intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. Another advantage of kernel methods is that they do not require manual feature engineering like traditional methods, making them easier to implement and tune.

Now, back to the topic of SVM using kernel tricks. Given a set of training data points $X=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and corresponding labels $Y=\{y_i\}_{i=1}^N$, where each $x_i \in R^D$ and $y_i \in {-1, +1}$, where D stands for the number of features, SVM attempts to find a hyperplane $w^T x + b = 0$ that maximizes the margin between the positive and negative samples. That is, it aims to find a good balance between keeping the samples on the correct side of the hyperplane while ensuring that there are enough samples on either side. Mathematically, this objective is expressed as:

$$\max_{\left\{ w,b\right\} \text{ s.t. } y_i (w^T x_i + b)\geq 1-\xi_i }\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(w^T x_i + b - y_i )^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^{N}\xi_i $$ 

where $\xi_i > 0$ is a slack variable representing the violation of the constraint $y_i (w^T x_i + b) \geq 1-\xi_i$. The parameter $C$ controls the trade-off between achieving a small loss and limiting the impact of misclassifications on the margins. Intuitively, a larger value of $C$ leads to a stricter margin requirement and hence less flexibility, leading to smaller gaps between the hyperplanes and better generalization performance.

However, notice that the above optimization problem is very difficult to solve directly because computing the inner product between vectors $x_i$ and $x_j$ requires $D$ multiplications and additions, resulting in a time complexity of $O(DN^2)$, where N is the number of training data points. To address this issue, many researchers introduced techniques such as kernelization and duality theory to reduce the computation cost to $O(NM)$, where $M$ is the size of the kernel matrix. In particular, they proposed the so-called kernel trick, which involves applying a transformation function $\phi$ to the inputs before performing any computations, allowing us to compute the inner products between transformed versions of the inputs only once, resulting in a significant reduction in computational cost. These transformed versions are commonly referred to as "feature maps" or "kernels". Mathematically, given a kernel function $k:\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and a set of labeled training instances $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ where $\mathcal{X}$ denotes the input domain, the kernelized SVM model is defined as follows:

$$\begin{align*}&\min_{\left\{ w,b\right\}, \phi} &\quad \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^N k(x_i,x_j)(w^T \phi(x_i) + b - y_i y_j )^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{N} \xi_i \\&\text{subject to} &\quad y_i (w^T \phi(x_i) + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i,\forall i\\& &\quad \xi_i \geq 0,\forall i \end{align*}$$

Here, we introduce the concept of a kernel function $k(x_i,x_j)$ which computes the similarity between the pair of input features $x_i$ and $x_j$. Specifically, if $k(x,z) = \langle \phi(x),\phi(z)\rangle$, where $\phi(x)$ is the feature map computed on the input instance $x$, then we obtain a linear kernel $k(x,z) = \phi(x)^T\phi(z)$ which corresponds to ignoring the nonlinear relationships between the input features and directly taking the dot product. Other popular choices of kernel functions include radial basis functions (RBF), polynomial kernels, and sigmoidal kernel functions. Note that there are infinitely many possible kernel functions and selecting the right one requires careful consideration of the specific task at hand.

One final note before moving forward is that although the kernel trick reduces the computational cost of solving the SVM problem, it comes at the cost of introducing a degree of freedom into the model that cannot be tuned analytically. Therefore, care must be taken during the selection of the kernel function and tuning of the regularization parameter $C$ to avoid underfitting and overfitting. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, manually selecting the appropriate basis functions is an important aspect of designing effective kernelized SVM models.
