Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular technique used in data mining and machine learning to extract patterns from the dataset. It helps identify and reduce the dimensionality of the original features by transforming them into new orthogonal uncorrelated variables called principal components. PCA provides insights about how different factors contribute to overall variance in the dataset and hence it can be widely used for various purposes such as exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, outlier detection, pattern recognition, etc. In this article, we will discuss the basics of PCA and explain its working mechanism using simple examples.
# 2.What Is PCA?
PCA is an algorithm that transforms the feature space of a dataset into another one with equal number of dimensions but with reduced complexity due to loss of correlation between the features. The key idea behind PCA is to find directions in the high-dimensional feature space that maximize their variance. These directions form what are known as principal components and capture most of the information in the dataset along those axes. We then project our original data onto these axes to obtain a lower-dimensional representation of the same data while retaining maximum information on the structure of the problem at hand. Here's how the process works:

1. Standardize the data so that each column has zero mean and unit variance. This ensures that all features have similar scales and removes any biases towards larger values. 

2. Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data. This shows us how the different features vary together. 

3. Compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors correspond to the principal components and their magnitude indicates their importance in capturing the distribution of the data. Eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each principal component. 

4. Choose the number of principal components required to retain enough information on the underlying structure of the data. Common choices are 95%, 99% and 99.9%. 

5. Project the original data onto the selected principal components to get a compressed version of the data. 

The above steps can be summarized in the following equation: 

$$X = Q \Sigma Q^T$$
where $X$ is the input matrix containing the original features, $\Sigma$ is the diagonal matrix containing the variances of the input features, $Q$ is the matrix of eigenvectors representing the principal components. 

We'll now go through the detailed explanation of each step in more detail. 

# 3.Background Introduction and Notations
Let’s consider two-dimensional data points $(x_i,y_i)$, where $i=1,\ldots,N$. Let’s assume that we know the value of $N$, which means we don't have access to every point in the dataset. Instead, we observe only a subset of the total points. Given some observed data points $D=\{(x_{i1},y_{i1}),\ldots,(x_{im},y_{im})\}$, where $m<N$, we want to reconstruct the entire set of data points. In other words, we need to estimate the missing values for the remaining data points $D'=(x_{i1}',\ldots,x_{in}')$.

One way to do this is to use linear regression models trained on subsets of the data points. However, if there is significant noise in the data, these methods may not work well. Another approach is to apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, which can help to capture important features while minimizing the impact of noise. 


## Data Preprocessing
Before applying PCA, we need to preprocess the data. Firstly, we normalize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Secondly, we remove any redundant or irrelevant features. Finally, we split the data into training and testing sets. 

### Mean Normalization 
Subtracting the mean of the data makes sure that the data points are centered around the origin. If we don't perform normalization, the algorithm might tend to converge to a local minimum instead of global minima since the initial weights could become very large or small. Also, normalizing the data puts all the features on the same scale, making it easier to compare them later. 

Here is the formula for mean normalization: 

$$ x_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_j}{\sigma_j}$$

Where $\mu_j$ is the mean of the jth feature and $\sigma_j$ is the standard deviation of the jth feature.  

### Feature Scaling 
Feature scaling is also referred to as feature normalization or rescaling. It involves scaling the range of independent variables or features in either positive or negative direction. For example, we can scale the data to ensure that all features have the same scale. There are several ways to do this, including MinMaxScaling, StandardScaler, RobustScaler, etc. All these techniques aim to scale the data within a certain range. One of the common ways to do this is to divide each feature by its standard deviation. 

Here is the formula for feature scaling: 

$$ x_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij}}{\sigma_j}$$

Where $\sigma_j$ is the standard deviation of the jth feature.  

### Reducing Dimensionality
After preprocessing the data, we move on to reducing the dimensionality of the dataset. To achieve this task, we first compute the covariances among all the features. Then, we sort the eigenvectors based on their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order. Next, we select the top K eigenvectors, where K represents the desired dimensionality. Lastly, we project the original data onto the chosen basis vectors to obtain a transformed dataset with less number of dimensions than the original one. 

In summary, after performing the following operations, we end up with a transformed dataset X':

1. Normalize the data
2. Remove irrelevant features 
3. Scale the data
4. Reduce the dimensionality of the data by selecting the top k eigenvectors  
5. Transform the original data X using the chosen basis vectors   


## How Does PCA Work?
PCA is a mathematical method that reduces the dimensionality of a dataset consisting of m observations and n variables. It does this by identifying the hyperplane that lies closest to the data and projects the data onto this plane. By doing this, we hope to capture the essential features of the data and discard noisy or redundant features. Here is how PCA works:

1. Compute the sample mean vector $u=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$, where $x_i$ denotes the i-th observation in the data matrix X. 
2. Subtract the mean vector from each observation in the data matrix X. 
3. Compute the scatter matrix S by multiplying the transposed data matrix $X^TX$ by itself, divided by n-1. Note that here the ^ symbol denotes matrix multiplication. 
4. Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the scatter matrix S. Sort the eigenvalues in decreasing order and choose the top k eigenvectors, where k is typically chosen to be a relatively small fraction of the total number of variables n. 
5. Form the projection matrix P by taking the dot product of the transpose of the eigenvectors with the original data matrix X. 
6. Multiply the projection matrix P by the sorted eigenvectors to obtain the transformed data matrix Y, with k columns and n rows. 
7. Select the top k columns of the transformed data matrix Y to form a reduced dimensional representation of the data matrix X. This is the final output of PCA. 

Note that PCA is essentially solving an optimization problem involving the tradeoff between the number of eigenvectors chosen and their respective variances. Therefore, it requires experimentation and judgment to determine the optimal choice of k. It is often recommended to start with few eigenvectors and increase them gradually until the desired level of accuracy and interpretability has been achieved.
