# 1.简介
  

Containers are an essential technology that have emerged in recent years as a promising solution for managing application deployment complexity and portability across different environments. A container is basically a standardized unit of software that packages up code, dependencies, and configuration files into a single package that can run on any machine regardless of its underlying infrastructure. Containerization enables developers to build applications using portable components with fewer integration issues than traditional installations or virtual machines. In this article we will introduce you to the fundamental concepts and terminology of containers and docker, and also see how they work by building our own simple web server container image.
In addition, I’ll explain why it makes sense to use containers over other solutions like VMs (virtual machines), compare their benefits, and provide guidance about when to choose one approach over another. Finally, I’ll present some best practices and tips for effectively working with containers and docker. By the end of this article, you should be well-versed enough to start working with containers on your own projects and seek help from experts if necessary.

# 2.基本概念与术语
## 2.1 What is a container? 
A container is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of software that contains everything needed to run an application: code, runtime environment, system tools, system libraries and settings. It has no dependency on the host operating system and can be used anywhere where the container engine runs - including cloud platforms, bare metal servers, laptops, or IoT devices. 

The word "container" refers to a type of packaging that was first introduced in 1978 by Dutch computer scientist Rijkman and is now widely used in software development and operations. The term "docker" refers to an open source project based on Linux containers that simplifies the creation, sharing, and running of containers. Today, most popular container technologies include LXC (Linux Containers) and BSD Jails. 

## 2.2 Terminology 
Before we dive deeper into the details, let's take a look at some key terms and definitions:

**Image:** An image is a file consisting of layers and metadata that defines a root filesystem, set of instructions to assemble a new filesystem layer on top of it, and configuration options. Images can be built from scratch or imported from existing images. 

**Container:** A container is a runtime instance of an image, which includes all dependencies, configuration files, and binary artifacts required to run an application. When a user executes a command to create a new container, Docker Engine creates a new container instance from the specified image and runs it in a isolated process space. Each container runs independently, shares only those resources explicitly assigned to it, and has its own network stack, IP address, and storage capabilities. 

**Repository/Registry:** A registry is a service that stores and distributes images. Docker Hub is the public Docker registry that anyone can use without having to set up anything locally. However, there are many private registries available for organizations to store and distribute their custom images. 

**Dockerfile:** A Dockerfile is a text document that contains a list of commands that assemble a container image. It describes the steps taken to build the final image, starting with the base image and applying any additional actions such as installing packages, copying files, and defining environment variables. Docker uses Dockerfiles to automate the assembly of containers and can significantly reduce the time needed to deploy new services or update existing ones. 

**Docker daemon:** The Docker daemon is responsible for creating and running containers. It listens for API calls and manages the building, running, and networking of containers. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon through a RESTful API.

**Docker client:** The Docker client is the primary way that users interact with Docker. From the command line, to the Docker UI or integrations with continuous integration and delivery systems. The Docker client sends commands to the Docker daemon to build, run, and manage containers. 

**Docker compose:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you define a YAML configuration file that specifies what services to run and how they should interact with each other. You can then use a single command to create and start all the services from your configuration simultaneously.

## 2.3 Benefits of Using Containers vs Virtual Machines
There are several advantages of using containers over virtual machines (VMs):

1. **Lightweight:** Unlike VMs, containers share the same kernel but run in a disposable environment that takes up less memory. This means containers can start quickly, often in milliseconds, whereas VMs require much more setup time due to the need to boot a complete guest OS.
2. **Portability:** Since containers run natively on Linux, they are easily transported between different hosts, providing easy migration between environments. Additionally, since containers do not rely on a hypervisor and run directly within the host kernel, they can still utilize hardware acceleration techniques such as NVIDIA CUDA and AMD ROCm on supported hardware. 
3. **Isolation:** Containers offer stronger isolation guarantees than VMs because they run in a separate execution context with minimal interference from other processes and services. They can be configured to use cgroups and resource limits to limit CPU, memory, and disk usage, further improving security. 
4. **Resource efficiency:** Containers offer significant cost savings compared to full-blown VMs because shared resources like CPU, memory, and storage can be consolidated onto a smaller number of physical hosts. This frees up valuable hardware resources for more important tasks, reducing costs while also improving utilization. 
5. **Easier scaling:** Containers enable easier horizontal scaling because they can be replicated simply by running multiple instances of the same container on different nodes. This eliminates the need to configure and maintain complex VM infrastructures.

In summary, containers provide a flexible and low-overhead alternative to VMs that can simplify development, testing, and deployment workflows while offering improved performance, scalability, and security. Deciding whether to use containers or VMs depends on factors such as individual needs, existing infrastructure, team skills, and business requirements.

# 3.How does Docker Work?
In this section, we will go over how Docker works internally by understanding how images, containers, repositories, and the Docker daemon work together. We will also cover some core Docker concepts and discuss how they relate to containers. Let's get started!

## 3.1 Images 
Images are templates that specify the software, configuration files, and dependencies needed to run an application. Images are typically created using Dockerfiles, which describe how to assemble them from various layers and configurations. Once an image is built, it becomes part of a repository, either on a local machine or on a remote registry, ready to be deployed as a container. Images contain a fully packaged software stack and can be shared and reused amongst different developers, teams, and organizations.  

### Image Layers
Each image consists of a series of read-only layers that are combined to form the final image. Each layer represents a set of changes applied to the previous layer, allowing for efficient versioning and rollbacks. For example, consider two images:

```
# Image 1
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install nginx

# Image 2
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install apache2

# Resulting Image
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install nginx apache2
```

In this scenario, both `nginx` and `apache2` are installed in the resulting image. These layers were derived from the Ubuntu parent image and added to the image separately, giving us the flexibility to add or remove specific pieces of functionality as needed.

### Image Tags and Registries
When you build an image, Docker assigns it a unique ID called a hash. You can tag an image with a human-readable name so you can refer to it later, rather than referring to it solely by its ID. If you want to push your image to a remote registry, you would usually assign it a URL like `registry.example.com/myuser/myapp:latest`. Docker Hub is the default public registry, but there are many others available for hosting private images.

### Base Images and Layering Effects
Every Docker image starts with a base image. A common choice is to use an official image provided by a third party, such as `alpine`, `ubuntu`, or `python`, which provides a stable and well-supported platform upon which to build your app. These base images are special in that they have few or no customizations beyond basic installation of packages, ensuring that the image size remains small and efficient. On the other hand, your own images may have customizations or additional packages that you want included in the final image. In order to achieve this, Docker employs a technique called "layering", which allows you to combine multiple images into a single new image. As each subsequent layer is built, Docker automatically detects the differences between the current state of the container and the new layer, then applies just the necessary changes to efficiently create a new container image. This method ensures that your final image is as small as possible, minimizing the amount of data that needs to be transferred during deployment or updates. 

Overall, images allow developers to create portable and reproducible environments for their apps, making it easy to develop, test, and deploy across different environments and platforms. By combining Docker with other technologies, such as container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or swarm mode, organizations can scale their deployments to meet changing demands and provide high availability and fault tolerance.

## 3.2 Containers
Containers are ephemeral runtime instances of an image that run on the Docker engine. When you run a container, Docker pulls down the corresponding image and sets up a secure container sandbox with the requested parameters such as memory and CPU allocation. Each container is isolated, meaning it has its own set of resources allocated to it, such as CPU, memory, and access to its own filesystem. Containers can communicate with each other via localhost interfaces or network interfaces exposed by the Docker bridge or overlay networks.

### Container Ports and Volume Mounts
By default, containers are completely isolated from outside communication except for ports that are explicitly mapped or forwarded at runtime. However, volumes can be mounted from the host filesystem into a container, allowing for persistent data storage and exchange between the container and the host. This enables apps to access and modify external data stores or databases.

### Running Processes and Environments
Once a container is launched, it runs inside a secured environment made up of processes and namespaces. The container engine allocates a new set of namespaces for the container, including a PID namespace for process management, a network namespace for hostname resolution and port mapping, and a mount namespace for managing filesystem permissions. All of these namespaces are isolated from the host and prevent unauthorized modification or interference from other containers or processes.

To ensure that the correct software and configuration files are executed, containers also come prepackaged with a specific version of the chosen base image, ensuring that builds are repeatable and consistent across different developer machines.

### Docker Lifecycle
The Docker lifecycle consists of four main stages:

1. Creation: The Docker client creates a new container by specifying an image to base it off of and any additional configuration options. The Docker daemon checks for the existence of the given image and downloads it if necessary before launching a container instance.
2. Start: After the container instance is launched, Docker triggers the entry point script defined in the Dockerfile. At this stage, the container enters the running state and begins executing the commands specified in the script.
3. Pause and Resume: You can pause a running container using the `docker pause` command, suspending all processes inside it until it is resumed. Similarly, you can resume a paused container using the `docker unpause` command. 
4. Deletion: To permanently delete a stopped container, you can use the `docker rm` command. Alternatively, you can stop a running container using the `docker stop` command, followed by the `docker rm` command. During deletion, Docker performs cleanup activities such as removing associated volumes, network interfaces, etc., freeing up system resources.
