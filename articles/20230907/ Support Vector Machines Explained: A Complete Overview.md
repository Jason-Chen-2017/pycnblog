Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. In this article, we will cover the following topics in detail:

1. Background Introduction: We will start by discussing why SVMs are important to data science and AI.

2. Basic Concepts and Terminology: We will explain the basic concepts of SVMs like decision boundaries, margin maximization, support vectors, hyperplanes, etc., which you need to understand before applying them to real world applications.

3. The Math Behind SVMs: Next, we will dive into the mathematics behind SVMs including derivation of the loss function, kernel functions, and mathematical optimization techniques such as gradient descent.

4. Using Python Code with Scikit-Learn Library: Finally, we will demonstrate how to use SVMs using Python code and scikit-learn library, which is widely used in industry and academia.

By reading through this article, you should have a good understanding of what SVMs are, their advantages, limitations, and best practices when using them in your projects. Let's get started! 

Note: If you're new to machine learning or artificial intelligence, make sure to check out our "Introduction to Machine Learning" and "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" articles first to familiarize yourself with the basics.

Before we move on to the details of SVMs, let's quickly go over some fundamental concepts that are commonly used in machine learning algorithms. These include:

1. Data: The input dataset consisting of features (independent variables), labels (dependent variable), and training examples. 

2. Features: Input variables used to predict the output label. It could represent physical attributes, like height, weight, age; financial metrics, like stock prices, interest rates; biological characteristics, like gene expression levels; image pixels, text content, etc. Examples of numerical features include temperature, pressure, distance; categorical features include color, gender, etc. 

3. Labels: The target value we want to predict based on the given inputs. For example, if we are trying to classify images into different categories like animals, cars, and people, then each image would have an associated label indicating its category. Similarly, in the case of spam detection, each email message would have a binary label indicating whether it is spam or not. 

4. Training Set: A subset of the entire dataset used to train the model, i.e., learn patterns from the data that indicate relationship between the features and labels. It consists of feature values and corresponding labels. 

5. Test Set: Another subset of the entire dataset used to evaluate the performance of the trained model after it has been trained on the training set. This is done to estimate how well the model will generalize to new, unseen data.

6. Hyperparameters: Parameters that are tuned during the model training process to optimize the performance of the model. They control various aspects of the learning process, like regularization strength, kernel function type, and tradeoff between error rate and accuracy.

Now that we have discussed these key concepts, let's take a look at the math behind SVMs. Before that, let me remind you that SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. That means it identifies a set of points called support vectors that act as the foundation of the decision boundary. You may also hear SVM referred to as Maximum Margin Classifier. So what does that mean? Well, it means that the optimal decision boundary is located where the margin between the two classes is maximum. Here's the step-by-step guide on how SVM works:

1. The goal of SVM is to find the line or hyperplane that separates the positive class from the negative class. 

2. One way to do this is to select the two dimensions along which the separation should occur that result in the largest possible gap between the two classes. However, it may not always be feasible to visualize the hyperplane due to complex geometry and non-linearity involved. Therefore, we use a technique called kernel trick, which allows us to project the data onto another higher dimensional space where linear decision boundaries can be drawn easily. 


In other words, we map the original feature space into a higher dimension, where the decision boundary becomes easier to draw. We call this mapping function the kernel function. There are several types of kernels available, but one popular choice is the radial basis function (RBF). Essentially, RBF creates a high degree of similarity among all points within a certain radius around the current point. Once mapped into the higher dimensional space, we can simply apply standard linear algebra to solve for the decision boundary.
