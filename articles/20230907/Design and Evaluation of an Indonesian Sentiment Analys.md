# 1.简介
  

Indonesia is one of the most multicultural countries in the world with over 170 languages spoken. Its rich culture and diverse heritage make it a popular tourist destination for many nationalities, including Indian and Malaysian visitors alike. Many news outlets and websites provide local-language content, making it hard to analyze its sentiment towards different political parties or even regional issues. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that can perform sentiment analysis on Indonesian language text data. Our approach involves training a deep learning model on a pre-annotated dataset consisting of tweets from several major political parties around the country alongside their corresponding labels (positive, negative, neutral). The trained model then takes as input new Twitter posts from users and produces predicted sentiment scores for each class label based on word embeddings extracted from pre-trained GloVe vectors. We evaluate our proposed method using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, as well as discuss potential limitations of the method. This work provides insights into how machine learning models can be used effectively to classify social media text data by analyzing sentiment in multiple languages. It also helps identify challenges and potential solutions in developing more accurate sentiment classifiers for specific domains and languages.
# 2.Basic Concepts and Terminology
In this section, we define some basic concepts and terminology used throughout the article. These terms will help us better understand the problem statement and context.

**Text Data**: Textual information captured from various sources, which could include emails, SMS messages, reviews, social media comments etc., that needs to be analyzed for sentiment and emotions.

**Sentiment Analysis:** A technique used to determine the attitude or opinion expressed within a given piece of text. 

**Emotion:** An emotion experienced by someone or something when they perceive something else through their senses, thoughts, or actions. Emotions range from positive to sadness, happiness to disgusting.

**Tweet**: A message posted on Twitter that typically contains up to 280 characters. Each tweet is attributed with an author, date/time stamp, and has optional metadata associated with it like likes, retweets, replies etc.

**Polarity:** Polarity refers to whether the overall tone of a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral. Positive sentences have a high degree of positivity while negative sentences are usually milder and tend to indicate strong negativity. Neutral sentences are those that do not convey any positive or negative sentiment at all.

**Lexicon:** A lexicon is a set of words or phrases that express a particular sentiment or feeling, and serve as the basis for identifying patterns and categories in natural language processing tasks. Examples of English lexicons include the Bing Liu Lexicon, VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), and MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon.

**Feature Vector:** A vector representation of a text document generated by converting each token into a numerical feature value representing its importance in determining its overall sentiment.

**Word Embedding:** A way of representing a text document where each word is mapped to a dense vector space of fixed size, similar to Word2Vec algorithm. Word embeddings capture the semantic meaning of individual tokens by mapping them to a dense vector space. Pre-trained GloVe embeddings are commonly used in sentiment analysis applications.

**Classification Model:** A supervised learning model that maps inputs to outputs based on a predefined set of rules. The goal of classification models is to predict a categorical output variable based on the features provided as input. There are several types of classification models depending on the type of data being processed. For example, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines etc.


# 3.Proposed Method
Our proposed method uses a deep neural network architecture called Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for sentiment analysis. CNN's ability to capture complex spatial relationships between tokens in text makes them ideal for sentiment analysis problems involving sequences of tokens.  

## Architecture

The proposed architecture consists of three main components:

1. Tokenization
2. Feature Extraction
3. Classification Layer

### Tokenization

We use NLTK library to tokenize the raw text into smaller units called "tokens". Tokens represent important words or groups of words that carry significant meaning. Tokens may contain stop words like "the", "and" etc., which are removed during tokenization process to reduce noise in the text. After tokenization, each token becomes a separate entity in the sequence that represents the entire text.

### Feature Extraction

We extract features from the tokenized text using pre-trained GloVe word embedding vectors. Word embeddings encode both the semantics and syntax of each token in the text. The idea behind word embeddings is to map words to a low-dimensional continuous vector space that captures semantic meanings. We train the GloVe model on a large corpus of texts and obtain a matrix containing word embeddings for all possible words in the vocabulary. We then use these word embeddings as features for our classifier layer.

For feature extraction, we create a feature vector for each token by multiplying its GloVe vector with the weight parameter of the target class. The weight parameters are learned during training and are dependent on the distribution of instances belonging to each class. Once we have created the feature vectors for each token, we concatenate them together to form a final feature vector for the text instance.

### Classification Layer

We implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for sentiment analysis. CNN's primary advantage is their ability to learn non-linear relationships between tokens in a text and produce highly informative feature maps. CNN's other key advantages include the ability to handle varying length sequences and the capacity to generate abstract representations of the input data.

A typical CNN architecture includes several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, fully connected layers etc. In our implementation, we follow the standard CNN architecture described below:

1. **Convolution Layer:** A series of filters applied to the input image. Filters slide across the image and compute convolutional activations at each position. 

2. **Pooling Layer:** Pooling operations take the maximum value inside a receptive field and shrink the dimensions of the activation volume down by factoring by a constant factor. This reduces the number of parameters and computation required later in the network.

3. **Dropout Layer:** Dropout layers randomly drop out some neurons during training to prevent overfitting. During testing, no neuron is dropped and full activation occurs.

4. **Fully Connected Layers:** Finally, the last few fully connected layers are used to connect to the output classes.

To train the CNN, we use backpropagation to update weights based on error computed during forward propagation. Loss function used here is binary cross entropy loss since we are dealing with two-class classification problem. Hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, momentum, regularization term etc. are tuned experimentally using grid search and hyperparameter optimization techniques.

## Dataset

For training our CNN model, we use a pre-annotated dataset consisting of Twitter posts labeled as either positive, negative or neutral sentiment towards a variety of political parties and regions. The dataset contains 10,000+ tweets annotated with polarities for 9 different political parties and geographical regions. Each post is represented by a sequence of tokens obtained after tokenization. We divide the dataset into training and test sets.

We preprocess the text data by removing special characters, numbers, punctuations, HTML tags, URLs, and extra white spaces. All remaining tokens that are less than or equal to 3 characters long are discarded. The resulting cleaned text is passed through the tokenizer to obtain the list of tokens.

## Evaluation Metrics

For evaluating the performance of our proposed model, we use standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among the total predicted positives. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among the actual positives present in the dataset. Overall, higher values of precision and recall lead to higher values of accuracy. Similarly, F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric. The formula for F1 score is given by:

    F1 = 2 * ((precision * recall)/(precision + recall))
    
# Limitations and Challenges

There are several known limitations and challenges related to sentiment analysis of social media text data. Some of these include:

1. Biases: Natural language processing algorithms can exhibit biases due to the limited availability of data and human annotators. One such bias arises when datasets and annotations used for training models were collected using demographics or cultural biases that favor certain political views or personal experiences.

2. Corpus Size: The amount of available social media data is quite limited compared to traditional corpora used for NLP tasks. In order to achieve meaningful results, large scale datasets must be used to train machine learning models. However, collecting and annotating such large volumes of data requires considerable amounts of resources and expertise in data collection, annotation and curation.

3. Heterogeneous Languages: Different languages can exhibit different sentiment expressions and dialects that affect the underlying linguistic structure and syntax of the text. Therefore, methods that rely on global statistical distributions of word frequencies and co-occurrence patterns may not perform well on heterogeneous language data.

4. Noisy Input Data: Machine learning models require clean and consistent input data without irrelevant or irrelevate content. Often times, input text data contains spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, unusual usage or idiomatic expression, which may cause confusion to the machine learning models leading to poor performance.

5. Lack of Context: Most existing sentiment analysis frameworks do not capture the nuances and subtle differences in sentiment expression across contexts or conversations. Therefore, they may miss valuable insights that cannot be inferred solely from the words used in a text alone.
