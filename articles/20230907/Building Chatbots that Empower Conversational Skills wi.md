# 1.简介
  

Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) have emerged as a natural language interface for machines to interact with users in recent years. This is accompanied by the rise of chatbots that help users to navigate through complex tasks by providing a conversation-like experience. However, building chatbot applications requires advanced machine learning skills such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Dialogue Management Systems (DMs), Machine Learning (ML), and AI/ML architectures.

In this article we will explore how to build chatbots using TensorFlow Lite and Cloud Functions on Google Cloud platform. We'll see what are the steps involved in building conversational chatbot, along with practical examples and explanations. The article also discusses the benefits of developing chatbots and provides suggestions for future research and development efforts in CUI. 

# 2.基本概念术语说明
## 2.1 TensorFlow Lite
TensorFlow Lite is an open source deep learning framework created by Google. It enables fast inference and deployment of ML models on mobile devices. In simple words, it simplifies and optimizes machine learning models so they can be deployed on small and resource-constrained devices like smartphones or IoT devices. Its efficient nature makes it ideal for running real-time chatbots.

## 2.2 Tensorflow JS
TensorFlow.js brings machine learning to JavaScript, enabling developers to train and run neural networks in their web browsers. Developers can use pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub or convert their own trained models to the browser format. They can also perform training locally within their web browsers without needing access to cloud resources.

## 2.3 Keras 
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed to make coding deep neural networks simpler. Keras is compatible with TensorFlow backend and can run seamlessly on both CPUs and GPUs.

## 2.4 GCP Cloud Functions
Cloud Functions is a serverless compute service provided by Google Cloud Platform that allows you to write lightweight functions executed in response to events triggered by other services. You can create Node.js, Python, Go or Ruby functions and configure them to run automatically based on your specific needs. These functions can access other cloud services directly via RESTful APIs or connect to external data sources using connectors.

## 2.5 Dialogflow CX
Dialogflow CX is a new feature of Dialogflow that helps you design and manage conversational experiences across channels, platforms, and devices. With CX, you can define different user interactions, integrate them into flows, and monitor performance metrics right from the Dialogflow console.

# 3.核心算法原理和具体操作步骤以及数学公式讲解
Building chatbots involves several steps:

1. Data Collection - Collecting labeled dataset for training and testing purposes.
2. Preprocessing - Cleaning, tokenizing, stemming and lemmatization of textual data. 
3. Feature Extraction - Extracting relevant features from the raw text data. 
4. Model Training - Training the machine learning model on the extracted features and labels obtained from step 2. 
5. Model Testing - Evaluating the accuracy and precision of the trained model using test datasets.
6. Deployment - Deploying the trained model on cloud platforms like TensorFlow Lite or deploying cloud functions to provide conversation capabilities over public internet.  

To implement these steps let's take an example of sentiment analysis chatbot. 

Sentiment Analysis refers to the use of natural language processing techniques to identify and extract subjective information in a text document, typically to determine whether the sentiment towards a particular topic has a positive or negative tone. Sentiment analysis uses various algorithms like lexicon-based methods, rule-based approaches, and machine learning algorithms. We can classify the sentiment of a sentence as Positive, Negative or Neutral. 

We will follow below steps while implementing the chatbot:

Step 1: Define a scenario which defines the purpose of the chatbot.
For our example, we want to develop a sentiment analysis chatbot where users can enter any query related to movie reviews and get feedback about its positivity or negativity. 

Step 2: Plan the architecture of the chatbot system.
The overall flowchart of our chatbot would look something like this:


Our chatbot consists of three components:

- Text Input component: This component takes input from the user in the form of movie review queries.
- NLP module: This module performs natural language processing operations on the input text.
- Prediction Module: This module predicts the polarity of the movie review query i.e., Positive, Negative or Neutral using the previously trained model.

Step 3: Prepare the dataset.
Dataset should contain a list of movie reviews along with their corresponding polarity label (Positive, Negative or Neutral). We need to collect this dataset manually or generate it using publicly available datasets.

Once we obtain the dataset, we need to preprocess the text data by removing stopwords, punctuations, special characters, etc. and then tokenize the remaining text into smaller units called tokens. After preprocessing, we can create n-grams of tokens and find the frequency distribution of each ngram present in the corpus.

Next, we can represent each token as a vector of word embeddings, either learned from scratch or using pre-trained embedding models. Word Embeddings capture semantic relationships between words. So now, we have transformed our text data into numerical vectors.

Now, we move onto the next step i.e., Model Training. Here, we train a machine learning algorithm on the dataset consisting of n-grams of tokens and corresponding polarity labels. Two common machine learning algorithms used for sentiment analysis are Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). But first, we need to split the dataset into training set and testing set. Training set contains a subset of all the data while the testing set represents the rest of the data after training.

After splitting the dataset, we fit the chosen algorithm on the training set and evaluate its accuracy on the testing set. Finally, we deploy the model on cloud platforms like TensorFlow Lite or deploy cloud functions to provide the conversation capabilities over the public internet.
