# 1.简介
  

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used for modeling the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In this article, we will learn how to perform linear regression using Python's scikit-learn library by implementing it from scratch. We'll also discuss the key concepts such as bias and variance and understand the limitations of linear regression. At the end of this article, you will be able to apply linear regression algorithms on your own dataset without any hassle. 

In summary, we will go through the following steps:

1. Importing libraries and loading data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - checking for outliers, missing values, correlation matrix, etc.
3. Preprocessing - handling categorical features, normalization, feature scaling, etc.
4. Model Building - training the model using the preprocessed data, calculating coefficients, intercepts, R^2 score, and other metrics.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning - adjusting parameters to improve performance of our model.
6. Evaluation Metrics - understanding different evaluation metrics and selecting the best model based on them.
7. Predicting new data points - predicting future outcomes based on trained model. 

By completing these steps, we will have implemented a basic version of linear regression algorithm in Python. Hopefully, after reading this article, you can start applying this approach on your own datasets and gain insights into complex relationships hidden within your data!

# 2.背景介绍
## What Is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that allows us to estimate the relationship between a set of input variables x and a continuous output variable y. The goal is to find a line that best fits the given data points while minimizing the errors. Linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable, meaning that a change in the value of one variable directly affects the value of the output variable proportionally. 

For example, if we want to relate temperature to the amount of rainfall in an area, linear regression would allow us to create a curve that shows the relationship between temperature and rainfall. If the increase in temperature causes an increase in rainfall more than expected according to the slope of the curve, then we can use linear regression to make predictions about the behavior of the system under study.<|im_sep|>

## Why Use Linear Regression?
Linear regression has many applications in various fields including finance, healthcare, social sciences, engineering, and economics. Here are some reasons why linear regression is useful in different contexts:<|im_sep|>

1. Simple and Easy to Understand
	Linear regression can be understood easily even for non-technical people due to its visual representation. It plots data points on a scatter plot along with the line of best fit which gives insight into the trend or relationship between the variables being studied. This makes it easy for anyone who wants to analyze their data visually rather than relying on mathematical equations. 

2. Easily Interpretable Predictions
	The formula for the line of best fit of linear regression can be derived quite easily once the appropriate equation is known. Therefore, it's not necessary for experts to spend long periods of time memorizing formulas. Instead, they can quickly and accurately interpret what the line represents when presented with new data. 

3. Ability to Handle Nonlinear Relationships
	Unlike decision trees, linear regression models do not require careful consideration of all possible branches of the tree. Because they rely on simple straight lines, they can handle nonlinear relationships well because they minimize the sum of squared errors instead of trying to split the data into smaller subsets. 

4. Relatively Accurate Predictions
	Because linear regression involves fitting a line to a set of points, it provides relatively accurate predictions compared to other types of regression analysis techniques. However, it does have its drawbacks like overfitting, i.e., it may produce poor results on test data with high variance. 

5. Flexible and Adaptable to New Data Sets
	Linear regression is highly adaptable to new data sets as it doesn't rely on assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. As a result, it can adapt to changes in the data more readily. Additionally, it can accommodate both numerical and categorical variables, making it suitable for a wide range of problems in a variety of domains. 

Now let's dive deeper into the details of linear regression with Python implementation.
