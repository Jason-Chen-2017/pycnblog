# 1.简介
  

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become one of the most popular deep learning models in image recognition and computer vision due to their ability to capture complex spatial relationships between features. CNNs can classify high-dimensional patterns by using filters that apply convolution operation on input images. This article will review fundamental concepts behind CNNs, explain key algorithms used, and provide detailed step-by-step instructions with code examples for building a model from scratch using TensorFlow library. The goal is to give readers an intuitive understanding of how CNNs work so they can use them effectively for practical applications in image processing tasks such as object detection and segmentation. We hope this article would serve as an excellent resource for beginners and experts alike to gain deeper insight into how these powerful models operate.

## 2.1 神经网络
A neural network is a set of connected nodes called artificial neurons or units. Each unit receives inputs from other units and processes its signals through weights and activation functions. Neural networks are designed to mimic the behavior of human brains by considering context and prior knowledge about the problem at hand. There are two types of neural networks: feedforward neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Feedforward networks process data sequentially, while recurrent networks store information from previous steps and learn new associations over time. In general, we focus on feedforward neural networks because they perform well on tasks where there is a clear input/output mapping. 

In addition to vanilla neural networks, which are simple networks made up of fully connected layers, several variants exist that incorporate different architectural choices such as skip connections, residual connections, attention mechanisms, etc. These design choices enable the network to learn more complex representations of the input data, leading to improved performance across various domains.

## 2.2 激活函数
Activation function refers to a non-linear function applied to the output of each node during forward propagation to introduce non-linearity into the system. Commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), LeakyReLU, ELU (Exponential Linear Units), SELU (Scaled Exponential Linear Units). Different activation functions lead to different behaviors and performance characteristics for different problems. For example, the choice of activation function often determines whether a network will be prone to vanishing gradients or not, and it may also impact the speed and stability of training.

## 2.3 卷积层
The core idea behind a convolutional layer is to extract features from input images by applying a kernel on top of the input. A kernel is a small matrix of values that convolves over the input image, resulting in a feature map that represents a particular aspect of the input. Commonly used kernels include edge detectors, sharpening filters, and blurring filters. The size and shape of the kernel determine what aspects of the input image the filter should pay attention to, and hence what features it captures. During backpropagation, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the convolutional layer can be calculated efficiently thanks to the chain rule.

## 2.4 池化层
Pooling layer is typically added after some convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and thus improve computational efficiency. Pooling operations involve reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps but retaining important features within those regions. Popular pooling methods include max pooling, average pooling, and global averaging pooling. Max pooling selects the maximum value in a local region of the feature map, while average pooling calculates the mean value of all pixels in the same region. Global averaging pooling computes the mean value of the entire feature map, which preserves global dependencies between pixel locations. 

## 2.5 全连接层（Dense Layer）
Fully connected layers are similar to ordinary linear regression models; they take in flattened feature vectors and produce output predictions based solely on learned weights associated with each input neuron. They can be thought of as a multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer, whose outputs are combined via element-wise multiplication followed by a non-linear activation function. 

## 2.6 Dropout层
Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out (i.e., sets to zero) some percentage of the incoming neurons during training. It helps prevent overfitting by encouraging the network to learn robust representations of the input data without being too dependent on any single neuron. Dropout layers are commonly placed immediately before the output layer of a neural network to avoid co-adaptation of neurons with different functional roles.
